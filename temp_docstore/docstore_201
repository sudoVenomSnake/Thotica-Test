Affected systems at all scales \u2013 countries, communities, households and individuals \u2013 need to define their responses to shocks and mobilize resources towards specific actions. These responses may reflect core principles of strengthening resilience, such as: maintain diversity and redundancy;9 manage connectivity; manage \u2018slow variables\u2019 (e.g. ageing)10 and feedbacks; foster com- plex adaptive systems thinking; encourage learning; broad- en participation; and promote polycentric governance sys- tems.11 The actions needed to strengthen the resilience of human systems can be understood in terms of resilience capacities,12 which include the following. 1. Anticipatory capacity: the ability of human systems to anticipate and reduce the impact of shocks through preparedness and planning. This can be seen in the proactive actions taken before an event, either to avoid or reduce exposure to a certain risk, or to minimise vulnerability to specific events. 2. Absorptive capacity: the ability of human systems to absorb and cope with the impacts of shocks and stresses. Absorptive capacity draws mainly on the available resources within human systems to recover from adverse conditions. Absorption refers to a system\u2019s ability to cope with shocks that have not been anticipated, and therefore have not been preceded by adaptive or transformative efforts, or to the residual exposure that has not been mitigated by these efforts. 3. Adaptive capacity: the ability of human systems to change in response to multiple, long-term and future risks, and to learn and adjust after a shock materializes. It describes the capability to take deliberate and planned decisions, even when conditions have changed or are about to change, to achieve a desired state. 4. Transformative capacity: the ability to take deliberate steps to change systems that create risks, vulnerability and/or inequality. Transformative capacities support people to invest and innovate, and can help societies to break away from the status quo, and shape their ability to identify opportunities for transformation. These four capacities are not independent; they overlap and complement each other, forming a continuum (see Figure 1.1) that promotes different levels of change, ranging from persistence through incremental adjustments to transformational changes.13 The response of the Asia-Pacific region to the 1997 financial crisis illustrates the mutually supporting measures that can be put in place to build these resilience capacities. The 1997 crisis exposed the risks inherent in fast-globalizing economies and the vulnerabilities of the financial system. Macro-prudential policies and other tools were deployed, financial regulations overhauled, and regulatory oversight of financial institutions was strengthened. Efforts were made to address systemic factors that encouraged risk- taking, and anticipatory capacity was enhanced through the establishment of early warning systems and institutions at the national and regional levels. Taken together, these actions strengthened resilience to the shocks accompanying a context of increased cross-border capital flows, greater integration with the rest of the world, more volatile external conditions and higher risk premiums.14 Human systems that have these fundamental resilience capacities are less likely to be undermined by shocks and stresses.15 Countries need to invest in analysis of emerging risks and their potential impacts on critical human systems Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 4 and, on this basis, determine the extent to which they need to strengthen their resilience capacities. There may also be trade-offs among the four capacities identified, such as between adaptation and transformation. Adaptive capacity focuses on altering current systems to make them less vulnerable to risks and disruptions, while transformative capacity aims to strengthen ability to create new arrangements. One good example is in the energy sector, where there is a need to transition from centralized, inefficient, fossil fuel- based systems to distributed, more efficient, renewable energy-based systems. Such a transition would allow countries in the Asia-Pacific region to achieve the SDGs on access to clean energy for all, to act on climate change and promote more sustainable consumption, while also increasing the resilience of the overall energy-provision system. It could, however, entail higher upfront capital costs in some cases, investments in capacity to manage new technologies and approaches, and measures to manage a fair transition for those who rely on conventional sources of energy for their livelihoods. Box 1.1 describes this interaction between resilience and transformation in the context of the 2030 Agenda. 1.3 Building the resilience of human systems: An approach to support policy development Operationalizing the concept of resilience can be challeng- ing across different areas and sectors, and for policymakers.

Initially, country A was on course to attain its SDG targets by 2030, while country B was following a pathway on which the SDGs were unachievable by 2030. Both countries experienced shocks in year \u2018 t1\u2019 and their differing resilience capacities meant they responded differently to this shock. Country A bounced back to its original development trajectory, meaning the SDGs were still attainable by 2030. Country B, on the other hand, utilized its transformative capacity to undertake systemic changes, moving to a new development trajectory that meant the SDGs were now attainable by 2030. Hence, systemic transformations in response to shocks can bring countries closer to realizing their SDG targets. Such transformations include a fundamental shift to renewable energy sources; societal reorganization that leads to greater female participation in decision-making; and economic structural transformation away from an extractive industry-based economy to one that is driven by services and higher value-added industries.

Resilience thinking, informed by an assessment of risk, understanding of potential impacts, and risk-informed response efforts, can support better policymaking. The following chapters explore each stage of this approach. Chapter 2 explores steps 1 and 2, taking stock of emerging sources of risk in the Asia-Pacific region and assessing the impacts of various types of recurrent shocks on its human systems, with a focus on the most vulnerable groups in society. Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 6 Step 1. What are the drivers of risk to regional food systems? Food systems, especially in the low-income countries in the Asia-Pacific region, are increasingly vulnerable to climate change, as well as to demographic change-induced risks. For example, climate change is expected to reduce yields and increase the cost of staple foods.17 Figure 1.3 plots the vulnerability of food systems in Asia-Pacific countries to climate change, alongside gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. This shows that the countries that are least prepared to face economic risks also have food systems that are most vulnerable to climate change.18 Source: ESCAP calculation, using data from the University of Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index Dataset (2016), https://gain.nd.edu/our- work/country-index. See http://data.unescap.org/escap_stat/#methodDefinition for the full list of ESCAP income groupings Step 2. How do these drivers impact the food system and who are most vulnerable? Trade systems are integral to regional food systems.

The combination of increasing vulnerability and reduced resilience within food systems points to an increasing risk of food supply disruptions, including through food price fluctuations. It highlights important potential trade-offs between policy measures that increase economic efficiency and those that safeguard resilience. This has important implications for the region. For example, the food price shocks of 2007\u20132008 increased the depth of poverty in rural areas and led to higher rates of malnutrition.24 A repeat of this could undermine the ability of the region to meet several targets of the 2030 Agenda. For example, climate change and resulting food shortages have the potential to increase the number of malnourished children in South Asia by 7 million.25 These vulnerable groups and communities should be identified early on, and it is vital that they are placed at the core of society\u2019s efforts to strengthen resilience, in order to achieve the central aspiration of the 2030 Agenda \u2013 to leave no one behind. Step 3. How can we strengthen resilience capacities to address emerging risks? This analysis can inform the policy responses required to build the resilience capacities of food systems in the region. Analysis of the resilience characteristics of networks can help to identify potential policy solutions by revealing the system- level network configurations that affect resilience to potential shocks and disturbances. z Anticipatory capacity: the region needs to closely monitor the emerging effects of climate change on its key food production areas. It is important to convey early on any climate anomalies, including variations in weather patterns, that can undermine the production potential of the main agricultural areas of the region. More research is needed to simulate and quantify the impacts of shocks on critical commodity networks. z Absorptive capacity: community- or national-level food stocks can be created to tide over any unexpected food shortages. z Adaptive capacity: plans related to national agriculture (including cropping patterns and the mix of inputs) and food security, as well as climate change strategies, need to reflect these potential impacts, particularly in the food production areas that are most vulnerable to climate change. z Transformative capacity: one important lesson from the earlier analyses is that the trade networks that support the provision of food in the region are showing signs of weakening resilience. Countries need to deliberate jointly on how to integrate strategic provisions within trade agreements, especially preferential trade agreements, to increase the resilience of trade networks for critical commodities.

For example, economic and financial volatility have been drivers of the global economic system since the 1980s. This underlying volatility has led to shocks, in the form of economic crises in Asia in 1997 and globally in 2008. There are many other shocks and stresses affecting the region, including political and security-related risks that have had severe effects in many countries. The shocks analysed in this report illustrate the diverse range of challenges to which the Asia-Pacific region must build its resilience. Strengthened governance and efforts to build peace in the context of SDG 16 play a vital role in strengthening resilience in the region. Furthermore, risks can play out at various levels: they can affect individuals, businesses, households and communities, all the way up to nation states and regional communities. Countries have varying abilities to cope with such shocks, to adapt to future crises, or to transform their institutions to reduce their vulnerability. While societies also face risks from other sources, the ability of these trends to escalate risk is the focus of this report, due to their universal nature and potential scale. This chapter examines the first two steps of the analytical framework introduced in Chapter 1. It explores some emerging sources of risks in the region, quantifies their impacts on critical human systems and identifies some of the groups in societies that will be disproportionately affected. 2.2 What are the sources of risk affecting human systems? The interaction of various trends and the risks created for human systems were considered during a series of subregional consultations, held to prepare for the Asia-Pacific region\u2019s dialogue on the theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. During the consultations, stakeholders discussed how to anticipate and deal with these risks. Table 2.1 summarizes these insights. The consultations highlighted that while the most resonant trends and the exact nature of risks identified differed across subregions, there were several commonalities. This suggests that there is great scope for mutual learning within the region, which will further promote resilience. Stakeholders also highlighted the interlinked and reinforcing nature of the risks posed by various trends on these critical human systems. Figure 2.1 highlights these links, drawing on a risk assessment conducted by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 2018.26 This was conducted through the annual Global Risks Perception Survey, with respondents drawn from the global multi-stakeholder community. Survey respondents were asked to identify three to six pairs of global risks that they believed to be the most interconnected. The analysis of this highlights the variety of emerging risks that face the world, and their interlinked and reinforcing nature.27 2.3 Which groups are most at risk of being left behind? While the trends identified in this chapter and their associated risks are likely to affect all people and systems in some way, the degree of impact will differ across regions and across layers of society. Some groups or communities are disproportionately exposed to risks and are more vulnerable to the changing risk profile of the Asia-Pacific region. It is vital, therefore, to identify vulnerable groups and make special efforts to strengthen their resilience. Table 2.2 provides some examples of at-risk groups identified during the subregional consultations. The people who are most exposed to complex risks are often found in the intersections of these groups. For example, an elderly, unskilled urban migrant is highly unlikely to be able to respond adequately to the confluence of challenges posed by climate change, pollution and technological changes. Identifying those at risk helps policymakers and other stakeholders to adopt targeted response measures. As an example, Japan has taken proactive steps to respond to the needs of its ageing society (see Box 2.1). Yet while there are many encouraging signs across the region, there is a need to continue to invest in transformative capacities to deal with the scale of the challenges presented across human systems. 11 Table 2.1 Subregional perspectives on the risks that critical human systems face from selected drivers of change Subregion East and North-East Asia Trend Demographic change Human systems affected Social, financial Risks Stakeholders highlighted the impacts of demographic changes, especially ageing. This is placing an increasing strain on the subregion\u2019s social systems (e.g. health care, social security) as many societies lack sufficient resources to care and provide for the elderly. Rapid ageing is also putting the financial system at risk, as the viability of pension systems is increasingly being undermined as the ratio of pensioners to working-age people declines rapidly.

The threat posed by mounting plastic waste, and recurrent episodes of cross-border haze from forest fires, were both raised by stakeholders.

Increasing haze and pollution also affect the economic system, causing economic damage and reducing economic productivity.

These risks could become more severe, given the existing tensions over sharing water resources between countries and the high likelihood of cross-border mass migration caused by climate change. Subregion Pacific Trend Globalization and economic liberalization Human systems affected Social, economic, cultural Risks Increasing globalization, including trade liberalisation, has led to an increased availability of cheaper, unhealthy food in the Pacific islands, resulting in changes to dietary patterns. These changes have led to an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases in the region.28 This has increased the pressure on the health system, affected the economic system (due to reduced human productivity and household financial stability) and reduced the overall well-being of the population. Increased cross- cultural flows, which are promoted by globalization, are also threatening the region\u2019s unique culture and identity.

This section explores the second step of the approach described in Chapter 1 \u2013 mapping out the critical systems in society that these risks will affect, and establishing who will be most vulnerable to the potential impacts of these risks \u2013 by looking more closely at three recurrent shocks to human settlements and economic and environmental systems. Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 12 Figure 2.1 Risk interconnection map Source: WEF, 2018 First, given the emphasis on resilience to disasters in the SDGs, it reviews the impacts of flooding, with a focus on South and South-West Asia.29 Second, it considers the effects of commodity shocks, with a focus on recent oil price fluctuations in Central Asia. Third, it considers the effects of pollution, with a focus on recurrent air pollution and haze caused by forest fires in South-East Asia. All three of these shocks can disrupt and even reverse progress towards the SDGs. While they cannot be fully eliminated, evidence suggests there is scope to substantially reduce and mitigate their effects by building up societies\u2019 resilience capacities. These issues are of relevance to all subregions of the Asia-Pacific region, although the specific vulnerabilities and resilience strategies vary. 13 Table 2.2 Groups identified as being extremely vulnerable to risk Vulnerable group Risks facing this group Elderly people As the proportion of elderly people in societies increases, social security and health systems become stressed and could become unable to meet this group\u2019s needs adequately. The migration of the working-age population to urban areas reduces the support system available for the elderly, especially in rural areas, while changing societal values further reduce the level of care available. These factors make elderly people vulnerable to many emerging risks. Indigenous populations Increasing demands for natural resources are leading to an increased risk of indigenous communities being displaced from their ancestral lands, their culture threatened, or their lands being polluted. Urban migrants Urban migrants, especially those working in the informal sector, are more exposed to the impacts of climate change, as their homes \u2013 often informal settlements \u2013 tend to be in areas more vulnerable to climate change.

The interplay of disability and ageing complicates the situation further. Working-age women In many countries, social norms expect women to be the caregivers in households. With many populations ageing, working-age women are likely to have to bear additional responsibilities by taking care of the elderly. This reduces their time to engage in formal employment. Unskilled youth Young people in many countries are finding it extremely difficult to find gainful employment that matches their aspirations and enables them to contribute meaningfully to society. Source: Subregional consultations Understanding risk: What are the sources of emerging risk in the Asia-Pacific region, and what are their impacts? Flooding While the effects of climate change will be felt globally, the Asia-Pacific region will be especially affected, particularly by hydro-meteorological hazards. One of most pervasive recurrent shocks affecting the region in recent years has been flooding. South Asia in particular has suffered greatly: between 1970 and 2016, some 35 per cent of floods in the region occurred here, with devastating effects on people across this subregion. There were considerable financial losses in the subregion, as Figure 2.2 shows, but also major losses of life and impacts on people\u2019s well-being.30 As Figure 2.3 shows, the monsoon rains in 2017 claimed an estimated 1,200 lives in South Asia, and affected 40 million people across Bangladesh, India and Nepal.31 The resulting floods damaged and destroyed homes, schools and health facilities, while many areas became inaccessible due to damage to hundreds of kilometres of roads and railways, as well as bridges and airports.32 The floods also brought several major cities to a standstill (see Box 2.2). The total costs of the 2017 monsoon season in South Asia were estimated to be around $1.2 billion.33 Planning for a future with a higher risk of extreme events Flooding events in parts of the Asia-Pacific region are likely to increase in the future. Models and scenarios predict a rise in heavy and extreme precipitation events during annual monsoons, which fall from June to September, in East and South Asia. This will exacerbate economic impacts \u2013 by some estimates, floods could cost the subregion as much as $215 billion each year by 203034 \u2013 as well as human impacts. Extreme events such as more intense flooding and more severe droughts will be compounded by risk factors associated with rapid urbanization and coastal development, which increase exposure and vulnerability to these hazards.35 Women are often disproportionately affected by such events, including in their aftermath. The relationships between the various factors that are likely to influence resilience, and the severity of flood and storm impacts (in terms of mortality rates, economic damage and affected populations, among other indicators) were explored for this report. This analysis revealed several policy-relevant insights.

Japan\u2019s demographic dividend started in the early 1930s, with the birth of the first \u2018baby-boomer\u2019 generation. This generation reached working age between 1960 and 1965, and contributed to social security systems through compulsory or taxed- based payments. Despite the economic slowdown in the 1980s, Japan\u2019s social security systems continued to be relatively successful, relying on its strong financial, social and human capital base. By the late 1980s, however, Japan had one of the world\u2019s highest life expectancies and an ageing demographic. Concerns grew over the fiscal sustainability of the social security system, due in part to the breakdown of the tradition of informal caregiving by family members. By 2030, the second baby-boomers will be elderly \u2013 one in three people will be over 65, while one in five will be over 75 \u2013 which, combined with the already declining fertility, will lead to an ageing society.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a538e812-5ad0-4f09-928a-503608f1ea7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a538e812-5ad0-4f09-928a-503608f1ea7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6385d1b1cbbdcc33cd8dc0478b00e64465dcd0d80ed056a273b706d17ef969be"}, "2": {"node_id": "56c74a15-9771-4853-b44a-ecfc265f533c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c04a1e9f939b3bc95304a29587c1d99a5270fa14fc250c25cd480e64c6b97f0"}}, "hash": "37d0b7648bc6d76861d060f954b6dfbb7f31d5fcbbedb2e76a21cb6424954098", "text": "In anticipation of this, in 1989 the government prepared a 10-year strategic plan for the development of health and welfare services for the elderly; this was revised in 1994 and 1999.

There has been an increase in crimes committed by elderly persons living in poverty, while families\u2019 resources have become increasingly stretched as they support elderly members. Given the increased participation of women in the workforce (among other factors), families were finding their responsibility to care for the elderly more difficult, with reports of neglect becoming more commonplace. Furthermore, Japanese society began to experience a phenomenon known as \u2018social hospitalization\u2019, where elderly persons were being admitted to hospitals not for medical reasons, but because they could not be looked after elsewhere. As the need to provide care for the elderly continued to grow, the challenges of ageing became a focus of national dialogue and policymaking. Through this, social security systems became more open to innovation and experimentation. Public policy innovations included: efforts to address the stigma associated with traditional family roles in the provision of social care; the introduction of both premium and tax-based long-term care insurance systems (in 2000); the introduction of schemes to attract skilled migrants (in 2012); and investments in outreach and community-based support systems. In 2017, reforms were made to the pension system to bolster its financial security. Other options still under debate include more pro-natalist policies, the introduction of robotics and automation to supplant the labour shortage, and a rethinking of migration policies. Together, these approaches may ensure that the social security needs of all generations can be met for the foreseeable future. At the same time, a close watch may be needed on whether more transformative approaches will eventually be required. What is certain, however, is that Japan is at the forefront of nations in terms of building resilience in an ageing society, and offers valuable lessons for other countries regarding how effective public policy can address these challenges.

Sources: OCHA, 2017; Save the Children, 2017; UNICEF, 2017 Access to high-quality infrastructure is closely linked to the lower impacts from flooding events. Infrastructure can help build the absorptive and adaptive capacities of flood-affected communities. To do so effectively, infrastructure must be planned, designed, constructed and maintained with due consideration of current and future hazards, taking a systems approach. For example, access to electricity is negatively correlated with flood mortality rates, while the percentage of paved roads is negatively correlated with the number of people affected by floods and storms. These links are well recognized in wider studies on global risk.36 Secondary and cascading effects from infrastructure failures often occur: for example, in the aftermath of cyclone Aila in India, access to safe drinking water was substantially reduced. Inadequate infrastructure can also limit access routes for disaster response efforts and evacuations.37 Given the rapid rates of urbanization in the Asia-Pacific region, investment decisions that increase the resilience of urban infrastructure can have significant effects. There is a need to focus on the most vulnerable people within urban areas affected by flooding. Our analysis shows that higher mortality rates in flooding events are positively correlated with the percentage of the urban population living in slums. This highlights the imperative to find more inclusive approaches to urban development, ensuring access to finance, livelihoods and decision-making within cities. Access to infrastructure services tends to be lowest in the poorest countries in the region, and for the poorest people within countries. For example, road coverage is likely to be provided for economic centres and richer neighbourhoods first. This reinforces the critical need to invest in more resilient infrastructure services for everyone across the Asia- Pacific region, and to strengthen the resilience of existing critical infrastructure, in order to reduce the losses currently caused by flooding. To achieve this, governments and associated stakeholders need to identify the critical infrastructure in their country, Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77d376e7-d777-4f53-9d32-47607fc7add8": {"__data__": {"id_": "77d376e7-d777-4f53-9d32-47607fc7add8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e0230e47af817ddfdda3bbf4d867b69d230202c0e448d700cab3e45a84611e6"}}, "hash": "9e0230e47af817ddfdda3bbf4d867b69d230202c0e448d700cab3e45a84611e6", "text": "in Asia and the Pacific 16 assess its vulnerabilities, and take measures to increase its resilience. Proposed infrastructure investments need to be informed by spatial analyses of disaster and climate risks that provide information on location-specific exposure and vulnerabilities, as well as the proposed infrastructure\u2019s integration with existing infrastructure and overall urban or rural development. A greater focus on green solutions is needed, recognizing that ecosystems often provide vital services for local resilience. The analysis also suggests that deaths from floods are negatively correlated with higher literacy rates. A wide body of literature highlights the importance of education in strengthening human capacity when facing natural hazards or climate-related risks, and the positive effects of formal education on reducing vulnerabilities.38 Education can help to build anticipatory, adaptive and transformative capacities. It can also directly reduce vulnerability by improving people\u2019s cognitive and problem-solving skills, and increasing their knowledge and perception of risk. Indirect effects from education are linked to improved development outcomes, such as poverty reduction, better access to information and greater social capital. Information is an important factor generally in increasing resilience. There is a broad consensus on the need to build anticipatory capacity by investing in systems to provide better information at multiple levels. Improved hydro- meteorological systems and early warning systems for extreme events have been a focus, and many countries in the Asia-Pacific region have made significant investments in such capacities, which are slowly beginning to yield results. These are likely to be aided in the future by technological innovations, such as mobile phone technologies that can monitor and disseminate information about natural hazards, and \u2018big data\u2019 and geospatial technology to support efforts to prepare for and adapt to possible shocks. Information is of course necessary, but insufficient on its own. It needs to be combined with an ability to access relevant information, interpret it and use it to make decisions. Here, the needs of vulnerable groups, particularly women, need particular attention, as do cultural considerations that may affect how people act on the information that they may be provided with. These findings highlight the inextricable links between sustainable development and efforts to manage disaster risk and improve resilience. Natural hazards have a debilitating effect on efforts to achieve the SDGs, washing away hard-earned investments in basic services and infrastructure. However, effective investments in these services can strengthen resilience to major natural hazard events. The effects of the August 2017 floods on Mumbai, India\u2019s richest city, highlighted the devastation that natural hazards can cause. The city received more than 300 millimetres of rainfall in 12 hours on 29 August, the heaviest rainfall since 26 July 2005, when 944 millimetres fell. This caused widespread impacts on Mumbai\u2019s people, transport systems and other infrastructure. The damage caused by flooding also took a significant toll in financial terms, with economic losses estimated to be more than $500 million. Mumbai was not completely unprepared for this event. In 2009, India adopted national guidelines on urban flood management, which were informed by the findings of a committee set up after the 2005 floods. Although the implementation of these guidelines was slow, there were some improvements to Mumbai\u2019s capacity to cope. For example, new pumping stations were installed, albeit on a delayed timeline. However, these measures were insufficient to alleviate the impacts of the 2017 floods, and citizens had to find new ways to cope. Social networks and civil society organizations (e.g. religious groups) across the city were instrumental in this. For example, people used social media to offer support to those in need and created groups to help people access shelter and clothing. This support did not, however, reach the poorest people, such as slum dwellers and homeless people. The need to take comprehensive measures to strengthen Mumbai\u2019s preparedness for, and resilience to, future flooding events remains paramount. Stakeholders have stressed the need to look beyond engineering solutions \u2013 although these will have a vital role to play \u2013 and pursue urban planning that allows for a greater role for green spaces and nature-based solutions. For example, policymakers must address the loss of protective mangroves, coastal wetlands and flood plains, which has reduced the region\u2019s natural ability to deal with floods by absorbing and storing water during heavy rainfall events.

Research suggests that increased integration and dependence on exports over the past decade may have intensified vulnerability to external shocks in the region,39 as commodity dependence can place fiscal and monetary stress on countries, cause economic disruptions, and put pressures on balances of payments.40 Commodity price-related shocks can also have direct impacts on poor people. The effects of food price rises can be especially hard for producers and for poor consumers for whom food constitutes a significant share of their expenditure. For example, unprecedented food price spikes in 2007\u20132008 saw world cereal prices rise by as much as 87 per cent as global food stocks plummeted. Estimates suggest that these effects, coupled with the global economic recession, pushed 100 million more people into hunger.41 Fuel price fluctuations can also affect the costs of the goods and services on which poor people depend, for example by increasing the costs of food production, which in turn increases the costs of basic food commodities. In addition to these financial and economic effects, there are issues related to environmental sustainability. Many countries that rely on commodity exports, especially those reliant on oil and related exports, have highly carbon-intensive economies. Efforts to support economic diversification to reduce exposure to shocks may bring substantial environmental benefits, if they prioritize the development of lower-carbon, more environmentally sustainable sectors and activities. Oil shocks in North and Central Asia Many Central Asian countries are highly dependent on natural resource exports such as minerals, natural gas and oil. For instance, fuel exports make up 92 per cent of Azerbaijan\u2019s merchandise exports and 70 per cent of Kazakhstan\u2019s. Figure 2.4 charts the fluctuation of oil prices and merchandise exports across the region between 2004 and 2017, highlighting the substantial effects of oil price fluctuations on economic conditions in Central Asia in comparison to other subregions. When oil prices are high, exports rise in parallel. But when the price falls, so do exports \u2013 and Central Asia has felt these effects more than other subregions. This economic reliance on fossil fuels has created major financial challenges in recent years. In addition, it poses an obstacle to much needed action on climate change in the region, through the pursuit of lower carbon paths to development. In many countries, however, the shocks to oil prices in 2014 prompted important efforts to explore paths to greater economic diversification. In the early 2000s, per capita incomes in many Central Asian countries more than doubled, largely in response to high global oil prices. Average incomes increased four-fold in Azerbaijan, and tripled in countries including Armenia and Turkmenistan. Another effect of this resource boom was that wages in resource-intensive economies increased, raising production costs and making it more difficult to shift to non-oil industries. By 2011, several countries were forced to confront the negative effects of rising energy prices, which peaked by 2012. These included food price inflation of more than 20 per cent in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, and of 15 per cent in Armenia. Energy price inflation exceeded 30 per cent in Uzbekistan. In 2014, Central Asia was hit by a different type of shock: the plummeting price of oil. Prices fell from $110 a barrel in July 2014 to around $50 a barrel in early 2015. This had severe economic and financial impacts on most countries in the subregion. Figure 2.5 shows the effects of energy price fluctuations on the GDP of the four most oil-dependent countries in Central Asia. While not all Central Asian economies are energy exporters, energy importers such as Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are dependent on remittances, mostly from the Russian Federation. Since the Russian Federation is also reliant on fuel exports and revenues, reductions in oil prices led to declining remittances in non-energy-exporting countries in Central Asia.42 Budget revenues have declined since 2014 in most oil- dependent countries, and fiscal balances have deteriorated.43 The effects have been particularly severe in Azerbaijan (see Box 2.3). GDP growth loosely tracks the rises and falls in energy prices, except in Uzbekistan. The Government of Uzbekistan took measures to manage external shocks, including fiscal buffers to boost spending, and monetary policies to ensure credit for the private sector expanded.44 Negative changes in budget revenues and fiscal balances create pressure to constrain spending on social welfare, thus making them a highly relevant issue even in countries where average income levels are relatively high. The impacts seen in Central Asia have prompted concern, both within these countries and among the wider development community that supports them, about prospects for sustaining income levels and recent employment gains.

Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 18 Commodity shocks are not a new issue for countries in the Asia-Pacific region; they are a long-standing economic challenge. Nevertheless, these shocks have exposed Central Asia\u2019s financial vulnerability, and the need to strengthen the governance and operating frameworks for banks and financial institutions in the region.46 Encouragingly, there have already been considerable efforts to strengthen resilience to such shocks in the region. Anticipatory capacities have been strengthened through diverse global and national-level efforts, such as tools to track commodity prices and market conditions. Indeed, a major effort has been invested by both government and private sector actors in developing such tools (see Box 2.4). Countries have sought to enhance both anticipatory and absorptive capacities related to the effects of commodity price fluctuations through fiscal and financial strategies, including countercyclical fiscal policy and stimulus programmes, cuts to interest rates and greater exchange-rate flexibility.47 Well-designed social protection programmes, with sufficient resources behind them, can also help.48 International financial institutions can and are playing an important role in helping countries to cope with this diversity of risks. For example, countercyclical lending windows can help cushion or mitigate the impacts of economic shocks. Steps to build countries\u2019 adaptive capacity include modifying budget strategies and tax systems to better insulate them against the effects of commodity shocks, improve access to financial services for all segments of society (financial inclusion), and diversify the economy.

This also presents an opportunity to transform economies to be more environmentally sustainable. Several research and policy debates emphasize the need to invest in education and skills development to support greater innovation and economic diversification in the Asia-Pacific region. Spending on research and development is one indicator of the efforts of governments and the private sector to obtain competitive advantages in science, technology and knowledge, and the level of investment that a country is making in innovating for the future.49 However, in many commodity-dependent economies in the Asia-Pacific region, general levels of spending on research and development are extremely low. These issues need addressing to capitalize on the opportunities presented by economic diversification to build resilience. Pollution Pollution has become a critically important development issue across the Asia-Pacific region, driven in large part by the paths to economic development that have been pursued across the region. Marine pollution is a major problem: in 2010 it was estimated that 4.8\u201312.7 million tonnes of plastic waste were dumped in the world\u2019s oceans,50 more than half of which entered from the coastal areas of China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 20 Economic and environmental damage from plastic debris in the world\u2019s oceans has been estimated to cost $13 billion a year.52 This includes the cost of clean-up operations and the drop in tourism revenues in coastal towns affected. The fishing industry is also affected by disruptions to ecological systems and damage to coral reefs. Microplastics ingested by marine wildlife can also be passed on to humans through the food chain.53 Freshwater, land, soil and chemical pollution and associated ecosystem protection are also significant challenges. However, air pollution is perhaps the most pressing pollution issue for the region. In 2015, pollution54 caused an estimated 9 million premature deaths worldwide, equivalent to 16 per cent of all deaths, making pollution one of the most significant contributors to premature mortality.55 Air pollution was estimated to be responsible for 6.5 million of these deaths. With its fast-growing cities, the Asia-Pacific region is now home to 25 of the world\u2019s 30 most polluted cities in terms of particulate matter.56 Due to their vulnerability and lack of coping capacity, poor people, the elderly and the very young are disproportionately impacted by pollution exposure. Adults over 60 years of age suffer the largest number of pollution-related deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, a quarter of deaths of children under 5 years of age are due to pollution exposure.57 Air pollution also has economic impacts. Welfare losses as a result of exposure to ambient and household air pollution are estimated to cost South Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific the equivalent of about 7.5 per cent of their regional GDP.58 Events that lead to severe, concentrated pollution within a short period of time can be severe shocks to human systems. For example, intense smog incapacitated New Delhi, India\u2019s capital city, in November 2017 (see Box 2.5), while recurrent transboundary smoke and haze in South-East Asia, caused by forest and peatland fires, have had severe social and economic effects in this subregion, affecting people in multiple countries. Forest and peatland fires in South-East Asia Deforestation and forest degradation are major issues for countries across the Asia-Pacific region, but the problem is particularly alarming in Indonesia, where more than 227,000 square kilometres \u2013 more than twice the size of the Republic of Korea \u2013 were lost between 2001 and 2016 (see Figure 2.7). This trend is driven largely by the demand for natural resources from forests, and to clear land for producing food and other commodities; the burning of land to establish palm oil plantations is a key driver of deforestation in Indonesia. Much of this forest land is cleared using slash- and-burn practices, as burning is still the cheapest way for businesses and farmers to clear land. This has further significant environmental impacts: South-East Asia is home to rich and biodiverse tropical rainforests, which are lost through these practices. Deforestation and forest degradation are also a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions from the region.

The monitoring and analysis of data (which vary by sector and commodity type) on price, demand and supply help these actors to anticipate and predict commodity shocks. For example, a mix of public and private players monitor developments in oil markets very closely. The Joint Oil Data Initiative includes 90 countries and international organizations, representing about 90 per cent of global oil supply and demand, to provide comprehensive data on oil prices. Private companies such as Platts, Argus and ICIS also provide in- depth data and market analysis on energy and petrochemical markets. Stronger food price monitoring is essential, given its huge developmental significance in poorer countries. For example, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations system has invested significantly in data, market analysis and monitoring of physical fundamentals for food and other agricultural commodities. In addition, following the 2008 food price crisis, the Group of 20 launched the Agricultural Market Information System51 to enhance market transparency and reduce panic-driven price surges and the associated excessive volatility in prices. Source: Fajarnes, 2011 Box 2.4 Monitoring commodities: Investing in anticipatory capacities 21 Air pollution is becoming increasingly serious in India, and debilitating smog in New Delhi during the winter months (November\u2013February) is a recurring phenomenon. In November 2017, the city experienced an extremely severe shock from air pollution, with PM2.5 levels59 rising steeply (see Figure 2.6). Regular sources of ongoing pollution in the city \u2013 including industrial smoke stacks, hotels and restaurants using coal, vehicle emissions, and dust from construction and demolition sites \u2013 were compounded by seasonal events. Farmers in nearby states were preparing their fields for planting by burning crop stubble; over a quarter of the particulate matter in New Delhi between October and November is attributed to the post-monsoon crop residue burning in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana states. Meanwhile, fireworks to celebrate the Diwali festival added to air pollution levels. Around this festival, levels of particulate matter nearly double and levels of potassium and barium can increase tenfold.60 Weather conditions further exacerbated the stress of these seasonal events in 2017, with cool dry air and slow winds trapping airborne pollutants. The effects on everyday life were significant: for example, 4,000 schools had to be closed, affecting about 4 million students. At the height of the crisis, construction projects were suspended, trucks were banned in New Delhi, and a car-rationing scheme was put in place. Coal-fired power plants were also shut down. Even the sale of firecrackers during the Diwali festival was banned. These emergency measures were inadequate, however, and underlying causes of this recurrent shock need to be addressed. These causes are well recognized, and were analysed in a report commissioned by the Department of Environment of the Government of New Delhi and the city\u2019s Pollution Control Committee.61 This report argued for a phased approach to address the multiple sources of pollutants affecting the city, starting with phasing out coal use in hotels and restaurants, and reducing the need to burn municipal solid waste by improving collection and disposal.

Estimates suggest that 6 million people in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore were exposed to very unhealthy air quality levels,65 and 2 million were exposed to hazardous pollution levels for more than half of the September\u2013October period in 2015.66 More than 500,000 cases of acute respiratory infection were recorded, and 19 deaths were directly attributed to exposure to haze.67 Schools had to be closed, and a state of emergency was declared in six Indonesian provinces. 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Square kilometres (\u2019000s) 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Rest of South-East Asia Indonesia Figure 2.7 Forest cover loss in South-East Asia and Indonesia, 2001\u20132016 Source: Hansen and others, 2013 There were immediate and direct economic impacts from the 2015 haze. There were widespread disruptions to transport and logistics systems, including shipping cargo and flights. These in turn affected trade, incurring losses worth up to $1.3 billion, with further losses in tourism revenue. The total cumulative cost to the Indonesian economy by 2016 was estimated to be $16.1 billion.68 Interacting factors escalated the severity of the haze event in 2015. The potential rewards on offer from exporting palm oil as a commodity have increased economic incentives to burn forests for this practice. Despite laws to manage and regulate burning practices, poor enforcement and weak governance meant these have continued.69 At the same time, this environmentally damaging practice coincided with natural climatological factors, including droughts in parts of the subregion, which intensified the problem. Increasing resilience to address pollution As with the other shocks reviewed in this chapter, recognition of the severity of these impacts has led to regional cooperation to build anticipatory capacity, for example by investing in better systems to monitor pollution in general, and deforestation, forest degradation and forest fires specifically. Yet, while there has been encouraging progress, there is a continued need to invest in better quality and more transparent systems. 23 Better engagement with the communities who live closest to the forests and are most dependent on them for their livelihoods can also help. Measures could include involving them in monitoring activities to help make these more precise and relevant. There is a need to further strengthen anticipatory capacity in the region by investing in central data coordination systems that consolidate all pollution data in accessible, transparent and actionable formats.70 Tackling the pollution challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region requires improved adaptive capacities, including adopting regulations and legislation to control pollution more effectively. Some countries and cities (such as New Delhi, as noted in Box 2.5) have already taken initial regulatory measures to address individual point sources of pollution, or have commissioned studies to understand the sources of pollution and identify potential priorities for an action plan. Improving access to health care is a substantial issue when considering how to increase the region\u2019s absorptive capacity for coping with pollution shocks. Preventing pollution-related health problems is the preferable solution, but health systems are increasingly having to care for people with pollution-related conditions. The central issue, however, is the need to transform economic incentives, industrial and urban development systems, and land-use planning and management processes to value forest resources more greatly, and promote practices that sustain and maintain ecosystem services. Such steps can help to address the root causes of pollution and support more environmentally sustainable approaches to development. Fire hotspots peak when this burning coincides with the dry season (June to September). In very dry years \u2013 for example, during droughts, El Ni\u00f1o events or positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions \u2013 the fires are even greater in scale and ferocity. In these years, farmers often take advantage of the dry conditions to burn more land, exacerbating the problem", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eed88b65-626b-4565-8e9d-75004cbda2ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "eed88b65-626b-4565-8e9d-75004cbda2ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa5c6f91971c6ce7546953dc0515df63e83b9adb9204e5fc38195d81c1de844d"}, "3": {"node_id": "587303d5-1f01-415e-9167-5407e578c2ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e437c2504b01f9853f5eeff01c273f465d50aad7744a966610a93f2ca3394be4"}}, "hash": "3aa5a889181f02f14d9f8b344862e04c7fa9d45cf4f3afdbbd132938a890d196", "text": "further. In Sumatra and Kalimantan (the Indonesian part of Borneo), there are extensive oil palm and timber concessions, where burning is common. Indonesia also has the largest area of tropical peatland in the world, most of which is in Sumatra and Kalimantan.

The three categories of shock analysed in this chapter drive home the urgency for countries in the region to find effective transformation paths if they are to become sustainable, resilient societies. Shocks have different effects on diverse groups in society, but data limitations make it difficult to provide a comprehensive analysis of how vulnerable groups are affected by specific events. Targeted efforts to better understand the effects of shocks and stresses on the poorest, most vulnerable groups in society are needed. The interplay between these shocks and the trends and changing development contexts described in this chapter are likely to alter the ways in which some of these impacts manifest in the future, but also hold the potential to find more effective ways to manage shocks. Chapter 3 discusses some of the good practices in the region that are emerging in this context. The severity of the effects of these shocks on diverse human system serves to strengthen increasingly well-accepted arguments for taking a more integrated approach to development; this will be necessary if the SDGs are to be achieved. Investing in practical, effective institutions that facilitate coordinated approaches to policy development and implementation is one vital element of such integration. The SDGs provide a starting point for a framework for considering links when conceptualizing and designing new development interventions. The Special Feature that follows takes stock of the resilience-related targets within the SDGs. 25 S P E C I A L F E AT U R E Taking stock: Resilience targets and indicators in the SDGs Several SDGs make explicit links to resilience, as Figure 1 shows, while numerous goals have targets and indicators that capture dimensions of resilience, even if the term is not expressly used. The SDGs focus on the resilience of poor and vulnerable groups (target 1.5), promoting resilient agricultural practices (target 2.4); investing in resilient infrastructure (targets 9.1 and 9.A); building resilient cities and human settlements (targets 11.B); increasing resilience to climate-related hazards and disasters triggered by natural hazards (targets 13.1 and 13.2); and strengthening the resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems (target 14.2).

For example, SDG 9 targets related to promoting resilient infrastructure capture people\u2019s access to road networks, but do not capture the extent to which these roads have been designed to be resilient to various shocks and stresses. Resilience and disaster risk reduction: SDGs 1, 11 and 13 SDG 1 \u2013 to end poverty in all its forms everywhere \u2013 includes a target (1.5) to build the resilience of poor people and those in vulnerable situations, and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters. SDG 11 \u2013 to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable \u2013 and SDG 13 \u2013 to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts \u2013 include similar targets and use many of the same associated indicators. The SDGs therefore reflect a relatively holistic approach to disaster risk reduction and resilience from multiple lenses. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are extremely vulnerable to natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, tsunamis and typhoons.72 On average, 185 million people in the region are affected by disasters triggered by natural hazards every year.73 Indeed, people in the region are five times more likely to have been affected by natural hazards than those living elsewhere.74 From 1990 to 2016, disasters triggered by natural hazards caused 1.8 million deaths worldwide, of which 65 per cent were in the Asia-Pacific region. They also rendered 101 million people in the region homeless, accounting for 89 per cent of the global total.75 Figure 276 shows that as the region has developed economically, and GDP has grown, economic assets at risk have increased substantially. The exposure of these growing assets has also increased as economies have developed without sufficient consideration of disaster risk. From 2007 to 2016, the average economic damages from disasters triggered by natural hazards were estimated to be $76 billion each year, more than twice the level in the preceding decade (1997\u20132006).77 Not only does the Asia-Pacific region have more to lose as its economies develop, it is also subject to increasing threats from natural hazards. Hazards have been increasing in severity as well as frequency, and climate change is likely to make this situation worse in the future. While attention often focuses on intensive events, extensive low-intensity, high-frequency events, such as localized flooding and droughts, also take a major toll.78 The effects of these localized events are often largely absorbed by poor and vulnerable people. SDGs 1 and 11 encourage countries to adopt, implement and localize disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030. 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Number of disasters 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 Damages ($, billions) 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 Total damages Climatological Geophysical Hydrological Meteorological Figure 2 The increasing frequency of, and damages from, disasters in the Asia-Pacific region, 1970\u20132016 Source: EM-DAT, www.emdat.be 27 Special feature: Taking stock: Resilience targets and indicators in the SDGs As of 2015, some 19 countries had yet to report on whether they had developed risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030. These ranged from high-income countries, such as the Russian Federation and Singapore, to some of the least developed countries in the region, such as Cambodia, as well as small island developing states such as Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. There is an urgent need for all countries to develop such frameworks, to help ensure that they are fully prepared for future disaster events, and that they reflect a holistic approach to reducing and managing disaster risk. The SDGs place a special emphasis on the need to develop local-level disaster risk reduction strategies. Under SDG 11, target 11.B monitors the number of local governments that have adopted disaster risk reduction plans in line with the Sendai Framework. As a rapidly urbanizing region, increasing the resilience of Asia-Pacific cities to stresses including climate change is imperative.

Between 2000 and 2015, low- income and lower-middle-income countries in the Asia- Pacific region lost almost 15 times more people per disaster event compared with high-income countries in the region.81 Social protection systems can play an important role in strengthening individual and community-level resilience (see Box 2). Sustainable food production and resilient agricultural practices: SDG 2 Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region need to pay more attention to food security and the diversification of food systems, and to growth in the agricultural sector (target 2.4). About 90 million hectares of agricultural land were lost between 2000 and 2013 due to land degradation and conversion to other uses. Between 1992 and 2014, the amount of arable land in the region fell from 0.28 to 0.21 hectares per person. The region also has the world\u2019s highest rate of mineral fertilizer use, which can have negative environmental effects on soil quality, water quality and human health.82 In addition, in recent years the agriculture sector has borne almost 17 per cent of the total economic impacts from natural hazards.83 There is an urgent imperative to invest in the health of the ecosystems that underpin food production systems. Increasing economic integration has reshaped food production systems in the region. Resilient infrastructure: SDG 9 The infrastructure needs of the region are diverse and substantial \u2013 projected at approximately $26 trillion between 2016 and 2030 in the region\u2019s developing countries, particularly in the energy and transport sectors.84 The costs of adapting this infrastructure to climate change are estimated to be $41 billion a year, mostly for transport infrastructure.85 Poor people often have the least access to infrastructure, and it is essential to find more inclusive approaches to infrastructure development, including in urban areas. SDG 9 focuses on the connectivity of transport and information and communications technology. There are scant data on the proportion of the rural population who live within two kilometres of an all-season road, the officially agreed indicator, but new research from the World Bank suggests that ratios vary substantially even across poorer countries in Asia and the Pacific, from 54 per cent in Nepal to 85 per cent in Bangladesh.86 On average, it is estimated that 40 per cent of the region\u2019s rural population (or 700 million people) do not have all-weather road access.87 The WEF Competitiveness Index suggests road quality in the Asia- Pacific region has substantial room for improvement, with only China, Japan and Singapore having roads that are on par with \u2018the best in the world\u2019. As of 2016, some 97 per cent of the region\u2019s population are within range of mobile cellular signals. Rates are lower in the region\u2019s low-income economies, such as Nepal Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 28 Effective social protection systems can help strengthen the resilience of individuals and households to stresses and shocks in several ways. First, they build absorptive capacity for a shock by providing safety nets that allow people to meet their basic needs. Second, social protection systems may be designed to help build anticipatory capacity, including in the context of climate change, if designed to incentivize people to prepare and plan for shocks. They can also help to build adaptive capacity in the long term, if they help to promote sustainable livelihoods through interventions that build people\u2019s ability to earn an income or maintain a solid asset base. SDG target 1.3 calls on all countries to establish nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage among poor and vulnerable people. It is, however, very challenging to establish effective social protection systems that create the right incentives for resilience-building efforts. Poor and vulnerable households are not homogeneous and may need different types of interventions to strengthen their resilience. As countries in the Asia-Pacific region have grown richer, many have taken steps to expand various aspects of their social protection systems. In most countries, investment in such programmes has generally increased, as Figure 3 shows.

The importance of finding more resilient approaches to infrastructure development, with a focus on protecting ecosystems, particularly connectivity and transport infrastructure such as roads, remains paramount. There are, however, critical trade-offs between some of the paths to greater infrastructure connectivity and wider objectives of promoting environmentally sustainable development and sustainable consumption. There may also be a risk that greater connectivity can undermine self-sufficiency and thereby resilience. Resilient marine ecosystems: SDG 14 Target 14.2 aims to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems, including by strengthening their resilience. Yet, only 11.2 per cent of the region\u2019s marine areas are protected.89 In the Coral Triangle Region alone, more than 85 per cent of reefs are threatened by local stressors, such as overfishing and pollution (versus the global average of 60 per cent); this increases to 90 per cent when combined with stress from ocean warming and coral bleaching (versus the global average of 75 per cent).90 While only SDG 14 makes explicit reference to resilience, this is a crucial consideration for many other ecosystems as well. Efforts to strengthen the resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems must be accelerated significantly. Special feature: Taking stock: Resilience targets and indicators in the SDGs Some programmes in developing Asia-Pacific countries have become the world\u2019s largest in terms of the numbers of beneficiaries.88 Countries such as China, Mongolia, Thailand and Viet Nam have emerged as global leaders due to the speed with which they have established social protection programmes with extensive coverage on selected issues related to health and unemployment. Despite this encouraging progress, many gaps remain. Data suggest that nearly 60 per cent of the region\u2019s population now have access to health social protection. Nevertheless, the International Labour Organization estimates that only 4 in 10 people in the region have easy access to health care, and access is often limited for those who are covered. Only 30 per cent of the population have access to social assistance, and less than 20 per cent have access to social insurance. Only 21 of 49 countries in the region offer benefits to children and families, while only 1 in 5 working-age adults receive unemployment benefits. Lastly, just over half of all older people in the region receive a pension. In low-income countries, such as Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar, there are almost no cash-transfer-based social protection programmes in place. Reporting on labour market programmes remains highly incomplete, and questions around the adequacy and depth of existing coverage arise. Both issues have significant fiscal implications. As efforts are made to enhance social protection systems in the region, there is an urgent need to factor current and future vulnerabilities into these programmes. The targeting of beneficiaries can be improved by using climate and disaster risk information. Integrated solutions to reduce risk and strengthen adaptive capacity through social protection programmes can be adopted. There is also a need for flexible design features to strengthen each programme\u2019s responsiveness to shocks.

On this basis, it draws insights into the key characteristics that individuals, organizations and societies need to strengthen their resilience.

A hazard combined with the wrong policy choices poses a risk before it happens; when it does occur, it creates a shock (e.g. a cyclone or tsunami). Poor policy choices increase the exposure and vulnerability of populations and can be associated with hazards of all kinds, including disasters, social conflicts, health issues, and economic and financial shocks. Therefore, there is a clear need for integrated and improved policy frameworks that can help transform societies and countries in the Asia-Pacific region and make them more resilient and sustainable. Building resilience requires policies and programmes that reduce the intersection or the scale of risks and shocks (see Figure 3.1). This can be achieved by: z reducing the likelihood of hazards occurring, for example by mitigating climate change z choosing policies that reduce people\u2019s exposure, for example by preventing human settlement in low-lying, flood-prone areas z reducing people\u2019s vulnerability, for example by increasing their capacity to cope with a hazard by having appropriate infrastructure or resources. Resilience-building requires the delivery of a combination of policy and programmatic interventions.91 Capital and assets help people withstand shocks, and accumulating these can contribute to inter-generational equity or sustainable development, if the choices made by a society, and the policies that govern them, do not increase exposure and vulnerability.92 As well as capital and assets, as discussed in Chapter 2, individuals\u2019 exposure and vulnerability depend on their social and economic status, and the area in which they live. Often, poor and vulnerable people also need support from the state and society. An individual\u2019s livelihood, which in part determines their capital and assets, is influenced by policy decisions taken at the national, community and household levels. Government policies and societal choices, which are guided by existing values and institutions, therefore play a significant role in building resilience. This chapter covers this subject in more detail. 3.2 Government policies and programmes for building resilience Building resilience requires both formal and informal strategies. Informal strategies include arrangements made by communities, for example whether to construct a small dam or diversify crops. Some communities also use informal insurance mechanisms, such as financial self-help groups in which members transfer resources or savings to support a member who suffers from a shock. Formal arrangements include market-based solutions, and public policies and programmes. Informal and formal policies are interdependent. For example, public policies and the availability of formal mechanisms heavily influence how extensively informal arrangements are used for building resilience. The balance Figure 3.1 Three elements of risk Hazard Vulnerability Exposure Risks Source: Adapted from Lavell and others, 2012, with inputs from Deborah O\u2019Connell 33 Building resilient societies: Getting ready for transformation between these is also changing over time. With the interaction of trends such as climate change, economic integration, demographic changes and rural\u2013urban transition, risks are becoming more complex. Increasingly, individuals and communities cannot address such complexity through their own informal measures; they need greater government support and solutions, in the form of formal measures that cover a broad spectrum of macro- level and sectoral policies, as well as targeted policies (e.g. those focusing on particularly vulnerable groups). Table 3.1 outlines some of the policies, programmes and projects implemented for building the four inter-related forms of resilience capacity \u2013 anticipatory, adaptive, absorptive and transformative \u2013 used in the Asia-Pacific region. While this chapter is structured around these different types of capacity, they are overlapping and most of the programmes and projects highlighted here include efforts to build more than one type. 3.3 Building anticipatory capacity People anticipate risks based on their human capital: their knowledge, information and experience. Education can play a vital role in shaping their human capital. As Chapter 2 noted, there is an established link between the quality of education in countries and their resilience. Several countries introduced disaster management into their school and college curricula a long time ago,93 while shocks and stresses feature in the content of courses in various university faculties, such as economic shocks featuring in economics courses. However, most people in poor communities anticipate risks in light of their experience only. As new risks emerge, they may not be well prepared unless they get information from governments or other stakeholders to raise their awareness of these risks. They need to be aware not just of the risks to themselves, but how a disaster might affect the capital and assets that they hold. Effective communication about risks therefore has a significant role to play in building anticipatory capacity.

Communities are also establishing early warning systems. In the north-east region of Bangladesh, vulnerable people form committees that together create a network that can quickly communicate the arrival of flash floods and monitor the effectiveness of warning systems.95 Many countries also run programmes and projects to improve people\u2019s awareness, knowledge and skills. Examples include China\u2019s \u2018Recovery to Resilience \u2013 Implementing Child-centered Disaster Risk Reduction\u2019 project and the \u2018Enhancing Resilience through Gender Equality\u2019 project. Building resilience to earthquakes in China Between 1964 and 2013, China experienced 151 earthquakes measuring 6.5 to 7.0 on the Richter scale, and has suffered several more since. Sichuan province, in the south-west of the country, is particularly prone to geological hazards including earthquakes, and the risks associated with these are increased due to rapid urbanization and overpopulation in the province. In 2008, the devastating Wenchuan earthquake, which reached 7.9 on the Richter scale, caused over 90,000 deaths and missing persons. In response, Save the Children China launched the \u2018Recovery to Resilience \u2013 Implementing Child-centered Disaster Risk Reduction\u2019 project in 2012 to deliver long-term improvements in children\u2019s resilience and in their communities\u2019 capacities to reduce the impacts of disasters. This programme introduced a new concept to the region, one that focused on risk reduction and resilience-building with a child-centred perspective. The Asian Disaster Preparedness Center and Save the Children China devised a strategy to safeguard children against the impacts of disasters by training parents, teachers, community leaders and government officials on disaster risk management, including the identification of hazards and vulnerabilities that exposed their communities to risks. Information collected during risks assessment was used to create hazard action plans that focused on the safety of children.96 Earthquakes are cyclical in nature, but big earthquakes only occur on cycles with long intervals. For example, Kathmandu in Nepal experienced an earthquake measuring 8.4 on the Richter scale in 1934. Another big earthquake occurred in 2015 \u2013 81 years later. As a result of this lengthy interval, which spanned generations, in 2015 there were hardly any people alive with experience of the 1934 earthquake. If the government and development partners had not raised awareness, and implemented regulations to turn awareness into actions, the 2015 earthquake could have claimed even more than the 9,000 lives that were lost, and damaged far more property. These examples illustrate the important role of education and communication. However, resilience not only requires communities to be better prepared for hazards such as earthquakes, but also governments in affected countries to have long-term visions and policies for making their societies more resilient.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3b39d92-2ec0-4a4b-90ce-80230fa17be1": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3b39d92-2ec0-4a4b-90ce-80230fa17be1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d235902322eaf636a02439c2dde1665211a25515e107dd5b89e77d5f01431842"}, "2": {"node_id": "75a7b04a-a8d0-458f-9810-65a174a2e7ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b637088ef01e0040a744f4c0ae4ad01586f2c08cd93d18266e6956234a672761"}}, "hash": "eeb65c3f76071b547b23a3b486157691d8d8e732843a5410ce2046ac16aa3385", "text": "In countries affected by earthquakes, this can be done through measures such as enforcing rules about land-use planning and building standards to minimize damage and losses from hazards.

The main tool was a poster communicating information about \u20187 ways to prevent dengue fever\u2019. These were distributed for people to display in their homes. The seven tips reminded people to replace water in flower vases, remove leaves from gutters, dispose of unused containers, clean water vessels weekly, cover water buckets and wear protective clothing.

For example, in Timor-Leste, female members of farmers\u2019 groups have increased their knowledge, skills and confidence to apply sustainable agricultural techniques to mitigate agricultural risks.97 This has not only helped their society to respond to disasters, but also empowered the women by improving gender relations and changing social structures. Building the resilience of poor and vulnerable groups has a higher pay-off than doing so for wealthier, less vulnerable groups, and contributes to realizing the principle in the 2030 Agenda to \u2018leave no one behind\u2019. 3.4 Building adaptive capacity Despite efforts made by states and society to anticipate and reduce risks, it is impossible to avoid all hazards. It is therefore important to take measures that can help people adapt and live with them. These can include ex-ante or risk adaptation measures; and ex-post or risk absorption measures. At times, it is difficult to make a clear distinction between the two measures, because the absorptive capacity of a society depends on how much adaptive capacity is built before a hazard occurs. To build adaptive capacity, it is necessary to reduce the exposure and vulnerability of a society. This can be done through a variety of measures. For example, adaptive capacity can be improved by implementing macroeconomic policies that decrease the impact of economic shocks; through sectoral policies and programmes, such as agricultural development and irrigation improvement, that lead to an increase in incomes or diversified livelihood options or income sources; or by mainstreaming risk management into national and sectoral planning, such as through National Adaption Plans (NAPs). Macroeconomic policies Over the past three decades, regional cooperation and integration have benefited the Asia-Pacific region, driving trade, economic growth and stability. Asia had a combined GDP of $17 trillion in 2010; this could reach $174 trillion by 2050, accounting for almost half of global GDP.98 But while economic integration has increased investment and trade, resulting in economic growth, the region is still at risk from shocks that can affect its economic systems. These shocks can be contagious. When global supply chains are disrupted, a shock can have impacts far beyond the country in which it originated. The 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, which struck off the coast of Japan, damaged and shut down several major ports and airports, disrupting global supply chains such as those for semiconductor equipment and materials, for which Japan\u2019s production comprises 20 per cent of the world market.99 A globalizing economy creates both opportunities and challenges. The Republic of Korea adopted a series of economic policies and expansionary policies to aid coordination with other countries; these helped to attain a fast recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. The Republic of Korea\u2019s experiences illustrate the role of regional cooperation in supporting resilience against economic and financial shocks (see Box 3.2). Not all countries and communities are in a position to adapt to global shocks by themselves, however. There remains a need for stronger global and regional cooperation. Several cooperation initiatives are already being pursued in the Asia-Pacific region, including the 2013 Bangkok Declaration on Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration in Asia and the Pacific, which focuses on: (1) the formation of an integrated market;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "801632c6-3003-4689-b887-a59b3a7a9649": {"__data__": {"id_": "801632c6-3003-4689-b887-a59b3a7a9649", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77b110ddb4dd0abed7ac1c66bd80f3e658c3e694b873644ae1144388e6dcebc2"}}, "hash": "77b110ddb4dd0abed7ac1c66bd80f3e658c3e694b873644ae1144388e6dcebc2", "text": "(2) the development of seamless connectivity across the region in the areas of transport, energy and information and communications technology; (3) enhancing financial cooperation; and (4) increasing economic and technical cooperation to address shared vulnerabilities and risks.100 Agricultural development Historically, most successful industrialization processes began with progress in agriculture. In recent years, the experiences of China, India and Viet Nam have shown how agricultural growth can lay the foundations for the subsequent growth of industry and other economic sectors.101 Even though the traditional development path \u2013 from agriculture to industry to services \u2013 is now changing, agriculture remains an essential sector in most developing countries as the mainstay of poor people. Many smallholder family farmers are poor and food insecure, and have limited access to markets and services.102 The food crisis that emerged in 2008 demonstrated yet again the vulnerability of these people to adverse long-term trends and unexpected shocks. For example, smallholder family farms in the informal sector often have limited access to credit and other facilities, which means they lack a potential coping mechanism when crises hit. Many also lack knowledge and skills about how to manage risks. They are often very risk averse compared to large-scale farmers, Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 36 because of their limited capital and assets. These factors mean they remain vulnerable unless they are provided with a package of services, as well as the motivation to use those services (see Box 3.3). Irrigation is a critical input to agricultural development; irrigation projects, even small-scale systems, can also increase the resilience of smallholder farmers to shocks and stresses. This was the case for farmers in China\u2019s Hongta District. For many years, they relied on precipitation for their irrigation. The unpredictability and scarcity of this led to low agricultural production, income instability and poor living standards. The \u2019Small-scale Farmland Water Conservancy Construction\u2019 project, implemented by the government, enhanced their adaptive capacity by providing more efficient small-scale irrigation systems that required less water, as well as water conservation facilities including solar- powered pumping stations, cisterns, pools and pipelines. The results have been dramatic. Farmers can now cultivate crops all year round, which makes them more resilient to shocks. They have also switched to horticultural crops that provide better returns. Overall, the project has led to an increase in food production of 1.33 million kilograms per year, and an increase in the value of cash crops of RMB 12.4 million (approximately $1.8 million) per year. Farmers\u2019 incomes have doubled thanks to year-round irrigation, bringing more stable livelihoods and a better standard of living, which has accelerated socioeconomic development.104 Their increased capital and assets will also help make them more resilient to future shocks. Diversifying income sources Various resilience-building programmes seek to widen people\u2019s options for earning an income. Incomes enable people to absorb the impacts of shocks and adapt to cope with future shocks. However, relying on one income source makes people vulnerable in the case of that source being affected by a shock. Thus, diversifying income sources helps communities to cope with risks. Most income-diversification programmes apply a livelihoods approach, such as an off-farm cultivation project in Bangladesh that aimed to mainstream alternative livelihood options in flood-prone areas.105 Some programmes take a mixed approach: as well as aiming to diversify sources of income, they aim to protect biodiversity as a further way to manage risks. One example is the \u2018Community Based Conservation of Biological Diversity in the Mountain Landscape of Mongolia\u2019s The Republic of Korea was hit hard by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Learning from this, it improved its macroeconomic and financial management systems to minimize the risks from similar shocks in the future. For example, the government enhanced the soundness of financial and non-financial sectors by strengthening the regulation and supervision of financial institutions and markets; and by regularly monitoring foreign exchange liquidity conditions, paying serious attention to the management of foreign exchange reserves. Despite these efforts, the country could not avoid all the impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis. It suffered from a loss of confidence among foreign investors, resulting in large capital outflows. This resulted in a capital account deficit of $42.6 billion in the last quarter of 2008, which was over 20 per cent of GDP. In addition, its exports decreased substantially, aggravating the liquidity crunch further.

The economy of the Republic of Korea managed to rebound relatively quickly, once the global market started to recover from March 2009. This experience reinforces the case for regional cooperation to strengthen regional financial safety nets. A notable initiative in this regard is the Chiang Mai Initiative of currency swapping. Continued efforts to develop regional capital markets, such as the Asian Bond Markets Initiative, can play a complementary role. Moreover, the Republic of Korea still needs to look out for trends such as ageing and low birth rates, which can depress economic growth, while top-down visions (such as pursuing green growth) still require substantial bottom-up support to achieve the desired transformation.

The project provided loans and grants to community groups to help them develop tourism, grow vegetables, repair winter shelters and improve the quality of their milk and wool products. Furthermore, 7,000 herders received training in new trades, including weaving and felt-making, processing and marketing of dairy products, tourism, and wildlife monitoring and management.106 With a wider range of income sources, the herders were more resilient to shocks. Further approaches to diversifying livelihoods include skills development and the formation of savings and credit groups. Labour migration and remittances may also play a role (Box 3.4). However, while several developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region have built their financial capital through remittances, there is generally a lack of appropriate policy measures to diversify sources of capital. Banerjee and others (2016, 2017) suggest that the adaptation potential of remittances can only be realized if there are policy incentives to use this source of financial capital to build other types of capital. For years, cotton farmers in Tajikistan lacked access to finance and technology and, being risk averse, were unwilling to grow new crops or try new farming methods. To address this problem, the government implemented the \u2018Sustaining Agricultural Biodiversity in the Face of Climate Change\u2019 project, which aimed to improve the welfare of 3,300 farmers by providing finance and technology to promote climate-resilient crops. The project contributed to building farmers\u2019 adaptive capacity by improving their knowledge and skills on adaptation issues, farm management and productivity. This was achieved through training and workshops on issues such as climate- resilient and biodiversity-friendly farming practices, crop diversification, financial management, and using equipment such as solar dryers. The project improved access to finance, for example through micro-credit schemes, as well as establishing agro- processing shops and more resilient and profitable agribusinesses. As a result, farmers\u2019 incomes increased by 40 per cent on average. It also helped to change the risk-averse attitude of the farmers, persuading them to try new farming methods by demonstrating the economic benefits of these.

In the Eastern Brahmaputra sub-basin, people\u2019s livelihoods are heavily reliant on natural resources, which further increases their exposure to flood risks. Labour migration has emerged as a livelihood diversification option for many people. Almost 90 per cent of households have one migrant worker, and nearly 10 per cent have had two migrant workers over the past 30 years. These workers send back money in the form of remittances, and households receiving these are more likely than non-recipient households to have access to services such as formal financial institutions, insurance and communication devices \u2013 all of which increase their resilience. Remittances have had a positive effect on the structural changes made by households to reduce the impacts of floods, enabling them to invest in resilience-building strategies such as farm mechanization.

People throughout the region will need support as they are forced to adapt to a future with new and greater climate-related risks. Encouragingly, many countries are already acting to build the adaptive capacity of their societies. Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and NAPs are all important instruments that help countries to implement climate change policies and programmes.107 NAPAs were established to help least developed countries to identify priority activities for adapting to their most urgent and immediate needs in relation to climate change. This is essential, as delays in taking these actions would increase their vulnerability and/or result in higher costs if enacted at a later stage.108 Many NAPAs include ecosystem-based adaptation, which increases the resilience of vulnerable communities and of the ecosystems on which they depend. In the Asia-Pacific region, one approach is to expand and connect protected areas to conserve intact forests, wetlands, mangroves and coral reefs, all of which provide a natural buffer for vulnerable communities against disasters intensified by climate change.109 While there were many ways in which the NAPA process could have been strengthened, the experience has greatly informed understanding of adaptation planning in developing countries. Building on this experience, countries have started developing NAPs. Approximately half of the middle-income, developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region are developing medium-to-long-term, cross-sectoral and cross-scale processes to formulate and implement their NAPs, which are aimed at reducing vulnerability and integrating climate change adaptation into planning and budgeting processes.110 Environmental problems have become more complicated and complex; consequently, there is an increasing need for regional, inter-regional and global responses. ClimaEast111 is an example of an inter-regional project that has achieved significant results in terms of building the adaptive capacity of countries in the Asia-Pacific region and Eastern Europe (Box 3.5). The ClimaEast project (2012\u20132017) operated in seven countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Russian Federation in the Asia-Pacific region, and Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine in Eastern Europe. The project used an ecosystem-based approach, which combines issues of rural development, sustainable land management and sustainable livelihoods to establish community-based solutions to the challenges of climate change. Activities under the project focused on the integrated management of land, water and natural resources that have a vital role to play in climate change mitigation and adaptation, including peatland, permafrost landscapes, boreal forests and pasturelands. The programme had two components: country pilot projects and policy. The country pilot projects demonstrated that intact ecosystems can have a strong and cost-effective impact on both climate change mitigation and adaptation. They also showed how valuable an integrated approach and strong regional cooperation can be, and showcased the need for ecosystem-based approaches for tackling climate change. Under the policy component, the project contributed to improved climate policy and planning processes, better sectoral climate policies, and better climate change modelling and reporting processes. The seven countries now have greater capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and stronger cross-country engagement and partnerships, including partnerships between national stakeholders in regional climate debates and actions. All of these contribute to the sustainability and resilience capacities of the countries involved. Overall, ClimaEast had a significant impact. It built the adaptive capacity of 192,000 people by strengthening their livelihoods and providing social security benefits; it protected 72,000 hectares of ecosystems vulnerable to climate change. Further, it reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the project countries, for example by replacing fossil fuels with biomass for energy in Belarus and by restoring and improving the carbon absorption capacity of peatlands (Russian Federation, Ukraine), forests (Armenia, Moldova, Russian Federation) and pasturelands (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova).

Since the adoption of Hyogo Framework for Action in 2005, progress has been made in reducing disaster risk at local, national, regional and global levels. This has been guided by a comprehensive global framework that aims to tackle these risks. In 2015\u20132016 alone, governments established several separate but inter-related agreements, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 (see the Special Feature).113 However, more than a decade after the adoption of the Hyogo Framework, disasters continue to undermine efforts to achieve sustainable development.114 Within the Asia-Pacific region, the Pacific island countries and territories are extremely vulnerable to climate change and natural hazards. The experiences of tropical cyclone Winston in 2016, tropical cyclone Pam in 2015 and numerous other natural hazards have all reinforced the need for actions on climate change and disaster risk management to be better understood, planned for, funded and coordinated at the local, national, regional and international levels. Encouragingly, there has been progress on this front. For example, the Pacific Risks Resilience Programme (2015\u2013 2018) works with Pacific island countries and their people to mainstream the risks they face from climate change and disasters into development planning and processes.115 Under this initiative, several Pacific countries, including Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu, have adopted an approach that incorporates risk-informed planning and budgeting. One of the projects implemented under this programme was the relocation of Tukuraki village in Fiji to avoid the risk of landslides (Box 3.6). 3.5 Building absorptive capacity Absorptive capacity generally refers to the measures that people use to cope in the wake of shocks and disasters. However, some of these measures reduce or degrade their human and financial capital and assets. For example, people might reduce their food consumption, change the type of food they eat, reduce family expenses, take out loans, sell their livestock and assets, or take their children out of school. One crucial aspect of building absorptive capacity is therefore to increase people\u2019s income-earning options, so that they can meet their basic needs in times of crisis (such as buying food). World Food Programme (WFP) projects, such as the \u2018Enhancing Resilience to Natural Disasters\u2019 project in Bangladesh, have contributed to building the capacity of individual households, ensuring that they have less need to turn to potentially damaging coping measures (Box 3.7). Social protection programmes Social protection systems can play an important role in building absorptive capacity. They play two major roles: to ensure income security and health security. These systems ensure that children, adults and older people all have some form of income and access to essential health care to absorb the impacts of a shock.116 United Nations agencies have, in the last decade, emphasized social protection systems as a way to address the impacts of a number of global crises, including shocks to food, fuel and financial systems.117 Social protection provides opportunities to attain growth in a manner that protects poor and excluded groups. It does so by smoothing patterns of income generation and consumption so that shocks cause less disruption, and by maintaining political and social stability, among other ways.118 Social protection programmes tend to focus on wider goals than just income generation and can play a critical role in reducing poverty. They are designed to help people maintain an adequate standard of living and good health and to build their overall human capital and thus break intergenerational cycles of poverty and vulnerability. For example, social protection programmes can seek to increase food security (e.g. through the provision of regular and reliable cash transfer programmes), improve the health of women and children (e.g. through free antenatal care for women), promote access to education (e.g. through child grants or school stipends) or provide income transfers to older people (e.g. through old-age pensions). Some programmes are specifically focused on emergency relief efforts. Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 40 Income and consumption patterns vary with age: young and older people have less income than their consumption. Social protection programmes for children and older people can tackle these life-cycle vulnerabilities. The pace at which income deficits and consumption costs change with age varies from country to country, however. For example, in countries such as Japan, per capita consumption in old age increases sharply, whereas per capita labour income decreases more rapidly than in Thailand (Figure 3.2). Social protection programmes are funded from taxes and other sources of revenue. Tax-financed social protection, including cash transfers and universal health coverage, should provide minimum income security and ensure everyone has access to essential health care. This is particularly important in the Asia-Pacific region, where 60 per", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57af244a-4d3a-4ee3-a7ab-4d9be09a8402": {"__data__": {"id_": "57af244a-4d3a-4ee3-a7ab-4d9be09a8402", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e08538a1d2403d3cee760e388db154e83b4e81ed1e817cb73f5cedf149835e50"}, "3": {"node_id": "929417a6-49a9-4df2-afd5-b2d66ba49ca6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f86e54907d302d99731767f8fe0d3093b47744df451f3dcc22a4e19acbf6c64a"}}, "hash": "c1be8b0e4cad774445e971b401014a9249e2a798b200696f5522dd43c825245d", "text": "cent of the labour force works in the informal sector.119 Contributory social insurance schemes allow income earners to smooth their consumption over the course of their life. Many countries adopt mandatory public contributory schemes that are tied to employment. Here, contributions basically function as a form of insurance, where employees contribute a share of their labour income while working and, when a contingency occurs (e.g. unemployment, disability or old age), ensure a higher income-replacement benefit than would be provided by tax-financed, non-contributory schemes. Major shocks and crises, such as disasters triggered by natural hazards and external economic crises, can cause significant damage to individuals and to national economies, if the families affected resort to damaging coping strategies such as selling their productive assets. Social protection programmes can increase household resilience to shocks; they have enabled families to cope with sharp drops in commodity prices or when drought hits. With social protection, families can bounce back to higher productivity more quickly once the crisis dissipates.120 In January 2012, a major landslide swept rocks and mud down the steep incline above Tukuraki village, Fiji. More than half of the village was submerged by mud and debris; in one house, a family of four were buried as they slept inside. The village was declared unsafe and villagers were asked to leave; many ended up living in makeshift homes close by. Following this, tropical cyclone Evan, a Category 4 cyclone that hit in December 2012, and cyclone Winston, a Category 5 cyclone that hit in February 2016, caused further damage to what was left of Tukuraki. In the aftermath of these disasters, the government, through the Commissioner Western\u2019s Office and the National Disaster Management Office, consulted with the affected community about how to reduce their vulnerability. The decision made was to relocate the village to a safer place. Financing for the new village infrastructure was secured under the \u2018Building Safety and Resilience in the Pacific\u2019 project. This enabled the construction of 10 new houses, a community hall, a water supply system and an access road, as well as other risk-management measures. Climate change and disaster risk considerations were built into the project management process from the start. Risk maps were used to identify a new site for the village, using a new geographic information systems platform and data from the Ministry of Agriculture. Consultations and risk assessments fed into the project design, including three community consultations to identify a new site, consider future disaster and climate risks, and possible mitigation measures to address these. The project included planning for risk management measures such as cyclone-resistant infrastructure, storm-water drains, retaining walls, waste management and storage measures, and roads situated to act as fire breaks. Further, a task force was set up to monitor project implementation and ensure compliance with regulations. Social inclusion issues were included in the design of the relocated village, including railings and walkways for elderly and disabled people. The Tukuraki Women\u2019s Committee and other women\u2019s committees were central to the redevelopment process, helping to ensure gender considerations were factored in. This holistic, multi-stakeholder, multi-sector approach was adopted to increase community resilience. In support of this, the non-governmental organization Live and Learn Environmental Education provided development planning expertise to increase the community\u2019s resilience in their new village. The project is now being used as a successful example of risk-informed development, in order to scale up this approach in the Pacific. For example, Tukuraki is being used in training for divisional planners across Fiji.

Worldwide, 68 per cent of older people receive contributory or non- contributory pension payments. However, this coverage varies widely, from 22.7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa to 100 per cent in North America. In the Asia-Pacific region, this figure is 55.2 per cent; however, there is considerable subregional variation. Effective coverage ranges from 23.6 per cent in South Asia to 77.3 per cent in East Asia, where China, Japan and Mongolia have all achieved 100 per cent coverage. While gaps in income security for older people remain throughout the region, there has been notable progress in extending coverage. For example, with strong political will, the Maldives has achieved 99.7 per cent coverage of older people through a mix of contributory and non-contributory pension schemes; the non-contributory scheme alone reaches 90.6 per cent of all women and men aged 65 years and above. Thailand is moving towards universal pension coverage, and has already achieved universal health coverage (Box 3.8). Many countries have implemented non-contributory pensions, called social pensions, to increase coverage. But often the level of payments is insufficient to meet basic needs. These low payments are concerning, as entire family units often rely on pension payments to increase access to nutrition, education, health and other essential goods and services. Adequate pension payment levels that provide basic income security, at least at a nationally defined minimum, are vital to build resilience and protect older persons and families against losses due to shocks. To ensure that all older persons receive sufficient benefits to make them resilient, as stipulated in the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing,121 greater investments in health care and adequate, sustainable social security systems are a necessity.122 As the number of people aged 65 years and above in the Asia-Pacific region is set to almost double, from 556 million today to an estimated 1.29 billion by 2050, countries need to begin and continue designing and implementing pension schemes that will ensure all older persons have access to basic income security.123 3.6 Building transformative capacity Transformative capacity refers to the ability of a society to create and move to a fundamentally new system, so that a risk is avoided, or will have a limited impact if it does occur. This section examines transformations made in different systems \u2013 forest management, health care and climate change mitigation \u2013 to illustrate how such shifts can be achieved. In each of the case studies described, the building of transformative capacity was underpinned by a fundamental rethink of the way in which natural resources are allocated and managed (see Box 3.9), the ability to bring diverse stakeholders together around a single goal, and the ability to access and generate knowledge in new ways. These issues are explored further in Chapter 4. The pension system in Thailand is a mix of several contributory schemes for public sector officials, private sector employees and informal economy workers. This covers about a quarter of the population above 60 years of age. To cover the gap, the government has implemented a non-contributory old-age allowance (or social pension) that provides some level of income security to old people who are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35092303-0284-4c49-815d-7062c5ca0887": {"__data__": {"id_": "35092303-0284-4c49-815d-7062c5ca0887", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d29d346bfd11598fea919c241407b924c29d888d2a924e2477b6c56eca23c8f"}}, "hash": "4d29d346bfd11598fea919c241407b924c29d888d2a924e2477b6c56eca23c8f", "text": "without access to regular pension payments.

Thailand implemented its Universal Health-care Coverage Scheme in 2001, consolidating several health insurance schemes. It is based on the principle of universality, irrespective of economic and vulnerability status. The scheme is financed through taxes and provides free health care at the point of service. The benefit package under the scheme is comprehensive: it includes general medical care and rehabilitation services, high-cost medical treatment and emergency care. As a universal scheme, it controls costs and ensures its financial sustainability by fixing the annual budget and capping provider payments. The scheme has encouraged the development of health infrastructure and increased access to health services, reaching many people who were not covered earlier, such as those in the informal sector.124 Source: ILO, 2017 Box 3.8 Income and health security in Thailand 43 Building resilient societies: Getting ready for transformation Transforming health systems to cope with shocks Transformation is rarely achieved by just one project intervention; rather, it requires a series of changes, including reforms to legislation and policies. In health systems, for example, shocks such as disease outbreaks lead to a series of major policy shifts, as was the case with the Republic of Korea\u2019s response to the MERS outbreak (Box 3.10). In other cases, shocks to health systems are longer- term trends. As discussed in Chapter 2, air pollution is a major threat to human health and well-being in many parts of the Asia-Pacific region, particularly urban areas. Encouragingly, there are some good transformative practices being implemented to reduce air pollution. In Singapore and Seoul, Republic of Korea, the authorities have focused their attention on emissions-reducing public transport programmes as a way to reduce health risks. Similarly, Ahmedabad, India, has established a bus rapid transit system to promote a shift towards public transport and curb air pollution. Thailand has strengthened its fuel- quality and vehicle-emission standards. In Japan, practices include controlling volatile organic compound emissions125 through target setting and a mix of regulatory controls and voluntary efforts.126 Some countries have started addressing air pollution from brick kilns. For example, Viet Nam has successfully transformed its energy-inefficient brick production by switching to kilns that use liquefied petroleum gas. Viet Nam\u2019s Bat Trang village once used to be covered with dust and filled with smoke, and its residents suffered from respiratory diseases; now, they have started breathing clean, fresh air.127 Similarly, Kathmandu municipality started building cleaner and safer brick kilns after the 2015 earthquake. These government efforts have contributed to reducing the vulnerability of air pollution-related health risks. Without these, the incidence of non-communicable diseases would have been higher. Governments, together with development partners, have been driving wider innovation for transformation in the health sector. For example, the Government of India has been supporting a Universal Immunization Programme, under which an electronic vaccine intelligence network is enabled with a smart mobile application. The network \u2013 an online, real-time vaccine logistics management system \u2013 is a ground-breaking technological innovation that aims to ensure equity through efficient distribution and the timely availability of vaccines. It provides real-time information on stocks, flows and storage temperatures for all vaccine storage points, for 12 states at present. This empowers frontline health-care workers and supports the government\u2019s ambitious Universal Immunization Programme, which aims to immunize more than 156 million people every year.128 Transformation towards environmental sustainability Combating climate change requires countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and transition to low- carbon development models. This requires integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning, as set out in target 13.2 of the SDGs. Over recent decades, developing countries have deepened their efforts to reduce emissions in the context of efforts to pursue development goals. In this context, since 2007 developing countries have formulated NAMAs. NAMAs include both national-level actions as a formal submission declaring mitigation intent, and individual actions at the sector or industry level that will help a country realize its intentions. Developing countries voluntarily pledged NAMAs as an outcome of international climate policy negotiations during the 2009 Conference of the Forests used to be considered as national property in Nepal, protected and policed by the government under the Forest Nationalization Act of 1957.

Accordingly, the Forest Act of 1993 enacted a radically different approach: one which guaranteed the rights of local people in community forest management programmes, as well as in the use of forest resources. In doing so, Nepal became the first country to enact forest legislation that allowed local communities to take full control of government forests. Since its implementation, this transformative policy has helped Nepal to conserve its forest resources better and protect its mountainous regions from being denuded.

After the first MERS case was confirmed in May, 186 further cases were detected, with a death toll of 38 by the end of December, and more than 16,000 people were put into isolation. The outbreak had high cost implications. The emergency response placed an extra cost on health-care facilities of more than KRW 178 billion (about $160 million). Tourism and other industries suffered severe economic losses due to a drop in the number of visitors to the country. Figure 3.3 illustrates the timeline of the event. As an initial response, on 7 June, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) took several measures. It upgraded the alert level for communicable diseases, strengthened quarantine inspections at airports, traced everyone who had had contact with the first patient and isolated them, put a 24-hour response taskforce into operation, and reported regularly to WHO. Despite these initiatives, the lack of information, epidemiologic inspectors and facilities to detect MERS and isolate those affected hampered efforts to control its spread. Compounding this were overcrowded emergency rooms in hospitals and the Korean custom of visiting friends in hospital, which accelerated the spread of the disease. Other factors contributing to the outbreak were the delayed release of information about the disease and inefficient communication among government departments, local authorities and medical institutions. These factors also contributed to the widespread public fear about MERS. Based on comprehensive consultations with the National Assembly, health expert groups, WHO, the media and other stakeholders, in September 2015 the government introduced 48 reforms to enhance its capacity to prevent, detect and respond to emerging infectious disease threats and public health emergencies like MERS.

The targets set in NAMAs have varied substantially. For example, China pledged to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 40\u201345 per cent131 and India by 20\u201325 per cent by 2020 compared to 2005 levels. The Republic of Korea set a target to reduce emissions by 30 per cent below \u2018business as usual\u2019 levels by 2020. These pledges built on national efforts to develop climate change responses in the lead up to the Conference. These plans provided a foundation for deepening action on low-carbon and climate-resilient development. Developing countries built on their NAMAs and other climate-related planning efforts, including NAPAs, NAPs and Technology Needs Assessments, to develop Intended Nationally Determined Contributions of climate action in the lead up to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015. Fifty- one countries in the Asia-Pacific region submitted an NDC with a mitigation target.132 With the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on climate change, these now represent firm commitments. The nature of NDC development differed across countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In many cases, independent assessments suggested the potential for greater ambition in the future.133 Most countries focused on mitigation opportunities in energy and energy efficiency, such as in the Philippines, which has been transforming its", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2de5fcde-f19f-4ecc-be3a-6364a09aff85": {"__data__": {"id_": "2de5fcde-f19f-4ecc-be3a-6364a09aff85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47aaab2752c52df99ac930ac60905ba2d08a084de007000da77328dceb11ee41"}}, "hash": "47aaab2752c52df99ac930ac60905ba2d08a084de007000da77328dceb11ee41", "text": "energy sector by switching to clean and renewable energy (Box 3.11).

It not only revised its legislation, but also provided the funding needed to implement the new legislation. The result is a transformed health system, one that is far more resilient to disease outbreaks. For example: Dedicated divisions have been established in the KCDC, such as the Emergency Operations Center, to strengthen event-based surveillance, information collection, risk assessment and emergency operations. z Technical capacities with the potential for high public health impacts have been strengthened, including systems to maintain high levels of immunization coverage in the population, and to monitor and control outbreaks related to food safety. z National laboratory systems have been equipped with the capacity to test a wide range of pathogens from human, food and environmental samples. z Dedicated teams have been established for the mitigation, surveillance and risk assessment of antimicrobial resistance. z Public health emergency response systems and risk communication systems have been improved, especially those related to internal coordination and coordination with partners, as well as communication with affected communities.130 While MERS was a major shock, it was also a trigger that resulted in systemic changes. As a result, the Republic of Korea is now more alert to, and better prepared for, new and emerging diseases. The response to MERS was a full package of interventions, starting from creation of awareness to planning and putting system and institution in place and taking actions. This suggests that transformation requires a package of interventions and their effective implementation. This episode also served as a reminder that regional and international collaboration, and sharing medical measures and health experts, increases societies\u2019 resilience to public health emergencies. Box 3.10 Continued Source: Authors Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 46 Several countries have taken steps towards environmental sustainability through the efficient use of energy and by adopting clean energy solutions. In Indonesia, the lack of a pro-environment policy and business environment meant that companies producing tofu and tempeh, two foodstuffs made from soybeans, were inefficient. This not only reduced their profitability and productivity, but also led to environmental damage due to high emissions and wastes. To tackle this, the \u2018Soybean Processing\u2019 project was launched to reduce energy consumption and increase sustainable growth in the sector, for example by promoting the use of energy-efficient technologies. The project reduced emissions from all the companies involved by 83,200 tonnes per year and improving energy efficiency by 27 per cent. There were further environmental benefits, with a reduction in water pollutants and in water use, from 15 litres per 1 kilogram of soybeans processed.134 There were also health benefits, due to reduced levels of smoke from the production process. As a major rice-producing country, Cambodia generates large amounts of husks from rice processing. The rice sector also emits significant levels of carbon from the diesel used in its inefficient mills. The \u2018Waste to Energy in Rice Milling\u2019 project, implemented in 2012\u20132015, addressed these issues by introducing biomass as a fuel source to 150 rice millers. This reduced energy consumption by 65 per cent by replacing the diesel used in rice mills, which led to a cut in greenhouse gas emissions of 7,732 tonnes per year (a 12 per cent reduction). The project also reduced the amount of solid waste produced by 25 per cent, for example by encouraging the use of rice husk ash as a soil stabilizer. Further benefits included a rise in income for those working in the sector, which built their adaptive capacity.135 3.7 Conclusions and policy implications The four forms of resilience capacity outlined here are inter-related and serve the same end purpose: to make societies more resilient to shocks. However, they operate at different levels of change. Anticipatory capacity provides the information needed to prevent a risk or mitigate the impact of a shock.

Thus, as noted in Chapter 1, they can be seen as a continuum and, as The situation of vulnerable energy security, combined with rising oil prices and greater environmental awareness, led to a strong commitment to clean energy by the Government of the Philippines, which passed the Renewable Energy Act in 2008. This is considered to be the first comprehensive legislation on renewable energy in South-East Asia. The cornerstone policy instrument in this act was the feed-in tariff incentive scheme, which offers preferential rates for electricity sales for qualified renewable energy producers. This has been crucial in attracting private investment into the sector. Since deliberation began in June 2010, the Energy Regulatory Commission has adjusted rates to maintain an optimal balance between an acceptable rate of return for power producers and end-use pricing for consumers. Since the feed-in tariff incentive scheme was put in place in 2012, and thanks to the sharp decline in the cost of technologies such as solar and onshore wind, the Philippines has made significant progress in renewable energy deployment. Fuelled by growing domestic and overseas investments, the renewable energy industry has grown rapidly and transformed energy markets and business models.136 As of 2015, the Philippines had the world\u2019s second-largest geothermal power generation.137 Currently, some 30 per cent of electricity production is from renewable sources, which makes the Philippines one of the leaders in renewable electricity production in the region.138 Measures to facilitate private sector participation in the electricity sector, supported by the Philippines Energy Regulatory Commission, helped to create an environment that allowed renewable energy producers to play a growing role. The new National Renewable Energy Programme, launched in 2011, should lead to both diversification and further expansion of renewable energy contributions over the next two decades. To meet the growing demand, the programme aims to increase the installed capacity of renewable energy sources by 200 per cent from 2011 to 2030, which would represent an increase of nearly 10 gigawatts of capacity.

The policies and programmes outlined in this chapter identify some of the characteristics needed for individuals, organizations and societies to become resilient. These include awareness, diversity and integration. It is through awareness and information that people can expect a certain hazard to occur, and plan to manage and adapt to the risk. A person needs to be aware of their own capacity, which is defined by their environment (including human dynamics, natural systems, infrastructures and service provisions) and how they interact with this environment. Creating knowledge and raising awareness is an important component of most of resilience-building programmes, and is required at an early stage \u2013 before actions to increase adaptation or absorption capacities. Creating awareness requires an assessment of risks, which means identifying hazards and assessing how a society is exposed to a hazard, and the extent to which it is vulnerable. Disaggregated levels of information about concentrations of people and wealth, infrastructure and services, as well as other features, are necessary for enhancing resilience. Diversity refers to the different sources of capital, assets, infrastructure and services that an individual or society needs. For example, there is a need to diversify types of capitals and assets so that if one fails in the face of a shock, another comes to action. This also applies to provisioning systems: a variety of sources can make a society resilient. For example, if poor people cannot produce enough food, they can get it from public food distribution systems, such as those found in India,139 or through participating in workfare programmes. Having redundancy and reserves in a system can help it to operate smoothly during a crisis; for example, a backup supply of electricity from a generator in hospitals is essential when the main power supply fails. There is a need to move away from the \u2018silo\u2019 approach, where an individual government ministry works on only one aspect of resilience-building, and move towards greater integration. As an example, the project working with cotton farmers in Tajikistan (Box 3.3) comprised many components and activities, ranging from raising awareness, improving access to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc1b891b-1107-4ef5-8b9b-b21687278c2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc1b891b-1107-4ef5-8b9b-b21687278c2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "feb73802fe77d89409af4137119fa7483b0fa563fe5c8a176a20ab5bf2ff5f76"}}, "hash": "feb73802fe77d89409af4137119fa7483b0fa563fe5c8a176a20ab5bf2ff5f76", "text": "technology (e.g. solar dryers) and finance (e.g. micro-credit schemes), and introducing new skills and knowledge (e.g. about agro-biodiversity-friendly practices, crop diversification and financial management). This required support from several different departments and ministries in the government, and effective coordination and integration between these was essential to the project being successful. Integration includes the need to ensure meaningful and effective engagement with all stakeholders, not just policymakers but also the private sector. In conclusion, building the resilience of different groups in a society requires not just one policy, but a package of policies and interventions that reduce vulnerability as well as exposure to hazards. Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 50 4.1 Introduction The SDGs set out a vision for transformed societies that are prosperous, peaceful, meet the needs of all people, and protect the planet. There are many goals which the Asia- Pacific region is far from achieving, and a transformation in focus and approach will be needed if we are to attain them.140 Processes of transformation are often long term, however, requiring system-level changes. A sound understanding of opportunities, risks and challenges will be essential. Commitment to change, often reinforced by social momentum to support new ideas and actions, can help steer these efforts. Purposeful transformation to achieve the SDGs can be supported by a shared vision, and collective understanding of the avenues available for change in response to risks, opportunities or crises. This report has highlighted the changing nature of risk in the Asia-Pacific region, the impacts of shocks and stresses on human systems, and emerging efforts to build resilience capacities at multiple levels. The most vulnerable people in society are disproportionately affected when risks materialize. All four resilience capacities discussed in this report \u2013 absorptive, anticipatory, adaptive and transformative \u2013 are essential to deal with increasingly complex risks. Strategies for building capacity to support transformation are among the least understood, however. This concluding chapter builds on the insights presented in Chapter 3 to identify strategies to help build capacity for transformation. It suggests areas in which regional and subregional cooperation can support transformation through strengthened resilience. 4.2 Barriers to transformation A legacy of past decisions, built infrastructure, knowledge systems and cultural norms, among other factors, define a set way of doing things. Breaking through this \u2018path dependency\u2019 means addressing some major barriers. The following discussion highlights some of the major barriers. Human and institutional capacity Human and institutional capacity can constrain options for, and participation in, societal transformations that may be initiated by government policy, but sustained and disseminated by the private sector, by households, by institutions and by other actors in society. Constraints may include insufficient investment in addressing vital knowledge gaps at the institutional, community, stakeholder-group or individual level. They may also arise from limited financing to sustain critical functions. Social and cultural issues can also have a significant influence. Indeed, inequality in access to information has been found to be correlated with income inequality.141 Institutional rigidity Institutional rigidity can be a key challenge in responding to new shocks and building resilience. Rigidity \u2013 the lack of openness to, or mechanisms for, change in institutions with specific functions in a policy cycle \u2013 can block opportunities for rethinking development pathways and the delivery of public goods. For example, the report commissioned by the President of the United Nations General Assembly142 in the wake of the international financial crisis highlighted institutional rigidity as a significant issue in failing to prevent that crisis and slowing response efforts. The report identified the need for deeper reflection on basic assumptions about the most appropriate options for the future. Where institutions lack established processes for evolution, the gap between the services needed by a society and the services that are provided can increase. Institutions often reflect the society in which they operate, and so several factors can influence institutional rigidity, including socio- cultural beliefs, gender and other dimensions of inequality, and imbalances in access to decision-making. Chapter 1 noted that where there is strong adaptive capacity, there is often a trade-off with transformative capacity. The capacity of institutions to identify and implement short- term, adaptive measures can also reduce incentives for the deeper thinking and institutional reforms needed to drive transformation. Inadequate momentum for change The need for broad-based support for a new vision for development, informed by the SDGs, was raised earlier in this chapter. The process of establishing a national \u2018vision\u2019 has long been an important feature of national development planning efforts in countries across the Asia-Pacific region. In many cases, however, the transformation needed for these visions to be realized", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9397f50d-0eaa-4a1f-81ac-95cfbdd1dccb": {"__data__": {"id_": "9397f50d-0eaa-4a1f-81ac-95cfbdd1dccb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8eb25b667fcf197dcde2af10a8fac51f15a0a8c6d455613fb2ce8543a7315528"}}, "hash": "8eb25b667fcf197dcde2af10a8fac51f15a0a8c6d455613fb2ce8543a7315528", "text": "has remained out of reach. One factor may be inadequate engagement of stakeholders in bringing about change, including citizens and the private \u201cWe are determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world on to a sustainable and resilient path.\u201d \u2013 The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 51 Enabling transformations towards sustainable and resilient societies sector. Governance approaches and policy incentives that can bring the key elements of society together around a shared vision can support transformation processes. 4.3 Strategies for transformation Strategies for transformation towards resilient and sustainable societies must address these barriers. They can be informed by the resilience principles introduced in Chapter 1: maintain diversity and redundancy; manage connectivity; manage \u2018slow\u2019 variables (such as ageing) and feedbacks; foster complex adaptive systems thinking; encourage learning; broaden participation; and promote polycentric governance systems. This chapter highlights four strategies that can support transformation: (1) transformative learning; (2) deeper social engagement; (3) social enterprises and effective partnerships; and (4) diversifying financing and investment. Transformative learning As the preceding chapters have stressed, resilience approaches emphasize learning as a way to better understand and anticipate threats and opportunities. This needs to include learning about the impacts of past policies, the realities of the policy environment, changing risk profiles, and the perspectives of people most vulnerable to these risks. However, examples of public institutions that are committed to and equipped for transformative learning are not easily identified. This is explained in part by the persistence of long-standing challenges such as corruption and inequality. Three factors can support transformative learning. The first is the creation of explicit learning processes as part of the policy cycle, especially during phases in which problems are framed and strategic goals are set.143 These may be linked to more informal opportunities for dialogue with stakeholders and learning. Methods and mechanisms that enable transformative institutional learning provide opportunities to reassess the underlying values, beliefs and views that have underpinned previous approaches to policy, and to take stock of changes in the wider context.144 Foresight institutions have the role of looking beyond the short term to highlight dangers, alternatives and choices; raise awareness; contribute to more diverse public dialogue and better-informed decision-making; and support institutional evolution.145 Several governments in the Asia- Pacific region have established offices of strategic foresight that are beginning to take on such challenges. A second factor is the use of analytical methods that can deal with complexity and support a better understanding of causal and systemic issues. Such methods integrate information from different disciplines (e.g. environmental sciences and economics) and different stakeholder perspectives. Analysis of the interactions between different human systems is critical for defining solutions that cross the lines of sectoral and institutional responsibilities, enabling a coherent response. Processes, methods and institutional mandates for collective problem-framing, addressing dissent and controversy, dealing with uncertainty, peer review and more transparent metrics for evaluation can support these efforts.146 Specialized methods for learning and analysis that engage people are especially needed where there is social conflict.147 Third, better understanding and awareness of risk required to support transformative learning requires better access to data. Having information and data about potential risks and impacts before a shock occurs is particularly important, so that a society can take measures to prevent or mitigate the impacts of potential shocks. Chapter 2 provided some examples of efforts to invest in data to support such anticipatory capacity by identifying hazards and assessing exposures and vulnerabilities. While a disaster can hit a whole society, its impact will often be felt by individuals, which requires even more disaggregated data about risks, and individual assets and capacities to cope with these risks. Deeper social engagement Broad-based stakeholder support for change can play a vital role in enabling transformation. Harnessing or shaping shared values and providing the right incentives can enable the propagation of ideas and technologies, and diversify and expand access to information, financing and other resources. For example, in the Republic of Korea, national support for a shared change agenda shaped by citizens, the private sector and government supported efforts to rebound from the 1997 financial crisis, as discussed in Chapter 2.148 Social mobilization is another critical step, for example in efforts to support recovery from conflicts and disasters. It can enable people to understand their new situations, and to organize and initiate action for their recovery, exercising initiative and creativity.149 In practice, this can be supported by governance approaches and institutional mandates that bring different groups of stakeholders together to act. Effective processes for social mobilization involve participatory approaches that engage civil society in constructive dialogue and public participation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fa2bfce-b748-401c-ad0a-12830897325d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fa2bfce-b748-401c-ad0a-12830897325d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/transformation-towards-sustainable-and-resilient-societies-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b5a3c441a1248d546c646b5cf8ced3b7274aa34e5fcafb43b90bdb727c476a0"}}, "hash": "8b5a3c441a1248d546c646b5cf8ced3b7274aa34e5fcafb43b90bdb727c476a0", "text": "Change often requires a degree of creative conflict, as there will Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific 52 inevitably be opposing views and entrenched positions. Governments need to become more adept at balancing diverse perspectives. Balancing the interests of different stakeholders to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected is critical. Although many governments have expressed a commitment to better involve stakeholders in efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda, legislative changes and, in some cases, extra-judiciary actions have constrained the space for social dialogue in several countries. Strengthened legal mandates for civic participation, robust civic education, an active and effective media, and measures to build trust between stakeholders are among the foundations for effective public participation strategies.150 Social enterprise Social enterprises use commercial strategies to provide socially supportive services that respond to a specific need. They have the potential to connect poverty alleviation, sustainability and resilience-strengthening objectives with economic objectives in ways that can transform communities. Social enterprises can provide locally relevant solutions to development challenges, be they technology driven,151 focused on adapting learning to cultural contexts,152 or reliant on the \u2018activation\u2019 of groups of people that may have been previously overlooked as sources of innovation.153 In the Asia-Pacific region, many social enterprises are found in the agricultural sector154 \u2013 a sector which plays a critical role in food systems and thus strongly influences development outcomes across several SDGs. Some types of social enterprise hold particular potential to enable local- level transformations (see Box 4.1). Social enterprise is being actively promoted in countries such as the Philippines and the Republic of Korea. For example, the comprehensive and sustained social enterprise strategies adopted by the Seoul Metropolitan government have created awareness about the social economy, supported intermediary organizations and developed a market for social enterprise products.155 Partnerships often help social enterprises scale up their reach and impacts. Whether involving the private sector156 or governments,157 they multiply and diversify the ways in which resources can be accessed and mobilized. The transformative potential of social enterprises built on effective partnerships is highlighted by examples in which actors have been brought together to increase the value added across the agricultural supply chain (e.g. through fair-trade certification) and have played an important role in improving development outcomes for households, communities and entire sectors, as shown by a benchmark analysis on agricultural value chains158 conducted in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. By contrast, limiting the roles of farmers and farming communities to being merely suppliers of goods reduces opportunities for transforming livelihoods and communities.159 Diversifying finance and investment Each of the shocks discussed in Chapter 2 highlighted the diversity of ways in which financing is essential \u2013 though not sufficient \u2013 for building more sustainable and resilient societies. A growing range of risks, particularly from climate change and disasters, threaten the viability of core development investments, such as infrastructure and social services. Increased resilience and strengthened transformative capacity both require fiscal systems to be flexible when the worst happens. Responses can take diverse forms: they can, among others, provide emergency funds to conduct relief efforts and undertake repairs after disasters; harness climate finance; or mitigate the effects of budget deficits, particularly to safeguard spending on vital public and social services. Research covering Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines has defined a specific type of social enterprise: the \u2018Social Enterprise with the Poor as Primary Stakeholders\u2019, which strengthens resilience while also responding to poverty, inequality and wider social challenges. These enterprises have three common characteristics: 1. They explicitly pursue a social mission, such as poverty reduction or alleviation, as their primary objective. 2. They create wealth with due regard to social and environmental costs. 3. They have a distributive enterprise philosophy, meaning that unlike typical businesses, much of the wealth they create is distributed in ways that directly benefit poor people as their primary stakeholders, rather than accumulated by a few. Source: Dacanay, 2012 Box 4.1 Social enterprises with poor people as the primary stakeholders 53 Enabling transformations towards sustainable and resilient societies International financial institutions play an important role in helping countries to find the fiscal space to cope with this diversity of risks. In addition to fiscal flexibility, innovative mechanisms that ensure that access to finance is inclusive and provided through effective channels are needed. Developing these mechanisms depends on the convergence of multiple factors, discussed previously in this chapter, including information, technology, governance, policies, regulations and human capacities.160 Partnerships around information and communications technology can open new paths to financial inclusion, building essential resilience and creating the conditions for potentially wider social transformations.

For example, countercyclical financing162 can be used to help cushion or mitigate the impacts of economic shocks on a country. Efforts to build and deepen insurance markets in the Asia-Pacific region, where access to affordable and effective insurance is often quite limited, is another important tool. Indeed, there is growing interest in the potential to design and deploy micro-insurance to better support communities and households to cope with the effects of shocks and stresses. Such measures to invest in risk reduction and prevention can help reduce the amount of emergency financing needed to support recovery efforts. Continued \u2013 and greater \u2013 efforts to factor emerging risks into investment design and choices are needed. Many financing institutions are increasingly aware of such risk and are beginning to adopt tools and practices that help them assess these issues, though much remains to be done. 4.4 In conclusion This report has highlighted opportunities to strengthen public policy to support transformation towards resilient and sustainable societies, and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, by investing in resilience capacities. It shows how capacity-building and institutional interventions \u2013 from the household level through the community level to the national level \u2013 can increase resilience. It underlines that the likelihood of achieving some of the most urgent transformations advocated by the 2030 Agenda can be increased by better understanding the context of risk and focusing on resilience-building. It has stressed opportunities to support transformations that can support more resilient development, including through a focus on learning, deeper stakeholder engagement, innovative partnerships and financing for resilience. Considering the commonalities in the risk profiles of countries across the Asia-Pacific region, there is significant scope for regional action, including to support learning. There is a need for a greater regional focus on capacity- building and institution-building to strengthen governance. The Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development is just one forum in which emerging risks can be discussed and collective responses can be developed. Stronger partnerships and greater collaboration between countries need to go beyond these types of interventions, however. There is also a need for a continued focus on investments in individual resilience capacities, especially in the context of delivering on the Agenda 2030 pledge that no one is left behind. Efforts to eradicate poverty and reforms to address the structural aspects that create marginalization and vulnerability in society all contribute to empowerment and agency.163 Investments in strengthening social protection systems can also play a critical role in strengthening individual and society-level resilience. The findings of this report, prepared to support regional dialogue on the theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on sustainable development, are also highly relevant to efforts to empower people to support progress towards the SDGs and promote equality. They offer insights that may also inform regional dialogue on the 2019 High-level Political Forum theme of \u2018Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality\u2019.

This is a simplified version of the concept of social\u2013ecological systems used in the literature, acknowledging that the interaction between society and the environment is mediated and guided by institutions and governance arrangements. 4 Hendrix and Brinkman, 2013. 5 Institute for Societal Resilience, n.d. 6 Adapted from Rockefeller Foundation, n.d. 7 For a definition of hazards, exposure and vulnerability, see Cardona and others, 2012. 8 Adapted from ADB, 2017. 9 Redundancy refers to the presence of multiple components that can perform the same function, thereby allowing for backup options or insurance within systems. 10 Variables that change slowly often determine the properties of a system. Once these variables cross certain thresholds, they can affect the functioning of the system as a whole; hence the need to manage slow variables. 11 Biggs and others, 2015. Governance systems refer to the norms and rules governing human interactions, including how actors and institutions interact, coordinate and work to make and enforce rules. 12 B\u00e9n\u00e9 and others, 2012. 13 B\u00e9n\u00e9 and others, 2012; Tanner and others, 2017. 14 Jeasakul and others, 2014. 15 Bahadur and others, 2015. 16 In preparation for the fifth session of the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, ESCAP, ADB and UNDP facilitated five multi-stakeholder subregional discussions in 2017, during which the three-step analytical framework was applied and found useful in guiding the deliberations. These events were held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, 27\u201328 September; Beijing, China, 10\u201311 October; Bangkok, Thailand, 18\u201319 October; Apia, Samoa, 1\u20132 November; and Kathmandu, Nepal, 1\u20132 November. They were attended by government officials, civil society, academia and representatives from business sectors. 17 ADB, 2017. 18 The vulnerability of food systems to climate change incorporates aspects such as projected changes in crop yields, demographic changes (e.g. projected population trends) and sensitivity factors (i.e. countries\u2019 dependency on food imports). For full details of all six components of the vulnerability index of food systems, see ND-GAIN, 2016. 19 Porkka and others, 2013. 20 Kharrazi, 2018. 21 One of the potential driving factors of this phenomenon in the region is Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). The Asia-Pacific region has been a major contributor to the growth of PTAs; 167 of existing PTAs \u2013 63 per cent of the global total \u2013 were established here.

ESCAP analyses show that there is a close association between the proliferation of PTAs and a reduction in the resilience of food trade networks. 22 Presutti, 1992. 23 In this study, redundancy, which measures the degree of freedom or diversity of pathways within any network, was used as a measure of resilience. 24 Compton and others, 2010. 25 ADB, 2017.

This database records hazard events as disasters if the event leads to 10 or more deaths; 100 or more people affected, injured or made homeless; a declaration by a country of a state of emergency; or an appeal for international assistance. Geophysical disasters refer to hazards originating from solid earth, such as earthquakes and volcanic activities. Meteorological disasters are caused by short-lived extreme weather and atmospheric conditions, including heat waves, severe winters and storms. Climatological disasters are caused by long-lived atmospheric conditions such as droughts and wildfires. Hydrological disasters are caused by water occurrence and movements, such as floods and landslides. 63 Endnotes 31 OCHA, 2017. 32 OCHA, 2017. More recent data from EM-DAT suggests that the total figures for mortality and the number of people affected may have been lower, but definitive data are not yet available. 33 Aon Benfield, 2017.

This has sparked concerns about maintaining pension systems over the long term, for example, in the Philippines and the Republic of Korea.70 Worldwide, more than half of total public pension expenditure, amounting to 3 percent of global GDP, is allocated to income security for older persons.71 In 2010 to 2011, public non- health social protection expenditure for older people was highest in Western Europe at 11 percent of GDP, and lowest in Africa at 1 percent.

It is therefore important to increase public investment in education from early childhood development programmes all the way to higher education. It is proposed that the adequate expenditure on education in early childhood development would particularly contribute to the provision of good quality education.16 However, many of developing countries in Asia have on the whole allocated 1-4 per cent of GDP to education (Table 1). As a comparison, the global or OECD average percentage rate of public education expenditure is\ufffd5.0\ufffdper\ufffdcent\ufffdof\ufffdGDP.\ufffdIn\ufffdorder\ufffdto\ufffdmeet\ufffdSDG 4: achieve universal access to quality primary and secondary education alone, 69 million teachers would be required globally, of which South Asia would\ufffdneed\ufffdto\ufffdaccount\ufffdfor\ufffd15\ufffdmillion\ufffdteachers\ufffd (mostly in secondary education) while Southeast Asia would need to account for 1 million teachers.17 The region\u2019s investment in the health sector is also low.

Public investment in increasing the number of doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals is essential for improving human development, creating decent and sustainable jobs, and thus contributing to sustainable development and economic growth. Governments could allocate more public investment in basic services such as medical and health care and care of the elderly and people with disabilities as well as education, which would help increase human development as well as create a greater number of decent employment opportunities in the related services sector. 16 For example, Heckman and Masterov (2007) argue from a case of the United States, that the return of investment in enriched pre-school facilities for children from disadvantaged households is very high, reduce school repetition, increasing productivity and reducing crime rates among others. 17 UNESCO, 2016. 18 UNDP, 2016.

SDG 13.1 calls for strengthening \u201cresilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.\u201d SDG 13a proposes to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 for the Green Climate Fund to support developing countries to adopt meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation. To make climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning programs more\ufffdmeaningful\ufffdand\ufffdeffective,\ufffdgender-sensitive\ufffd analysis of current practices is essential. As we discuss later, women\u2019s gender roles of collecting water and fuel, such as wood, make them dependent on climate-vulnerable natural resources. Natural disasters such as droughts result in women walking for longer distances, increasing their amounts of physical labor, exposing\ufffdthem\ufffdto\ufffdnegative\ufffdhealth\ufffdeffects,\ufffdand\ufffd increasing risks to their safety.19 Despite low rates of land and asset ownership, women make considerable contributions to livelihoods, family well-being, natural resource management, biodiversity conservation, health, and food security. Case studies from India and Nepal show that women are the primary managers of agricultural biodiversity, and in some cases, custodians and users of traditional knowledge. This includes knowledge around climate resilience, which is of critical importance for agricultural adaptation to climate change.20 While men start growing cash crops and rely on seed commercialization, women grow a variety of crops for household food security. Climate change, therefore, alters cropping and weather patterns, which may increase women\u2019s burden as food producers and providers. In addition, their knowledge of and roles in the household and communal experiences would add value to adaptation and mitigation policies, and programmes geared towards sustainable development.21 Therefore, greater women\u2019s participation in decision-making processes and more respect of their rights are essential to reduce women\u2019s and their communities\u2019 vulnerability to climate risks. For example, in many parts of the region, women are not allowed to leave the home without the permission from a man, such as a father and husband. More women and girls than men and boys are illiterate and have less access to training about early warning systems or survival skills in the case of disasters. These gender norms, biases, and inequalities make women and girls more exposed to and vulnerable to climate change-induced disasters, particularly floods.\ufffdStudies\ufffdhave\ufffdfound\ufffdthat\ufffdwomen\ufffdand\ufffd children are 14 times more likely to die than men during disasters.22 Women earning their own income and having a better bargaining power at home may help women and girls to make their own decision for survival in the case of disasters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "078b8baa-b1de-4dd8-a3af-50a53ca33284": {"__data__": {"id_": "078b8baa-b1de-4dd8-a3af-50a53ca33284", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/now-time-reduce-and-redistribute-unpaid-domestic-and-care-work-burden-women-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Now is the Time!

It can also be a combination of various unpaid domestic and care work. For example, a mother cooking a dinner while watching her children to do homework. Or, it can be a combination of leisure and unpaid domestic and care work, such as one is watching TV while folding or ironing clothes. In the time use survey, there is a way to capture these simultaneous activities and categorize them accordingly. However, it is not always easy to understand the quality of work and responsibilities attached to the activity. For example, \u2018sleeping\u2019 is a considerable amount of time people spend under the personal activity \u2018self-care and maintenance,\u2019 assuming that sleeping means resting. But the parent or household care giver is always \u2018on-call\u2019 when s/ he is sleeping (thus, not resting). In the case of an emergency, such as a household member falling sick in the middle of the night, the care giver will get up to take care of the sick household member and perhaps sleeps aside the sick person to monitor the condition. So even during sleeping hours, some are performing unpaid care work. Services and goods can replace much of unpaid work, often for better quality If one performs the activities such as food preparation, cleaning, child care etc. external to the household or not for family members (the work category (1) above), the work is paid and counted in the GDP. Some may say, one cooks for the family for love, not for salary or money. However, the household members take care of each other at home without remuneration for various reasons. It can be personal incentives or moral obligation. Or, some have no other options; for example, they are too poor to purchase the services that can replace unpaid work. Nations already provide services that meet basic human needs such as primary education and medical care, but more can be done towards the achievement of sustainable development. And often, public and private services provided by professionals in education or in the care of the sick, elderly, and people with\ufffddisabilities,\ufffdoffer\ufffdbetter\ufffdquality\ufffdthan\ufffd services provided at home. Moreover, public investment for better access to irrigation, water purification,\ufffdelectricity,\ufffdand\ufffdmodern\ufffdenergy\ufffd for cooking or heating can reduce time spent on unpaid work and improve people\u2019s health outcome. If people are the real wealth of nation (UNDP, 2016), nations need to make sure such services are available to all households at free of charge\ufffdor\ufffdat\ufffdaffordable\ufffdprice. NOW IS THE TIME! 11 Everybody has the same 24 hours; but how one uses her or his time is not all up to the individual. Those who don\u2019t have the power and choice to determine how they spend their time \u2013 such as women, girls and the poor \u2013 take up most of the unpaid work. All work \u2013 whether paid or unpaid \u2013 is important work. But some work is not recognized or is stigmatized because it is done at home \u2013 in the private sphere \u2013 and because it does not generate income or revenue. Rather, unpaid domestic and care work often provides savings for the households and nations by providing the services that should be, otherwise, widely available with public support or purchased. When nations take unpaid domestic and care work for granted or are blind to the important contribution that unpaid domestic and care work makes in society, they may not provide or delay\ufffdfinancial\ufffdinvestment\ufffdin\ufffdbasic\ufffdsocial\ufffdservices\ufffd and infrastructure.

Since the surveying years, age groups, and survey methods vary, it is not wise to compare the time spent on each activity across the countries. However, commonalities across the countries include the fact that women on the whole spend more time than men in unpaid domestic and care work, and when paid and unpaid work is combined, women work longer hours than men each day in all countries \u2013 except New Zealand where women and men work for same hours.

Educational attainment has a mixed impact on women\u2019s time spent on unpaid domestic and care work If higher educational attainment were to help empower women and girls, the time spent on unpaid domestic and care work may reduce as their educational attainment becomes higher. They may challenge gender norms and inequalities in the household and society. They tend to share the unpaid work burden with male members of the household. Higher educational attainment may lead to higher-paid jobs, leading to a great amount of disposable income that can be used to purchase time-saving appliances or market services to replace some of the unpaid work. However, the analysis from Asian countries shows a mixed result. \u2022 An analysis of married couples in China in 2008 found that educated women spent less time on household work and more on labour market work. The opportunity cost of not working, that is foregone earnings, could be higher among educated women. Therefore, educated women might have an economic incentive to increase their time on labour market work.

NOW IS THE TIME! 19 \u2022 Bangladeshi women with greater levels of education are likely to participate more in unpaid work, especially those who have completed secondary schooling, matriculation, or higher education. This could be because they spend more time teaching children.30 \u2022 In Nepal, those who are literate spent a higher amount of their working hours fetching water than those who are illiterate (1.9\ufffdper\ufffdcent\ufffdvs.\ufffd1.5\ufffdper\ufffdcent).\ufffdHowever,\ufffd literate\ufffdindividuals\ufffdspent\ufffdless\ufffdon\ufffdfirewood\ufffd collection\ufffdthan\ufffdthose\ufffdwho\ufffdare\ufffdilliterate\ufffd(5.7\ufffd per cent vs. 9.0 per cent). \u2022 Educated Thai men and women tend to have longer market work hours and less time for leisure, social, religious, and civic engagement in comparison to those with less education.

Ensuring good social infrastructure and basic services matters Generally speaking, having access to safe drinking water, electricity, and gas for cooking and heating or having time saving assets such as cooking stove is likely to reduce time spent on unpaid work for collecting water and fuelwood. However, in Asia there are cases that people use fuelwood for cooking even in the villages where gas or electricity is available.31 \u2022 In Bangladesh and Pakistan, rural populations are likely to have poorer infrastructure and relatively basic services.

Many women work full-time but the unpaid domestic and care work responsibility still remains with the As a result, when women get paid jobs, it is women, not men, who carry the double burden of unpaid a paid work. Women who wish to avoid the double burden (and if they can afford to do so) choose not to ta paid work or work part-time to balance this with their household responsibilities. Women\u2019s limit participation in the labour market in turn results in both women\u2019s lower wages relative to men and low sh of managerial and decision-making posts in both economic and political spheres. As for girls and young women, a review of infrastructure projects by Brown (2015) found that improv access to water supplies in six states in India and in Punjab of Pakistan helped save time for women and g and increased the attendance of girls at school. In Japan and New Zealand, girls and young wom participate in the same levels of education and trainings as boys and young men but on average study ho for girls and young women is lower than boys and young men.35 Similar trends were observed in Banglade and Pakistan.36 \u00a8 Figure 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87f7c18f-8672-4a2d-bc61-484ecfd7d518": {"__data__": {"id_": "87f7c18f-8672-4a2d-bc61-484ecfd7d518", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/now-time-reduce-and-redistribute-unpaid-domestic-and-care-work-burden-women-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Now is the Time!

(2017a, 2017b) 24 NOW IS THE TIME Valuing unpaid domestic and care work Several studies have assigned a monetary value to unpaid domestic and care work. Otherwise, the important contribution that unpaid domestic and care work makes to welfare goes unnoticed in conventional economic discussions and undervalues a country\u2019s welfare.37 Since women perform most of the unpaid domestic and care work, women should get a fair share of the\ufffdbenefits\ufffdgenerated\ufffdfrom\ufffdnational\ufffdgrowth.\ufffd For example, in current pension systems that are conducted on a contribution-basis, higher income earners receive higher amounts of pension.\ufffdSince\ufffda\ufffdsignificant\ufffdshare\ufffdof\ufffdwomen\u2019s\ufffd contribution to the economy and society is unpaid, women with no or low income are unlikely to contribute to the pension system well. This makes them more vulnerable to poverty when they get older. The monetary valuation of unpaid work helps to raise public awareness of women\u2019s contribution to the economy and lead to a greater recognition of their need for support from wider society.38 There are various methods of estimating the value of unpaid work. 1) The output approach assigns a value to the output produced by unpaid work by multiplying the quantity of the output by the price of a corresponding good produced in the market. 2) The input approach calculates the value of the output produced by unpaid work by focusing solely on the value of labour inputs, corresponding to wage rates. The input approach may involve either an opportunity cost method or a replacement cost method. 2.1) The opportunity cost method sets the value of unpaid work as equal Reducing unpaid domestic and care work burdens are good for women and the economy to the income that the person who performs the unpaid work could have earned in the labour market if s/he had performed paid work rather than unpaid work. In this method, often the average wage for all people or all people of a particular sex in the economy, instead of the actual or predicted wage of the person who performed the unpaid work, will be used. One problem with this method is that value of unpaid work would vary by who performed the work. As women\u2019s average wage of women is usually lower than men\u2019s, unpaid domestic and care work tends to be undervalued. 2.2) The replacement cost method calculates the value of unpaid work by computing what it would cost to hire someone to do it. This method can be divided further by distinguishing between generalist and specialist approaches.

Nowadays, households use washing machines at home, pay to use a laundromat, or opt for dry cleaning. The time spent on unpaid washing activities is therefore reduced dramatically while jobs will be created, say in the manufacturer of washing machines or in laundromat business. The same holds for cooking, cleaning and other household chores.

Safe drinking water Irrigation for piped water, community wells, or\ufffdinstalling\ufffdwater\ufffdpurification\ufffdsystems\ufffdin\ufffd communities would reduce women\u2019s time for fetching water. Since water is needed not only for cooking but also for bathing, washing dishes and clothes, and feeding animals, women need to make frequent trips to boreholes, rivers, ponds, or wells, and carry heavy water, which can lead to physical ailments.

To make this happen however, working conditions for the care workers have to be improved by increasing salaries and reducing working hours. Nearly 60 per cent of kindergarten teachers and a quarter of long-term care workers perceived their wages as too low. In addition, women\u2019s unpaid domestic and care work responsibility is also a factor for leaving the workplace. About one-third of long-term care workers have left their workplace in the past due to marriage, child-birth or child-rearing, and 13 per cent of them did so because of their needs to take care of their own family members who are senior citizens or ill.57 Redistributing unpaid domestic and care work National accounts such as GDP capture the production and sales of commodities and the provision of various services at the market prices. Labour force (labour power) is an important input for producing more value in the process of production or provision of services. Unlike other production materials that are produced and traded in the market, labour power is \u2018produced\u2019 and \u2018reproduced\u2019 in the households outside of the market. Labour, like any other commodities, is traded in the market, based on the demand and supply, according to the conventional economics model. Businesses negotiate the selling price of the goods based on the costs of\ufffdproduction\ufffdplus\ufffdprofits.\ufffdOn\ufffda\ufffdsimilar\ufffdnote,\ufffd do households negotiate for the salary of the household members based on how much they invested in rearing the child? Often, households, businesses and the government don\u2019t question about\ufffdthe\ufffdamount\ufffdof\ufffdboth\ufffdfinancial\ufffdand\ufffdtime\ufffd investment made for taking care of a household member. In reality, households provide materials in the form of purchasing food and clothes, educational services as well as time to nurture and raise a child. When child rearing provides the equivalent or more returns to the households, then\ufffdthe\ufffdinvestment\ufffdmay\ufffdpay\ufffdoff.\ufffdBut\ufffdchildren\ufffd may leave the household and may not provide anything in return. However, child rearing provides returns to a society as a whole, as each individual contributes to the economy and society as a worker and by paying taxes, contributing to social security funds, raising the next generations and so on. It is also true that children cannot choose the parents. So why do nations not pay for the kids?58 Through public support in child care, education and health care among others, we need to ensure that children born in the low-income households have the same opportunities as other children who come from relatively wealthy family. The economic contribution of domestic and care work is out of the SNA production boundary 30 NOW IS THE TIME as described above. However, that should not mean that it is out of the government\u2019s economic interests and polices. The public sector should support those who spent years rearing children unpaid or senior citizens who contributed to the economy and society for decades in order to avoid free-ride on unpaid care workers. Without public support \u2013 in both\ufffdfinancial\ufffdand\ufffdin-kind\ufffdsupport,\ufffdhousehold\ufffd members with children, senior citizens, or family members with disabilities or long-term illness tend to fall in income and time poverty trap. Therefore, it is important for governments to make sure that there are adequate care facilities and services available to all. The private sector should also be held responsible for reducing and redistributing women\u2019s unpaid domestic and care work burden, by providing paternal leave to men.

It also discourages the sharing of unpaid domestic and care work within the household, as well as between the households and the government. Tax breaks should be given to individuals regardless of their marital status, based on the low-level of their income. - Review and redesign the pension system in a holistic manner, through valuing unpaid domestic and care work. Or, provide stipends to those who are homemakers through social transfers, which will be counted and contributed to the pension system (see Box 1). Many countries are already guaranteeing the basic income for women during maternity leave through taxes. The proposed system is an extension of such existing mechanisms. For example, provision of care for new born babies at public or private day care systems is costlier than that of toddlers. Extending the length of parental leaves, particularly extending paternal leave, could require less investment than increasing the number of day care facilities and teachers for 0-1 years old. - SDG 17.1 states the need of strengthening domestic resource mobilization and improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection.

We congratulate all teams on the exciting, positive results they achieved. We thank the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for its generous, continued support to P4P in Phase I and Phase II. We would like to acknowledge the P4P Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and the Steering Committee, whose inputs and support throughout have helped make P4P a success. We would like to thank the report reviewers and editors: Melissa Alvarado; Ingrid Fitzgerald; Koh Miyaoi; Sophie Namy; Richard Pierce; Pragya Singh and Michiyo Yamada. We hope that the positive results of this project will be nurtured and will grow further so that women and girls are able to fully enjoy their right to live free from violence and so that healthy, non-violent and equitable ways of being men and boys are the most common and accepted forms of masculinities. P4P has demonstrated that such a future is possible and the lessons shared here can assist teams in taking up this important work. 2 Contents ACRONYMS & ABBREVIATIONS 6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 7 PARTNERS FOR PREVENTION KNOWLEDGE PRODUCT SUMMARY 10 REGIONAL KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTS 11 COUNTRY PRODUCTS 11 Bangladesh 11 Cambodia 11 Indonesia 12 Papua New Guinea 12 Viet Nam 13 INTRODUCTION 14 PARTNERS FOR PREVENTION 15 WHAT IS PRIMARY PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS? 16 WHY PRIORITISE PRIMARY PREVENTION? 16 WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTIVE AND PROMISING PRIMARY PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS? 18 WHAT ARE THE CORE COMPONENTS OF PRIMARY PREVENTION PROGRAMMING? 19 WHAT ARE THE AIMS OF THIS REPORT? 19 SUMMARY OF THE P4P II PROJECTS 20 Bangladesh 20 HOW DID WE GENERATE LESSONS LEARNED? 20 Cambodia 21 Indonesia 21 Papua New Guinea 21 Viet Nam 21 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS 22 THEME 1: UNDERSTANDING PRIMARY PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS 23 Lesson #1: At the outset, most stakeholders and implementers had a very limited understanding of primary prevention of Violence Against Women and Girls. 23 Lesson #2: Organizations and teams that have already carried out successful programmes on Violence Against Women and Girls still need additional capacity building to effectively plan and implement new primary prevention projects. 24 THEME 2: INTERVENTION DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND ADAPTATION 24 Lesson #3: Building on existing, data-based, theoretical models, and rigorously evaluated and effective or promising intervention methods is ethical and efficient. 25 Lesson #4: Development of interventions demand sustained and active engagement from stakeholders and technical advisors. 26 4 Lesson #5: Balance fidelity to evidence-based models with necessary modifications for the local context. 27 Lesson #6: Adaptation to the local context is not about verbatim translation, but must be an active process to ensure meaning and accessibility in the new language without compromising fidelity to the core material. 28 Lesson #7: A multiple session intervention implemented over the course of a year is necessary to support transformation. Challenge the misconception that programmes should be shorter. 29 Lesson #8: Building gender-equitable attitudes is a complex process, but it is possible with adequate investment. 29 Lesson #9: Integrating volunteerism shows encouraging results, although more research is needed to identify how to promote it effectively and how to understand the role that it plays. 30 THEME 3: IMPLEMENTATION 30 Lesson #10: Recruiting participants takes time and community members often have concerns in the early stages of the intervention that can slow implementation and that can affect evaluation. 30 Lesson #11: Engaging men and boys is feasible, but challenging. 32 Lesson #12: Initial implementation piloting requires dedicated staff to address logistical and technical issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89023890-1423-4c20-86a6-b8efc15330f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "89023890-1423-4c20-86a6-b8efc15330f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "P4P Lessons Learned about Primary Prevention of VAWG in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "597d4cf3600f21f3e9add63f80f865f874e7ff82a90d68d9a6cf81b2e3b78034"}, "2": {"node_id": "97fc44bb-1df1-494d-b503-e90fc117a062", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d97d017d09247045dfdb9e3a59f1d07d3f26e8bbe08ae98a818c8b014ed14d5"}}, "hash": "f9731d229f9bf56d7718ad82068e47916b2a73123804c79ee62208397ffda0c4", "text": "33 Lesson #13: Facilitators are essential to success, yet have a lot of capacity strengthening and support needs. They need to go through transformation themselves, similar to what the intervention aims to achieve among participants. 33 Lesson #14: Participatory learning methodologies are a new approach for project staff at UN agencies, for implementing partners, for intervention facilitators and for community members. Although project stakeholders found this methodology challenging at first, they eventually found it very useful. 35 Lesson #15: Emotional expression, including acknowledging and voicing emotions, or addressing emotional needs, is new for most people, including project staff, facilitators and participants, so it was more challenging to complete the activities focused on this.

This report describes the lessons learned throughout this programme, to give insight into successful strategies and challenges, with practical recommendations for prevention programming. These lessons learned and recommendations cover six themes. Theme 1: Understanding primary prevention of violence against women and girls We found that most project teams, stakeholders and implementers were experienced with VAWG response projects \u2013 for example providing care for survivors \u2013 or awareness raising activities. However, they needed intensive capacity building in understanding primary prevention of VAWG. P4P invested deeply in this capacity building, with the result that multiple groups at national and community levels in the five countries had improved capacity in this field. Theme 2: Intervention design, development and adaptation P4P maintained an evidence-based approach, first by encouraging teams to develop theory-of- change models grounded in available evidence and using data from local sources and experiences to adapt and contextualize interventions in a systematic way. It was important to build on and adapt existing effective and promising approaches to primary prevention, such as: (1) addressing gender inequality; (2) using a participatory approach to facilitating transformation among individuals, families and communities; and (3) maintaining the duration and frequency of sessions to support transformation. Integrating and promoting volunteerism throughout the primary prevention of VAWG interventions yielded promising results for ongoing activism. Although most teams found the interventions to be complex and demanding with the design, development and adaptation phase needing a lot of time, it was very encouraging to see this deep investment and effort pay off with the changes that the interventions effected among intervention beneficiaries, their families and their communities. 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Theme 3: Intervention Implementation Overall, the lessons in this theme point to the importance of collaborating fully with communities throughout the process of planning and implementation in order to maximize their buy-in and ownership of the intervention and the process of social norm transformation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b58ebffe-26cc-4dbc-98e2-a81c4c998fea": {"__data__": {"id_": "b58ebffe-26cc-4dbc-98e2-a81c4c998fea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "P4P Lessons Learned about Primary Prevention of VAWG in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e13cb33fff44abc4d077bccc455488c96c1edbdeb869a9333db823b3ee601b1c"}, "2": {"node_id": "141c8eb1-9e19-4fc4-a6d9-e0853d820838", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cacaad9bd0ec08eda6ad471ae427c351e474283d142c5ee6365d820a0096d693"}}, "hash": "c47a05b1dc0e09317b1228cbc4b21f0d5bd23f2c56fb8ab58baa936d806b571e", "text": "Projects benefitted from community partnership and also from staff and facilitators, who: (1) embraced the intervention principles and skills for their own transformation; (2) who were deeply committed to the logistical and technical needs of the project; and (3) who were strongly supported throughout their work.

These strategies were designed to fit the scope, available resources and theory of change for each project, and therefore it was helpful to have the intervention design and M&E design teams work closely together. Although it can be challenging to quantify and measure social norm transformation at multiple levels of the socioecological model, projects were able to gather valuable quantitative and qualitative data that demonstrated various impacts of the interventions. All teams found it encouraging to see the results of their intervention efforts documented systematically and are now able to use this data to inform future work. Given the sensitivity of VAWG and research on this topic, P4P supported each team to obtain ethics approval for their M&E from local institutions. Theme 5: Operational Learning The technical, ethical and operational demands of primary prevention of VAWG were different from those that teams were accustomed to managing on their other projects. Therefore, P4P provided ongoing capacity strengthening and technical advice to the teams to ensure successful pilot projects as well as increased readiness to continue this work. The P4P programme itself, and all P4P projects in the five countries, were all joint programmes or otherwise involved partnerships across agencies and sectors. This kind of multi-sectoral programming offered great opportunities for complementary, cross-sector contributions and capacity building, which may result in more long-term successful primary prevention programming in the countries and across the region. Theme 6: Budgeting Funding and budget concerns are typical on most projects and primary prevention of VAWG is no exception. However, because of the investments in intensive capacity building, development and management required for VAWG primary prevention, budgets can be particularly tight. Across the P4P programme, teams were resourceful and went above and beyond to mobilize resources, cost-share, minimize administrative costs and leverage other resources to support interventions. In conclusion, P4P and the project teams in each country invested deeply in capacity building, development and adaptation, implementation, management and M&E for primary prevention of VAWG interventions. This investment, and the committed partnerships throughout the project resulted in many valuable lessons learned and, notably, encouraging changes were achieved within project teams as well as among project participants, their families and communities. 8 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Four overarching recommendations emerged across the themes: 1. Invest in good, on-going capacity development and continuous learning. 2. Establish multi-sectoral partnerships and commit to personal and organisational transformation, processes to embrace the guiding principles and core components of evidence-based primary prevention. 3. Build on and contribute to the evidence-base for primary prevention of VAWG 4. Plan well and allocate sufficient resources. We hope that these lessons and recommendations will inform ongoing successful work on primary prevention. Effective prevention on a large scale will be necessary in order to attain Sustainable Development Goal #5 on gender equality and empowering women and girls, particularly Target 5.2 on eliminating VAWG. It is remarkable to see that when deep investment in, and commitment to, evidence-based primary prevention occurs, promising transformation is achieved at the individual, family and community

Among respondents, 26 to 80% of men reported ever having perpetrated physical and/ 1 Fulu, E., Warner, X., Miedema, S., Jewkes, R., Roselli, T. & Lang, J. 2013.

Overall, half (49%) of the men who reported having raped a woman said that they did so for the first time while they were still teenagers. In addition to violating fundamental human rights, violence has wide-ranging negative impacts on individuals, families and communities. A WHO study on the consequences of intimate partner violence and sexual violence for women2 shows that, among others, women who have experienced physical or sexual violence are twice as likely to have an abortion, are almost twice as likely to suffer from depression and are at increased risk of suicide3 compared to women who have not experienced partner violence. The recent Demographic Health Survey in Cambodia4 also reported that 48 percent of women who experienced IPV suffered from physical injuries. These findings underline the urgent need for prevention interventions that engage men and boys, as well as women and girls, to realize the long-term goal of a world where women and girls can live a life free from any form of violence.5 The UN MCS identified key risk factors associated with men\u2019s perpetration of violence against women and girls, which included factors related to gender inequality, childhood experiences with abuse and the enactment of harmful masculinities. In some sites with a low level of education, food insecurity, alcohol abuse, controlling behaviour over a partner and gender inequitable attitudes were related to violence perpetration. Rape was related to having multiple sexual partners, engaging in transactional sex or having had sex with a sex worker and perpetration of physical violence against female partners.6 What is primary prevention of Violence Against Women and Girls? The P4P Phase II VAWG primary prevention projects aim to prevent violence before it starts rather than respond to violence after it has already occurred. This approach is relatively new in Asia and the Pacific, with few programmes of this nature having been implemented and rigorously evaluated. But this is a fast-growing and essential field.7 While the term \u201cprevention\u201d is used to describe a wide range of activities and programming, the specific focus of primary prevention is to stop violence by transforming the underlying harmful social norms, practices and inequalities that drive VAWG (see Figure 1). This approach is largely driven by theoretical models8 informed by reliable data from large-scale, population-based surveys on VAWG and the causal and risk factors of this behaviour, such as those found in the UN MCS.9 Why prioritise primary prevention?

However, because primary prevention is about transforming gender-inequitable social norms and harmful practices, these interventions are directed at women, girls, men and boys from the general population, that is, individuals who do not necessarily have a history of violence or a particular risk profile. In addition, effective primary prevention includes intervention components at different levels of the socio-ecological model, which means working with multiple groups of people (see Figure 2). The socio-ecological model is a conceptual framework to understand the interplay of factors that explain why some people are more likely than others to perpetrate VAWG, or to experience it. The socio-ecological model portrays factors within each level and acknowledges interaction between risk factors on all levels.14 By addressing all levels of the socio-ecological model, these interventions reach beyond the individual level, striving to transform problematic social norms and promoting positive social engagement in order to ultimately help individuals realize gender-equitable, violence-free and thriving relationships, families and communities.15 10 Krug, E.

There has been an increase in the development and rigorous evaluation of primary prevention interventions recently, especially in low- and middle- income countries.

The SAFE project, in Bangladesh, targeted youth living in slums and addressed issues around gender inequality, violence, health and rights through group sessions.21 The group sessions were structured to include women only, men only and men and women together.22 In India there have been successful approaches, including the Yaari Dosti programme, and Parivartan, which targeted men\u2019s perpetration of VAWG by transforming gender inequitable norms through group trainings and social communication programmes.23 16 Darntall, E., & Gevers, A.

What Works to Prevent Violence So a stronger evidence base is still needed in the region to inform future successful programming. This evidence base should include practical recommendations for programming to continue to build capacity. What are the core components of primary prevention programming? Prevention interventions should use a multi-faceted approach and should target underlying risk factors when men perpetrate violence, such as power imbalances and gender-inequitable attitudes, patriarchal and harmful masculinities, and harsh parenting. The interventions must support gender equality as well as healthy and happy relationships, and should address mental health issues such as substance abuse and coping skills.24 Research and learning from previous programs have lead to the identification of the core components that should always be included in VAWG prevention:25 \u2022 Engage multiple groups of stakeholders simultaneously, such as men and women, boys and girls, teachers and schools, and/or community or religious leaders. \u2022 Address gender inequality and patriarchal constructions of masculinities, power, relationships including parenting/childhood and intimate relationships, and mental health, including substance abuse and coping skills. \u2022 Engage people in a participatory and inclusive way that promotes critical reflection26, discussion and practice of key skills such as communication, dialogue and conflict resolution. \u2022 Use aspirational framing to stimulate personal transformation and facilitate integration of these newly learned skills and knowledge into participants\u2019 personal lives. The evidence-based intervention models and approaches for primary prevention are demanding and complex, as well as being a very new area for most project stakeholders in the region. Primary prevention interventions address norms and practices that are intricately linked to people\u2019s world view, identities and day-to-day practices. It is delicate and intense work. Further, interventions should engage with multiple groups of people simultaneously across the socio- ecological model, which is challenging and which requires coordination across sectors. In addition, increasing evidence suggests that personal and organisational transformation is needed first so that all involved in the project fully understand and embrace the guiding principles of primary prevention work including equality, justice, respect and participatory processes.27 What are the aims of this report? The growing number of published, rigorous evaluations of primary prevention interventions provides important guidance for programming.28 However, what is often not included in this literature, 19 INTRODUCTION or in the reports, is the \u201cnuts-and-bolts\u201d learning of how we actually do prevention work effectively. Some lessons-learned publications have emerged29 that provide important insight into what it takes on the programme management and implementation levels to do primary prevention successfully. These lessons are valuable for the field more broadly because they are often undocumented and yet influence the design, planning, implementation, timeframes and outcomes of projects as well as work relations and partnerships. How did we generate lessons learned? Lessons learned were generated through extensive reflections and some in-depth interviews on practical experiences and the processes of designing and adapting the intervention framework, content, approach and materials. We reflected thoroughly upon all aspects of implementation, monitoring, evaluation and management, and collectively reflected upon all facets of programming, providing feedback on these reflections and lessons learned. Further lessons learned were generated through feedback from staff working at the country level, including UNVs, project officers and implementation partners. In-depth interviews and focus groups with intervention participants, facilitators and key stakeholders provided further insight into lessons learned at the national level. 29 Dartnall, E., & Gevers, A. 2017.

This intervention engaged adolescents, parents, teachers, sports instructors and community leaders at schools, madrasas and community clubs for adolescents on VAWG and sexual and reproductive health issues. 20 INTRODUCTION Cambodia In Cambodia, the Building Our Future: Supporting Healthy and Happy Relationships intervention was a joint effort of UNFPA Cambodia, UN Women, UNV and the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (MoWA), with technical support from P4P. It was implemented in five communes of Kampong Cham province over 12 months and addressed key risk factors for VAWG. The intervention engaged 252 adolescents ages 12 to 14 and 346 caregivers, including parents, guardians, teachers and youth service providers, in parallel workshops. It employed a participatory method to transform social norms and harmful masculinities, decrease harsh punishment and increase supportive parenting. Indonesia Reimay (Reaching Papuan Prosperity) was a 10 month programme initiated by UNFPA, UN Women, UNV and the International Planned Parenthood Federation of Papua (PKBI), with technical support from P4P, in Papua Province. The pilot intervention engaged 131 adolescent boys and girls ages 12 to 16 and 131 caregivers including parents, religious leaders and other influential community members in participatory group sessions. These sessions aimed to give adolescents gender-equitable attitudes and improve the relationship with their caregivers, and also aimed to give caregivers gender equitable attitudes, skills in positive discipline and skills in supportive parenting. The project built on the existing \u2018Violence Free Villages\u2019 programme, which raised awareness of VAWG in communities and built capacity of local authorities and civil society to respond to VAWG. Papua New Guinea The Planim Save, Kamap Strongpela (Plant Knowledge, Grow Strong) intervention in South Bougainville, was designed and implemented by UN Women, UNICEF and Nazareth Centre for Rehabilitation, with technical support from P4P. It focused on preventing VAWG and transforming negative gender norms, community peace-building and trauma healing activities. The project used a community conversation model that aimed to increase awareness, information and conversation on VAWG, trauma, healing, peace-building, and positive relationship skills, with 716 men and 814 women. Viet Nam In Viet Nam, the \u2018Male Advocate Programme\u2019 was a project of UN Women, UNV, the Da Nang Women\u2019s Union and UNFPA, with technical support from P4P. This was a year- long programme with 24 male facilitators and 93 youth and older men. It focused on transforming harmful masculinities and engaging men to become advocates for VAWG prevention in their communities through a volunteerism component. It also aimed to build gender-equitable attitudes, challenge harmful masculinities, build healthy relationship skills, develop awareness of VAWG issues and empower young men and older adult men to volunteer in their communities, to lead and engage in violence prevention. 21 INTRODUCTION Theme 1: Understanding primary prevention of violence against women and girls Lesson #1: At the outset, most stakeholders and implementers had a very limited understanding of primary prevention of Violence Against Women and Girls. Primary prevention of VAWG is a new and fast-growing field, and there are gaps and misconceptions as to what it actually entails. While the technical and academic terms used are very helpful to direct evidence-based approaches that are the most likely to succeed to prevent VAWG before it begins, this can be unclear especially to those who are new to the field, those who are not academics or those whose primary language is not English. It is therefore essential to translate technical language into plain language that is understandable to national and local community stakeholders. These materials should also include the theoretical models underpinning primary prevention of VAWG and the evidence base of effective practices. This will not only help more organisations and teams to do this work well but will also facilitate greater participation and contributions to the evidence base from more diverse sources.

As discussed earlier, primary prevention of VAWG is complex and demanding work, and personal and organisational transformation is an essential part of it. Teams need to build up their capacity to take on intervention programming driven by evidence, rigorous M&E and community mobilisation. In general, teams rated their own capacities in the P4P capacity assessment exercise very high. Many of these teams and organisations had worked successfully on VAWG, so their self-ratings reflected these experiences. However, the capacity development needs for evidence-based primary prevention of VAWG were much more intensive than anticipated both by P4P and by the teams themselves. The nature of primary prevention meant that teams often had to learn about this new field as well as manage a complex intervention. Specific capacity building for primary prevention: \u2022 Understanding approaches to primary prevention of VAWG. \u2022 Understanding promising evidence-based practices. \u2022 Developing and using theories of change. \u2022 Using evidence to inform programming. \u2022 The importance of fidelity to evidence-based interventions \u2022 Realistic timelines and staff capacity for adaptation, contextualisation, training and implementation. \u2022 Community mobilisation needs. \u2022 Ethics protocols. \u2022 Rigorous M&E. Recommendations: \u2022 Invest in long-term, ongoing capacity strengthening throughout the project and carry out an extended inception and planning phase. \u2022 Commit to personal and organisational transformation to align the values, goals and process of work to the values, goals and principles of social norm change. Theme 2: Intervention design, development and adaptation P4P committed to supporting evidence-based interventions that directly address risk and causal factors of VAWG perpetration, such as those found in the UN MCS.30 Where possible, P4P strongly encouraged teams to adapt existing interventions that had been found to be effective or promising through rigorous evaluation.31 This adaptation process included pairing a national technical advisor with an international technical advisor who had experience in development of primary prevention interventions and design of manuals for community facilitators. All P4P partners were encouraged to participate in the process to adapt the intervention, including reviewing and providing input to draft materials. Facilitator training and pilot implementation stages began after the manuals had been approved by all 30 Fulu, E., Warner, X., Miedema, S., Jewkes, R., Roselli, T. & Lang, J. 2013.

In this way, building from a solid evidence base is ethical because it uses good- practice models that are unlikely to cause harm and more likely to have promising effects. There are evidence summaries available that will help to orient teams toward effective and promising practices and away from those that are less likely to be effective.33 We found that some teams needed to be guided away from simple \u201cawareness raising\u201d or \u201ccommunication campaign\u201d models because these are not effective in creating behaviour change. This process of evidence-based development and decision-making was particularly helpful with teams who had little previous experience with primary prevention. The development process was thus significantly more efficient \u2013 especially with the limited time and funding available \u2013 because well-developed approaches already exist which could then be adapted for piloting. While adaptation and contextualization required a significant amount of resources (described in Lesson 2), adapting completely new models without a basis in good evidence could have taken much longer and ran the risk of being ineffective or even harmful. Recommendations: \u2022 Review and learn from existing literature, organisations and people with a solid history of effective or promising primary prevention work that is informed by good evidence. \u2022 Develop a data-informed theory-of-change model for the project. \u2022 Link specific research to intervention design to show how the evidence is being translated into programming. \u2022 Understand the core components of evidence-based primary prevention and of specific interventions that are being adapted so that these aspects are not compromised during the design and adaptation process. \u2022 Establish an evidence-based decision- making, design and planning process, and apply it to all aspects. Lesson #4: Development of interventions demand sustained and active engagement from stakeholders and technical advisors. All of the lessons learned in this section indicate the complexity of design, development and adaptation. The process requires input from multiple local, national and international stakeholders. Given that the intervention is the core of the project, time should be allocated to incorporate feedback from all stakeholders in at least two revisions of the intervention plan and its materials, such as the manual or guide. Ideally, opportunities to field test all or part of the intervention should also be included in this process. These experiences will provide data to further strengthen the intervention and well as identify key areas for focused training or issues to address during community mobilisation. 33 Fulu, E., Kerr-Wilson, A., & Lang, J. 2015.

Lesson #5: Balance fidelity to evidence- based models with necessary modifications for the local context. Adaptation and contextualisation are not simply about translating documents but are also about adapting processes, activities, illustrations and sometimes additional content to support extra formative research around new or sensitive themes such as sexuality or adolescents and dating. This should include common cultural symbols and practices that (1) align with the values of the intervention, but (2) are not harmful or (3) perpetuate patriarchal gender norms. Participants must be able to identify with the content. In some countries, some project stakeholders were concerned that the cultural context was too conservative, for example on sexuality, adolescents dating or sexual and reproductive health. However, during workshops, other stakeholders suggested a way to address this issue, by retaining the sensitive content but introducing it to participants gradually, such as by modifying language to be less explicit but still clear, or by changing examples to mirror common local practices: guests going to a wedding party; teenagers meeting at a guest house. But this \u201ccontextualising\u201d should not dilute the intervention either. We found that consultative workshops with the project team, stakeholders and national and international primary prevention technical experts were very useful in the process of adapting interventions, because multiple inputs from various perspectives strengthened the intervention. Some specific steps during adaptation and contextualization may include: \u2022 List the core components of primary prevention and of the specific intervention models being considered to understand where there is flexibility and where adaptations should be more careful. It is important to stay faithful to the intervention intensity, frequency, key messages, approach and duration. \u2022 Gather and present evidence on the local context to inform adaptations and planning in a systematic manner. \u2022 Consider the theory of change and ensure that adaptations do not significantly depart from this theory. \u2022 Assess the capacity of implementing partners and community facilitators in order to inform adaptations and planning particularly in the training and implementation plan, to ensure that the scale of the intervention is within the scope of the available capacity. Adaptation and contextualisation should be considered an ongoing process within a project with learning and results from early piloting or ongoing implementation informing continued strengthening of an intervention. While the adaptation and contextualisation process through consultations may take time, it will yield rich dividends in terms of intervention acceptability and ownership. 27 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS Intervention facilitators must be literate in order to use the materials as a guide to deliver sessions efficiently and with fidelity. However, many community facilitators had limited literacy levels and manuals needed to be further simplified in clear language. The manuals are designed for community facilitators to use, but are not for participants, because interventions are designed to be participatory in nature. The intervention approach should avoid traditional rote teaching methods that focus on passive listening, and instead use an approach where facilitators ask thought-provoking questions and encourage critical thinking by getting participants to engage in discussions, debate and dialogue. In addition, participants need experiential learning activities such as role-plays, skits or other games in order to learn, practice and internalise different skills. Recommendations: \u2022 All initial translations should be done by local staff or facilitators who are bilingual and who have a solid technical understanding of evidence-based primary prevention. \u2022 Involve community members and key facilitators in translating manuals in a participatory workshop manner especially around core concepts and terminology. \u2022 Ensure that local project staff and key facilitators carefully review all translations for accessible, accurate language as well as fidelity to the intervention model, rather than leaving the translation up to one or two people alone. \u2022 Use posters and story boards to start discussions with clear and relevant sample scenarios Recommendations: \u2022 Ensure local community stakeholders are actively and deeply involved throughout the design and adaptation. \u2022 Conduct several consultative workshops with a diverse group of stakeholders from different sectors to develop and adapt the intervention before implementation and afterwards using the pilot data to inform continued intervention strengthening. \u2022 \u201cPre-pilot\u201d the intervention during the design and adaptation phases with integrated robust community monitoring and feedback mechanisms throughout to understand what works well and what needs further adaptation and contextualisation, and note any unanticipated consequences.

Activities that were concise in English were often not so in Khmer or Bahasa, for example. There needs to be a more active process for translation, then, where national team members, national consultants, community stakeholders and community representatives work through translations in detail, together, refining them to be more accurate. Pre-pilot implementation, on a small scale, would also help to assure that nothing was lost in translation. A team with technical knowledge of primary prevention interventions should be part of this process to ensure continued alignment with effective practices. 28 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS Lesson #7: A multiple session intervention implemented over the course of a year is necessary to support transformation. Challenge the misconception that programmes should be shorter. Several teams requested that interventions have a shorter time period, shorter sessions, and shorter activities within the sessions. However, the evidence to date suggests that sustained activities over time are needed given the complexity and depth of transformation necessary to achieve primary prevention of VAWG. It is not realistic to implement a participatory process necessary for transformation in very brief sessions. The P4P team provided the rationale for length of sessions and assisted teams with planning to demonstrate a consistent but not overwhelming schedule. By the end of the intervention, most participants even requested more sessions because they felt them to be relevant, valuable and enjoyable. Recommendations: \u2022 Strengthen stakeholders\u2019 understanding of, and commitment to, effective and promising evidence-based processes, including frequency, duration, and intensity of the intervention. \u2022 Bring in experienced teams who have implemented evidence-based primary prevention interventions similar to the one planned in order to share the reasons for, and experiences of, the lengthy, sustained and intensive activities. \u2022 Develop an implementation plan that balances project resources with community availability and evidence-based practices. \u2022 Develop mobilisation and recruitment strategies to deal with community-level concern of interventions being too long by positively framing the time commitments as an investment in family well-being and respect, or community safety and success (see also notes about benefits-based framing in lesson 10). \u2022 Nurture community commitment to the intervention throughout mobilisation, recruitment and implementation particularly through the community facilitators and community leaders. Lesson #8: Building gender-equitable attitudes is a complex process, but it is possible with adequate investment. Addressing gender inequality and patriarchy, especially problematic masculinities, is central to effective primary prevention of VAWG. But transforming harmful masculinities and building gender equality means challenging deeply entrenched socio-cultural norms and beliefs. Some of the manuals piloted in various P4P interventions offered sessions focusing solely on gender, and others also had brief notes about gender and gender equality. However, many community facilitators were also undergoing transformation in their gender attitudes and practices themselves, through their experience while being trained for the intervention, and still needed explicit guidance. Field reports also indicate that supervisors and community facilitators found the gender sessions to be difficult for participants to understand, and suggested additional, simplified sessions that address gender more slowly using examples that the community could relate to. Recommendations: \u2022 Invest in ongoing capacity strengthening and facilitate transformation among facilitators in order to deepen their understanding of gender and embrace gender equality. Use additional resources such as from Raising Voices SASA! or Get Moving as evidence-based interventions focusing on gender and power analysis. 29 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS sustaining results particularly in transforming social norms. Raising Voices has documented their work on SASA! through community activists who implement the programme in their communities. To date there are no evidence-based guidelines for volunteerism within primary prevention. However, P4P has found that it is feasible to do this and qualitative reports from intervention participants, facilitators and supervisors indicate positive results. There were multiple examples where participants were able to share ideas and skills gained from the interventions with others in their communities through volunteerism so that the reach of the intervention went beyond the direct beneficiary group. Recommendations: \u2022 Continue to develop and research volunteerism in primary prevention interventions. \u2022 Build the evidence base by collecting data on volunteerism to strengthen the case for it. \u2022 Partner with existing volunteer groups in the community to support VAWG volunteerism. Theme 3: Implementation Lesson #10: Recruiting participants takes time and community members often have concerns in the early stages of the intervention that can slow implementation and that can affect evaluation. In several P4P-supported interventions, more time, resources and/or planning were needed for participant mobilization, including raising awareness and enthusiasm about the intervention, clarifying and addressing questions or concerns, understanding communities\u2019 needs and how the intervention links", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e9bd9b9-14d1-45ab-9e0c-69c9b3db8a30": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e9bd9b9-14d1-45ab-9e0c-69c9b3db8a30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "P4P Lessons Learned about Primary Prevention of VAWG in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5d9bc8f35982d44d4f00f2839ef571e7585139b84e3c0637dc9f0d2099f595a"}}, "hash": "a5d9bc8f35982d44d4f00f2839ef571e7585139b84e3c0637dc9f0d2099f595a", "text": "to them, and negotiating implementation logistics with communities to adjust to their schedules. \u2022 There should be several experiential learning sessions on gender equality throughout an intervention to give participants the opportunity to continuously engage with the topic in ways that support a transformative experience. Rote training styles are unlikely to be transformative. \u2022 Facilitators need explicit guidance in every session to link content to gender equality, because they too are often in the early stages of transforming their ideas and practices around gender equality. Lesson #9: Integrating volunteerism shows encouraging results, although more research is needed to identify how to promote it effectively and how to understand the role that it plays. P4P integrated volunteerism by: \u2022 recruiting international and national UNVs for field assignments to support the interventions and to liaise with UN agencies, implementing partners, facilitators and communities; \u2022 training community members, who then volunteered as intervention facilitators; and \u2022 including activities for participants to engage in volunteerism either through existing activities in the community or by supporting participants to conceptualise, plan and implement their own projects. Most participants needed more guidance than originally provided in order to successfully drive their own volunteerism projects, and they benefitted from initial, formal opportunities to get involved in their communities before doing so independently, such as events led by local organisations or government ministries. There is still little research on the best way to integrate volunteerism in primary prevention projects, or on what role it has in achieving and 30 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS Some community mobilization should be continued throughout the intervention in order to retain participants, and the sessions should build on each other, because the intervention is designed to address complex risk factors for VAWG and to build up several layers of protective factors. Facilitators can check in with participants on challenges in attendance or how to make sessions more enjoyable, and in consultation with the supervisors and technical team to make adjustments as needed, but ones that do not compromise the effectiveness of the intervention overall. P4P supported interventions in environments where people work, harvest, contend with harsh weather, participate in elections and attend community festivals, among many other elements of community life. They are not always available for all sessions and some community factors like these delayed some elements of implementation, while others went ahead. In some projects, community members who were not initially participating joined the intervention later because their interest was piqued, because they witnessed the benefits among participants or were encouraged by other participants, or because of ongoing mobilization and recruitment. But the appearance of new participants should be managed carefully. All of this work also delves into personal and sensitive topics, so maintaining the cohesion and safe space of the group based on trust, confidentiality, respect and support is important. The process of mobilization is especially important here because interventions are not usually integrated into an activity for which community members regularly gather, such as school, religious activities or work, but are an additional activity for people to fit into their lives. Community leaders, community members and other stakeholders therefore need to understand the intervention and how it may be valuable to them as individuals, as members of families and as a community before they will take ownership. For example, an intervention could be integrated into regularly- scheduled things like lunch breaks, religious events or other events where people meet. In the early stages, some participants thought that P4P was for \u201cwomen-only\u201d or was a \u201cforeign\u201d attempt to undermine local culture or religious beliefs. But the team was able to ally their concerns, and once they experienced the intervention they were generally positive about it and encouraged others to join. One lesson learned here: by partnering with community leaders and community organisations you can limit misunderstandings. Further, these early partnerships with grassroots stakeholders and representatives allow for sustainability beyond the life of the pilot and help to develop a feasible implementation plan and community-accessible intervention materials. Recommendations: \u2022 Invest in thorough, sustained and participatory community mobilization and relationship building prior to, and during, implementation. Develop a strategy to mitigate community resistance. \u2022 Carry out in-depth situation analysis of a community early, to put in place successful strategies to mobilize participants, recruit facilitators and plan for training and support. \u2022 Develop talking points about the intervention that focus on the potential benefits that it hopes to bring to individuals, families and the community rather than the problems it will address; benefits-based or aspirational framing is more inspiring and motivating. \u2022 Engage in community-driven scheduling, such as negotiating the implementation schedule", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebabb65d-110c-42a4-8986-64fcdb81ef31": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebabb65d-110c-42a4-8986-64fcdb81ef31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "P4P Lessons Learned about Primary Prevention of VAWG in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ae2b70d99e304c5f78aef16cd5fdd8e8bd846d7ccbd54c12955fe067949e1c2"}}, "hash": "9ae2b70d99e304c5f78aef16cd5fdd8e8bd846d7ccbd54c12955fe067949e1c2", "text": "with various community stakeholders and participants during planning and mobilization. \u2022 Plan on whether and how to integrate additional participants into existing groups without jeopardising group cohesion. Alternatively, consider a rolling implementation schedule with multiple groups in a community starting at different times to accommodate different groups\u2019 schedules. 31 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS Further, men were willing to be positive role models in their communities, demonstrating equitable, non- violent attitudes and behaviours sometimes despite potential stigma or \u201cquestions\u201d from neighbours or other peers. In these cases, support from fellow participants was helpful. P4P ultimately strove to ensure that engaging men and boys in violence prevention did not come at the cost of values and goals for the intervention, including: \u2022 it did not replicate patriarchal norms; \u2022 it did not cast men in the role of protector of women; and \u2022 it did not impose solutions to VAWG that exclude women. It was important to maintain this feminist grounding while working with men and boys. Recommendations: \u2022 Continuously engage in team reflection on engaging men and boys to ensure that they are included, and also to avoid replicating problematic norms or practices within the intervention. \u2022 Engage men and boys specifically during mobilization to understand their concerns, and find the motivators for them to commit to the intervention. \u2022 Employ benefits-based and aspirational framing focusing on what men stand to gain from participation during recruitment and intervention sessions. \u2022 Get buy-in from community leadership and have them encourage men to join the intervention. \u2022 Men\u2019s involvement should not come at the expense of priorities, leadership, participation and safety for women and girls. Lesson #11: Engaging men and boys is feasible, but challenging. All P4P projects aimed to engage men and boys either in men-only interventions or within combined interventions with both women and men, and/or boys and girls. As with many similar projects, there was often relatively low participation or high dropout for interventions that combined men and women, yet in the male-only intervention in Viet Nam there were good participation and retention rates. However, feedback from the male participants in this intervention was that they recommended women be included because the intervention would be relevant and valuable for women. It would be easier to institute community-change with more people involved, and because the men would enjoy working with women. This intervention in Viet Nam, which was part of a larger, multi-component programme, was male- only at first because the initial feedback during the planning and early implementation stages was that men in the community felt that the combined groups were primarily for women. In contrast, men in Papua, Indonesia, where an intervention was piloted, felt it was not culturally appropriate to have men and women meet together for all topics. This contradictory feedback illustrates the complexity in engaging men and boys in prevention programming. Therefore, a good situational analysis, in-depth community mobilization and community input into planning and design are all necessary to understand how best to engage men and boys. This similar situation has been found in other regions. It was encouraging to see that men did participate in various interventions across the countries, although in lower numbers than women (except for Vietnam). The evaluations indicated that men changed in positive ways, including being less violent, more involved in child care, housework and less prone to drinking34. 34 Gevers, A., Taylor, K. (2018) Promising strides toward ending violence against women and girls in the Asia and the Pacific Region: Results from Partners for Prevention pilot interventions in four countries. 32 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS Lesson #12: Initial implementation piloting requires dedicated staff to address logistical and technical issues. All P4P projects faced challenges with community mobilization, recruitment, retention, facilitator capacity and support, scheduling and fidelity to the intervention model. Yet they benefited greatly from having a dedicated staff member to mentor and monitor the intervention with the implementing agency and facilitators on the ground. The projects that dedicated more staff time to this kind of support showed more encouraging results. Primarily national UNVs were recruited and assigned to fill these positions, but in some cases other UN staff took on this role. Even better if staff have technical knowledge of the intervention and especially of the evidence-based effective strategies. P4P invested deeply in the capacity strengthening, mentoring and support of the people in this role. For example, some UNVs lead in-service training and capacity building activities to strengthen facilitators\u2019 skills particularly in participatory intervention methodologies and fidelity to the manual. They developed this activity with the support of P4P staff, and it is best if the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4de61bd-1f54-4e3c-a45a-ef5748f50907": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4de61bd-1f54-4e3c-a45a-ef5748f50907", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "P4P Lessons Learned about Primary Prevention of VAWG in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "870abe7786f180d0873d3f872882b33914fa0218e830983cd8b8a81791a952da"}}, "hash": "870abe7786f180d0873d3f872882b33914fa0218e830983cd8b8a81791a952da", "text": "support person participates in both development and pre-service facilitator training, to build both technical and management knowledge for their role. Recommendations: \u2022 Appoint a mid-level staff person to support and monitor all aspects of implementation in the community. \u2022 Provide solid technical training and operational management skills to the field support person. Lesson #13: Facilitators are essential to success, yet have a lot of capacity strengthening and support needs. They need to go through transformation themselves, similar to what the intervention aims to achieve among participants. As described earlier, primary prevention interventions aim to facilitate deep transformation of gender norms and practices, relationship norms and practices, and family and childcare norms from the personal and relationship levels through to the community and society levels. This kind of transformation is a large undertaking, but evidence shows that it is possible, even within the relatively short timeframe of interventions that are implemented over a year or two. Facilitators drive this transformation, and so play a central role in achieving the intervention aims. Facilitators need to be carefully selected based on clear criteria: \u2022 High school graduate and/or demonstrated literacy in abstract ideas, intervention guides and background reading. \u2022 Confidence with public speaking. \u2022 Experience with community mobilization or bringing people together. \u2022 Ability to build rapport and cohesion with a group. \u2022 Be in good standing in the community, not necessarily as a leader, but at least someone who people in the community trust and respect. \u2022 Able to deal with sensitive topics and discussions as well as with challenging questions. \u2022 Available to commit fully to all training and support for, as well as preparation and facilitation of, the intervention. In addition, in-depth assessment of facilitators could be integrated into the M&E to document capacity building achievements as well as use data to inform future facilitator selection and capacity building. One method used in Cambodia and Indonesia, for example, was to recruit more facilitators than needed to participate in the pre-service training. The 33 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS facilitators. To minimize the impact of vicarious trauma and burnout, regular support sessions are essential and good ethical practice for primary prevention work. This kind of training and support programme throughout intervention implementation is both time-consuming and resource-intensive, but in the P4P experience (as well as other projects such as SASA!) it is clear that the rewards are seen in the intervention impacts. The intensive training and support programme described above is not only for skills building, but also to support and facilitate personal transformation among facilitators. This transformation is important because facilitators will become role models for their group participants as well as more broadly in the community. Facilitation is both easier and more effective, and in our experience at P4P being similar to that of Raising Voices, when facilitators believe in and fully embrace and display the values, principles and practices promoted by the intervention. Recommendations: \u2022 Develop selection criteria and assessment strategies. \u2022 Invest in good quality pre-service and in-service training as well as ongoing mentoring, coaching and supportive supervision with all project staff. who will be involved in intervention facilitation including the facilitators and supervisors. \u2022 Use a co-facilitation model of two community facilitators guiding intervention sessions. project then delivered an intensive training which included teach-back activities, where candidate facilitators led an intervention activity from the manual. This strategy had multiple benefits: \u2022 Both supervisors and facilitators got a feel for the intervention and whether it was something that they could commit to; and supervisors can make an informed decision selecting the best facilitators. \u2022 Project managers and supervisors could identify facilitators\u2019 skill level and strengths and develop a strategy for strengthening specific skills. \u2022 Having more facilitators allowed for a co- facilitation model pairing stronger facilitators with those who needed more support and capacity building. This model could potentially be used for ongoing training if implementation were expanded to additional communities. In other cases, a young and dynamic facilitator was paired with a senior facilitator to bring both a seriousness as well as a participatory and fun approach to the intervention. \u2022 Having more facilitators will lessen the impact of staff turnover. Pre-service training alone was not sufficient in any project. It was essential to have a combination of pre-service training, in-service training and ongoing mentoring and supportive supervision for both capacity strengthening and skills building, as well as for motivation and emotional support.

All projects also benefited from initial training by experienced, technically strong trainers. Further, it was extremely useful for facilitators to have monthly guided preparation and practice sessions, especially during the beginning stages of the intervention. These sessions should be held before a particular session is implemented in the community to derive the most benefit. Facilitating social norm change interventions that deal with VAWG can also be emotionally taxing on 34 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS Lesson #14: Participatory learning methodologies are a new approach for project staff at UN agencies, for implementing partners, for intervention facilitators and for community members. Although project stakeholders found this methodology challenging at first, they eventually found it very useful. Participatory methodologies for intervention delivery are a core component of primary prevention of VAWG. These methodologies include open sharing, questioning and dialogue on complex issues fostering critical consciousness. They focus on transforming social norms rather than simply memorizing information and they encourage critical thinking and use thought-provoking questions. The approach requires emotional vulnerability and non-hierarchical dynamics in a group, which can feel uncomfortable for facilitators and/or participants who are accustomed to teaching structures where questioning, discussion and emotional openness are not encouraged. Nevertheless, participatory methods are essential to facilitate the process of transformation around deeply held social norms, attitudes, and practices. Participatory methods can also appear to take more time to deliver results because they are not focused on knowledge gains but rather on deeper transformation that is not always immediately apparent or easy to measure. Some supervisors requested facilitators to list the aims, objectives and key messages for each session and each activity that they felt would ensure learning. Such practice, though, could undermine the participatory approach and does not encourage the process of transformation. If participants are told the aims, objectives and key messages, then they may disengage if they don\u2019t agree with them or if they feel they already know them. Further, this structure of simply telling participants the key messages focuses on passively hearing information rather than the deeper transformation of attitudes, practices and norms. This rote method for simply memorizing information allows participants to remain detached from the content, where a participatory approach means that they, their families and their communities can be immersed in the learning and better integrate it into their lives. In this environment, manuals for participatory interventions are usually meant to be a guide for facilitators but not for participants. These manuals outline a series of questions or activity directions in each session used to facilitate the group discussion and activities. In addition, there are notes within the session guide as well as in the annexes that provide information and reminders to facilitators about core content and key messages. As reflected in Lesson 12 above, this manual requires facilitators to be literate and to spend substantial time preparing for sessions by reading the notes and understanding the process they will facilitate. Several facilitators requested shorter manuals and sessions, but this needs to be carefully considered to guard against the intervention sessions focusing only on rote learning. As mentioned in lessons 6 and 7, facilitators, supervisors and programme managers need to realise that there is no shortcut to transformation, so participatory approaches throughout the project design, management and implementation \u2013 especially for facilitator training and community sessions \u2013 are necessary for effective prevention work. The focus in participatory interventions is on facilitating a process for experiential learning and understanding, which will drive change. 35 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations: \u2022 Include activities on emotional awareness and expression in the intervention so that new skills on coping, emotional regulation and support are easier to integrate into participants\u2019 lives. \u2022 Facilitating prevention interventions can be emotionally taxing so facilitators need good support. Providing good emotional support to facilitators will help to model this skill that they can use with participants \u2022 Understand locally-relevant self-care practices to integrate them into the facilitator support plan as well as promote them during the intervention. Lesson #16: Violence Against Women and Girls is a pervasive problem in communities and prevention interventions will include participants who need support services. Even though the focus of primary prevention interventions is to stop violence before it occurs, in reality many participants in primary prevention are likely to be survivors of violence themselves. In addition, at times an intervention or project may become known for its focus on VAWG and thus community members may even come forward to ask project staff or facilitators for assistance. Facilitators and project staff therefore need to be prepared to manage these needs.

In one project, the implementing partner trained community counselors and also had parallel response services running so participants could be referred to either of these support services. Specifically, community counselors were trained to provide initial support to survivors of VAWG, and central to their training was the ability to make referrals to safe houses or more intensive counseling. In other projects, the team compiled information about referral services in the area in line with the WHO ethical guidelines for such Recommendations: \u2022 Teams need a lot of capacity building, guidance, mentoring and encouragement on participatory methodologies.

Lesson #15: Emotional expression, including acknowledging and voicing emotions, or addressing emotional needs, is new for most people, including project staff, facilitators and participants, so it was more challenging to complete the activities focused on this. However, it was greatly appreciated Project officers and facilitators reflected that talking about their own emotions was uncommon in their experience. Depending on the cultural context, it may be necessary to carry out activities that: (1) practice using emotional expression; (2) supportive listening and reflection; and (3) discuss the value of sharing these within various relationships before starting project implementation. Although prevention interventions are not necessarily focused on therapeutic processes for survivors, experiences of abuse and violence are often shared. In addition, the themes covered in interventions are often very personal and the process of transformation can be emotional and deeply personal. Therefore, facilitators need to be able to address emotional needs and provide emotional support to participants, which also serves to model appropriate emotional expression and support for participants so that they can apply it in their own relationships. 36 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS information sheets35 and included help seeking sessions in the workshops. Facilitators were trained to make referrals and distribute information leaflets to all participants at multiple times during the intervention implementation. Local service providers were also aware of the interventions being implemented in their areas and were invited to meetings to share information about the project. Recommendations: \u2022 Prevention programmes need strong linkages to care for VAWG survivors as part of the intervention either through referral networks or through making counseling services available. \u2022 Information about where to find various support services such as counseling, protection orders or shelters must be provided to all participants. These information leaflets must include information about other social welfare (e.g., social grants, vocational training, employment agencies, work programmes), health related services, and/or civic engagement organisations so as not to increase the risk of victimization among those who have violent partners or parents (see WHO guidelines). \u2022 When developing referral leaflets for participants, ensure that you contact all organisations to make them aware of potential increases in service utilization and discuss potential partnerships between the prevention project and their ongoing work. 35 World Health Organization.

Theme 4: Monitoring & Evaluation Throughout P4P \u2013 in phases I and II \u2013 there has been a strong commitment to gathering and using high- quality data or evidence both to inform programming and to contribute to the larger national, regional and global evidence base for primary prevention of VAWG. This means that rigorous M&E strategies were very important in the P4P pilots. These strategies were designed specifically for each country bearing in mind: the available funding and capacities; the intervention design; the project timeframes, the interests of various stakeholders and the outcomes they wanted to learn about; and the questions they wanted to answer. Randomised control trials were not feasible and the exact same design was not possible across projects. Instead, collecting good quality data on the same concepts (e.g., gender equitable attitudes and practices, aspects of healthy relationships and volunteerism36 was common across all projects, though measured differently.

P4P used data-driven design processes throughout projects, which further built interest in, and capacity for understanding, using and valuing good M&E data. Yet M&E is often left as a last item for design and budgeting, with the primary focus being development and implementation of the intervention itself. Teams were often surprised by the time, detail and constraints required by M&E, or they misunderstood the importance of the M&E activities being conducted specifically with the people participating in the intervention rather than a selection of people 37 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations: \u2022 It is crucial to start M&E at the outset, to ensure a solid foundation for the implementation and continuation of the programme. \u2022 Link data and findings to actions not only during data analysis but also during the planning and design phases so that teams strengthen their capacity to assess and use evidence. \u2022 Showcase the evidence and describe how it was generated, and why you have confidence in the findings. \u2022 Monitoring data will generate important \u201cprocess learning\u201d \u2013 why and how something is implemented and how it effects change \u2013 so be sure to include this in the design and build in opportunities to reflect on what is emerging. \u2022 Involve all team members in the design of M&E so that they understand it and will support the process; also so they understand what questions the M&E design will be able to answer at the end of the project. Encourage team members to ask questions that will feed into M&E design and data to promote buy-in and ensure that the questions that are relevant to project stakeholders will be answered with good quality data. \u2022 Disseminate the M&E data widely and show project teams how their work has contributed to broader learning in VAWG primary prevention programming. \u2022 Take time regularly to reflect on and document lessons learned throughout the project, by all staff and stakeholders, as part of thorough M&E. \u2022 The implementation plan may need to be adapted based on emerging M&E data and findings. who did not participate at all. Or they misunderstood the importance of standardizing the intervention and implementing it accurately in all communities in order to understand the specific effects. Some teams also hoped for results quickly at the end of the intervention. However data analysis is time- consuming, especially with multiple researchers and reviewers. It is important to schedule opportunities to reflect frequently on monitoring data and feedback. For example, facilitator feedback in Cambodia and Viet Nam during the intervention implementation period led to revision of intervention materials to be simpler or to include informational handouts for participants. Good quality M&E, which reliably documents both the process and outcomes of an intervention and its implementation, allows for rigorous evaluation where agencies and donors can be confident in the results. Monitoring data can offer insight into both unintended consequences and achievement of important milestones in transformation, and can be analysed quicker than can results data. However, rigorous M&E is also costly because expertise is needed to design strategy and tools; high-quality M&E demands time and human resources for documentation and analysis. Despite these challenges, the teams on P4P projects valued the findings generated under this initiative because they provided clear evidence of achievements as well as important understanding of processes that strengthened implementation. They found it particularly helpful when data and findings were linked to specific actions. Without good M&E, teams will not be able to answer essential questions after piloting that will inform whether to continue investing in and expanding the intervention, and how to strengthen the intervention and its implementation. Therefore, all team members and stakeholders, including the facilitators, should understand the importance of rigorous M&E, the specific project M&E strategy and their roles in supporting the M&E activities. 38 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS Lesson #18: Transformation takes time and can be difficult to measure, especially within small pilot projects. The kinds of transformation that primary prevention interventions aim to effect are nuanced and difficult to measure in simple, reliable \u201cself-report scales\u201d, such as the Gender Equitable Men Scale (GEMS), while qualitative research with reporting biases may affect the data as well. P4P used the same existing measures that are widely used in VAWG research, including many that were used in the first phase of P4P\u2019s work with the UN MCS.37 These measures are considered rigorous in violence prevention and they generate data comparable to that of other studies.

The conditions for rigorous, research trials such as experimental or quasi-experimental designs, randomised control trials, or interrupted-time- series design is not possible in small pilots.39 Neither is it feasible to have large enough sample sizes or control groups to conduct the best statistical analysis and interpretation. Small sample sizes mean that the opportunity to detect even small but significant changes is minimized. Without a \u201ccontrol group\u201d the changes that are detected cannot be attributed entirely to the intervention. Accordingly, given the deep kind of transformative impact that primary prevention interventions seek to make, it would be useful to have long follow-up measures to understand whether initial changes and impacts are sustained or whether they grow or fade over time. 37 Fulu, E., Warner, X., Miedema, S., Jewkes, R., Roselli, T. & Lang, J. 2013.

Lesson #19: Approvals from ethics committees and institutonal review boards are necessary, but access to these bodies in each country is challenging. P4P sought formal ethics review and approval from official bodies as a good practice, yet most teams were also unfamiliar with this process and with the amount of time and resources needed to go through it. However, with P4P\u2019s focus on generating and disseminating rigorous evidence for the countries and the region as well as contributing this to the international field of VAWG prevention, it was important to secure ethics approval. Recommendations: \u2022 Begin the ethics approval process very early in the project so that the M&E protocols and procedures can be developed during the design phase and baseline implementation can begin on time. 39 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS translating learning and evidence from previous studies into action. Similar to other projects40 partner teams needed continuous support and technical guidance as well as regular contact with the P4P team in order to keep activities moving forward as planned. In this type of project, operations or management decisions may conflict with the evidence-based, technical guidelines. For example: \u2022 hiring a workable, realistic sample of facilitators instead of recruiting strictly according to the recommended criteria; \u2022 shortening intervention sessions or shortening the intervention overall; \u2022 reducing the training plan or reducing the time spent on support, mentoring and monitoring; and \u2022 not assigning senior staff and resources to the project. Therefore, the management, operations team and technical team should all work closely to build their understanding of each aspect of the project in order to make decisions that do not significantly compromise the effectiveness or ethics of the intervention. Managers and directors will ultimately need to understand how meaningful outcomes can be achieved in primary prevention. For example, knowledge gains alone do not drive reduction or prevention of VAWG, so other targets need to be defined bearing in mind the challenges associated with M&E in this field.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2c32742-9a25-4659-a05d-5325ae9626fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2c32742-9a25-4659-a05d-5325ae9626fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "P4P Lessons Learned about Primary Prevention of VAWG in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66cfac395f10612ec853d109e80f352d34f536798ea0317a698a6b45954a63c9"}, "2": {"node_id": "733f0d15-8e16-45ca-81f8-73dac6eb655a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5deb6a9f00fbfe0f0f9650c9bc7ceb3bd8bca3e152a2ff85ece58ca8b5b50f2"}}, "hash": "2967d70e4be1d36a3781ec558bcfc6307933cb3e3b63a459d0e96ae8eee10e14", "text": "Results frameworks need to be developed together with the technical team to ensure that all members understand what they are working toward.

The role of management and logistics of the project and the project team become very important in complex projects that use new methodologies, approaches, and technical understanding compared to what teams and agencies usually work on. The most successful projects in terms of implementation efficiency and results achievement occurred when: \u2022 All partner agencies and organisations were committed at the senior management and technical team level with good communication and mutual support between the management and technical leaders. \u2022 Partner agencies and organisations recognised the added value of P4P and took co-ownership of the project as a whole rather than seeing themselves and/or the programme as a separate or additional commitment. \u2022 Staff time and resources were dedicated to the project including at least one full-time staff member to coordinate the project and liaise between partners and different groups in the team. \u2022 Key staff put in considerable effort to learn about and implement evidence-based primary prevention and rigorous M&E, and champion the project. Lesson #20: The technical, ethical and operational demands of community-based social norm change with rigorous M&E differ for that in VAWG response or awareness- raising projects. As discussed in Lesson 1, this area was new for most partners. Therefore, P4P fostered a culture of continuous learning at the regional level by including all team members in learning activities, including sharing key articles and readings, group review processes for documents and reports, encouraging dialogue especially with the technical group and 40 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS \u2022 Invest in ongoing capacity development especially by partnering with a group who have previous experience and technical expertise in primary prevention of VAWG. \u2022 The management and operations group should work closely with the technical group and collaborate on all planning and implementation. \u2022 Build productive parternships with organizations and people with complementary skills with a particular focus on continuous learning. Lesson #21: Joint programming and projects with multi-sectoral teams are challenging but also beneficial to building long-term, effective primary prevention programmes. The advantage of joint programming and multi- sectoral teams is that the strengths of multiple agencies and organisations can be combined. This also ensures a multi-sectoral approach across the socio-ecological model in programming. Strong multi-sectoral teams, based at project sites, countries or locations will promote long-term sustainability and expansion of the programming. There are important capacity strengthening and advocacy benefits of partnering with multi-sectoral stakeholders as well. If multiple partners are involved then capacity building is reaching more people and organisations. In addition, multiple sectors will become engaged in primary prevention efforts so more voices will become advocates for evidence-based primary prevention. Having government partners in early primary prevention projects is particularly important for this. Large project teams are also challenging, however, in that each partner agency or organization have their own priorities, culture, structures, methods and administration. Therefore, clear procedures and protocols, and clear agreement on values and goals, are vital for effective coordination. Equally important is establishing good working relationships throughout to promote effective collaboration and cohesive implementation. Fostering a culture of inclusive, participatory management will also serve as a model for communities and facilitators during the implementation. Empowering all levels of staff to work together without hierarchical barriers may also contribute to capacity development and later successful expansion of this work. Here it is especially important to engage government ministries from project inception. P4P found that it was useful to have senior-level staff fully involved in order to liaise among high-level partners such as national government and partner UN agencies and community leaders. Having a mid-to-senior level staff person dedicated to this in the pilot stages of field work is useful to be able to respond to and document problems as they arise and for using this experience to plan for future work. Recommendations: \u2022 Establish a multi-sectoral project team from inception especially including government ministries. \u2022 Develop clear protocols for administration, management and implementation for all partners. Be open to reviewing these regularly to ensure that project operations continue to be effective and capitalize on each partner\u2019s strengths. \u2022 Invest in building relationships constantly, to ensure that the team will always work collaboratively and cohesively. \u2022 Promote a participatory and inclusive project management approach, to empower and strengthen the capacity of all partners and team members as well as to embrace the core principles of effective primary prevention interventions. Commit senior staff to work directly on the project throughout, especially in the pilot phase. 41 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS \u2022 Allocate time for resource mobilization including monitoring and following up on additional funding opportunities even", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8df402d0-f312-4951-80d7-34a73084572c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8df402d0-f312-4951-80d7-34a73084572c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "P4P Lessons Learned about Primary Prevention of VAWG in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/p4p-lessons-learned-about-primary-prevention-vawg-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7c847819dfb0666a83eaaeb1c399a676f91264a9982b38529366329075d0f37"}}, "hash": "a7c847819dfb0666a83eaaeb1c399a676f91264a9982b38529366329075d0f37", "text": "if the project is already underway. \u2022 Seek high-quality technical guidance early in order to minimize potentially costly mistakes; and the evidence-based approach has a higher likelihood of success based on previous rigorous evaluation. \u2022 Invest in formative research or a situational analysis at the outset. Conclusions Critical reflection, feedback and data collected to date indicate that the process of intervention adaptation, implementation and evaluation of primary prevention programming has been a great personal and professional transformative experience for the teams, facilitators, volunteers and participants involved in the second phase of P4P. Important benefits and positive outcomes among intervention participants have been achieved, and great progress has been made in building capacities in the region for primary prevention of VAWG. Even though teams were initially concerned about the length and intensity of the work, the pilots all demonstrated the feasibility of the intervention models and the positive results that they generated. During the project inception phase, donors, project teams and community stakeholders need to build an understanding of what it takes to carry out evidence- based primary prevention to be able to plan and allocate resources realistically. We hope that this paper will contribute insight into such processes. The lessons learned and recommendations are summarized broadly under the following four steps for teams planning to undertake or continue primary prevention programming: Theme 6: Budget Lesson #22: Primary prevention is resource and time intensive, so plan accordingly. All P4P teams noted that evidence-based primary prevention with rigorous M&E was more costly and intense than they expected. In all projects unexpected issues arose, such as additional monitoring, additional training, extensions of activities or staff turnover, that all impacted budgets that were already very tight. Funding in general was scarce and project teams needed to come to an agreement on resource mobilization together rather than competing against one another. Innovative solutions to this included co-funding arrangements, in-kind agreements, sharing of resources minimizing the cost of complex administrative processes, and avoiding costly design or implementation mistakes. Making ample use of volunteers was one cost-efficient strategy. Often no money is set aside for good formative development work. Formative research is conducted prior to intervention piloting and evaluation. It allows for initial, systematic exploration of key processes and concepts within a particular cultural context as well as on aspects within the project area that will affect implementation, e.g., functional literacy rates; typical community schedule. It is very valuable to understand how specific risk factors manifest in a particular cultural context, and testing some intervention processes with communities during the design and planning stage of a large primary prevention project are recommended. This formative work should be linked to a situation analysis during the inception phase. Recommendations: \u2022 Develop a cohesive funding strategy with all project partners. \u2022 Manage funds carefully; be clear from the planning phase on funding needs and obligations. 42 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Invest in good on-going capacity development and continuous learning. A recurring theme throughout the lessons learned was capacity gaps, and P4P found that working with experienced technical experts, and maintaining regular contact through live calls, country visits, and workshops were essential to this process. Ideal would be an intensive, residential inception workshop with all teams to build relationships, strengthen understanding and guide initial planning for each country. Capacity development involves layers of learning so it is likely that topics, concepts and practices will need to be revisited especially as teams work to adapt and innovate for their local contexts. It was helpful in P4P to be able to come back to a consistent theoretical model and evidence- based programming recommendations when working with various teams. 2. Establish multi-sectoral partnerships and commit to personal and organisational transformation processes to embrace the guiding principles and core components of evidence-based primary prevention. Primary prevention is complex and there is a need for on-going and widespread advocacy for these evidence-based models. Establishing strong multi-sectoral partnerships at the outset allows for cross-sectoral sharing and learning, which can strengthen programming. This partnership needs to be grounded in the guiding principles and core components of effective primary prevention in order to collaborate well and to maximise the innovative and positive impact. 3. Build on and contribute to the evidence- base for primary prevention of VAWG Start with understanding what is effective and then innovate and adapt the models for the community context where the intervention will be implemented. But innovation and adaptation should not compromise the core components of effective primary prevention either.

A clear and thorough \u2013 but flexible \u2013 intervention plan is essential. Allow time for thorough development, adaptation, training and mobilization to maximize outcomes and impacts. Evidence-based primary prevention interventions may not be quick, cheap and easy, but it is remarkable that there are promising and effective models that can reliably result in less VAWG and improvements in gender equality, healthy relationships, and community cohesion. 43 LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS Effective violence prevention programme: meets the highest scientific standard for effectiveness (scientifically proven), as evidenced in published evaluations; has a significant, sustained preventive or deterrent effect or reduction of problem behaviour, the reduction of risk factors related to problem behaviour; or the enhancement of protective factors related to problem behaviour and has been replicated in different communities or settings.41 It has been found that multi-component interventions that engage with multiple stakeholders tend to be more effective in preventing VAWG than single-component ones. There are proven effective programmes, such as Microfinance and gender transformative approaches; Relationship-level interventions, group education with community outreach and community mobilization.42 Evidence-based: Derived from or supported by objective and scientific research. Fidelity: The degree of adherence to essential elements in the implementation of evidence-based clinical practice. Programmes with high fidelity are expected to have greater effectiveness in achieving desired client outcomes. Interrupted Time Series design: is a special type of time series where treatment/intervention occurred at a specific point and the series is broken up by the introduction of the intervention. If the treatment has a causal impact, the post- intervention series will have a different level or slope.43 Intervention: The systematic process of assessment and planning employed to remediate or prevent a social, educational, or developmental problem. Primary prevention: Any effort to stop the occurrence of violence by addressing and transforming the underlying harmful social norms, practices, and inequalities that drive violence against women and girls (VAWG) perpetration. This approach is largely driven by theoretical models informed by reliable data from large-scale population-based surveys on VAWG perpetration and the causal and risk factors of this behaviour. Promising violence prevention programmes: meet scientific standards for effectiveness without meeting all of the rigorous standards of effective programmes44. For primary violence prevention programmes, parenting programme falls in this category.45 ANNEX 1: GLOSSARY 41 National Crime Prevention Centre, Promising and Model Crime Prevention Programs.

The report will locate the P4P project and learnings within the broader context of the global primary prevention field to highlight the contributions that P4P is making to advance the field globally. The report will draw on outcome reports from each country: \u2022\ufffd Cambodia \u2013 quantitative and qualitative reports \u2022\ufffd Indonesia \u2013 qualitative reports \u2022\ufffd PNG \u2013 quantitative and qualitative reports \u2022\ufffd Viet Nam \u2013 qualitative and quantitative reports Because of the diversity of interventions and monitoring and evaluation M&E strategies across the four countries, the impact discussed will focus on three main themes (and these will be linked to an overarching theory of change): \u2022\ufffd Gender attitudes, including transforming harmful masculinities \u2022\ufffd Healthy relationships \u2022\ufffd Volunteerism These three themes were identified across all interventions and their respective M&E strategies will collect data on these themes in different ways. Additional notable findings from individual projects will be discussed as relevant (e.g., violence attitudes). The report will conclude with recommendations for primary prevention of VAWG programming that transform harmful masculinities and social norms and research based on the multiple data sources (i.e., quantitative and qualitative data from intervention participants, key informants, programme implementers, and technical advisors) drawn on throughout the report. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to express our deep appreciation for all people, communities, local and national organizations, local leaders, government ministries, and international agencies who embraced the P4P projects and drove them to success. We congratulate all teams on the exciting, positive results they achieved. We thank the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for its generous, continued support to P4P in Phase I and Phase II. We would like to acknowledge the P4P Technical Advisory Group and the P4P Steering Committee whose inputs and support throughout the P4P programme have helped to drive this programme to its success. We would like to thank the report reviewers and editors: Melissa Alvarado, Elizabeth Dartnall, Ingrid Fitzgerald, Koh Miyaoi, Jennie Williams and Michiyo Yamada. We hope that the positive results of the P4P projects will be nurtured and grow further so that women and girls are able to fully attain their right to live free from violence, and healthy, non- violent and equitable ways of being men and boys are the most common and accepted forms of masculinities. P4P has demonstrated that such a future is possible and the lessons shared here can assist teams taking up this important work. \u00a9Partners4Prevention 6 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1.

This report describes the evaluation results from the four countries where P4P was deeply involved in intervention design and/or monitoring and evaluation of the intervention pilot projects: Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam. Primary prevention of VAWG means addressing the underlying causal and risk factors driving this violence. At the core of effective primary prevention of VAWG is challenging prevailing norms around gender including gender inequality and power imbalances between men and women and problematic hegemonic gender roles and identities.1 Data from the United Nations Multi-Country Study2 indicate that common additional risk factors for perpetration of VAWG include: 1. Experiences of childhood trauma, including emotional abuse or neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or witnessing the abuse of a mother 2. Problematic relationship practices 3. Mental health challenges including depression and alcohol abuse 4. Involvement in violence outside the home 5. Socio-economic adversity including not having a high school education or current food insecurity ThEORY OF ChANGE Promoting gender equality, healthy relationships and volunteerism through effective intervention methodologies will result in people adopting gender equitable attitudes, beliefs, practices and identities; people having more positive relationships and safer and happier homes; greater community and social cohesion; and social diffusion of equitable, positive attitudes and practices throughout communities and social institutions. In this way, gender equality, healthy relationships throughout the lifespan, and positive social engagement and cohesion become normative. These norms will allow women and girls to be able to fully attain their right to live free from violence and for healthy, non-violent, equitable masculinities to be most common and accepted norms. 1 Michau, L., Horn, J., Bank, A., Dutt, M. & Zimmerman, C.

The intervention engaged adolescent girls and boys (aged 12\u201314) to adopt gender-equitable, respectful and caring attitudes and practices, develop skills to appropriately manage stress and mental health challenges, participate in productive and prosocial leisure or volunteer pursuits, and build healthy, non-violent, happy and respectful interpersonal relationships. The intervention also engaged caregivers of adolescents such as parents or other family members, teachers, youth service workers and community leaders on similar topics and skills in order to facilitate a supportive environment for adolescents that would support the intervention outcomes. \u2022\ufffd Women and girls are able to fully attain their right ways to live free from violence \u2022\ufffd Healthy, non-violent and equitable of being for men and boys are the most common and accepted forms of masculinity \u2022\ufffd Gender equality is the norm \u2022\ufffd Healthy relationships across the lifespan are the norm \u2022\ufffd Positive social engagement and cohesion are the norm Within Effective or Promising Intervention Approaches Promote Gender Equality Promote Healthy Relationships Promote Volunteerism 13 Indonesia: REIMAY UNFPA Indonesia in partnership with UN Women Indonesia supported two local NGOs (Indonesian Planned Parenthood Association \u2013 PKBI; the Institute for the Study and Empowerment of Women and Children \u2013 LP3A) to pilot a VAWG prevention intervention in two semi-rural villages in Papua province.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4478f4d-bc86-437e-8b6b-2f14e7ac025b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4478f4d-bc86-437e-8b6b-2f14e7ac025b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promising strides toward ending violence against women and girls in the Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6f57c624816a724a37f4b236a3dae30de785ecd43c587d1f1bc2cff569aba73"}, "2": {"node_id": "980cc589-e6aa-42ad-b9d1-07e44a612863", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ad2bdc93e9e48a3ba95d322e0879afe151e07ee09e0a0f3324199a07509ec78"}}, "hash": "6a00177ed16acbfa405b95451eb2c99ea149cd02d30fdacff58e11a0c2908f0e", "text": "piloted in Cambodia, this community-based intervention had two complementary components implemented in parallel: a participatory workshop series for young adolescents and one for caregivers of adolescents (e.g. parents, grandparents, guardians, teachers and youth service providers).

Using a community conversations model, the intervention addressed four themes: 1. Gender-Based Violence and Gender Equality 2. Peacebuilding and Conflict Resolution 3. Gender and Human Rights 4. Trauma Viet Nam: Male Advocate Clubs To Prevent Violence Against Women And Girls: Transforming Masculinities And Building Respectful And Equal Relationships With Women UN Women Viet Nam supported the Da Nang Women\u2019s Union to adapt and pilot a male advocacy intervention in one rural and one semi-urban commune within a broader violence prevention programme. The intervention aimed at transforming harmful masculinities, promoting gender equality, building relationship skills (e.g. being supportive, open communication, non-violent conflict resolution), and challenging the use of violence against women and children. In addition, throughout the intervention, participants were encouraged and given opportunities to participate in community activism and volunteerism activities (these were part of the broader VAWG prevention project that included a parenting programme and community activities) and then to develop and implement their own community advocacy and volunteerism activities to help build a safe and vibrant community and end VAWG. 14 Intervention design and contextualization process P4P committed to an evidence-based approach and supported country teams to translate local, national and international evidence into intervention design. The following steps were followed during the development and adaptation process: 1. Develop a theory of change and select a context for the intervention 2. Select existing effective or promising intervention model 3. Draft intervention materials with a participatory and consultative process 4. Revise intervention materials INTERVENTION EVALUATION METhODOLOGIES P4P\u2019s strong commitment to evidence-based programming meant that rigorous, high-quality monitoring and evaluation for each project was prioritized. The P4P technical team, together with country teams, developed feasible, relevant, locally meaningful and rigorous methodologies to monitor and evaluate the interventions. Each project had a tailored monitoring and evaluation (M&E) strategy and therefore the methodologies for each pilot evaluation differed; the strengths and limitations of these are discussed in each intervention evaluation report. A mix of quantitative and qualitative data was collected from direct beneficiaries, implementation team members and key stakeholders in each project. Results of pilot intervention evaluations These descriptions are based on the findings from each intervention evaluation. Because of the different methodologies utilized for each project, it was not possible to use the same measures across projects but data was collected on a core set of themes (gender, relationships and volunteerism). The measures for variables within each theme are discussed in detail in each project\u2019s intervention evaluation report. Although a meta-analysis of data from all projects is not possible we are able to present and discuss findings within each theme. The three themes correspond to the Theory of Change: 1. Gender equitable attitudes and transforming harmful masculinities 2. Healthy and happy relationships 3. Volunteerism Gender equitable attitudes and transforming harmful masculinities Quantitative data on gender equitable attitudes showed mixed results. Intervention participants in Indonesia showed significant improvements in gender equitable attitudes. However, there was no statistically significant change between baseline and endline scores on this measure among intervention participants in Cambodia and Papua New Guinea. No quantitative data on gender attitudes was collected in Viet Nam. 15 The qualitative data provide a more nuanced view of changes in gender equitable attitudes and harmful masculinities. Across all four sites, participants reported changing gender inequitable behaviour, most often in the context of household chores. Prior to the intervention, most households followed traditional norms of a gendered division of labour with most of the burden of the family caring and household work assigned to women and girls. However, after the intervention many participants reported sharing childcare and household work more equitably among all family members old enough to take on specific responsibilities. Some men described an increase in appreciation and empathy for women and girls after they gained insight through the intervention discussions into the hardships that gender inequality and patriarchal norms create for women and girls. Happy and healthy relationships Overwhelmingly, intervention participants and facilitators reported a multitude of improvements in various relationships. Family relationships \u2013 especially those between caregivers and adolescents, and adolescents and their siblings \u2013 became more supportive and less violent, and many participants reported that these changes made the relationships more rewarding and warm. Caregivers and adolescents in Cambodia and Indonesia especially reflected on transformations in their understanding of the negative effects of harsh discipline and the value of expressing and discussing emotions. Another significant theme of findings from P4P projects is an improvement in intimate relationships such as between spouses or other intimate partners.

In addition, many facilitators and intervention participants described reductions in or stopping sexual violence in their relationships (most notably in Viet Nam), strategies to reduce tension and engage in productive conflict resolution to avoid violence (especially in Cambodia), and overall more positive interactions between spouses or partners reported across projects. There were some reports, particularly out of Papua New Guinea, of improved community relations with increased cooperation and positive conflict resolution. Volunteerism Most participants and volunteer facilitators found their involvement in volunteerism to be very fulfilling and planned to continue with these efforts in the future. The most common forms of volunteerism were participants and facilitators across projects sharing lessons and skills from the intervention with family and friends, and engaging in awareness-raising of VAWG in their communities. Participants and facilitators from Indonesia and Viet Nam reported that their involvement in volunteerism through the interventions built their leadership skills and self- confidence, enabling them to be agents of change in their communities. In Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam, the intervention was structured to include specific, mentored volunteerism opportunities for participants such as at community events (e.g. a Lake Festival in Indonesia or a family holiday in Viet Nam) or using a drawing competition or role plays to build community members\u2019 awareness of VAWG, gender equality and happy relationships. In Papua New Guinea, volunteerism efforts grew more organically from the intervention; for example, some participants formed a group to regularly help elderly members of their communities to tend their vegetable gardens which they rely on for food, others visited a non-intervention community to share their learnings and try to develop a 16 solution to the problems caused by brewing alcohol in the neighbouring community, and another group formed a farming collective to strengthen their negotiation with buyers. Intervention acceptability All project M&E plans included systematic collection of feedback3 from participants, facilitators and key stakeholders about the intervention and its implementation in order to understand the overall acceptability of the intervention methods and content. Overall, the beneficiaries, implementers and other stakeholders were all very positive about the interventions and their experiences of participating in them. They felt that the content, skills and concepts were valuable and that the participatory methodologies were enjoyable and promoted learning. Most respondents were also very enthusiastic about the opportunity to address issues they felt were important in their community and that most skills or changes could be applied within their daily lives. This indicates that the interventions were, in general, relevant to people and communities. There were a few detractors of the P4P interventions in each community but they were in the minority. Many came to view the interventions positively after their concerns were answered. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The following achievements were made in the pilot interventions: 1. Intervention participants began to adopt gender equitable practices and attitudes, though continued work on this transformation and integration into gender equitable beliefs and identities is needed. 2. Intervention participants reported significant improvements in a multitude of relationships including more supportive and non-violent or less violent relationships between caregivers and adolescents, adolescents and their younger siblings, spouses or partners, and community and peer relationships among adolescents and adults. This was a particular area of success for the P4P projects. 3. There was evidence of intervention participants sharing their learning and skills with their families and to some extent with friends or community members as well as some burgeoning community volunteerism in various forms indicating the potential for the attitudes, practices and identities promoted in the intervention as well as community- driven development work to continue to grow equitable, non-violent norms. 4. The capacity of project partners and implementing organizations to design and implement rigorous VAWG primary prevention programmes in communities was strengthened. These are all promising results indicating good evidence that the P4P interventions did make strides in promoting gender equality, healthy relationships and volunteerism. Further, it is encouraging that communities enjoyed the interventions and found them valuable. While interventions for the primary prevention of VAWG may be demanding during development and piloting, they are well 3 As with the outcomes findings, details of feedback from stakeholders in particular countries can be found in their outcomes reports and there is additional discussion of some key points in the P4P lessons learned reflection report: Partners for Prevention Lessons Learned about Primary Prevention of Violence Against Women and Girls in Asia and the Pacific Region. 17", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4479ec06-63f0-4ba0-84a5-72e9189ce7d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "4479ec06-63f0-4ba0-84a5-72e9189ce7d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promising strides toward ending violence against women and girls in the Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acad32faa1c0102fdd01ef85646ab14f2e11808dd7e71c0b95f9677741001165"}, "3": {"node_id": "87fe0d2e-f7fd-4f67-be38-f7519821777b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52ed03b7edb9f331263b5ebccf2cd9d25640e2cf42ded40c1d6c348a4d4463cd"}}, "hash": "405e87333d23a1fd5ce218ed6b3e09b4e4ea54ca4d90d8db6effe5e5b4ed5dc0", "text": "worth the investment given the promising results achieved across all four pilot projects in the P4P programme.

Partners for Prevention (P4P) \u2013 a joint UNDP, UNFPA, UN Women and UNV regional programme \u2013 aims to contribute to the prevention of VAWG in Asia and the Pacific. During the first phase of P4P (P4P I), the programme focused on building understanding and awareness of the epidemic of VAWG in Asian and Pacific contexts through the three main areas of (1) Effective Communications; (2) Networking and Capacity Development; and (3) Research, Knowledge and Policy Advice. During the second phase (P4P II), the programme focused on primary prevention interventions with an aim to achieve the following outputs: 1. Output 1: Interventions are implemented, monitored and evaluated in selected sites to prevent men and boys\u2019 perpetration of violence against women and girls, and to generate new learning. 2. Output 2: Selected national partners have increased their capacity to design and implement rigorous evidence-based interventions and policies for the prevention of VAWG. 3. Output 3: Regional bodies and organizations have a greater number of resources to support effective programmes and policies for the prevention of VAWG. P4P II supported the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of localized VAWG prevention interventions to address specific risk factors for VAWG in Bangladesh,4 Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam. This report describes the evidence-based theoretical model P4P used to guide the development and piloting of VAWG primary prevention interventions and then goes on to describe the process of development, piloting, and monitoring and evaluation for each project. The report then describes the interventions and highlights the outcomes achieved by the interventions in the various projects before concluding and identifying the next steps for primary prevention of VAWG work in the region. EXTENT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS Globally, more than one-third of women aged 15 and over have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence in their lifetimes.5 There is significant variation in prevalence estimates of VAWG victimization between countries: in the World Health Organization (WHO) multi-country study on women\u2019s health and domestic violence, which surveyed women between 15 and 49 years old, the range of lifetime prevalence of physical or sexual violence was reported to be between 15 4 P4P\u2019s role in Bangladesh was as a capacity-building partner and the focus of the team\u2019s work on this project was supporting UN Volunteers to implement advocacy activities that supported a larger intervention that was being trialed. Because P4P was not involved in the intervention development or monitoring and evaluation, we are not able to include discussion of this project and its achievements within this report. 5 Devries, K.M., Mak, J.Y., Garcia-Moreno, C., Petzold, M., Child, J.C., Falder, G., Lim, S., Bacchus, L.J., Engell, R.E., Rosenfeld, L., Pallitto, C., Vos, T., Abrahams, N. & Watts, C.H.

CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS There are countless negative health consequences of VAWG including physical injuries, a higher likelihood of acquiring HIV, and a higher likelihood of having a low birthweight baby.12 In addition, there are a slew of negative mental health consequences associated with VAWG including 6 Garcia-Moreno, C., Jansen, H.A.F.M., Ellsberg, M. & Watts, C.

Therefore, the fundamental human rights violation of violence against women and girls needs to be addressed urgently.

At the core of effective primary prevention of VAWG is challenging prevailing norms around gender including gender inequality and power imbalances between men and women and problematic hegemonic gender roles and identities.24 Violence Against Women and Girls Prevention Interventions Recent evidence reviews have identified effective and promising intervention approaches for VAWG prevention and include:25 1.

While transforming gender-power imbalances is at the centre of successful VAWG prevention, addressing multiple risk factors across the social ecological model in sustained and coordinated multi-sectoral efforts is essential. These efforts should encourage personal and collective critical thinking and skills building, and inspire change through benefits-based or aspirational approaches that focus on the positive changes participants can expect to gain, instead of solely focusing on issues that should be avoided or taking a punitive, judgemental approach. Experiential and participatory learning approaches are more effective rather than didactic or \u2018lecturing\u2019 approaches and there is no proof of effect for standalone communication campaigns that do not provide opportunities for discussion and questioning.27 Recent reviews28 of global evidence for VAWG prevention interventions found that few interventions have been rigorously evaluated with published results \u2013 especially in low resource contexts \u2013 and thus it is difficult to document all prevention efforts. While most evaluations have been conducted in high-income countries, intervention evaluations in low- and middle-income countries are increasing. In particular, multiple evaluations have been conducted in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and a few in South America. The prevention intervention evaluations conducted in Asia and the Pacific region have primarily occurred in Bangladesh and India.29 Indeed, during Partners for Prevention Phase I, it was noted that VAWG prevention work in the region was mostly small scale and isolated with few links to comprehensive programming or evidence-based approaches identified in the global field. Therefore, Partners for Prevention Phase II addressed a particular need to generate knowledge and build capacity on VAWG prevention in countries in the Asia and the Pacific region. ThEORY OF ChANGE FOR P4P II INTERVENTIONS There was an overarching core Theory of Change for the P4P II interventions and then in each of the four participating countries, the Theory of Change was adapted for the specific context. As noted above, the Theory of Change is based on the assumption that addressing driving factors underlying VAWG perpetration will prevent such violence from occurring. There is no single theoretical model or intervention package that is effective in preventing VAWG. Rather rigorous research has found several, varied interventions to be promising or effective in diverse contexts.30 Therefore, adaptation and continued development and refinement within particular contexts is essential. The overarching Theory of Change for Partners for Prevention is based on evidence from the UN MCS31 \u2013 including data from individual country studies \u2013 and international promising practices.32 The Theory of Change is illustrated below and a description follows. 26 Michau, L., Horn, J., Bank, A., Dutt, M., & Zimmerman, C.

Greater community and social cohesion. Social diffussion of attitudes, practices, and identities through community groups and institutions. Positive social engagement and cohesion becomes the norm. 26 Theory of Change Description Research has repeatedly found that various manifestations of gender inequality and patriarchal constructions of gender are at the root of VAWG.33 In addition, various types of problematic relationship dynamics across the lifespan have been found to be associated with VAWG. These include: abuse and neglect during childhood, witnessing domestic violence during childhood, frequent quarrelling with an intimate partner, rigid gender role expectations, and commonly accepted social narratives of violence as normal in relationships.34 Communities where instability, disadvantage, violence (ranging from individuals fighting to gang conflict), normative beliefs around patriarchal gender roles and acceptance of violence against women, as well as poor social cohesion are prevalent, are likely to have higher levels of VAWG.35 In order to transform problematic social norms around patriarchy and violence, it is essential for communities to build on their existing strengths and drive the transformation from within. Volunteerism can build community and social cohesion around positive and healthy gender and relationship norms, and is essential to create an enabling and empowering environment that supports an end to VAWG. Addressing these factors in interventions is essential for VAWG prevention. At the core of the Partners for Prevention interventions Theory of Change are three components: \u2022\ufffd Promote gender equality \u2022\ufffd Promote healthy relationships \u2022\ufffd Promote volunteerism These three main components are conceptually and practically interlinked. That is, a gender- power analysis cannot ignore how men and women relate to one another in different types of relationships, and constructions of gender drive many relationship expectations and practices. Further, equitable relationships are part of having a healthy and safe relationship. Volunteerism means that people go beyond embracing gender equitable and healthy relationship norms for themselves and share these ideas and skills with others. For ease of reference and clarity, these three components are illustrated and discussed separately. Gender equality is promoted through building understanding of the manifestations and effects of gender inequality in daily life; challenging patriarchal constructions of gender; and transforming harmful masculinities. Gender transformative interventions have been found to be essential in effectively addressing VAWG.36 Healthy relationships are promoted through building understanding of various forms of violence or abuse and their impacts; strengthening relationship-building skills such as being non-violent, being supportive, good communication and conflict resolution; and developing healthy relationship ideals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e120da30-9cb7-4300-b8f1-ab180ee11219": {"__data__": {"id_": "e120da30-9cb7-4300-b8f1-ab180ee11219", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promising strides toward ending violence against women and girls in the Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "410ebce4edc19a30b8e4f680b327003f24a5f7a692acff1f89851ce0e61fc424"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a8584a5-8281-4e9d-aeab-73291b205263", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e8b20fe39666fb17110a4af0e736d27358d45ea54e2627c6dfea8efb5526e88"}}, "hash": "c94ad947e8036677624d1ca50a348ff5e8135a8e2a4d1f2536785606f5da11c9", "text": "Relationship interventions including parenting and school-based programmes have been found to be effective or promising in VAWG prevention.37 33 UN Women (2015); Fulu, E. & Heise, L.

Addressing Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence Among Adolescents: Emerging 27 Volunteerism encompasses both formal and informal social behaviour or activities undertaken of free will, for the public good and where monetary reward is not the principal motivating factor.38 There is great value in volunteers being intrinsically motivated and personally committed to a cause \u2013 this conviction is likely to positively impact on their dedication to drive social norm change in their communities, and to embrace and model positive social norms. Volunteerism is promoted through supporting people to share the ideas, skills and practices they have learned in the intervention with others in their social circles such as family, neighbours, co-workers and community members; creating opportunities for people to engage in activities that enhance community development and safety, and overall positive engagement with and investment in the community.39 This component is both an intervention strategy and a social diffusion strategy to expand the impact of the intervention. Community mobilization approaches have been found effective in reducing VAWG.40 The P4P theoretical model identified the core factors to address \u2013 gender equality, healthy relationships, and volunteerism \u2013 and also focused on the importance of addressing these within effective or promising intervention methodologies: \u2022\ufffd Given the sensitive nature of the factors being addressed and the goal of deep, personal transformation, it is important that intervention workshop sessions are considered a safe space for open discussion and group processes.41 The structure of the group as egalitarian and non-hierarchical should model the safe, equal and vibrant spaces that the intervention promotes and aims to inspire in homes, communities and social structures and institutions. \u2022\ufffd Facilitating such sensitive and deep transformative work is complex and requires facilitators to have respect within the community as well as being role models for the attitudes, identities and practices that the intervention is promoting.

These changes in individuals, relationships and communities will lead to changes in social norms where gender equality, healthy relationships throughout the lifespan, and positive social engagement and cohesion are normative for all people. In this way, there will be no more VAWG, women and girls will be able to fully attain their right to live free from violence, and men and boys will adopt healthy, non-violent and equitable forms of masculinity.

In addition, the implementing organization (Provincial Department of Women\u2019s Affairs) along with a UN Volunteer and representatives from the National Ministry of Health and UNFPA Cambodia provided regular mentoring and support for facilitators throughout the implementation period. The group sessions were conducted in Khmer and the intervention guides were available in English and Khmer. Intervention evaluation The formative evaluation of this intervention sought to determine the feasibility, acceptability, accessibility and potential impacts of the intervention. The mixed method evaluation study included: (a) a quantitative within-group comparison of change using baseline and endline self-complete questionnaire data from intervention participants (100 adolescent girls, 42 adolescent boys, 116 female caregivers and 24 male caregivers); (b) qualitative feedback about the intervention experience and impact from intervention participants at the end of the intervention (5 focus group discussions (FGD) with adolescents, 5 FGDs with caregivers); and (c) qualitative feedback sought from key stakeholders/informants including the intervention facilitators and supervisors (1 FGD and 4 in-depth interviews (IDI)) from each community in the intervention. The study followed ethical guidelines for VAWG research49 and received permission and support to conduct the study from the National Ethics Committee for Health Research from the Cambodian Ministry of Health. Key results: 1. Reductions in violent punishments towards adolescents 2. Decreased acceptance of violence 3. Increased access to support services Indonesia - Reimay Intervention outline UNFPA Indonesia in partnership with UN Women Indonesia supported two local NGOs (Indonesian Planned Parenthood Association \u2013 PBI; Institute for the Study and Empowerment of Papuan Women and Children \u2013 LP3A) to pilot a VAWG prevention intervention in two semi- rural villages in Papua province. The intervention name means: Reaching Papuan Prosperity. This project built on the Violence Free Villages model50 that has been implemented in several communities and focuses on advocacy, response services such as traditional mechanisms, health services, legal services, counselling and awareness of VAWG issues. 49 WHO Ethical guideline: http://www.who.int/ethics/research/en/ 50 This model focused on awareness-raising of VAWG in villages, supporting villages to develop action plans to prevent and respond to cases of VAWG particularly through early detection, and referral to appropriate services. http://indonesia.unfpa. org/en/news/creating-safe-villages-free-violence-papua 31 The intervention over 10 months aimed for adolescent girls and boys aged 12\u201316 years to have gender equitable attitudes and be equipped to build healthy, non-violent, happy and respectful interpersonal relationships supported by influential adults in their lives and communities. Intervention implementation Similar to the intervention piloted in Cambodia, this community-based intervention had two complementary components implemented in parallel: a participatory workshop series for young adolescents and one for caregivers of adolescents (e.g. parents, grandparents, guardians, teachers and youth service providers). The group size, format, delivery method and intervention content was the same as that for the Cambodian intervention described above, but during the process of adaptation and contextualization, slight changes were made to better fit with the local context. The intervention sessions were conducted in the local language \u2013 Bahasa \u2013 and the intervention guides were available in both English and Bahasa. Facilitators were selected and trained by the implementing organizations and ongoing mentoring and support, including supervision sessions, was provided by a UN Volunteer and staff from the implementing organizations. Intervention evaluation The intervention evaluation methodology included (a) collecting qualitative data in group discussions from adolescent (4 FGDs) and caregiver (4 FGDs) participants before and after the intervention including reflection and feedback on their intervention experience, and documenting stories of change; and (b) qualitative data from intervention facilitators and supervisors (1 FGD). In addition to the rich qualitative data collected, the study also employed a short questionnaire before and after the intervention to provide additional data on the impact of the intervention on gender equitable attitudes (38 adolescent girls, 43 adolescent boys, 37 female caregivers and 34 male caregivers).

It reached 2,800 people to prevent and reduce gender- based violence while building peaceful communities in Bougainville, addressing gender- based violence (GBV), gender and human rights. Using a community conversations model, the intervention addressed four themes: 1. Gender-Based Violence and Gender Equality 2. Peacebuilding and Conflict Resolution 3. Gender and Human Rights 4. Trauma In addition to the community conversations, community counsellors were also trained and available for additional support to participants who requested it. Further, facilitators and community counsellors referred participants to a safe house or additional counselling services through NCFR. Mixed-sex, participatory group sessions primarily for adults were facilitated by trained community members who received a small stipend for their service. Groups met over a period of 12 months and followed a 22-session intervention guide. The intervention guide was available in English, but all training and group sessions were conducted in the local dialect of Tok Pisin. Intervention evaluation The quantitative evaluation of this intervention had a one group, pre-test post-test design that only allowed comparison within groups between the baseline (pre-intervention) and \u00a9Partners4Prevention 33 the endline (immediately following the intervention, 12 months after the baseline). The intervention implementation period of 12 months was agreed with NCFR and UN Women. This non-experimental design was chosen based on the available capacity, funds and resources. The study sample included matched cases for 344 men and 407 women. These participants self-completed a standardized questionnaire on a tablet device with an audio-enhanced application that enabled participants to read and/or listen to each item in either Tok Pisin or English. The qualitative evaluation (conducted at endline only) of this intervention included 11 FGDs and 10 IDIs with intervention participants, 2 FGDs and 3 IDIs with intervention facilitators and counsellors, and 3 IDIs with key informants. The study followed all ethical guidelines for VAWG research and was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board of the Papua New Guinea Institute for Medical Research and the Medical Research Advisory Committee of the Papua New Guinea National Department of Health. Key results: 1. Community commitment to ending VAWG including support services, strengthened governance structure and responsibility for peace building 2. Reduced alcohol-related GBV 3. Increased self-reflection and change for peaceful communities Viet Nam Intervention outline Male Advocate Clubs To Prevent Violence Against Women And Girls: Transforming Masculinities And Building Respectful And Equal Relationships With Women in Viet Nam. UN Women Viet Nam supported the Da Nang Women\u2019s Union to adapt and pilot a male advocacy intervention in one rural and one semi-urban commune within a broader violence prevention programme. \u00a9Partners4Prevention 34 The intervention engaged 120 male youths and older men to transform harmful masculinities, promote gender equality, build relationship skills (e.g. being supportive, open communication and non-violent conflict resolution), and challenge the use of violence against women and children. In addition, throughout the intervention, participants were encouraged and given opportunities to participate in community activism and volunteerism activities (these were part of the broader VAWG prevention project, Community mobilization in prevention of violence against women and girls in Da Nang, Viet Nam that included a parenting programme and community activities) and then to develop and implement their own community advocacy and volunteerism activities to help build a safe and vibrant community and end VAWG. The intervention content included: \u2022\ufffd Constructions of gender and masculinities with a focus on challenging and transforming harmful masculinities and promoting gender equality \u2022\ufffd Communication and conflict-resolution skills \u2022\ufffd Understanding VAWG and its effects \u2022\ufffd Supporting survivors of VAWG \u2022\ufffd Sexual violence and healthy sex \u2022\ufffd Healthy relationship ideals \u2022\ufffd Being a VAWG prevention advocate in the community Intervention implementation Community-based, men-only group sessions were facilitated by trained community volunteers (an older respected, community volunteer and a youth volunteer were paired to co-facilitate sessions).

Increased awareness and understanding of positive masculinities, gender equality and prevention of VAWG 2. A willingness to share their learnings among the community. 3. Increased volunteerism, less acceptance of violence, better relationship quality, lower depression, empowerment, and a commitment to continue VAWG prevention DESCRIPTION OF INTERVENTION DESIGN AND CONTEXTUALISATION PROCESS P4P\u2019s commitment to an evidence-based approach meant that the intervention design began with evidence-informed theory of change models based on country data from the UN MCS where available. Second, most intervention design began by drawing from and adapting effective, evidence-based intervention models where possible.51 In Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam, P4P assisted with intervention design and adaptation, whereas the intervention used in Papua New Guinea was developed by a local faith-based organization; P4P and UN Women\u2019s role was to assist in formalizing the intervention into a comprehensive manual. Step 1: Develop a theory of change and select a context for the intervention Intervention design began with the development of a theory of change using country findings on risk factors for VAWG perpetration from the UN MCS. Intervention selection was based on alignment of the theoretical model with country programme goals and plans taking into consideration existing strong partnerships between UN agencies and implementing organizations. Next, teams had to strategically plan the context in which they planned to pilot the intervention \u2013 for example, considering the target participants (e.g. adult men and women, adolescent boys and girls, etc.) and where to locate the intervention (e.g. community-based, school- based, faith-based, workplace-based, etc.). Teams in Cambodia and Indonesia selected a community-based approach that engaged adolescent girls and boys, and adults from the community who were caregivers of adolescents (e.g. parents, teachers, youth service providers and youth leaders). These interventions were implemented by a government ministry in Cambodia and by NGOs in Indonesia. In Viet Nam, the team selected a male advocacy intervention to be integrated into a larger VAWG prevention programme pilot.

This adaptation focused on culturally contextualizing the materials and activities. For example, scenario sketches were contextualized to be locally relevant (e.g. instead of going to a house party or a community football game, characters in a sketch would go to a community wedding party or celebration day) and all character names were changed to typical local names. Socio-cultural contextualization in most settings primarily focused on making sexual references less explicit to align with local sensitivities. The next stage of adaptations focused on translation and providing additional explanation or illustrations of some concepts that were difficult to translate or thought to be unfamiliar to potential implementing team members. Translation proved to be a particularly complex task because verbatim translations were not adequate and sometimes such translations lost the original meaning of an activity or concept or skill (a more detailed discussion of lessons learned around translation is provided in another report).54 The adapted materials then underwent extensive review and consultation with multiple national and local stakeholders identified by the project team. Participatory workshops proved to be very useful in bringing together stakeholders, project team members, and national and international technical experts to continue to adapt and strengthen the intervention model and materials prior to piloting. After a few rounds of review and feedback by the project team and other stakeholders, the two technical consultants were able to finalize the intervention model and materials to be used in piloting. Step 4: Revise intervention materials While piloting the intervention materials, supervisors (with facilitator input) documented the strengths and weaknesses of them and made specific recommendations for revisions. In addition, in every project we sought feedback from intervention participants about the intervention experience and their recommendations for improvements. This data, together with evaluation data, and inputs from the project team and key national and local stakeholders during consultative workshops were used to make further evidence-based revisions to the intervention model and materials. for Prevention Regional Learning Community for East and Southeast Asia.

Again, P4P\u2019s strong commitment to evidence-based programming meant that rigorous, high-quality monitoring and evaluation for each project was prioritized. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) methodology is considered the gold standard in intervention evaluation research,55 however, recently there has been increasing acknowledgment of the limitations of this methodology and acceptance of the validity of other rigorous methodologies.56 RCTs were not feasible for the pilot projects within the P4P programme because of budget constraints, the small project size, timeframe limitations, and low technical capacity. Therefore, the P4P technical team together with country teams developed feasible, relevant, locally meaningful and rigorous methodologies to monitor and evaluate the interventions. While these methodologies may not provide conclusive evidence of effectiveness they did document promising effects. Each project had a tailored M&E strategy and therefore the methodologies for each pilot evaluation differed; the strengths and limitations of these are discussed in each intervention evaluation report. A mix of quantitative and qualitative data was collected from direct beneficiaries, implementation team members and key stakeholders. This allowed insight into the potential outcomes and impact of the intervention as well as process-oriented insights that were invaluable for contextualizing the findings and making recommendations for strengthening interventions and informing future programming.

This data is reported here. Quantitative data on gender equitable attitudes showed mixed results. Intervention participants in Indonesia showed significant improvements in gender equitable attitudes. However, there was no statistically significant change between baseline and endline scores on this measure among intervention participants in Cambodia and Papua New Guinea. No quantitative data on gender attitudes was collected in Viet Nam. Gender attitudes, identities and practices are difficult to measure quantitatively, especially in culturally diverse settings.59 We used previously validated and standard measures used in other studies in the field.60 It is possible that the participants experienced no significant changes after the intervention, but there are other possible explanations. Statistically significant changes were hard to detect because the studies were generally small, statistically underpowered and without a control group. The indicator is complex; the measures used may not be sensitive enough to accurately measure it. Finally, transformation in gender equality may take more time. Longer-term follow-up measures are needed to detect results. The qualitative data provide a more nuanced view of changes in gender equitable attitudes and harmful masculinities. Across all four sites, participants reported changing gender inequitable behaviour, most often in the context of household chores. This focus on the family and household may be because interventions were focused on these relationships and context rather than broader political and economic participation. Prior to the intervention, most households followed traditional norms of a gendered division of labour with most of the burden of the family caring and household work assigned to women and girls. However, after the intervention, many participants reported sharing childcare and household work more equitably among all family members old enough to take on specific responsibilities. From men\u2019s perspectives, this was often phrased as \u201chelping\u201d their wives indicating that they did not take full ownership of and shared responsibility for family and household work. Several adolescent participants also described changes in their views that men and women are equally capable of the same work. Some men described an increase in appreciation and empathy for women and girls after they gained insight into the hardships that gender inequality and patriarchal norms create for women and girls through the intervention discussions. All of these examples are very encouraging. There were, however, some instances where gender inequitable attitudes and behaviours persisted even after the intervention.

(2013). 39 These findings signal that positive changes in ideas about gender and masculinities have begun among participants. It is possible that participants and facilitators found it easier to make concrete changes in their lives relating to gender equitable norms whereas changes that are more abstract (such as changes in attitude and identity) may take more time and potentially more sustained intervention work. The value of these incremental changes should not be diminished, because there is evidence that equitable practices and equitable caregiving in the home is more likely to lead to men having gender equitable attitudes and practices later in life.61 Problematic constructions of gender and harmful masculinities are widely and deeply entrenched at the individual, family, community and societal level; they are woven into our very identities and social order so it is no wonder that they are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76ea9f74-5dd9-4c91-9c87-c509a6d36381": {"__data__": {"id_": "76ea9f74-5dd9-4c91-9c87-c509a6d36381", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promising strides toward ending violence against women and girls in the Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08a25c8a4b32b9e1b3c284e334314d57d84ff022b829a6dcb3b44b0fdb969e53"}}, "hash": "08a25c8a4b32b9e1b3c284e334314d57d84ff022b829a6dcb3b44b0fdb969e53", "text": "particularly challenging to transform. However, data from the P4P pilot studies as well as many other prevention studies show that transformation of gender equitable attitudes and behaviour is possible which makes it all the more important to continue to invest in these evidence-based approaches to build gender equality and positive masculinities for the benefit of all. Healthy and happy relationships The theoretical model outlines the importance of promoting healthy, non-violent relationships of all kinds to prevent intimate partner violence as a form of VAWG and also to interrupt the intergenerational cycle of violence by having healthy, non-violent family relationships. Frequent quarrels, emotional abuse and neglect, and harsh punishments (especially during childhood) are indicative risk factors for later relationships to be violent or abusive. Overwhelmingly, intervention participants and facilitators reported many improvements in various relationships. Family relationships \u2013 especially those between caregivers and adolescents, and adolescents and their siblings \u2013 became more supportive and less violent, and many participants reported that these changes made the relationships more rewarding and warm. Caregivers and adolescents in Cambodia and Indonesia especially reflected on transformations in their understanding of the negative effects of harsh discipline and the value of expressing and discussing emotions. Another significant theme of findings from P4P projects is the improvement in intimate relationships such as between spouses or other intimate partners. It was remarkable to see significant quantitative reductions in physical violence perpetration by men in Papua New Guinea as well as similar reductions in women\u2019s experiences of emotional, physical and sexual partner violence in the same project. In addition, many facilitators and intervention participants described reductions in or stopping sexual violence in their relationships (most notably in Viet Nam), strategies to reduce tension and engage in productive conflict resolution to avoid violence (especially in Cambodia), and overall more positive interactions between spouses or partners reported across projects. There were some reports, particularly out of Papua New Guinea, of improved community relations with increased cooperation and positive conflict resolution. Some facilitators and participants in the other projects also described using skills from the intervention that benefited their relationships with others in the community; however, this 61 Levtov, R. G., Barker, G., Contreras-Urbina, M., Heilman, B., & Verma, R. (2014). Pathways to Gender-equitable Men:Findings from the International Men and Gender Equality Survey in Eight Countries. Men and Masculinities, 17(5), 467-501. doi:10.1177/1097184x14558234 40 appeared to be an incremental change only among some and was not explored in-depth in the evaluations due to time and budget constraints. Positive changes in relationships were reportedly due to changes in communication styles. This link was emphasized especially by participants and facilitators in Cambodia and Indonesia who spoke of using more polite and respectful language and \u201csweet words\u201d which improved their relationships and inspired similar changes in those around them even though they had not directly participated in the intervention. Another important skill promoted by interventions was around conflict resolution and peacebuilding where people are encouraged to understand others\u2019 perspectives and express their own views respectfully and work towards a mutually acceptable solution. Participants reported using the initial steps of proactively reducing tension in conflict situations and prioritizing dialogue in various situations. Improvements in relationships can also be seen through a gendered lens. Many changes described within the family or household where men took on more chores and caring tasks and appreciated women\u2019s work more, are likely to have had a positive impact on relationships in the home and increased satisfaction in intimate relationships.62 The potential intergenerational impact of improvements in relationships especially within homes and between caregivers and young people is particularly exciting. Boys who grow up in emotionally supportive and caring homes without harsh punishments and warm relationships with caregivers, together with the equitable caregiving discussed above will have a significantly reduced risk of becoming violent men when they grow up.63 This kind of impact will contribute to the ultimate elimination of VAWG. The participants\u2019 and facilitators\u2019 enthusiastic reports on improvements in their various relationships as well as the significant reductions in intimate partner violence found in Papua New Guinea illustrate accomplishments that the P4P interventions had on people\u2019s lives and relationships. Volunteerism An innovative component of the P4P interventions was to promote ongoing activism and transformation through volunteerism. Each project and the programme as a whole integrated volunteerism in different ways and these are described in more detail in the volunteerism lessons learned report. Volunteerism is social behaviour or activities undertaken with free will, for the general public good and where monetary reward is not the principal motivating factor, although it is recognised that volunteering brings significant benefit to the volunteer as well.64", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70f269bd-600b-4817-b8a7-42b786178356": {"__data__": {"id_": "70f269bd-600b-4817-b8a7-42b786178356", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promising strides toward ending violence against women and girls in the Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f052f44d98def1ced41be32f94db09408ea642e0cd2272fef9fab56e6d50bf1b"}, "3": {"node_id": "13a69e15-68f6-4e9c-96ca-c92dbcc3016e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "850f945d74911fc812f4d120cc08c57642e7e9c2515e64557280b2783ce3ecce"}}, "hash": "47c57937a7aa6ae1b35a0f8a75e0b1795c134399540e7abdd6d290efae1109dd", "text": "It encompasses both formal and informal activities, local and international volunteers, and covers a broad range of issues.

Literature Review for the State of the World\u2019s Volunteerism Report 2018: Building resilient communities in a turbulent world. UNV. 41 found their involvement in volunteerism to be very fulfilling and planned to continue with these efforts in the future. Participants and facilitators from Indonesia and Viet Nam reported that their involvement in volunteerism through the interventions built their leadership skills and self-confidence to be an agent of change in their communities. In Cambodia, Indonesia, and Viet Nam the intervention was structured to include specific, mentored volunteerism opportunities for participants such as at community events (e.g., a Lake Festival in Indonesia or a family holiday in Viet Nam) or using a drawing competition or role plays to build community members\u2019 awareness of VAWG, gender equality, and happy relationships. In Papua New Guinea volunteerism efforts grew more organically from the intervention; for example, some participants formed a group to regularly help elderly members of their communities to tend their vegetable gardens which they rely on for food, others visited a non-intervention community to share their learnings and try to develop a solution to the problems caused by brewing alcohol in the neighbouring community, and another group formed a farming collective to strengthen their negotiation with buyers. Many of the volunteerism activities promoted links between the intervention implementers and participants with other organisations or leaders in the community (for example, the Women\u2019s Union and Farmer\u2019s Union became involved in the Viet Nam project and religious leaders become involved in the Indonesia project). These linkages may provide ongoing opportunities for VAWG prevention and social norm transformation. The positive benefit of volunteerism to individuals and communities supports the P4P interventions and aims to build enabling environments that support non-violence and equality. Further, the volunteerism efforts appear to promote local ownership of VAWG prevention and efforts to build gender equality so that the outcomes of the intervention may be sustained and grown. Reflection on findings within the context of the Theory of Change In the theoretical model, the P4P interventions broadly aimed to promote gender equality, healthy relationships, and volunteerism to ultimately achieve violence-free lives for women and girls and non-violent masculinities to become the norm for men and boys. Three out of four P4P projects adapted effective or promising intervention methodologies and addressed the three core themes of the theory of change model. The result was that high-quality interventions were implemented by trained facilitators in various communities and reached many individual adolescent girls and boys and adult women and men. Considering the overview of the findings presented here, the following achievements were made: \u2022\ufffd Intervention participants began to adopt gender equitable practices and attitudes, though continued work on this transformation and integration into gender equitable beliefs and identities is needed. \u00a9Partners4Prevention 42 \u2022\ufffd Intervention participants reported significant improvements in a multitude of relationships including more supportive and non-violent or less violent relationships between caregivers and adolescents, adolescents and their younger siblings, spouses or partners, and community and peer relationships among adolescents and adults. This was a particular area of success for the P4P projects. \u2022\ufffd There was evidence of intervention participants sharing their learning and skills with their families and to some extent with friends or community members as well as some burgeoning community volunteerism in various forms indicating the potential for the attitudes, practices, and identities promoted in the intervention as well as community-driven development work to continue to grow equitable, non-violent norms. \u2022\ufffd The capacity of project partners and implementing organisations to design and implement rigorous VAWG primary prevention programmes in communities was strengthened. These are all promising results indicating good evidence that the P4P interventions did make strides in promoting gender equality, healthy relationships, and volunteerism.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13a69e15-68f6-4e9c-96ca-c92dbcc3016e": {"__data__": {"id_": "13a69e15-68f6-4e9c-96ca-c92dbcc3016e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promising strides toward ending violence against women and girls in the Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f052f44d98def1ced41be32f94db09408ea642e0cd2272fef9fab56e6d50bf1b"}, "2": {"node_id": "70f269bd-600b-4817-b8a7-42b786178356", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promising-strides-toward-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47c57937a7aa6ae1b35a0f8a75e0b1795c134399540e7abdd6d290efae1109dd"}}, "hash": "850f945d74911fc812f4d120cc08c57642e7e9c2515e64557280b2783ce3ecce", "text": "Unfortunately, it was beyond the scope and timeframe of P4P to measure the larger, long-term impact on social norms and the ultimate elimination of VAWG.

The lack of similar interventions and M&E designs across the countries limited the ability to draw stronger conclusions about effectiveness of VAWG primary prevention in the region in this report. Further, the lack of longer-term follow up data makes it difficult to determine the sustained impact of any of these interventions. PARTICIPANTS\u2019 AND FACILITATORS\u2019 EXPERIENCES OF ThE INTERVENTIONS All project M&E plans included systematically collecting feedback65 from participants, facilitators, and key stakeholders about the intervention and its implementation in order to understand the overall acceptability of the intervention methods and content. Overall, the beneficiaries, implementers, and other stakeholders were all very positive about the interventions and their experiences of participating in them. They felt that the content, skills, and concepts were valuable and that the participatory methodologies were enjoyable and promoted learning. Even the sensitive topics \u2013 especially sexuality-related themes for young people \u2013 were usually well-accepted by community members and even those who felt uncomfortable recognised the importance of addressing the topics. This feedback indicates that the interventions were in general acceptable to communities. Most respondents were also very enthusiastic about having the opportunity to have an intervention that addressed an issue they felt was important in their community and that most skills or changes could be applied within their daily lives indicating that the interventions were, 65 As with the outcomes findings, details of feedback from stakeholders in particular countries can be found in their outcomes reports and there is additional discussion of some key points in the P4P lessons learned reflection report. 43 in general, relevant to people and communities. Further, participants and facilitators discussed the benefits they experienced in their personal, professional, and family lives because of their participation in the P4P projects beyond the formal intervention results indicating that they found the interventions valuable. There were some detractors to the P4P interventions. In Papua New Guinea, implementers faced a lot of initial scepticism and resistance to the intervention but once community leaders and members engaged more with them and experienced the intervention they were open to and supportive of it. A few participants and stakeholders complained about some of the intervention material being inappropriate or too foreign, and that some of the activities were not being appropriate for elderly participants. But such feedback was minimal. Three common themes emerged in feedback about what was challenging about the P4P interventions: \u2022\ufffd The interventions were intensive and demanding in terms of resources, training, preparation and support to facilitators, and achieving implementation targets within the project timeframe and the community\u2019s ebb and flow of availability. \u2022\ufffd The concepts and materials were sometimes too complex and the materials were not always user-friendly especially for facilitators with low levels of education. \u2022\ufffd It was difficult to engage men and boys in the interventions. Some initial feedback from project officers and implementers suggest that a variety of reasons may have contributed to fewer male participants including that they don\u2019t see it as \u201ctheir\u201d issue but rather a women\u2019s issue,66 they do not feel comfortable in a female-dominated space, they do not see prevention of VAWG as an important priority, they worry about being blamed in the workshops, and, most typically, they reported that their work commitments conflicted with the intervention implementation schedule. These themes are discussed in more detail with specific recommendations to address them in the P4P lessons learned reflection report.67 The overwhelming majority of the feedback is that the P4P interventions had a high level of community acceptability, relevance and value. 66 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4706022/#cit0023 67 Partners for Prevention Lessons Learned about Primary Prevention of Violence Against Women and Girls in Asia and the Pacific Region. \u00a9Partners4Prevention 44 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The recent SDGs provide a global imperative to urgently address VAWG around the world.

These findings have also proven to be inspiring at the country level with several organisations planning to continue the intervention in different forms in the future. It is especially encouraging to see implementing partners in different countries planning to take on the mantle of driving future evidence-based VAWG prevention programming within their own mandates and programming plans. The P4P projects used three main strategies to promote sustainability of the interventions themselves and their results. 1. Deep investment in the transformation and capacity building of country teams and specifically of community partners such as the local facilitators and supervisors. 2. All interventions integrated and promoted volunteerism in various ways so that participants, facilitators, and stakeholders would be equipped and inspired to continue to share and embody the ideas and skills learned in the intervention and engage in community development to promote social norm change toward gender equality, healthy relationships, and community safety and cohesion. 3.

The evidence and lessons learned69 generated from these P4P pilot projects have provided valuable insight into the potential benefits and impact of the interventions as well as what it takes to achieve these results. These findings and the experience of piloting have also generated questions that would be valuable to explore in future research or monitoring and evaluation plans for programming: 1. Larger scale trials that include a control group and long-term follow ups would be useful to demonstrate effectiveness of the interventions. 2. Culturally appropriate and reliable measures of gender norm transformation at the individual, relationship, family, and community level need to be developed. 68 Fulu, E., Warner, X., Miedema, S., Jewkes, R., Roselli, T. & Lang, J. (2013). 69 Partners for Prevention Lessons Learned about Primary Prevention of VAWG in Asia and the Pacific Region 45 3. It would be valuable to document how intervention-driven transformation is sustained and grown in the long-term and what the most effective sustainability strategies are. 4. The scaleability of interventions is a key issue that urgently needs evidence to inform how best to expand or scale up interventions and understand whether the impacts also scale to the same level in order to achieve large-scale social norm change. 5. Economic evaluations and intervention costings are increasingly necessary to inform programme budgeting and illustrate the long-term economic benefit of such programming. Future work should also invest in and document innovations in engaging men and boys in gender transformative VAWG prevention programming in ways that promote accountability and continue to be grounded in gender equality to facilitate true and lasting transformation in harmful masculinities. Understanding how best to recruit and retain men and boys to actively participate in interventions is essential if VAWG prevention is to achieve the ultimate goal of the elimination of VAWG and establishment of gender equality. The P4P pilot interventions for the primary prevention of VAWG made significant strides in demonstrating the feasibility and results of this work, as well as generating important evidence-based recommendations for the continued strengthening of such programmes. In our experience, continuing to invest deeply in capacity-building for evidence-based VAWG prevention programming would greatly benefit the women, men, girls, and boys in the Asia-Pacific region. \u00a9Partners4Prevention", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e254c5e-6531-4425-ade5-dce72a0b2b43": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e254c5e-6531-4425-ade5-dce72a0b2b43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3420368622f266a1b3d301a2f049cba512e7d6072c37bdb028c2607fdc5fda0"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe36779a-47cd-4c12-8103-c6eaea7aba8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ceb4c970afeb70896365017d31303a092c406d3415345f33d40d44665558818c"}}, "hash": "a4d5327e7da4413493e3ae9ba36ecb058fe6a67fce7018ff49b1cb87c2f83c92", "text": "A REVIEW OF DOMESTIC DATA SOURCES FOR CLIMATE FINANCE FLOWS IN RECIPIENT COUNTRIES This review is commissioned under the joint FAO-UNDP Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans Programme (NAP-Ag) initiative.

Executive summary I. Introduction In recent years, increasing attention and eforts have been put towards monitoring climate related fnancial support for developing countries. The Biannual Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows Report (2016) of the Standing Committee on Finance (SFC) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) identifed that fnancial support from developed countries to developing countries increased 15% in the period 2013-2014. However the allocation of such support is unbalanced with 70% going towards mitigation eforts and only 25% to adaptation, even though the number of vulnerable countries and the costs of climate change impacts are already producing signifcant social and economic losses. Measuring, reporting on, and verifying climate fnance efectively increases accountability and trust between parties. However, many developing countries have limited experience with these topics. This is particularly the case for the analysis of fnance for adaptation. As such, few developing countries have included this information in reporting tools submitted to the UNFCCC. In an efort to identify the limitations of climate fnance reporting and provide key recommendations to improve this within the context of compliance with the Paris Agreement, this research analyzes the status of reporting mechanisms that exist under the UNFCCC. The study focuses on six countries as case studies \u2013 Colombia, Guatemala, Kenya, Nepal, Philippines and Zambia - and documents their experiences in these activities. This study intended to focus on the reporting of climate fnance for adaptation, but due to limited information, the scope of the work was modifed and extended to climate fnance in general and, where possible, for adaptation in particular. Through analysing these case studies challenges can be identifed and lessons learned. The analysis can also provide recommendations to strengthen work on climate fnance reporting to comply with articles 2, 9 and 13 of the Paris Agreement. II. Methodological note The Climate Finance Group for Latin- America and the Caribbean (GFLAC) was commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to develop a \u201cReview of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries\u201d. This report is focuses on case studies of: Colombia, Guatemala, Kenya, Nepal, Philippines and Zambia. These countries were selected on a number of criteria including: regional balance, presence of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), (intended) Nationally Determined Contributions (i)NDCs, Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) studies, participation in the Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) Programme2, and progress in climate fnance agenda. I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 6 For the development of the study deskwork was done, along with interviews which primarily focused on representatives of ministries of fnance, environment, climaterelated institutions and non-governmental representatives. III. General context The countries selected for this study represent diferent contexts, locations, economic situations. levels of vulnerability to climate change and climate variability.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 10 A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries VI. Climate fnance and fnance for adaptation defnitions in reporting tools Regarding the defnitions used in the reporting tools, it was identifed that only Colombia and the Philippines have been progressing towards a defnition of what counts as climate fnance. However, in the latest reporting tools, most of the countries include information related to climate fnance. These references vary, representing sometimes statements of needs and sometimes including specifc fgures. Some countries identify the cost of actions, others identify fnance received from international mechanisms and recently some countries have included information about the amount of money allocated through their national budgets to deal with the problem nationally. Identifcation of sources for reporting on climate fnance and fnance for adaptation The analysis of climate fnance is complex due the lack of information. However, it was identifed that some countries have developed systems with fnancial information that refects the status of national public expenditure. Others refect information about international fnance received. Not all these systems have included specifc information on climate change but some countries are working on the creation of specifc labels to identify climate activities, such as the Colombia, Kenya, Philippines and Zambia. Developing countries do not always rely on approaches created by donor countries, instead developing their own monitoring systems. Colombia is the only country that has a methodology to classify and measure climate fnance that uses both national and international approaches, which is the base of the MRV system on climate fnance. Identifcation of complementary data sets Interest in monitoring climate fnance has increased not only within governments but also in other international, national and nongovernmental bodies. For instance, the CPEIR methodology, created and applied by UNDP, has been applied in 17 countries around the world and presented important lessons supporting the analysis of public expenditures in governments. While other initiatives such as the GFLAC have been supporting the analysis of climate fnance from a non-governmental perspective. Both experiences have identifed important lessons that aim to support the work of both governmental and non-governmental actors. Country Estimations Colombia Kenya Nepal Zambia Philippines Guatemala Expenditures of adaptation fnance USD 3,1 billion (2016) NI 48% out of the USD 3.2 billion go to adaptation (IIED, 2014 includes public and private information) USD 15.5 million to over 100 million (2010-2012) USD 255 million (2013-2014), Fundaci\u00f3n Solar, FEDES, GFLAC USD 59,790 per year (2014-2017), UNDP* Approx.

It is more developed for mitigation, but currently they are expanding it to cover adaptation actions, including means of implementation. Assessment of data sets, which support national and international reporting processes At the national level, some ministries of fnance have developed information systems aimed at tracking public expenditure, as well as international cooperation. The quality, disaggregation and transparency of the systems vary considerably among countries. Some are very accessible since they are part of the fnance ministry\u2019s website, which are public, however in general the disaggregation of information is not always as adequate as needed. Additionally, the information presented refers mainly to the national level or central government, excluding subnational levels, which makes it difcult to track the allocation of resources at the local level. There are systems, institutions and platforms that have been increasing the level of transparency in terms of information related to climate fnance fows. The main international sources of information are represented by data sets of multilateral and regional banks and international organizations such as the OECD and multilateral banks that have been improving the presentation of climate fnance although they are is still not comparable, due the methods to measure climate fnance varies. As mentioned before, eforts to make climate fnance information more accessible and transparent have been made not only by governments from recipient countries and donors, but also by non-governmental (international, regional and local) organizations. These include: the Climate Funds Update (CFU), Climate Policy Initiative\u00b4s Global Landscape of Climate Finance, the Latin American and Caribbean Group on Climate Finance (GFLAC), and the Adaptation Finance Accountability Initiative (AFAI), among others. I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 12 A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries VII. Common challenges The common (at national and international levels) challenge identifed is related to a common defnition or understanding of what can be accounted as climate fnance and fnance for adaptation. At the national level, the main common challenges are: the limited institutional arrangements and internal capacities on climate fnance; the lack of unifed systematized information on climate fnance at the diferent levels of government; limited access to information from diferent sources (from donors, the public and private sector), but also from diferent sectors where the resources are allocated; and, the lack of capacities to quantify adaptation costs and needs, including the access and analysis of climate information. There are other challenges with the understanding and the systematization of information related to climate fnance at the international level, such as: information is not presented in a detailed (country or project) manner which makes it difcult to track fnancial resources; there is lack of global reporting systems and guidelines; and there are no indicators which help identify the efectiveness of the allocated resources. VIII. Recommendations In general, there is a need to improve national fnancial monitoring systems to capture data systematically and to increase its comparability and accuracy. At the national level, the main recommendations identifed are: address climate fnance through integrated approaches for planning and budgeting, creating national strategies on climate fnance that can include a comprehensive understanding of national fnancial necessities to connect them to fnancial opportunities; enhance institutional arrangements and internal capacities on climate fnance periodically and creating an specifc unit or committee to coordinate the topic; adopt harmonized guidance to measure and classify climate fnance; establish clear institutional arrangements for monitoring and tracking means of implementation, specially on climate fnance, and build national mechanisms to measure, report and verify climate fnance, this can be done base in existent tools in the countries. Colombia is the country that has more progress in the creation of an integral MRV system for climate fnance that refects, public expenditure, international public fnance and private fnance. Zambia has established the Interim Inter-Ministerial Climate Change Secretariat which functions as the hub of information related to climate fnance. Nepal is currently in the very initial stages of producing a climate fnance strategy and Kenya has included reference to the needs of having one in its Climate Change Act. I.

This does not only apply to developed countries but developing countries may also apply them according to their capacities. The analysis of this research suggests that the new modalities should include: guidance about the sectors and activities that count as climate fnance; the type of instruments that should be counted as climate fnance; a defnition of how and when climate fnance fows are counted and the type of receptor that should be included. Standing Committee on Finance (SCF): The results of the last Biennia Report presented in 2016 identifed three major activities to be undertaken in the context of the SCF: improve guidelines for the preparation and reporting of fnancial information, including modalities, guidelines and procedures for transparency of support; enhance the availability of country-level data; and, practical options for estimating and collecting data for private climate fnance. Conclusions In general, reporting on climate fnance has been limited in developing countries mainly due the lack of capacities in the diferent related-institutions, lack of funding and due the lack of methodologies and guidelines to defne what constitutes climate fnance, besides overall capacity constraints in the countries which limits the collection of climate fnance information. The main results of this research suggest that: \u2022 The absence of clear definitions of climate finance at national or international levels hinders tracking and reporting processes. Despite the absence of a clear defnition there are pluralities of data sets that can be used to do such exercises in the countries, besides that many of them have already systems that can be adapted to track climate change related activities without generating extreme charges of work. Reporting systems are still at early stages but countries like Colombia and the Philippines are leading examples that can be a reference for others. \u2022 There is a need for capacity building related to measuring, reporting and verifying climate fnance at diferent governmental levels and among diferent stakeholders. Programs such as the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) are in place, but periodic and systematic capacity process are needed. \u2022 \ufffdodalities for accounting climate finance will be defined in the conte\ufffdt of the UNFCCC and their adoption should also guide the work of developing countries, according to their capacities and their national circumstances. I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 14 A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries \u2022 It is necessary to track climate finance domestically to identify financial gaps, improve accountability of donors and the international community, and improve the national planning processes. The creation of MRV systems nationally is an opportunity for developing countries to improve this and increase the efectiveness of climate fnance. \u2022 Climate finance tracking has been undertaken in the conte\ufffdt of governmental activities, along with other private and nongovernmental and international actors that aim to identity climate fnance gaps and make climate fnance information more accessible, transparent and efcient. A compilation of these exercises and a creation of a global MRV on climate fnance could support the comparability of the data. Besides that, these eforts can drive a more efcient identifcation of needs and use of the fnancial resources to tackle climate change in an efective way, attending the actual necessities of developing countries.

INTRODUCTION 17 Climate change is one of the biggest threats that humanity is facing. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) the changes in the climate system are closely related to human activity (IPCC, 2014) and its impacts have been producing economic and social loses around the world. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has provided the forum for global consensus building and negotiations about the world\u2019s climate change response over the past 21 years. In the context of these international negotiations there is stronger recognition of the importance of increasing fnancial resources to support mitigation and adaptation actions, especially for developing countries. Article 2 of the Paris Agreement states that a major goal of the Agreement is \u201cto make fnancial fows consistent with the low greenhouse gases and resilient development\u201d (UNFCCC, 2015). To achieve this and other goals of the UNFCCC there is growing demand to increase information related to climate relevant fnancial fows to enable a better understanding of the gaps and opportunities to deal with climate change. These demands are coming from both, donor and recipient countries with donor countries calling for better understanding on where climate fnance is being spent in recipient countries. At the same time, developing countries are demanding more clarity in tracking the amount of money that has been reported as transferred to them to assess and verify international commitments but also to better connect international fnancial opportunities with national realities and needs. In many developing countries, where adaptation to climate change remains the top priority to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience of social and bio-physical systems, especially for vulnerable communities and groups; recent studies have estimated that climate fnance fows being transferred from developed to developing countries is less than adequate. For example, the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) of the UNFCCC notes in its most recent Biennial Assessment of Climate Finance Flows report (BA 2016), that \u2018despite global funding increases of 5% from USD 650 billion in the period of 2011-2012 to USD 687 for 2013 and then to USD 741 for 2014, there remains an imbalance in the allocation of climate fnance between mitigation and adaptation and that 70% of the total goes towards mitigation and only 25%, to adaptation actions, while is not clear where the other 5% goes\u2019. The Paris Agreement recognizes the importance of balancing both mitigation and adaptation fnance and to do that, the establishment of tracking systems to verify this balance becomes increasingly relevant. Reports such as the BA 2016 and other calculations such as the Climate Finance Global Landscape reports from Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) provide some insights to understand the status of global climate fnancial fows, however major limitations have been identifed including the lack of a global methodology to classify and measure climate fnance across countries. II. INTRODUCTION 18 The Paris Agreement recognizes this gap and had declared that \u2018parties should create modalities for accounting for climate fnance\u2019. This is now part of the work plan for the Subsidiary Body of Technology and Scientifc Advisory (SBSTA) that should be done by 2018. Progress towards this has begun and amongst donor countries through various initiatives such as the work guided by the OECD and multilateral development banks who have supported the COP to develop a common tabular format (CTF) for reporting on climate fnance fows for developed countries in their biennial reports (BRs). However recently under the banner of common but diferentiated responsibilities, (CBDR) there is an increased interest in identifying the role of developing countries in the tracking process. According to the Paris Agreement \u201cother parties\u201d including developing countries, are invited to provide information about fnancial support provided and received (Article 9 and 13). The frst exercise to accounting these contributions under the UNFCCC were included in the SCF BA 2014 which made a major contribution to the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f8a1a54-103a-4b2a-8853-681664709ac3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f8a1a54-103a-4b2a-8853-681664709ac3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a2fd1df740f147e4d8f856d1cc27f8caa9fee4cbb2f909d836df3f51192adc5"}, "3": {"node_id": "95574217-e527-4d87-8c3a-d351dbbd8157", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e58b6ba3856b724d8d7de5f469f9c47aa62ef7e7340514aab26f5db63631a4b"}}, "hash": "30b2748945b98ed610638aa579c112ad3b4d61ca1693cc7fd7365f15a3229ddb", "text": "climate fnance studies as it incorporated information related to fnancial fows from developing countries. This information was not only related to the amount of international support received in these countries, but also included information about public expenditure related to climate change fnance allocated nationally through domestic budgets. With support from organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), The World Bank (WB) and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), there is an increasing number of developing countries that are beginning to focus on climate fnance tracking tools, however, the number of countries (specially developing countries) reporting on climate fnance is still limited for several reasons including the unclear defnitions about what counts as climate fnance, limited capacities and unclear institutional mandates to report on climate fnance fows, fragmented reporting systems and a lack of data, among others. This paper seeks to go further to identify the limitations of climate fnance reporting for developing countries and to proposes some recommendations to improve such exercises in the context of the compliance of the articles 2, 9 and 13 of the Paris Agreement. Using six country case studies from diferent regions across the globe (Colombia, Guatemala, Kenya, Nepal, Philippines and Zambia); the report analyzes the status of the reporting mechanisms that exist under the UNFCCC to assess to what extent information on climate fnance has been included and how to improve these exercises. In seeking to understand the status of information on fnance for adaptation and mitigation actions, it was found that the topic of climate fnance is still considered new in most of the countries and that repositories for national information on climate change and climate fnance are limited. . For this reason it was necessary to review the general context of general climate change reporting, to identify to what extent countries have been working on the analysis of the fnancial aspects of adaptation and mitigation actions. Even though the topic is in the early stages of development, analysis in these countries provides lessons and recommendations to improve the provision of information in the context of the UNFCCC. II. INTRODUCTION 19 A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries III. A note on methodology The Climate Finance Group for Latin-American and the Caribbean (GFLAC for its name in Spanish) was commissioned by the UNDP to develop \u201cA Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries\u201d. The GFLAC, together with UNDP selected six recipient countries located in diferent regions. The selection of Colombia, Guatemala, Kenya, Nepal, Philippines and Zambia, was based on criteria including: 1. Countries with National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), 2. (intended) Nationally Determined Contributions (i)NDCs, 3. Countries that have conducted CPEIR studies, 4. Participation in the NAP-Ag Programme, 5. Maintaining a regional balance, as well as 6. Progress in climate fnance agenda. The countries selected for this study represent diferent regional contexts, considering their geographical location, their economic situation and their levels of vulnerability to climate change and climate variability. According to the Long-term Climate Risk Index (1996-2015), the selected countries have diferent levels of vulnerability with the Philippines in the 5th po- sition (being the most vulnerable of the group), Guatemala 9th, Nepal ranked 24th, Colombia 47th, Kenya 85th and Zambia ranked 143rd. The scope of the study: The study aimed to understand the status of information on climate fnance (particularly for adaptation). It was necessary to use a more general approach about climate fnance, because it was identifed that limited information was available for the specifc analysis of adaptation fnance. Therefore, the analysis was made for climate fnance in general and, when possible, for adaptation in particular. III.

GENERAL CONTEXT 23 A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries In relation to Adaptation, there are two diferent key instruments: National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), which were one of the main results of the COP16 (Cancun, 2010) as part of the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF). The NAPs are a \u201cmeans of identifying medium and long-term adaptation needs and developing and implementing strategies and programs to address those needs\u201d6. Therefore, NAPs should present information on the fnancial resources needed in the country to address climate change adaptation in the mid to long term. From the sample countries, only Colombia and Kenya have approved a National Adaptation Plan. Nepal is at a very early stage of building its National Adaptation Plan, but has over the past few years been developing and implementing Local Adaptation Plans for Action (LAPAs) and trying to integrate them into the national planning and budgeting systems. In some cases, for example in the Philippines, adaptation action is guided by National Climate Change Plans, which include adaptation considerations. Table 4 below, presents the information related to the goals, sectors and costing included in the National Adaptation Plans of Kenya and Colombia.
