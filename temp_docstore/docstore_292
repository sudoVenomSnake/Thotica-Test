Constitutions are increasingly made with the participation of the people and, to an extent, refl ect their preference for a welfare-oriented state. Constitutions also refl ect the growing corpus of international human rights and, thus, include valuable principles of freedom and social justice. In fact, many constitutions are made to end internal confl ict and include elements of inclusion. Thus, the constitution, gets long, ambitious, and aspirational, which fi nds favour with many groups but also meets with resistance from others. The real challenge is to implement it. From the point of view of MDGs, the achievement of MDGs becomes more challenging in an unequal society. The 2003 Human Development Report says, The more unequal a society, the less likely it is to generate sustained political support for the Goals, because political power is usually concentrated and overlaps with economic wealth and social dominance. In unequal societies, elite- dominated progress towards the Goals is also less likely to benefi t the poorest people. Moreover, overall national progress may still mean that large sections of the population are being left behind, as in Brazil, China, India, and elsewhere.1 Can a constitution which elevates social justice and egalitarianism to a high principle overcome this challenge? The constitution is not a self-operating or self-executing instrument. It is one thing to make a constitution. It is quite another to breathe life into it, making it a living, vibrant document which affects, and hopefully improves the reality of people\u2019s life. A living constitution is one which people use in their daily existence, which governs and controls the exercise of state power, and which promotes the values and aspirations 170 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS expressed in it. Even more importantly, a living constitution is also one which political leaders and senior and junior state offi cials understand, respect, and observe\u2014and to the values and procedures of which they are willing to submit their exercise of state power. It is not the objective of this chapter to provide a blueprint for the implementation of a constitution\u2014the blueprint in any case would vary from constitution to constitution and country to country. It is to alert the reader to some aspects of implementation. At a technical level, making a constitution fully effective revolves around three elements: implementing, promoting, and safeguarding. To implement a constitution means to give full expression to its provisions: making new laws and policies to give effect to them, setting up new institutions and vesting them with powers and resources adequate for their responsibilities, and repealing laws inconsistent with them. To promote the constitution means enforcing these laws, respecting rights, and freedoms of the people, developing constitutional norms, sustaining institutions and the rule of law, holding regular elections, providing access to justice, resolving disputes in accordance to the constitution, and facilitating the participation of the people in public and state affairs. Safeguarding the constitution means to protect the constitution against hasty amendments that detract from the values of democracy, constitutionalism, and the rule of law. Attacks against which it must be safeguarded also include the distortion of constitutional norms through practice and disregard of the law, and the avoidance of unnecessary resort to emergency powers. Safeguarding also means, in extreme cases, protection against the overthrow of the constitution through illegal measures such as military coups. There is a distinction between constitution-making and constitution- building\u2014the latter continues well beyond the enactment of the constitution. A new constitution oriented towards social justice often also represents signifi cant changes from previous laws and practices. Its implementation requires the repeal of some old laws and the enactment of new ones as well as changes in administrative practices, sometimes in fundamental ways if the state is radically restructured. This requires not only political will, but also new attitudes and skills. Many progressive parts of the constitution may remain unfulfi lled, such as the freedom of information, affi rmative action, land redistribution, economic and social rights. Much needed legislation is not prepared and brought to the legislature for want of either political will, or lack of capacity. IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 171 The real problem is the neutralization of the values of the constitution, imperfect or incomplete implementation, the occasional or systematic disregard of some of its provisions, selective implementation, abuse of powers given under the constitution, and denying separation of powers or the independence of institutions including the judiciary. Threats to the constitution are inherent in the circumstances", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "629ced4b-2ca0-4f3c-9b3c-92102e3d2c09": {"__data__": {"id_": "629ced4b-2ca0-4f3c-9b3c-92102e3d2c09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee9d6c8e46fd477a90369090e9540601670b16f0d03e9471df72652e6ccb98e9"}}, "hash": "ee9d6c8e46fd477a90369090e9540601670b16f0d03e9471df72652e6ccb98e9", "text": "which require the strengthening of the powers and capacity of the state. People have high expectations of the State as the agency for social and economic development, and solver of society\u2019s problems. This sense of dependence is accompanied by a deep suspicion of those who manage the affairs of the State, politicians and civil servants, widely regarded as self-serving and corrupt. Thus, there are attempts to restrict the purposes and modes for the exercise of state power and to impose high standards for the conduct and accountability of those who wield state power. At the same time, the state is the terrain of internal struggle and confl ict. Externally, there are economic and political forces against which the constitution can provide limited resistance. The weight and resilience of social traditions, ideologies, and institutions is a major obstacle to the achievement of progressive social reforms and changes. Among other consequences, it leads to fear, on the part of the disadvantaged, of using constitutional remedies in order not to provoke political, economic, or social retribution from the powerful. The wide ranging ambitions expressed in the constitutions\u2014 particularly, as they affect class or ethnic interests, such as affi rmative action, social and economic rights, and identity\u2014make the constitution controversial and divisive and prevent it from becoming an unquestioned point of loyalty and focus. Corruption is a major threat to the integrity of the constitution. Powerful interests in or external to country, who are not sympathetic to the objectives of the constitution or wish to buy illegitimate infl uence, use corrupt means to sabotage it. This leads to the subversion of both the values and the institutions of the constitution\u2014one of the surest ways to weaken them is the fi nancial or political corruption of the judiciary. We have pointed to the particular problems of implementing socio- economic rights. In part, they are political. The wealthy have little interest in greater social justice, which they consider is at their own expense (for example, higher taxation). The ideologically conservative oppose socio-economic rights because they think that they distort the logic and mechanisms of the market. Both groups are politically powerful. We have suggested that the universal support for MDGs provides a good opportunity 172 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS to win support for goals of social justice and to consolidate them as socio- economic rights. In part, the problems are technical\u2014the newness of the concept of socio-economic rights and, therefore, uncertainty among policy-makers and the legal community on how to proceed with their realization by the state, the lack of clear criteria and standards for their achievement, and the diffi culty of access to political and legal institutions for those whose rights are ignored or violated. We have suggested that some of these problems can be resolved by ensuring representation of the disadvantaged communities in the legislative and executive bodies. Reference can be made to the jurisprudence of international and regional tribunals, including treaty bodies, special rapporteurs, and public interest litigations, and fi nancial and administrative ways can also be found to assist the disadvantaged to access the courts and other relevant bodies. Linking to international networks of human right activists, around international treaty systems, for information and mutual assistance is another way to strengthen the movement for socio-economic rights. Additionally, it would also be useful to set up a special, independent commission to ensure the implementation of socio-economic rights by offering both assistance in preparing laws and regulations, and on relevant standards and monitoring. In the case of a new constitution, such a commission would have the broader function of assisting with the implementation of the entire document, perhaps in accordance with a schedule in the constitution, setting out a programme of phased implementation (see p. 188). However, even with these measures, there is no guarantee that socio- economic rights will be protected and promoted. The viability and success of a constitution is premised on the ideology of constitutionalism, a belief in the value of restrictions on power, expressed as substantive and institutional limitations, and the practice of the rule of law, with emphasis on rules and the modes of their enforcement. These refl ect and spring from political and cultural traditions. Paradoxically, countries which try to use the constitution for social transformation, often lack these traditions. Constitutionalism provides a framework for the organization and functioning of the society and State which may run counter to the logic and practice of other social orders, based on the dominance of religious, feudal, social, and economic elites and where the repository and exercise of power is based on dogma or individuals and their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25b829b4-d73b-4233-b6a0-132f5ee23532": {"__data__": {"id_": "25b829b4-d73b-4233-b6a0-132f5ee23532", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04b305e63b546354b96e6fbd56686febdbd41200f1cd3182a89f74e628d19cf8"}}, "hash": "04b305e63b546354b96e6fbd56686febdbd41200f1cd3182a89f74e628d19cf8", "text": "personalities. These social orders may command greater allegiance from, or inspire fear among, the people than the constitution, whose values, institutions, and procedures may not be fully understood by them. IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 173 The problems inherent in the confl ict between these social and political orders go beyond issues of socio-economic rights and pervade the entire corpus of values and institutions of he constitution. One way to understand the potential of a constitution to impose its imprint on state and society is to examine two key factors. One is internal to the constitution: the way in which it distributes power, the institutions it sets up for different tasks, modes of accountability, and methods for the enforcement of the constitution, including respect for and protection of human rights. The balances within the constitution can do something to guide state institutions and empower the people. The other, external to the constitution, is societal\u2014the way society and economy are organized, the understanding and commitment of the leaders and the people to constitutionalism, including democracy, human rights, social justice, the relations between different communities, social hierarchies, and the organization of the economy. We begin with a discussion of what the constitution can do. 1. CONSTITUTION: A FRAMEWORK FOR RIGHTS In the context of human rights and social justice, the ultimate goal of a constitution must be to fulfi l Article 28 of the UDHR: Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized. Since the national constitution can do little about the international order,2 the focus of this section is on the national aspects of the constitution. Article 28 requires that every provision of the constitution be rights-friendly. The Indian Constitution has a similar orientation. The fi rst Directive Principle says, \u2018 The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all institutions of the national life,\u2019 Article 38(1). Getting the Bill of Rights right is undoubtedly important. However, it is equally or perhaps even more important that the whole of the constitution is rights-friendly. A perfectly good Bill of Rights can be ghettoized (by which we mean isolated from the rest of legal activity and public life) and subverted if the political and judicial institutions are not correctly designed. Rights and social justice are unlikely to be respected or promoted if enormous powers are concentrated in the executive, if the government is not suffi ciently accountable, if elections are not free 174 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS and fair, and if the judges can be easily bought over, or are willing to take instructions from the executive. We must examine electoral systems to assess what kind of persons and from communities are likely to be elected.3 Similarly, we must consider whether an emphasis on culture may jeopardize the right of women, children, disabled, or low-caste persons, We must ask whether there is too much emphasis on some rights (for example, property, market, or contract) that restrict affi rmative action or other measures necessary for equity and social justice. 1.1 THE NEO-COLONIAL STATE In planning a constitution which is rights- and justice-friendly, we must begin with an analysis of what is wrong with contemporary political systems. In many poorer countries, often with a colonial background, the modern state is artifi cial and alien. It is artifi cial because it did not grow organically over a period of time but was created by a colonial power, drawing boundaries, sometimes in negotiations with other colonial powers, in which peoples with considerable racial, religious, linguistic diversity, and often with very different lifestyles were brought together. It is alien because it was imposed by the colonial power, in the image of its own state\u2014but without the humanizing and democratic dimensions existing or emerging in the latter. Towards the end of colonialism, attempts were made through new constitutions to incorporate human rights and democracy, but by now the colonial structures were well entrenched and the local leaders who succeeded to power were only too anxious, for their own benefi t, to preserve the coercive and extractive features of the old state. Consequently many features of the colonial state have persisted, including the following: the state remains highly bureaucratic with little scope for \u2022 participation or consultation by the public in decision-making relatively few ministers devote signifi cant time to policy issues \u2022 democracy seldom goes beyond periodic elections, which are often \u2022 dominated by ethnic", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "038ee57d-b07e-4fc4-8cd0-ff63edfaae92": {"__data__": {"id_": "038ee57d-b07e-4fc4-8cd0-ff63edfaae92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1ca4115f5d231fe9cff22dc67696feb592603e933ea098516399a2b6351ef89"}}, "hash": "f1ca4115f5d231fe9cff22dc67696feb592603e933ea098516399a2b6351ef89", "text": "politics and manipulation political parties are either ethnic enclaves or personal fi efdoms \u2022 with little understanding of, or commitment to democracy the elites (political, bureaucratic, and business) see the state \u2022 primarily as the source of enrichment for themselves; and so a key characteristic of the state is rampant corruption within it, and under its auspices IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 175 there is little accountability of the state and wide impunity for those \u2022 who abuse power, as most elites conspire to plunder the state there is little respect for the rule of law; the whims of the president/ \u2022 head of government are more important than, and override, the law; and it does not help that many judges are themselves corrupt and subservient to the executive for these reasons, the State is highly centralized, which marginalizes \u2022 many communities and regions the state is weak in its capacity to bring about economic and social \u2022 development but is strong vis \u00e0 vis society and, thus, little happens without State sanction reduced merely to subjects by colonialism, most people remain \u2022 docile and it is diffi cult to establish strong organizations in civil society most people are not aware of their rights or are afraid to exercise \u2022 them in fear of reprisals; they have little understanding of this alien state or how to infl uence it lacking legitimacy, the state relies on coercion and often draconian \u2022 laws bequeathed by colonial regimes; and, pretensions of the nation-state when it does little to cultivate a genuine sense of nationalism and common purpose. Those in charge of the apparatus of the state have endless opportunities for personal aggrandisement and for amassing fortunes through corruption, and very little interest in, or incentive for limiting these powers. Other groups in society lack the capacity\u2014or think that they lack the capacity\u2014 to impose controls, much less accountability, on the government. Because the State is so important for accumulation and access to power, patronage, and the like that there is considerable confl ict over control of the State, sometimes leading to civil war. This type of internal confl ict is often ethnic, deeply divisive and the cause of a great deal of suffering. The greatest setback to economic and social development, particularly socio- economic rights, in many countries is civil confl ict. Among those who suffer most are women and children, and ethnic minorities (already recognized in the Millennium Declaration as among the most marginalized groups). 1.2 RESTRUCTURING THE NEO-COLONIAL STATE How far can the constitution restructure the neo-colonial state, eliminating its negative, destructive tendencies, and introduce values and structures to promote fair and balanced development? Traditionally, the constitution 176 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS is concerned with the state and its institutions. It takes for granted certain presuppositions about society supportive of the constitution and if these presuppositions are not applicable in a particular country, the purposes of the constitution will be subverted. Formally and textually, the constitution can determine the structures of the State and their relationship to each other and society, prescribe values and purposes for, and procedures by, which the powers given to them are exercised. It can prescribe the electoral system and methods of the accountability of the government and legislators, designed, for example, to prevent and punish for corruption. Constitutions are increasingly being drafted to eliminate the problems outlined above\u2014and to prescribe values and principles of State policy and, as a consequence, have become very lengthy. However, whether constitutional provisions achieve their purposes is quite another matter. 1.2.1 Framework of Values and Principles PREAMBLES South Africa: The state is committed to Improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of each person Bougainville: WE, THE PEOPLE OF BOUGAINVILLE under the sovereignty of God our Father believing and trusting in HIM do now, with His guidance and blessing, hail the dawn of a new era of government for Bougainville to enable us with His help.

It is within this framework of values that IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 177 the constitution should be interpreted. Statements of values would also assist those who have to implement the constitution or who may want to use it for lobbying, litigation, and so on. to promote or safeguard particular values. 1.2.2 Inclusive and Participatory Democracy Men and women have the right to live their lives and raise their children in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression or injustice. Democratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people best assures these rights. Millennium Declaration 2 A major problem with most states is the lack of genuine democracy going beyond periodic and often rigged elections. Key decisions about state policies, including allocation of resources, are made by small groups. Consequently, the ordinary people and groups like women, the poor, lower castes, and youth have little infl uence on how the state functions or accountability of state offi cials. But democracy is not only about the functioning of the State; it is also about the organization of society. In many states, communities or regions are excluded from the benefi ts of the State. Others are excluded from meaningful participation in public affairs. In this way not only are these communities or groups deprived of their rights, but the State itself suffers from the benefi ts of a functioning democracy. As a result many groups are alienated from the State and often there are serious and damaging confl icts that we have mentioned above, and discuss later. Here is a list of constitutional provisions, probably not appearing in the Bill of Rights, but which are to be found in constitutions and which support meaningful democracy. an inclusive defi nition of citizenship so that no individuals or \u2022 groups are left out and everyone enjoys equal rights a fair electoral system which assures minorities and women \u2022 proportional representation and an independent electoral commission which ensure free elections regulation of political parties for integrity and internal democracy \u2022 separation of powers that ensures that the major institutions of the \u2022 state are independent in the exercise of their powers and are able to hold each other to a measure of accountability fair mechanisms under which constituents of a member of the \u2022 legislature can recall the member for neglect of duties or lack of integrity 178 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS procedures for law-making that give the people adequate \u2022 opportunities and time for consultation and commenting on legislative bills and regulations including a parliamentary committee, which is obliged to engage the people in law-making the decentralization of government which enables the greater \u2022 participation of people in public affairs and which diminishes the chances of the abuse of unaccountable power (experience shows, as we demonstrate below, that decentralization is good for the delivery of social services) a convention, if not law, that the government and not merely \u2022 parliament would include members of as many communities and regions as feasible a role for civil society organizations in public affairs. \u2022 When designing a constitution, we have to consider (i) how inclusion can be brought about\u2014for women, youth, low caste people, minorities, and such others\u2014in economy, politics, public service, and army; (ii) how participation in decision-making can be promoted; (iii) establishing mechanisms for consultation; and (iv) establishing social democracy, where objectives of justice are achieved through a democracy with a broad franchise and commitment to equality. 1.2.3 Prevention of Confl ict Confl icts, external and internal, are a major threat in many countries to the most basic of human rights. A typical consequence of confl ict is the displacement of large numbers of people from their homes, which denies to them basic human security, especially to children and women, access to education for their children, sanitary living conditions, malnutrition, and leads to suppression of culture and arts. Internal confl icts often arise out of competition for access to the State and its resources, the structure of the State, and inclusion\u2014and, thus indirectly about the constitution that governs these matters. Modern confl ict is seldom about outright control of the State by a narrow group; it is about a share in government and, thus, about inclusion and participation, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f616c547-d1db-49c6-a27c-0cc55300bb1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f616c547-d1db-49c6-a27c-0cc55300bb1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe993942ea065c5a5fa7cddb05f5e9632a13e99643c9bfad1437df7610f33592"}, "3": {"node_id": "41ace001-f5be-4e89-9c84-ded84e89f068", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9b712de4ce19447766a96d73f9d4d7401c52aae8bf3a9ccc7fb18dbdebfff2b"}}, "hash": "055c6d13a1a2056de77694b114304e1d2dc917b014e60a11d3b22467ac30cb36", "text": "the recognition of religions, languages, culture, and sometimes about forms of self-government. In these circumstances, a constitution acceptable to all groups becomes the precondition of any development. Examples abound, including Sri Lanka, the Sudan, the DRC, Rwanda, Palestine/Israel, Somalia, Kenya, Cambodia, Afghanistan, and Myanmar are all states dominated by confl ict in recent times. IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 179 There are many ways in which the constitution can prevent or mitigate confl ict. Inclusive and participatory democracy as defi ned above is critical. We have indicated some principles for bringing about this type of democracy. Social justice, including affi rmative action, is primary, since confl ict is primarily about resources. Special attention should be paid to group identity, languages, and religion. There should be respect for cultural differences. The precise mechanisms would depend on the circumstances and historical context. Some electoral systems are more hospitable to representation of minorities and participation can be secured through forms of consultation, modes of decision-making in government and legislature, power sharing, proportionality, and self-government, particularly through federalism or devolution. However, the recognition of cultural differences should not lead to further fragmentation of the people. Many of the mechanisms mentioned above are based on ethnic classifi cations, which have a tendency towards perpetuation, and indeed accentuation, of differences. A deeply divided and fragmented society is unable to deal with critical social and economic problems. A common vision and a common identity, leading to broad social consensus, not incompatible with recognition of differences, form the basis of collective action and are necessary for the fair and effective operation of the state. The success of the development of such consensus depends greatly on the quality of leadership\u2014and avoiding the temptations of mobilizing narrow sectarian interests. Some constitutions try to achieve these positive results by laws on political parties, prohibition of infl ammatory racial rhetoric, and the promotion of national symbols. The balancing of a common, national identity with particularities of religions, languages, and culture remains one of the greatest challenges to the making and functioning of constitutions. 1.2.4 Decentralization We have remarked above on the importance of democracy, participation, recognition of diversity, and power sharing, as well as self-government for a just and stable socio-political system. In many countries, decentralization has been the means through which some or all of these goals have been sought. Decentralization is the method for the reorganization of the State by which power is dispersed throughout the country, with powers that are best exercised nationally\u2014such as currency and monetary policies, defence, foreign affairs, international trade, nuclear power, and national transport infrastructure\u2014left to the central government, while those which are best exercised at sub-national levels\u2014such as those which relate to the 180 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS MDGs, health, primary and secondarily education, housing, social welfare generally, local transport, marketing, land, agriculture, and irrigation\u2014are transferred to districts and provinces. Proponents of decentralization argue that a state power should be vested at the lowest level at which it can be most effectively exercised. In practice, this principle is diffi cult to apply, for people and policy-makers may legitimately disagree on what the most effective level is. There are many objectives of decentralization which have to be balanced or given priority, popular democracy, promoting local cultures and languages, accountability, economic and social development, and changing values and technology. The scheme for, and the division of, powers are often determined in a country by factors such as history and tradition, ethnic diversity, geography, natural resources, and commitment to general and equitable welfare, and the bargaining power and skills of negotiators. Decentralization is not only about the division of powers. It is also about co-operation between governments at different levels in societies which are becoming increasingly complex and interdependent, and where all economic and social sectors are heavily infl uenced by globalization. It is also about the institutions which enable the exercise of power at various levels as well as coordination and co-operation. It is a means to enhance democracy and accountability and to provide a basis to share power between regions and communities. It seeks to strike a fair balance between national and local values, identities, and planning.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41ace001-f5be-4e89-9c84-ded84e89f068": {"__data__": {"id_": "41ace001-f5be-4e89-9c84-ded84e89f068", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe993942ea065c5a5fa7cddb05f5e9632a13e99643c9bfad1437df7610f33592"}, "2": {"node_id": "f616c547-d1db-49c6-a27c-0cc55300bb1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "055c6d13a1a2056de77694b114304e1d2dc917b014e60a11d3b22467ac30cb36"}}, "hash": "c9b712de4ce19447766a96d73f9d4d7401c52aae8bf3a9ccc7fb18dbdebfff2b", "text": "It seeks to strike a fair balance between national and local values, identities, and planning.

In one form or another, decentralization has been adopted in many countries in recent decades. It seems particularly suited to the achievement of MDGs. Responsibility for many socio-economic rights is vested in government at sub-national levels. Health, education, and water, for example, are very often fully or partly the responsibility of local governments, or regional/provincial governments in a federal system. When responsibility is with the central government, it may be hard for it IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 181 to fi nd out the needs of the people and, even when it is informed, there are often few incentives to persuade it to respond. However, placing the responsibility at a local level leads to more participation of benefi ciaries and, thus, to greater democracy. Needs are more clearly identifi ed and there is greater accountability. It is usually easier for local groups, including women, the disabled, and the marginalized, to make an impact. India has shown how women can be involved in large numbers at local government levels, though interestingly this only happened because the national constitution required it: one-third of local body members must be women. Decentralization can offer a counterbalance to the power of centre through local democracy. This will be even more so in a federal country, with powers of law-making and resources guaranteed by the constitution. The outcomes will depend on various factors such as the existence of some traditions of local democracy, of adequate resources, both fi nancial and human (see Box 3.1). According to the 2003 Human Development Report (Millennium Development Goals: A compact among nations to end human poverty), decentralization: often reduces absenteeism among government employees in local \u2022 schools and health clinics \u2022 provides bureaucrats with early warnings of potential disasters \u2022 encourages local people to fi nd solutions to their everyday \u2022 problems provides people with a much stronger voice in public policy \u2022 decisions that affect their lives. has increased representation among women. \u2022 And local authorities tend to act more in line with local preferences and \u2022 conditions, and no longer have to wait for permission from higher levels before acting decentralization of government spending is closely associated with \u2022 lower corruption among bureaucrats reallocating resources ensures a more equitable distribution of \u2022 national funds to regions previously neglected by dominant groups at the centre. There is likely to be resistance to decentralization: people, including leaders with vested interests in the centralized administration, will resist losing 182 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS their powers and control over resources. The bureaucracy is likely to resist: some fear losing their jobs, while others will be reluctant to move out of the capital, even to their \u2018home\u2019 areas. Implementing a new constitutional system of decentralization is likely to be very hard and time-consuming. BOX NO. 3.1 DECENTRALIZATION EXAMPLES FROM THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT (2003) \u2022 In Mozambique committed local authorities working in a decentralized system doubled health staff and focussed on outreach\u2014improving vaccination coverage and prenatal consultations by 80 per cent \u2022 The Kerala People\u2019s Campaign started in 1996, sparked by the state government\u2019s decision to devolve 35\u201340 per cent of state plan funds to village and municipal bodies. In its fi rst two years the campaign led to the construction of 98,494 houses, 240,307 sanitary latrines, 17,489 public taps, and 50,162 wells\u2014all far more than in previous years. \u2022 In Bogota, Colombia, after the people were able to elect their own mayor, deaths from traffi c accidents are down, from a peak of 1,387 in 1995 to 745 in 2001. Homicide rates have fallen even more sharply, from a peak of 4,452 in 1993 to 2,000 in 2001. Perhaps most surprising was a voluntary tax campaign that increased city revenues by $500,000 during the same period. Nor are all systems of decentralizations necessarily well designed or successful, as the HDR (Human Development Report) also shows. There is likely to be duplication of effort, using more money and personnel. There will almost certainly be expensive new institutions.

UN Habitat has developed a set of guidelines on decentralization and the strengthening of local authorities.4 This project makes a specifi c connection between decentralization and the MDGs. 1.2.5 Independent Bodies With the loss of confi dence in the integrity of politicians and occasionally judges, and often the administration, it is becoming common to set up independent institutions for the exercise of certain responsibilities and IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 183 functions. These institutions may have responsibility for accountability of state institutions (for example, auditor-general, human rights commission), dealing with complaints against the state for maladministration or unfair discrimination (for example, ombudsman, courts), the eradication of corruption, the conduct of politically sensitive functions (like elections, drawing of electoral constituencies), exercise of sensitive powers (like prosecution), and the promotion of constitutional values (like human rights or the protection of the environment). The characteristics and structures of these institutions differ, but they do share certain features: impartiality, independence, and expertise. The growth of these institutions represents a new development in the separation of powers, traditionally restricted to the separation of, and checks and balances, between the legislature, executive, and the judiciary. The South African constitution provides a good example of how to use these institutions.

(f) The Electoral Commission. (2) These institutions are independent, and subject only to the Constitution and the law, and they must be impartial and must exercise their powers and perform their functions without fear, favour or prejudice.

A Committee of the National Assembly puts forward names after consulting civil society, if this is provided for by law. The committee itself must refl ect the party make-up of the Assembly. The names must be approved by the Assembly and if the post is that of Public Protector or Auditor-General, at least 60 per cent of the Assembly members must support the nomination. Then the President formally appoints. These important offi cers may be removed from offi ce only for misconduct, incapacity, or incompetence after inquiry by a committee of the National Assembly. The report of the committee goes to the National Assembly which may vote in favour of removal. If the issue concerns the Public Protector or Auditor General, at least 60 per cent of the Assembly members must support the removal. If the Assembly votes for removal, the President must remove the person from offi ce. Two additional institutions to ensure fairness and prevent political intervention are provided: (a) a broadcasting authority \u2018to regulate broadcasting in the public interest, and to ensure fairness and a diversity of views broadly representing South African society\u2019 and (b) a National Directorate of Prosecutions. The former is important for promotion of public debates in which all viewpoints are heard, as a way of strengthening democracy and ensuring participation, and the latter is a critical component of the rule of law. The importance of an independent prosecution service is discussed below in the section on the rule of law. 1.2.6 Participation of Society A constitution inevitably pays most attention to institutions of the State. The State is the primary business of the constitution, and even democracy is conceived primarily as question of the relationships between State 186 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS institutions. When it deals with the citizen, the focus is his or her relationship to the State. Such an approach without consideration of societal structure, market relations, and the like, disregards the crucial role of social and economic forces in society in the functioning of the State. In market-driven societies, the economic power of capitalists and other wealthy groups plays a decisive role in the policies and decisions of the government\u2014largely to serve their interests. Socio-economic rights inevitably play a subsidiary role, that is, when they are recognized at all. As will be obvious, much of this book has been concerned to redress this problem and to compel the State into a greater recognition of the interests of the marginalized and the oppressed. What we concentrate on here is how the constitution can increase the role of civil society in the affairs of the State and, in this way, enhance democracy and accountability. Later we discuss how civil society can use the constitution to achieve social justice. Active citizenry and consciousness of civic virtues are essential for sustaining democracy. We have already seen that decentralization can increase public participation. In Switzerland the major form of participation, as well as initiatives by the people, is the referendum\u2014but the referendum, for various reasons, is not very suitable in many countries where levels of literacy are low or society is marked by ethnic cleavages. The constitution should provide for representation of groups hitherto marginalized\u2014of women, the disabled, indigenous peoples, and lower caste communities. Voters who think that their representative in state institutions has not fulfi lled her or his role, should perhaps be able to initiate the process for their recall. Citizens should have the right to petition lawmakers about legislation, and a parliamentary committee could be given responsibility for ensuring public participation at various stages of lawmaking. Civil society is made of up of various groups and organizations: trade unions, political parties, co-operatives, professional associations, movements of women, the disabled, and so on. Ways must be found to promote their participation. Public participation can be promoted by making offi cial information to the people; hence, the importance of freedom of information legislation. In the area of the MDGs, participation can be linked to the design of strategies and as service providers through community organizations and national NGOs and as watchdogs to ensure government fulfi", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b451d21-cc07-4228-abb4-87ed263f0d30": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b451d21-cc07-4228-abb4-87ed263f0d30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78b43e0895fb8c1eeb1c31cc575deb191540b332479e4c0ed9b6fa077ce6014a"}}, "hash": "78b43e0895fb8c1eeb1c31cc575deb191540b332479e4c0ed9b6fa077ce6014a", "text": "lment of commitments. Ultimately, participation is important because it transfers infl uence and power to groups who are often left out of traditional forms of democracy. If we believe that genuine democracy is essential to divert IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 187 resources to the needs of the poor, then participation becomes central to the strategy of the MDGs. 1.2.7 Institutionalizing the Rule of Law The supremacy of the constitution is impossible without the rule of law. The rule of law means that the affairs of the State, and its relations with the people, are conducted strictly in accordance with the law, especially the constitution. All State authority must be founded on the law. Laws or State policies which are inconsistent with the constitution are invalid. The law must be fair and respect fundamental human rights. It is up to the courts, not the government, to determine whether a law is invalid or what is the meaning of a provision of the law. The law must bind all, including the government, and all citizens must receive equal treatment before the law. The law must be administered impartially, without fear or favour. An important function of the rule of law is to limit the powers of the State and to protect citizens and communities against the arbitrary acts of the State or other forces. The establishment of the rule of law depends on a combination of laws, institutions, and procedures. The laws must be just and enunciated in accordance with constitutional norms, and, therefore, must not derogate from constitutionally protected fundamental rights. Laws must be made in accordance with prescribed rules and procedures. Ultimately, it is up to the courts to decide whether a law is valid. Nevertheless, it is important that a person who considers that a law violates his or her rights, or is in breach of the constitution, should be able to challenge it without being victimized. The public must have access to the laws. The law must be written in clear language, and a person who wants to know the law should be able to fi nd it easily. Laws must be applied fairly and without discrimination. As no-one is above the law, everyone is accountable for his or her conduct, or wrongdoing. No person can escape the law because that person is well connected with the ruling party or a powerful politician. If a law is not applied to a person because of his or her connections, or status, we say that the person has immunity from the legal process. Equally, no person can be punished or penalized who has not broken the law. Institutions which are involved in the decisions to prosecute a person or organization, or to decide what the law is, and whether it has been broken, should be separate from the government and independent of it. The government should not be able to tell the prosecutor who to prosecute. The prosecutor must make this decision in accordance with the law. A 188 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS judge should not be told or infl uenced either by the government or a rich or powerful person to fi nd an accused guilty or not guilty. The judges must be independent. This means that their appointment or removal must not depend on the government. Judges must be appointed by an independent body and they must be qualifi ed for the job in terms of their training and experience, as well as moral integrity. A judge should be removable for a crime or abuse of power. Similar principles apply for the appointment or removal of prosecutors, so that the powers of prosecution cannot be used to punish those persons that the government does not like or to protect its friends from the due process of the law. Lawyers who advise the public and provide legal representation to an accused person must also be independent. The police play an important role in the way in which the law is enforced by ensuring security in which the people can enjoy their rights, in the way they make investigations into breaches of the law, and in the way they exercise their powers to arrest or detain persons. Therefore, the police should be free from infl uence of the government or other well- connected persons in the performance of these tasks. An extremely important element of the rule of law is that a person whose rights have been violated or who has suffered from the breach of the law is able to get a remedy\u2014even if the violation or breach has been done by or on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84589d88-fa83-41ad-bcf2-567f0dd4b916": {"__data__": {"id_": "84589d88-fa83-41ad-bcf2-567f0dd4b916", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad7012d49eee532a1b200bece33c74452fcf5a06e341f27f297af8ae4a4b9cf0"}}, "hash": "ad7012d49eee532a1b200bece33c74452fcf5a06e341f27f297af8ae4a4b9cf0", "text": "the order of the highest offi cial in the state. The importance of remedies was emphasized in a recent resolution of the UN General Assembly which requires states to adopt \u2018appropriate and effective legislative and administrative procedures and other appropriate measures that provide fair, effective and prompt access to justice\u2019.7 Without access to justice, particularly of the vulnerable and disadvantaged persons and communities, the rule of law will have no meaning for them. Access to justice requires that a person should be able to secure legal assistance and representation (with legal aid if necessary), that courts are within easy geographical reach, that they can present the case in the language that they understands that fees for fi ling or conducting the case is not prohibitive, people are not intimidated so they refrain from seeking legal advice or the help of the court, that the judges are not biased against members of any community, and that if a judgment is given, it is promptly enforced. It is perhaps safe to say that constitutions may succeed in setting up institutions and giving them authority, but they often fail in the fulfi lment of national values or directive principles\u2014for the paradoxical reason that those who become offi cers of these institutions may have little commitment to the values. Constitutional values may well require signifi cant changes in the power structure of society, and state offi cials IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 189 who matter may be either unable or unwilling to bring economic and social change. In these circumstances the role of the judiciary becomes critical to ensure the fulfi lment of constitutional values and mandates. When amending the constitution is diffi cult or there is resistance to necessary legislation, courts can play a constructive role through interpretation of the constitution and directives on its implementation or observance. The role of a constitutional court with special responsibility to interpret and enforce the constitution (as in Poland, Germany, and South Africa) has been critical to the success of the constitution. Even in common law countries, where most courts have the authority to interpret the constitution, there may be value in having a specialist court with all judges well versed in national and comparative constitutions. Even in the role of the courts, the scales are weighted in favour of the rich. The poor have considerable diffi culties in getting access to the courts for reasons already mentioned earlier. In addition, the poor are often victimized if they resort to lawyers and courts. The record of the courts is mixed, but they have on the whole tended to favour the establishment and the well off. Where they have upheld the rights of the poor, the judgments have tended to be ignored by the other branches of the government and there are considerable problems in enforcing them by the disadvantaged. In a number of countries, the access of the poor is secured through a special form of litigation, public interest litigation (PIL). The concept and practice of PIL have been developed for cases which have a signifi cant element of public interest, often to enforce the rights of a poor, marginalized group. The US pioneered class interest litigation for this purpose, which was adapted in India to the circumstances of a country where is there is massive poverty, and social and economic marginalization. The poor have little access to the courts, there are long delays in concluding cases, the rules of procedure disadvantage the disadvantaged, and the remedies are inappropriate. PIL seeks to overcome these defi ciencies (see p. 27). Public interest litigation is generally credited with giving prominence to the plight of the disadvantaged, the development and implementation of constitutional values, empowering a marginalized community, and giving redress for the violation of rights of the poor. Several other countries have adopted PIL (including in Latin America, where some courts have used the mandates of the constitution in favour of indigenous peoples to redefi ne some key legal concepts like property to emphasize responsibility and not only entitlements, and indeed to reconceptualize entitlements 190 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS as well).8 However, recently these claims on behalf of PIL have been challenged. Despite wonderful court judgments and some continuing court involvement, enforcement remains a problem and the poor are often not empowered as professionals take over the key decisions about litigation. The previous section discussed various institutions that are important to constitutional implementation, including special commissions and the courts. However, recent constitutions have gone further and created special institutions and processes to try and ensure that in its initial stages the constitution does not", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "833b944c-b78b-4efc-a548-cb75afea2f5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "833b944c-b78b-4efc-a548-cb75afea2f5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dee55e67e0070f3dc28b78611a4a8fb10d7f4f8eadf40c8c37d781826a7bd2a5"}}, "hash": "dee55e67e0070f3dc28b78611a4a8fb10d7f4f8eadf40c8c37d781826a7bd2a5", "text": "remain a paper document only, or special implementation functions are given to other bodies. It is usually necessary to have transitional provisions in a new constitution to provide for the move from the old to the new system. Nonetheless, how can it be guaranteed that that transition actually takes place? One technique is to include a timetable in the new constitution for when particular things must be done: new institutions created, new laws passed. Nevertheless, alone this cannot guarantee that anything happens! Specifi c functions can be given to particular bodies. The human rights commission may be given a broad responsibility for the promotion of human rights including ensuring the introduction of new necessary legislation and institutions. Uganda has a land commission to develop policies within the general principles in the constitution and to implement them. Several constitutions have anti-corruption and environmental bodies with similar responsibilities in their areas of competence. One can carry this idea to a general commission to implement the entire constitution\u2014as is the case in Afghanistan and in the new Kenya constitution of 2010, working with the specialist commissions and relevant government ministries. The experience of numerous countries is that governments implement only those provisions which they like, and that civil society is too weak or unqualifi ed to do much about it. The failure to implement the constitution fully can also arise from the lack of expertise or resources. To make up for the lack of political will or the scarcity of resources, an independent commission, with considerable resources, could be established for a period of ten years or so to ensure full implementation. The commission would have the responsibility, in conjunction with the government and civil society, to review the old, and prepare the new legislation, and facilitate the establishment of new institutions. It would also promote knowledge of the constitution and facilitate the participation of communities and NGOs in public affairs. It would report periodically to the nation through the legislature on IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 191 progress and bring to their attention obstacles preventing full and effective implementation. In the case of a country adopting devolution/decentralization, particular reluctance to introduce the new system may arise. Yet a phased approach is almost certainly gong to be needed. Here, again, a special commission may be set up to prepare new laws, propose the necessary policies, and the like. A particular problem may arise in connection with human rights. We made the point earlier that rights ought, as far as possible, not to require new laws to be made. However, sometimes this is hard to avoid. If the government simply fails to make such laws, what can be done? The draft constitution that the Government of Kenya put before the people in a referendum in 2005 included an innovative, but unsatisfactory, solution. The Attorney General in consultation with the Commission on the Implementation of the Constitution was to prepare bills required to implement the Constitution, not only on human rights. However, if Parliament failed to pass them within the timetable laid down the bills would have been \u2018deemed to have been enacted\u2019 on the day after the time limit expired. This would have given a very great deal of power to the Attorney General and would be fundamentally undemocratic. It also assumes a degree of independence of the Attorney General from the government that may not always be found. The Constitution actual adopted in 2010 provides that if Parliament fails to pass a required law on time, the courts may order that the necessary steps are taken to pass the law, failing which Parliament must be dissolved. Other devices that anticipate possible foot dragging by the government include allowing institutions to make their own rules if the authority designated to do so fails to carry out the responsibility. The Constitution of Papua New Guinea said that if no law was made, a constitutional institution could provide for its own procedures. This would have applied to the courts, and constitutional commissions and offi ces. It would not have helped in Kenya where the Chief Justice failed, for many years, to make rules of procedure for human rights cases\u2014he was the constitutional institution for this purpose. The courts are better placed to implement the spirit of the constitution even if no laws are made. This is truer of courts in the common law systems, where judges are recognized as lawmakers to some extent.

Corruption, ineptitude, and lack of political will can obstruct implementation even if the laws and institutions do exist. That takes us to the external aspect of implementation\u2014society. 1.3 SOCIETAL CONTEXT So far, we have discussed what might be called technical issues in implementation, which experience shows are secondary to other factors. Constitutionalism cannot be willed, it must be established by deep commitment and sustained activity. The constitution cannot achieve any thing by itself. Like Marx\u2019s commodities, it does not have arms and legs. It must be mobilized, acted upon, and used. This idea is also expressed by Granville Austin,9 in his monumental study of the working and impact of the Indian Constitution, who says that a constitution, however living, is inert. A constitution does not work, it is worked. The real task of establishing constitutionalism, therefore, lies in other spheres: politics, the judiciary, the rise of professionalism, civic associations, and enlightened leadership. The fortunes of a constitution are shaped by many factors: personalities and elites, political parties and other organizations, social structures, economic changes, and traditions of constitutionalism. The constitution operates within society and seeks to infl uence its development. It may set out guidelines for the exercise of power and the aspirations that the State must fulfi l. But society also impacts on the constitution. The distinguished Indian sociologist, Andre B\u00e9teille, believes that a constitution can provide directions for the national development, but whether, and the pace at which, the development takes place depends on society.10 The constitution may set out guidelines for the exercise of power and the aspirations that the State must fulfi l. Nevertheless, society also impacts on the constitution, sometime giving it a push in the directions adopted in the constitution, and sometimes negating them. We have placed unjustifi ed reliance on the capacity of the constitution to infl uence society. Comparative constitutional law restricts itself to legal rules and techniques and says little about the society in which constitutions operate. The political order, intended to be set up by the constitution, competes with other models of power and ideologies, and realities. In most societies, it is society which has determined the extent to which the constitution will be observed, manipulated, or disregarded. B\u00e9teille\u2019s brilliant insight needs to be supplemented by a consideration of the obstacles to progress placed by the inherited, pre-constitution bias of the State apparatus. Perhaps, inadequate attention has been paid to IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 193 these obstacles, as opposed to societal obstacles, because it is assumed that the constitution has the primary function of designing and structuring the State. However, as we have mentioned above, it may structure institutions, but may fail to infuse them with values and principles. The constitution tends to structure macro institutions but often says little about values and procedures of the administration of the state which may persist from one constitution to another. The constitution may not only fail to mould civic values or the behaviour of key political actors, it also fails to generate a state which is capable of sound social policies, and fair and honest administration. Two inter-related factors, at least, have characterized the State in many developing polities\u2014the colonial, fashioned to establish the hegemony of a particular class, and what Jean-Francois Bayart has called the \u2018politics of the belly\u2019,11 and what others call the politics of eating.12 Everywhere the colonial state was exclusionary, built on racial and ethnic distinctions, with a stronger bureaucracy for this reason. The bureaucracy was rooted in the imperative of the dominance of the various societies that made up the colony, the close relationship between the colonial administration and the foreign, business community, and consequent economic disparities, and its resistance to democracy. In fact, it is this tradition rather than any adaptation to independence or democracy that marks the present reality. This system was buttressed by a battery of repressive laws and a repressive legal system which survived the colonial era and which constantly undermines new democratic constitutions. These characteristics ensured that independence would not bring about social transformation but merely the partial replacement of the old ruling group by the local elite, politicians as well bureaucrats, who found the colonial repressive apparatus highly functional. Bayart identifi es three factors which have sustained the authoritarian tradition, despite appearance of democratization: control over the security forces which has enabled them to maintain a covert harassment of the opposition forces, control over economic rents with which they have bought off dissident politicians and weakened the opposition, and the support", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1792ce68-3813-4e35-888c-fcf46db4b09f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1792ce68-3813-4e35-888c-fcf46db4b09f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6498471bbf21a5c206a3a81d652d3c801f061be0d28fa6322dafccc150531257"}}, "hash": "6498471bbf21a5c206a3a81d652d3c801f061be0d28fa6322dafccc150531257", "text": "of western powers obsessed about order and stability. More specifi cally, for many countries, there is an additional factor: the ethnicization of politics, which serves to obscure the underlying process and the reality of inequality and powerlessness, and is closely connected to the politics of eating (which is not, as Bayart clarifi es, merely gastronomic, but aspires to a network of relations, patronage, incentives, and sanctions that sustain an individual or group\u2019s hegemony). This is the colonial 194 THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION, RIGHTS, AND CONSTITUTIONS predatory state, but crude and criminalized, relying on impunities, without the sophistication of the colonialist. There are other forces, deeply rooted in society, that undermine the values of the constitution. Many countries have remnants of feudalism (often tied to religious beliefs), under which there is a hierarchy of castes or communities, and in which allegiance and services are owed to traditional leaders. Feudalism is characterized by unequal distribution of resources, authority, and prestige\u2014and rights. It has its own system of rewards and sanctions\u2014sanctions which can be severe, as in honour killings. In many parts of the world, this feudalism, transformed into modern politics and class relations, has negated the values as well as institutions of the constitution. Economic interests, particularly under the impact of globalization, have not been friendly to constitutions. The state restructuring of the 1960s, which heralded the contemporary phase of globalization, dealt a big blow to the provision of health, educational, and water services to the poor people, whose impact on the growth of poverty is still felt. The spread and intensifi cation of patent and other intellectual property rights, largely under the dominance of the West, and emergence of huge multi- national corporations and the increased infl uence of international trading and fi nance agencies, have weakened the capacity of states to fulfi l their obligations in respect of socio-economic rights\u2014and denied the basic premise underlying the constitution of an autonomous state. The powers that the constitution gives state agencies, thus, elude them. In so far as the kind of constitutions we are discussing are oriented towards the MDGs and social justice, that is, people-centred, it is especially important to redress the balance between politicians and traditional and new elites on the one hand, and the people on the other. What is required is the genuine empowerment of the people, promoting an awareness of public issues and procedures, the role of public institutions, familiarity with their constitutional rights, the mechanisms to protect and mobilize them, and institutions and opportunities to express their views, and to demand accountability. We have suggested that the constitution should provide effective entry points for civil society initiatives. Civil society institutions could bring legal actions on behalf of the disadvantaged and the voiceless, they could work with state institutions to establish standards and benchmarks for social progress and justice, they could mobilize the people to take advantage of provisions for public participation, they could inform and educate on constitutional issues, they could have played a critical role in the reporting to regional and international bodies on the IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING THE CONSTITUTION 195 fulfi lment of the country\u2019s international obligations, particularly regarding human rights. Ultimately, the people have to be guardians of the constitution. To perform this role the people must: understand the constitution and know their rights \u2022 know how to use the machinery of the constitution and the law to \u2022 hold public authorities accountable be involved in the conduct of public affairs \u2022 act as agents of accountability, for example, by: \u2022 providing alternative budgets or analysing draft state budgets \u00ba publishing annual assessments of the record of government \u00ba and corporations of human rights, social justice, environment, and natural resource policies, and so on providing alternative reports (often known as shadow reports \u00ba to regional and international human rights supervising bodies on the national record undertaking constitutional litigation to prevent the state or \u00ba private interests from breaching the constitution or law. However, all this may not, and will not, be enough for the transformation of social relations. The agenda of MDGs cannot effectively be achieved through the activities of civil society unless signifi cant portions of it convert themselves into a direct political force, challenging the hegemony of the existing, increasingly corrupt and irresponsible, political classes. Fundamentally, implementing a constitution is not about this or that provision, or even the totality of the constitution, important as these are. It is about the inculcation of a culture of respect for and discipline of the law, acceptance of rulings by the courts, and other bodies authorized to interpret the law, giving effect to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc05ed94-eabd-4ed0-b1b2-e185945c4594": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc05ed94-eabd-4ed0-b1b2-e185945c4594", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Millennium Declaration, Rights, and Constitutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3469feefffe02f1cf00a017f7cda6d97ee01b09430ab5d5243ebd0dd1a49c350"}, "3": {"node_id": "948d7575-e04c-4679-9a55-025ca5ae94f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/millennium-declaration-rights-and-constitutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b66957872578a613b77cfa911db00e09a4b04769688df5cefd53b05ee1c8a108"}}, "hash": "fc17d2db2eb7449761844fd12dbf92f15950fd978c72642dbcf1c69274d21ba6", "text": "judicial decisions, acceptance of the limits on the government, respecting and promoting human and collective rights, the participation and empowering of the people.

Rajivan National Trade and Development Strategies: 04-52 Suggested Policy Directions Kamal Malhotra Trade and Health in Asia: 54-83 Challenges of Globalization Chantal Blouin Table of Contents At the dawn of what many have called the \u2018Asian Century\u2019, several countries in the region have gained recognition for the speed with which they are growing. Having achieved such high levels of growth, they now find themselves facing another issue: striving to match economic gains with equally effective poverty reduction, addressing growing inequalities and bolstering human development. In essence, putting a \u201chuman face\u201d to trade and growth. The Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, Trade on Human Terms, won the 2007 Human Development Award for Excellence and Innovation for a Regional HDR. This flagship UNDP Report has contributed to the policy debate on how to align trade and economic policies with human development goals based on independent and rigorous research. The present publication aims to continue the discussion by bringing together two extremely relevant technical background papers, both prepared for the HDR. The first paper, National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions, by Kamal Malhotra, projects a two-way relationship in which boosting human development also has a catalytic effect on trade and vice versa. The paper concentrates on the analysis of national trade and development strategies in the Asia-Pacific region. What makes it unique is its use of lessons learned from Asia-Pacific countries to identify ingredients for success in bolstering human development. The paper provides strategy options and avoids inflexible prescriptions. The second paper, Trade and Health in Asia: Challenges of Globalization, by Chantal Blouin, delves into the pros and cons of approaches to boosting health services and trade. The breadth of issues includes privatization, health tourism and the \u2018brain drain\u2019.

Omar Noman Chief of Policies & Programmes UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre in Colombo Foreword 1 The Asia-Pacific is at the forefront of globalization and one of the world\u2019s most rapidly growing regions. At the same time, inequalities are growing, both between countries and within national borders. Trade is increasingly being subjected to two opposing forces - increased liberalization and increased restrictions - even as the playing field remains unbalanced. The international architecture remains contested and bilateral agreements are proliferating. Yet autarky is hardly an option in this inter-connected world. Countries of Asia-Pacific are renowned for the speed with which they have developed economically. That was the relatively easy part. Now they find themselves at a different frontier - trying to combine economic success with equally rapid poverty reduction, combating growing inequalities and promoting human development - in other words, trading on human terms. The two papers in this selection address important aspects of the trade and human development dynamic. In National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions, Kamal Malhotra considers the impressive performance of some Asian economies, whose gains have been translated into significant poverty reduction and human development advances. Based on a variety of domestic policies and strategies, the paper suggests a purposeful approach to economic integration and globalization. A strategic national trade and industrial policy that focuses on selective and time bound infant industry protection can be catalytic. The paper also hones in on the key role of other sectoral and macro-economic policies, particularly in the area of trade in agriculture and the services. In Trade and Health in Asia: Challenges of Globalisation, Chantal Blouin investigates the pros and cons of approaches for boosting health services and trade. She examines a range of issues spanning privatization, health tourism and the phenomenon of \u2018brain drain\u2019. Advantages and drawbacks of international commitments are also spotlighted, coming on the heels of changes to GATS and TRIPS agreements. Governments that focus on trade and health services could reap concrete and immediate benefits. Adjusting trade policies to enhance health services is quite an uncharted territory through which many countries in the region are picking their own course, for example by health tourism. The key, therefore, lies in experimenting while committing in ways that allow change. The ultimate yardstick of success must be quality of people\u2019s lives, rather than selling more. Anuradha K.

The key instruments of such a national trade and development strategy are not limited to narrow trade measures such as tariffs, but include a range of trade related policies and in- struments that are designed to actively promote both domestic industrialization and increase the volume of higher value added manufacturing and services exports. Indeed, the primary purpose of both domes- tic and international trade policy, if it is to be truly developmental in its impact and outcomes, should be to enhance the prospects of achieving a diversi- fied economy and widening and deepening its base, thereby increasing high quality employment oppor- tunities and possibilities. This should be a critical poli- cy objective for all developing countries, since almost every country that has experienced rapid growth in its productivity and standard of living over the last two centuries has achieved this as a result of diversifica- tion and relatively high value added industrialization. In the post World War II period, only a few developing countries have consistently managed to close the eco- nomic gap between themselves and economically ad- vanced nations. These countries, located primarily in Northeast and Southeast Asia, adopted a varied mix of domestic investment approaches and unconventional domestic innovations. This stimulated high economic growth rates and extremely rapid, manufacture- based export growth. More importantly, this resulted in high manufacturing value added and significantly increased income in the most successful cases. Gains from these outcomes eventually translated into sig- nificant poverty reduction and human development advances. A vast body of literature exists, which has attempted to identify and assess the principal reasons behind the success of these Asian countries. One fact that clearly stands out is that there are no simple, sin- gle factor explanations for such a diverse range of ex- periences and successes. There is, however, one common theme that exists in all these cases. All the successful Asian countries ap- proached global economic integration in a selective, purposeful and strategic manner, rather than relying on passive and indiscriminate global integration. This has been the principal factor behind both managing globalization successfully, and benefiting from the opportunities it offers to advance poverty reduction and human development objectives. The real policy debate, therefore, should not be over whether economic integration with the global econ- omy is good or bad, but rather over policies and pri- orities. The key questions which need to be addressed are: What is the correct sequence of policies? Does progressive and deeper external liberaliza- tion benefit every country\u2019s interests and in all its many dimensions? What types of public investment will best support trade and industrial policy? What are the key ingredients of industrial policy in the 21st century? Linked to this, how much priority should deep im- port liberalization receive? What types of macroeconomic policies will best support trade and industrial policy? This paper seeks to address these and other related questions in a policy relevant manner. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 7 Public Investment: A Critical Resource 2 T here is now a broad consensus across the political and ideological spectrum on the need for gov- ernments to make non-targeted, public investments in a range of sectors including health, education and infrastructure. Indeed, such investments have played a critical role in Asian countries, many of which saw their public investment to GDP ratios rise in the 1980s and 1990s. For example, the Republic of Korea\u2019s public investment to GDP ratio rose", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6950151d-cab4-4255-a818-ed226fec8478": {"__data__": {"id_": "6950151d-cab4-4255-a818-ed226fec8478", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "482708f1d8b20ed0cc236ba0314e00eb6105a5ac9f5d6bae86470b7c8bd16c13"}}, "hash": "482708f1d8b20ed0cc236ba0314e00eb6105a5ac9f5d6bae86470b7c8bd16c13", "text": "by 14 per cent between the 1970s and 1980s and by an additional 14 per cent between the 1980s and 1990s. Thailand\u2019s ratios in- creased respectively by 16 per cent and 14 per cent between these two periods, while Malaysia\u2019s ratio rose by a spectacular 60 per cent between the 1970s and 1980s (UNDP, 2005d, page 52-53). This section high- lights the critical role that public investment plays in three important areas: human development, research and development and infrastructure. Significant pub- lic investment in these areas can yield enormous divi- dends for strategic national trade policy. Indeed, lib- eralization is likely to carry significant risks, if it is not preceded by adequate and appropriate investment in health, education and infrastructure. Investing in Human Development Initial conditions matter. As already indicated, a coun- try\u2019s level of human development is an important and useful barometer of the degree to which it is likely to benefit from trade liberalization specifically and from international trade more generally. Countries and people with higher levels of human development are more likely to benefit from trade and economic growth, compounding already existing global and na- tional inequalities. China\u2019s current success can be partly explained by its attainment of relatively good basic human develop- ment indicators by the 1970s, prior to its embarking on a gradual economic opening to the world economy in 1978. This was accomplished primarily through the country\u2019s provision of universal access to health and education after the communist revolution. In this context, the huge gaps that exist between eco- nomically advanced and developing countries remain a concern. This extends not just to basic health and education indicators, but also to the tertiary enrol- ment ratio, the number of scientific and technical per- sonnel; and research and development expenditure. As a consequence, productivity increases in the devel- oping world are lower than those in industrial coun- tries. The resultant impact on the economic output of developing countries contributes to the growing in- equality between the rich and poor world. Indeed, as the UNDP said over fifteen years ago, \u201cIf developing countries are to trade on a more equal basis, they will need massive investments in people \u2013 because knowledge and the mastery of new tech- nology are a country\u2019s best competitive advantage today\u201d (UNDP, 1992). This argument was made well even before the need for non-targeted public invest- ments in health and education on a non-user fee basis was broadly accepted by the Bretton Woods institu- tions. Support for active government intervention in areas such as health and basic education now enjoys a broad consensus, although this is still not the case for critical areas such as tertiary education, despite the recognition that this area will be an increasingly important factor in determining a country\u2019s competi- tiveness in the 21st century. The international commu- nity\u2019s blind spot with respect to tertiary education has been reinforced by the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) on universal access to education, which while crystallizing the rights agenda on education, has not allowed a reasoned debate on what the appropri- ate mix of primary, secondary and tertiary education should be. This is unfortunate, because there is growing evidence from the Republic of Korea, India and other countries that public investment in tertiary education has high economic returns and is now emerging as a key in- gredient of economic success. The government of the Republic of Korea made huge public investments in technology infrastructure together with investments aimed at creating both general and technical skills. The country had the highest rate of university enrolment in the world in 2004 and enrolments in technical areas National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 8 at the tertiary level were over twice the OECD ratio. The Republic of Korea produces more engineers every year than India does, despite the much smaller size of its population and India\u2019s considerable achievements in tertiary level, technical education (Lall, 2004). There is also widespread agreement that the princi- pal factor behind the success of India\u2019s software and IT industries has been world class technical educa- tion at the tertiary level, financed primarily by its na- tional government. The much lamented \u2018brain drain\u2019 associated with this has now been transformed into a combination of \u2018brain gain\u2019 and \u2018brain circulation\u2019. A significant number of India\u2019s engineering graduates who went overseas after graduating have been re- turning home, either permanently or for large parts of the year. These graduates have not only brought back newly acquired skills and the latest technology but also considerable investment from Silicon Valley in the US and other countries.

Bangalore\u2019s excellent reputation for a number of high quality tertiary technical institutions has contributed significantly to its current recognition as a global IT and R&D hub (Pack and Saggi, 2006). It is thus clearly apparent that public investment in health and education is valuable, not only because of the inherent importance of these assets, but more im- portantly as a means for achieving strategic economic goals. Human development improvements in these areas will lead to a perceptible improvement in the capacity of people to contribute to economic growth and trade. A healthier, more skilled and educated workforce is also likely to display greater productiv- ity, which in turn will translate into both higher and greater value-addition exports. It is therefore clear that countries can derive tangible economic benefits from investing in health and education. It naturally follows that public investment in these and other ba- sic human development areas should be viewed as essential. The formidable challenge facing developing countries in the 21st century is accelerating progress in achieving the MDGs in areas of basic human needs (e.g., basic education, primary health care, food security). Invest- ing in science and technology education along with building technical and managerial skills is also a chal- lenge. Simultaneous public investment in all these ar- eas is essential if countries desire to move beyond low value-added production and trade. As emphasised in the Millennium Project report, an upward movement in value-added production and trade will not be possible without a substantial in- crease in public investment in a number of areas, particularly in the poorest countries (UN Millennium Project, 2005). Ranis and Stewart (2005a) have iden- tified three critical public investment ratios, which will need to increase steadily and significantly if de- veloping countries are to meet the challenges they face. These are (1) the public expenditure ratio or the proportion of GNP spent by various levels of govern- ment, (2) the social allocation ratio or the proportion of total government expenditure channelled to hu- man development sectors, and (3) the priority ratio or the proportion of total human development sector expenditure spent on priorities identified within these sectors. Drawing on data from various UNDP annual human development reports, they illustrate that while both Kenya and Malawi allocated a similar proportion of their national incomes to public expenditure, Kenya had both a significantly higher social allocation ratio and priority ratio compared to Malawi. As a result, the proportion of GDP going directly to human develop- ment enhancing priorities in Kenya was over three times that of Malawi (5 per cent compared to 2 per cent) in the 1980s.1 Ranis and Stewart (2005a) persuasively argue further that economic growth and human development are mutually reinforcing. This can result in an upward spi- ral (\u2018virtuous cycle\u2019), with high levels of human devel- opment leading to high economic growth, and higher economic growth further enhancing human develop- ment. Alternatively, it can lead to a downward spiral (\u2018vicious cycle\u2019), with low human development invest- ments and outcomes resulting in weak economic growth and consequently poor progress in improv- ing human development indicators. When human development investments are low, even high eco- nomic growth is unlikely to lead to an improvement Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 9 in human development, since the latter is heavily de- pendent on the social allocation and priority ratios. A number of East Asian countries have experienced a virtuous cycle. Meanwhile, Ranis and Stewart indi- cate that the largest number of countries caught in the vicious cycle can be found in Sub-Saharan Africa, although there are also a significant number in Latin America (Ranis and Stewart, 2005a, page 10). Investing in Research and Development Market failures which pertain to knowledge and skills are pervasive, which is why governments of all tech- nologically advanced countries continue to provide public investment and incentives for research and development (R&D) in these critical areas. R&D is a fundamental prerequisite for the ability of developing countries to engage in successful low level adaptation of foreign technology and reverse engineering. This is particularly crucial for technological diffusion over time and across countries. The Republic of Korea had the highest R&D expenditure in the developing world and was also ahead of all but a few leading OECD economies by 2007 (OECD, 2008; OECD, n.d.).2 Govern- ments have a responsibility to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd3d947a-4f73-4c8f-83d0-fc8c6dfe28c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd3d947a-4f73-4c8f-83d0-fc8c6dfe28c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d43606ca4e8c3a3444cb42adc5977ac290fd5c2c1323a76a6d73009bc7d6944"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c98467b-abb2-4a7b-9cf2-fd9e2d74a73d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "babe702cd35c71d422a9cd334bef474ccf5411de6705a35642a07d754b94fb6a"}}, "hash": "bec7dc49296a05ebb76b8d427fb4dc3189a34e3df675a7b6042dfe23d951d843", "text": "promote R&D. While the private sector has an important role to play, it must be emphasized that the kind of R&D that addresses the needs of poor people risks being neglected unless it is undertaken by the public sector. A particularly crucial role for governments wishing to pursue strategic national and international trade pol- icy is the conduct of what is sometimes termed \u2018fore- sight studies\u2019. These studies attempt to create a more coherent science and technology policy by identify- ing future demand and challenges that link science and technology policy to the country\u2019s economic and social needs. The process creates strategic awareness about the state of technological activity in the coun- try as well as emerging trends worldwide. This enables the government and domestic private sector to assess implications for national priorities and competitive- ness. Developing countries which are involved in such studies include India, the Republic of Korea, South Africa, Thailand and several Latin American countries (UNDP, 2001). In addition to their own direct role in this area, gov- ernments can also create incentives for others to in- vest in R&D. The two most promising avenues for the promotion of technology-oriented research have been the fostering of links between universities and industry, and fiscal incentives to promote R&D by pri- vate firms. \u2018Push\u2019 incentives support research by chan- nelling public money to the most promising research activities in public universities and institutions, while \u2018pull\u2019 incentives promise to pay only if a desirable out- come is achieved (such as a tuberculosis vaccine or drought-resistant maize variety), whether produced by a public or private institution. Governments have also used a range of policy options to stimulate R&D within the private sector. One option has been for the government to provide matching funds for R&D, as in Malaysia where the government contributes $1.25 for every $1 invested in R&D by private firms. Another approach has been for the government to co-finance R&D through a technology fund which disburses re- sources as a conditional loan that is to be repaid if a venture succeeds, but is written off if it fails (Ibid). Actively promoting links between universities and industry can also stimulate R&D and policy-oriented innovation. High-technology companies thrive on state-of-the-art knowledge and creativity as well as the scientific and technical expertise of universities. Meanwhile, public R&D is often needed for new indus- tries to successfully identify, adapt, and obtain tech- nology from abroad. China presents an interesting case in this regard because it appears to have lever- aged a variety of government programmes to support R&D which prioritized high technology industry in the 1990s. Tsinghua University, for example, established the Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry Institute jointly with Sino-Petrochemical Engineer- ing Company. Simultaneously, the State Torch Pro- gramme encouraged enterprises to strengthen their ties with research institutions in an attempt to acceler- ate the commercialization of research results. Chinese universities have also established science parks. The Shanghai Technology Park acts as an incubator for the rapid application of scientific and technological work in industry. China is also using R&D to improve the productivity of traditional activities in agriculture. For example, the Spark Programme propagates technolo- gies to the countryside and assists farmers in using them for agricultural development (Ibid). Despite these examples of public-private partnership National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 10 in R&D, public R&D still remains the main source of innovation for much of what can be called poor peo- ple\u2019s technology in both economically advanced and developing countries. Moreover, industry initiatives are no substitute for structural policy responses from governments. Regrettably, however, public R&D has long been under-funded at both national and interna- tional levels. No global framework currently exists for supporting research and development that addresses the common needs of poor people. It is difficult to visualise how the current dismal state of affairs with respect to public R&D investment will be reversed since there is an absence of both a dedicated source of funding and an appropriate mechanism for global transfers. Despite clear evidence of high returns, na- tional and international agricultural research in poor countries remains a particularly neglected area. New energy technologies are also under-funded. Research and development spending in this area is low relative to both the direct value of energy spending and the negative environmental impacts of conventional en- ergy sources (Ibid).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c98467b-abb2-4a7b-9cf2-fd9e2d74a73d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c98467b-abb2-4a7b-9cf2-fd9e2d74a73d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d43606ca4e8c3a3444cb42adc5977ac290fd5c2c1323a76a6d73009bc7d6944"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd3d947a-4f73-4c8f-83d0-fc8c6dfe28c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bec7dc49296a05ebb76b8d427fb4dc3189a34e3df675a7b6042dfe23d951d843"}}, "hash": "babe702cd35c71d422a9cd334bef474ccf5411de6705a35642a07d754b94fb6a", "text": "One area of concern is that, not only is public invest- ment in R&D under funded, but it is also shrinking relative to private R&D investment.

Over 60 per cent of research and development in the OECD region was conducted by the private sec- tor by the late 1990s (Ibid). While this proportion has been growing, the role played by public R&D in rich countries has been shrinking. The most worrying as- pect of the increasing trend towards the privatization of R&D is the neglect of the poor\u2019s needs. This is high- lighted by the fact that less than 10 per cent of global spending on health research is devoted to the major health problems of 90 per cent of the world\u2019s popula- tion.3 The eventual outcome is a sharper increase in in- equalities. Another consequence of the privatization of R&D is that basic scientific and technical knowledge has become increasingly privatized. As a result, infor- mation that previously used to appear in the public domain is now likely to be patented or copyrighted. Over 90 per cent of new patents issued in any given year are accounted for by OECD countries. The end result of these developments is that access and pro- hibitive costs are now emerging as major obstacles to technology transfer and innovation in developing countries. The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement and the wide and growing spectrum of \u201cTRIPS-plus\u201d bilateral and regional free trade agreements tend to make it even more difficult for developing countries to gain access to key patent- ed products, which are often owned by private firms and universities in industrial countries. This situation needs to be urgently addressed, not only if the Mil- lennium Development Goals are to be met but also if the sharp and widening gap between the developing world\u2019s research needs and the rich world\u2019s research agenda is to be bridged. Investing in Infrastructure Trade-related infrastructure must prioritize transport, storage and telecommunications systems. Such in- frastructural facilities must essentially encompass a functional network of rural and international roads, railways, ports and airports, telephones and internet facilities, as well as efficient storage facilities, and en- ergy and water services. Since some of these needs are regional in nature they cannot be addressed at an individual country level. Most areas however can, and should, be addressed through public investment, which can be complemented by the creation of an enabling environment for greater domestic private investment. However, delivering well functioning markets with the necessary transport, telecommuni- cations, storage and energy infrastructure remains a major challenge for most developing countries, in- cluding several countries in the Asia-Pacific region. A fundamental trade-related issue faced by many de- veloping countries, in particular the poorest, is that they are ill-equipped to take full advantage of new trade opportunities, owing to their supply-side capac- ity constraints. For example, gaining improved market access is a futile exercise if the countries lack the ca- pacity and transportation to sell. The leading priority for the poorest countries must therefore be to address their export supply capacity constraints through in- creased investment in infrastructure, and their pro- ductive capacities and skills (Helleiner, 2002, page 89; UNCTAD, 2007). The current renewed emphasis on these issues through the prioritization of Aid for Trade in the context of the Doha Round appears to acknowl- edge much if not all of this, recognizing that a broader definition of competitiveness must include trade re- lated infrastructure issues. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 11 The principal theme of virtually all the Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies conducted under the six-agency Integrated Framework for Trade Related Technical As- sistance for the LDCs (IF) over the past five years has been that transport bottlenecks (e.g. limited storage facilities at the railhead in Lesotho) tend to raise the cost of both exports and imports far more than for- mal trade policies. According to research conducted by UNCTAD and UNECA, the international transport and insurance costs of landlocked African countries account for an estimated average of 21 per cent of the value of their imports, compared to the world aver- age of 5.4 per cent and a 12.7 per cent average for all African countries.

The challenge is more acute for landlocked coun- tries, where transport costs are 50 per cent higher and trade volumes less than half those of similar coastal countries (Commission for Africa, 2005). Astonishing- ly, transport costs in landlocked countries can account for as much as 75 per cent of the value of exports. Ship- ping a car from Japan to Abidjan costs US$1,500, but shipping the same car from Abidjan to Addis Ababa costs US$5,000 (Ibid). The World Bank has attempted to measure the bene- fits which have accrued from investments and reforms in four aspects of trade facilitation, including port ef- ficiency and trade-related services infrastructure. The research aims to assess the impact of improvements in these areas on the potential increase in trade among 75 countries. The findings suggest that better trade facilitation would increase trade among the 75 coun- tries by about 10 per cent, or $377 billion. About $107 billion of this amount would be generated from more efficient ports, and $154 billion from enhancing infra- structure in the trade-related services sector (World Bank, 2005, page 13). A WTO programme \u2212 Aid for Trade \u2212 will enable de- veloping countries to enhance their competitiveness, through the establishment of appropriate standards and the diversification of their agricultural, industrial and services capabilities and exports. However, such interventions must also take into account the vast spectrum of human, institutional and other produc- tive capacity and supply-side constraints in a compre- hensive and coherent manner. For example, it would be a futile exercise to build a port, if the essential in- frastructure to effectively manage it is not in place. A significantly enhanced IF and Aid for Trade needs assessments exercises should be used as the basis for identifying larger capacity building projects and proposals for LDCs and other low income developing countries. This exercise will need to be supported by additional measures including a broader \u2018aid for trade\u2019 package. International support for the trade-related infrastruc- ture needs of developing countries thus requires continuous, long-term commitments in the form of traditional development assistance as a major source of financial resources (which would supplement do- mestic resource mobilization). The resource implica- tions are estimated as fairly substantial. Current cost estimates for resolving the critical infrastructure bot- tlenecks in Africa alone are estimated at $52.2 billion per year in public and private investment, and about half of this financing will need to go towards energy (MDG Africa Steering Group, 2008). This clearly under- estimates the actual funding requirement, since it ex- cludes areas such as spending on ports and airports. This is well above the baseline projection made by the OECD-DAC, which indicated that between 2002 and 2005, donors committed an average of $21 billion per year on aid categories most closely related with Aid for Trade (OECD and WTO, 2007). This aid was com- mitted by donors at the 2005 G-8 Gleneagles Summit, the 2006 G-8 Saint Petersburg Summit, the 2007 G-8 Heiligendamm Summit and, most recently, at the first ever Aid for Trade Global Review in Geneva (Novem- ber 2007). This represents a significant increase in ab- solute terms in trade-related assistance4, especially if viewed in the context of the major decline in aid for in- frastructure and productive capacity building projects in the 1990s. However, it remains sharply below the amount required by Africa, let alone that of the devel- oping world as a whole. National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 12 Despite a number of developing country concerns, many of which are clearly reasonable, it is plausible to argue that the current renewed emphasis on aid for trade is legitimate and, if handled appropriately, can be beneficial not only for LDCs but also for all devel- oping countries. However, in order to be more effec- tive, it must be emphasised that aid for trade funding aimed at augmenting trade-related infrastructure should be in addition to and not at the expense of de- velopment assistance available for other critical areas of development. These funds can, as has historically been the case, be channelled in the form of grants or concessional loans. Certain areas which have tradi- tionally been neglected should be prioritized.

There should also be explicit consen- sus on the fact that even an ambitious aid for trade package cannot and should not be viewed as a sub- stitute for the development dimensions enunciated in the Doha Round, although it can serve as an important complement to them. There is also a pressing need for a shift in focus away from the current \u2018conditionality\u2019 mindset which seeks to link aid for trade with trade liberalization and integration. The direction should in- stead be towards using aid for trade primarily for trade development. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 13 G iven that agriculture is unlikely to emerge as a major area of comparative advantage within the Asia-Pacific region as a whole in the foreseeable fu- ture (even though it is for some products for countries such as Thailand and Vietnam), the principal rationale underlying strategic and selective government inter- vention in industrial policy formulation is to develop a national trade policy that actively promotes both domestic industrialization and increases the volume of higher value added manufacturing and services exports. This should be a critical policy objective for all developing countries, since almost every country that has experienced a rapid growth in its productivity and standard of living over the last two centuries, has achieved this as a result of industrialization (Murphy et al., 1989, page 1003). It is important to note that the definition of domestic industrial policies used in this paper encompasses both the manufacturing and services sectors of an economy. Domestic industrial policy can either reinforce5 or counteract a country\u2019s given comparative advan- tages. Such policies often aim at converting a coun- try\u2019s inherent comparative advantage into a dynamic one. If successful, it should not only translate into an increasing share of exports in overall GDP but, more importantly, lead to higher value added contributions from both the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy. The importance of achieving higher value addition and incomes from manufacturing and services cannot be overstated since these are the key ingredients that enable countries to reap the full ben- efits of globalization, while simultaneously encourag- ing a virtuous circle of growth, poverty reduction and human development. Dynamic competitive advantage needs to be built because comparative advantage theory is static in nature and ignores the linkages that exist between present choices and future production possibilities. It thus follows that this theory is not the best guide to the pattern of international specialization which a country should pursue, particularly when there are asymmetric learning opportunities associated with the production of different goods or technology use. Rather, the choice of what products and technolo- gies developing countries should opt to specialise in and prioritize ought to be based on their potential for long-term growth and industrialization (Succar, 1987), rather than static or short-term possibilities and con- siderations. This raises the important question: will specialization raise a country\u2019s overall productivity if the country opens its economy? Empirical findings from an im- portant study by Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) indicate that countries begin to diversify after their very initial stages of development. It is only relatively late in the development process that they start the process of specialization. The study suggests that specialisation may not be an essential ingredient of development and, as Rodrik puts it, \u201cthe trick seems to be to acquire mastery over a broader range of activities, instead of concentrating on what one does best.\u201d (Rodrik, 2004, page 6-7). The widely accepted critical importance of techno- logical innovation in determining rates of economic growth, combined with the belief that technologi- cal innovation is concentrated in the industrial sec- tor (Greenwald and Stiglitz, 2006), are pivotal factors. These factors underlie the rationale for strategic trade and industrial policy. Industrial activity typically takes place in large, stable and densely concentrated firms, as opposed to agricultural and craft production, for example. The latter type of production is highly de- centralized among many small, unstable, and short- lived enterprises. Inherent characteristics of industrial enterprises make them the ideal base for knowledge and human capital accumulation; provide a much eas- ier taxable base for government revenue that can be used to enhance education and health care systems, and support public research and development, in- cluding in agriculture and other non-industrial sectors. Additionally, positive spillovers from industrial policy and innovation are crucial for growth and dynamism in the agricultural sector (Ibid.), similar to the very early crucial stages of development, when agricul- tural surpluses were crucial for industrialization.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9cbeb26-5d45-4c0a-be12-b80c33e898cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9cbeb26-5d45-4c0a-be12-b80c33e898cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fffaf3af9d689ba9c3916869cd6dcba32db9ecd4982533b867910b1e4da1e4cf"}, "3": {"node_id": "551d07c5-8ab0-4e48-bd06-35579d5778fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e01b4cd716171f74e8a3d93a7ccf4b5b45dd767d5f45aa7636354cd87d89701a"}}, "hash": "255db9b73609ab5fafe61fc763c4aefb6570bec4cd09e99cff1a7f4c02c51c9e", "text": "These widely acknowledged facts reinforce the rationale for Strategic National Trade and Industrial Policy 3 National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 14 a strategic national trade and industrial policy. They include the fact that industrial policy requires learn- ing and capability building, and that market failures arising from importing and using technology can only be dealt with by appropriate government interven- tion (Lall, 2004). Infant Industry and Infant Economy Protection In this context it is important to assess the appropri- ate role for governments in fashioning such a policy. Although it is acknowledged that governments will need to play multiple roles, the most critical one (which is supported by past literature and trade theo- ry) is that of selective infant industry promotion. If im- plemented properly (as was done to a large extent in the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, province of China), the tangible outcomes provide a powerful empirical validation of trade theory. Almost every country that has successfully industrialized, either historically or more recently, has passed through an infant industry phase (Shafaeddin, 2006a, page 3). Bardhan (1971) noted that the infant industry argu- ment is dynamic in nature and provided the first dy- namic model of Learning by Doing (LBD) in an open economy. Based upon this, Bardhan derived the con- cepts of the optimum extent and time path of protec- tion to the learning industry. Building on this work, Succar (1987) argued that to qualify for assistance, infant industries should demonstrate both dynamic, learning-by-doing economies and positive intra-indus- try learning benefit spillovers. She also suggested that the significant positive inter-industry learning exter- nalities that are likely to result in developing countries strengthen rather than weaken the case for infant industry protection (Ibid.). Thus government inter- vention to promote industries characterized by LBD economies and those that generate significant and positive intra-industry and/or inter-industry spillovers should be an integral part of strategic trade and in- dustrial policy in developing countries. It also follows that such interventions need to be selective, rather than \u2018blanket\u2019 in nature, primarily because offering uniform protection to all activities makes little sense when learning processes and positive spillovers differ by technology and activities (Lall, 2004). Baldwin (1969) provides additional arguments in sup- port of infant industry protection. These include the costs of knowledge acquisition by firms even though such knowledge may not be appropriable by them - this is the standard argument for subsidizing R&D. In addition, subsidies would also help to offset on-the- job training costs. Owing to labour mobility, these costs may not be recoverable and the benefits may never materialize for a firm. Another argument put forward by Baldwin in favour of infant industry protec- tion is that static positive externalities will result from the production of a good and investment in new in- dustries. The benefits may become freely available to potential competitors, making it difficult for investors to earn a rate of return high enough to justify their ini- tial investment. Greenwald and Stiglitz (2006) go even further, arguing that there are often trade-offs between static efficien- cies and long-term growth, since markets by them- selves do not necessarily or in general lead to overall dynamic efficiency. They suggest that the dynamic benefits of broad trade restrictions may outweigh their static costs, creating a case for time-bound protection of the economy as a whole (termed \u2018infant economy\u2019 protection), rather than just infant industries. Tariffs and Industrial Development It is important to assess the implications of infant in- dustry or infant economy protection for tariff policy. The principal issue that needs to be considered is that a successful industrialization process is both ongoing and cumulative in nature. It involves moving up the ladder, from the basic stage of industrial production to higher rungs that are manifested in higher-value added skills and technology. Typically, this involves moving up the production chain, from resource based and labour intensive manufacturing, to low, through medium, to high technology and skill intensive prod- ucts (Aky\u00fcz, 2005a). All countries do not necessarily start at the resource based end, since this depends on their national endowments, and the process is not strictly sequential. However, the progression from low skill and low technology intensive to high skill and high technology intensive industries described here has been broadly typical of all successful industrial- ized economies. Those include relatively recent ones such as Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, prov- ince of China.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "551d07c5-8ab0-4e48-bd06-35579d5778fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "551d07c5-8ab0-4e48-bd06-35579d5778fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fffaf3af9d689ba9c3916869cd6dcba32db9ecd4982533b867910b1e4da1e4cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9cbeb26-5d45-4c0a-be12-b80c33e898cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "255db9b73609ab5fafe61fc763c4aefb6570bec4cd09e99cff1a7f4c02c51c9e"}}, "hash": "e01b4cd716171f74e8a3d93a7ccf4b5b45dd767d5f45aa7636354cd87d89701a", "text": "Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 15 Therefore, the tariff protection requirements for infant industries at these different stages of labour or tech- nological intensity levels are quite", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc80dbd1-3d9a-45a2-b08a-8283bca204e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc80dbd1-3d9a-45a2-b08a-8283bca204e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c96a5a257d78b4201be34d8a67992f5d0eae0c17f373facf8b15cebc58199f4d"}}, "hash": "c96a5a257d78b4201be34d8a67992f5d0eae0c17f373facf8b15cebc58199f4d", "text": "different. Aky\u00fcz (2005b), drawing on both theoretical and empirical evidence, argues that the overall tariff protection re- quirements of an economy at very early stages of de- velopment are likely to be low compared to when it is at an intermediate stage of development. This is likely to decrease again when the economy reaches a ma- ture, advanced stage of development. This is attributa- ble to the fact that a country is likely to rely much more on either its natural resource advantages or its pool of unskilled and low skilled workers for labour-intensive manufacturing in which it has a static comparative advantage at very early stages of development. In ad- dition, the industrial tariff protection requirements of labour intensive industries in relatively poor countries with surplus low skilled labour are minimal, and could be phased out after a relatively short period of learn- ing and export expansion, primarily due to the less technologically demanding nature of such sectors. However, this situation will probably change as a low income country moves on to the next stage of low and medium technology intensive industrial production and attempts to become more competitive in such industries. A new generation of infant industries will need protection at this intermediate stage of devel- opment, since investors may be reluctant to venture into more technologically advanced activities unless measures to support and promote them are initiated by the government (Lall, 2004). Moreover, govern- ment intervention in support of such industries will most likely need to be of a higher magnitude and for a longer time period. This is due to the increasing tech- nological complexity and the length of time needed for learning and adaptation. There are also myriad disadvantages that late entrants face compared to al- ready established industries in more advanced coun- tries. Aky\u00fcz (2005a; 2005b) argues that protection for low labour skill intensive industries should ideally be phased out at this stage, even as protection for low and medium technology intensive industries is in- creased.6 As industrialization progresses further, higher skill and technology intensive industries will need to be phased in under selective protection. Simultaneously protec- tion for some labour intensive and low and medium technology intensive industries that have become internationally competitive on their own, and other industries that have failed to achieve the required de- gree of competitiveness will need to be phased out. The situation is likely to undergo a further transforma- tion at more advanced stages of development when the need for protection will be much lower or even non-existent and when competitiveness in a diversi- fied range of high skill and technology intensive in- dustries has already been built and established in an economy. In broad empirical terms, it was such an approach that underpinned the success of the Republic of Korea which has successfully built up the base for technolo- gy intensive industries such as steel, shipbuilding and automobiles in which the country had no prior com- parative advantage at the initial stages of its industri- alization process. Some of the key ingredients of the Republic of Korea\u2019s success include a sustained effort to upgrade and raise productivity along with value added in manufacturing. Exports were also prioritized, while protection of its traditional labour intensive in- dustries was de-prioritized after they had reached a certain stage of development. Such a strategy requires policy flexibility in both the level and direction of import tariffs for particular prod- ucts. During the initial stages, imports on which the economy is totally reliant can be tariff-exempt. After- wards, however, tariffs will need to be established to protect infant industries producing goods that were previously imported. These can be phased out as the industry matures. Technology intensive industries will require higher levels of initial protection and support than resource-based and labour intensive industries for the reasons already indicated. Capability building will result in a shift to more advanced industries. Sub- sequently, the rate and time period for protection can be lowered for technology intensive industries com- pared to the initial period and industries, primarily be- cause learning and capability building should become a quicker process. The need for tariff protection should largely cease once an industry matures or approaches maturity. In fact, at this point of development, trade liberalization can actually help foster the competi- tiveness of industries. The impressive performance of Brazil\u2019s aerospace industry is a recent example of suc- cessful targeting and selective government interven- National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 16 tion followed by liberalization in a technology inten- sive industry where continued protection at maturity would have harmed its competitiveness (Shafaeddin, 2006a, page 31).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23ea970b-1231-40f4-9b18-7b9cd498de3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "23ea970b-1231-40f4-9b18-7b9cd498de3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e31f32f6282ae99f55079244977941dca81301fdbdbdeba74c9fb9578e25db79"}}, "hash": "e31f32f6282ae99f55079244977941dca81301fdbdbdeba74c9fb9578e25db79", "text": "Given that the real world is more complex than this stylized description, industrial policy will need to differ across countries. In reality, product and industry cycles overlap, and the choice and sequencing of industries across countries differs. This depends on a range of di- verse factors, including resource endowments, initial conditions and institutional arrangements. Moreover, if product and industry cycles overlap, different in- dustries that share the same imported inputs could be affected differently by tariff protection on a spe- cific product line. In addition, even at relatively early stages of development, tariffs can be beneficial from a fiscal and balance of payments viewpoint. Countries will need to distinguish between tariffs on consumer and luxury goods, on the one hand, and those on capital goods and necessities which are not domesti- cally available (i.e. food and fuel), on the other. At early stages of development, higher tariffs should ideally be imposed on consumer goods rather than capital goods imports. That is because domestic production of consumer goods is likely to be easier and should be selectively encouraged. Meanwhile, high tariffs on im- ports of investment goods will inevitably result in rais- ing the cost of the overall domestic cost of production and domestically produced consumer goods, in addi- tion to eroding their international competitiveness. This approach should lead to a pattern of greater sec- toral concentration in the initial and advanced stages of development of a country with diversification in the intermediate stages. This is consistent with the empirical findings of Imbs and Wacziarg (2003), and common to all successful industrialisers. Industrial tar- iff changes may, thus, follow a non-linear path. There are also a number of implications for industrial tariff policy and trade negotiations in the non-agricultural market access (NAMA) area of the Doha Round (Aky\u00fcz, 2005a). Specific policy implications include the follow- ing: Infant industry protection will require the co-ex- istence of low and high tariffs on specific products at any given point in time. Different industries will require differing tariff levels, while the tariff re- quirements within the same industry can vary over time. Thus, industrial tariffs can be widely dispersed. Such dispersion may rise or fall in a given economy, depending on its stage of industrial development. Tariffs will either increase or be reduced on par- ticular products, depending on a country\u2019s stage of development. As a result, across-the-board pro- gressive liberalization will be neither possible nor desirable. It is likely that both advanced industrial countries and LDCs will require low tariffs on most products at a given point in time compared to countries at intermediate stages of development. However, a crucial difference between the two is that for LDCs which are seeking to build dynamic competitive advantage over time (rather than merely relying on their static comparative advantage as LDCs), tariffs will need to rise over time for certain industries and products. It will, therefore, be a mistake for such countries to agree to tariff bindings at levels which may be appropriate for early stages of develop- ment but not for intermediate stages of develop- ment. That is because this will make it impossible for them to move up the technology ladder later and enjoy a virtuous circle of growth, poverty re- duction and human development. It will be difficult to harmonize tariffs and make them uniform across countries, especially on a line- by-line or sectoral basis, since countries are at dif- ferent stages of the development process and thus have different needs. Prolonged protection can lead to inefficiencies and the inability of an industry to compete internation- ally. However, premature and across-the-board import liberalisation is likely to lead to de-indus- trialization. Such liberalization can also reduce the ability of a country to catch up technologically and add value to its basic labour or natural resource- based static comparative advantages (Shafaeddin, 2006a, page 32). Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 17 Thus, a key policy implication for multilateral and bi- lateral trade negotiations is that countries should not agree to bindings on a sectoral basis. Moreover, the overall bindings agreed should be high enough to ac- commodate the needs of different sectors at different stages of industrialization. Bound tariff rates at a level equivalent to the maximum average requirement for a country in the course of its industrialization process will provide an inbuilt self disciplining mechanism, since applied tariffs in areas not needed any more will need to be reduced to accommodate higher tariffs in areas where they are needed, to enable the techno- logical upgrading process.

The industrial sector of the US suffered when it tried to liberalize prematurely during 1847-61. It sub- sequently had to revert to protectionism against the UK\u2019s imports (Ibid., page 13). More recently, a number of countries, such as Kenya, have undergone rapid de- industrialization as a result of either unilateral meas- ures or external conditionality induced liberalization (UNDP, 2003b). Retaining policy flexibility on industrial tariffs is of cru- cial, strategic importance at this stage in international trade negotiations. Such flexibility is even more critical for developing countries that have not already ceded policy autonomy in this area. However, it is important even if countries have already reduced their policy flex- ibility unilaterally, as a result of loan conditionalities or because of a bilateral or regional free trade agreement. Tariff protection may not always be the most efficient way to promote technologically dynamic industries. However, many effective first best options used for industrial upgrading in the past (e.g. by the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, province of China) are no longer available to developing countries. Reversing commit- ments made as a result of multilateral or other trade agreements may also be very costly for countries. The NAMA negotiations therefore assume greater signifi- cance for policy space in the Doha Round than they would have otherwise for many developing countries, especially late industrialisers. It is worth recalling at this juncture, that the objec- tives and principles espoused by the advanced OECD countries on NAMA do not conform to their historical experience (Chang, 2002; Bairoch, 1993) since pro- tectionism was the rule and free trade the exception during their early stages of development and industri- alization. The US was amongst the most protectionist countries, across a wide range of industries even till World War II. Japan, although more selective than the US, followed in its footsteps, while the Republic of Ko- rea followed Japan. The Republic of Korea did not be- gin to significantly liberalize imports till the mid-1980s, which was long after its economic and export success had been firmly established. Against the backdrop of this historical experience, most developing coun- tries today appear to have prematurely compromised much of their policy flexibility in respect of industrial tariffs. This was partly due to the need to fulfil structur- al adjustment loan conditionalities that required them to rapidly and significantly lower their tariffs. Many of them have also entered into bilateral or regional free trade agreements which are ill-conceived in develop- ment terms. These developments have led some analysts and policy makers to question if the policies discussed in the previous few sections are relevant in today\u2019s world. They argue that while competitiveness has always mattered for success, its nature has changed; globalisation of production over the past two decades has resulted in the dramatic growth of international production networks (IPNs). Indeed, the landscape of domestic and global policy-making has been dramati- cally altered by rapid technological change and the spread of information technology. Shrinking space and time along with disappearing borders caused by widespread trade and financial liberalization have also contributed to this. This has been combined with the growing dominance of global supply and distribution value chains in certain industries. Nevertheless, as the analysis in Box 1 below illustrates, participation in IPNs is not a panacea for most developing countries. Even developing countries that have benefited or can ben- efit from participation in them, cannot rely on such participation as their only industrial strategy. National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 18 Box 1: Benefits and Limitations of Participation in International Production Networks The spread of integrated production networks (IPNs) has made it more difficult and risky, in par- ticular for small and medium-sized countries, to adopt the autonomous route to industrialisation taken by Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, province of China. It is now much easier for most (though not all) countries to attract specific portions of a transnational coporation (TNC) activity rather than build local industry to compete with a TNC affiliate. Integrating into an IPN also allows them, with relatively little effort, to enter into the low end of what are often technologically and organizationally complex manufacturing activities and reap export benefits. Indeed, even small countries such as Samoa can now participate and capture some benefits through IPNs. This is par- ticularly true for labour intensive activities which can yield considerable benefits for countries at an early stage of industrialization when they have surplus labour. Under such circumstances, IPNs facilitate increased employment, exports and per capita income. This can result in a net overall gain even if the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "012e9756-8424-4e27-8580-57edd9197c65": {"__data__": {"id_": "012e9756-8424-4e27-8580-57edd9197c65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccbf5a28bc053911c5343e71f2b94cad983edb3f38b2ea1a6a3af0949ab7e84e"}}, "hash": "ccbf5a28bc053911c5343e71f2b94cad983edb3f38b2ea1a6a3af0949ab7e84e", "text": "manufacturing value added generated is low. Furthermore, such participation can en- able countries at very early stages of development to acquire skills and organizational experience. IPNs can also help widen the range of sectors through which industrialization can begin. A number of countries such as Mexico and Thailand have taken this path. They have succeeded in increasing the share of exports in their overall GDP but have been less successful in raising the share of manu- facturing value added in the economy. Despite the benefits, there are clear limits to a strategy of integrating into IPNs. For example, only certain production activities can be carried out through IPNs. Such activities include those that can be readily segregated both technologically and geographically and for which differences in labour costs significantly affect the location decisions of different processes. These aspects are character- istic of only a few low technology industries such as footwear, clothing and toys or medium to high technology industries, such as electronics where horizontal integration through an IPN is possible. This excludes a very large portion of industrial activity which is not driven by global production systems and thus has dim future prospects of becoming part of an IPN. Therefore, most developing countries, in particular LDCs, are unlikely to be able to participate in IPNs and their global produc- tion systems to any significant degree. Some LDCs may not be able to participate at all. In addition, countries are unlikely to be able to benefit from participating in IPNs beyond the la- bour intensive and low technology segments of the production process, unless they have under- gone their own industrial deepening and learning process. This becomes more apparent when a country attempts to move up from labour intensive and low technology industries to medium and high technology industries. Benefits may dwindle further when a country faces barriers to entry in terms of know-how, technology, design, coordination and management. This analysis implies that while current patterns of globalization reduce the scope and raise the cost of some previously successful selective industrial policies, they do not eliminate the need for them. Rapid technological change may have increased the cost of bypassing global production systems in a few areas such as clothing, toys, shoes and electronics. However, IPNs do not signifi- cantly weaken the case for domestic industrial deepening. They, at best, offer an alternative route to a handful of countries, for some activities but only for a limited time period. Sources: Lall 2004; Aky\u00fcz 2005a; UNCTAD 2002b. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 19 Despite some errors in application, selective infant in- dustry protection and the accompanying implications for industrial tariff policy just outlined, appear to have stood the test of time. Even critics of such policies ac- knowledge that government intervention is the best option to deal with market failures. However, they ar- gue that the requirements in terms of capabilities and institutional capacities are beyond the reach of most governments. They also suggest that government fail- ure would be worse than the market failures it seeks to correct (Pack and Saggi, 2006). The Asia-Pacific region has empirically demonstrated that this has not been true (and remains untrue) for a number of countries in the region. The critics may be more correct about the low capacities of LDCs and countries with weak states but this is, at best, a simplistic tautology. The time bound infant economy argument of Greenwald and Stiglitz (2006), if appropriately applied, should be able to address the concerns of critics even under such cir- cumstances. Infant industry protection will empower governments over time to make strategic and more selective interventions, if combined with a policy of significant investment in building government capac- ity. The hands off, market laissez-faire approach advo- cated by critics of infant industry protection, will have even more serious repercussions for development in low capability economies and is akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Tariffs should be broadly and uniformly applied to industrial products in LDCs and other low capability states. No attempt should be made by their govern- ments to pick winners by supporting particular indus- tries at such an incipient stage of development. The main benefit arising from this is that it will avoid the creation of special interest groups, which a state with low capabilities and weak institutions is unlikely to be able to manage effectively. If individual national mar- kets are too small, governments will need to intervene to ensure that their economies can combine with ad- jacent economies at similar stages of development to form a regional free trade", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36e7bb54-1621-4a30-b77e-9d7d3c215879": {"__data__": {"id_": "36e7bb54-1621-4a30-b77e-9d7d3c215879", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "983e26871989c6bacef89aa7a1e0e75d483e75e1cd5c03c4fbab015b01e8631c"}}, "hash": "983e26871989c6bacef89aa7a1e0e75d483e75e1cd5c03c4fbab015b01e8631c", "text": "area in which protection is provided through a common uniform external indus- trial tariff. Such \u2018infant economy\u2019 tariff policies were effectively practiced by the European Economic Com- munity (EEC) in the 1950s. This was during its recovery from the Second World War (Ibid.), even though EEC members at that time were far from being LDCs or countries with low capabilities. Important and useful lessons can be learnt from this successful experience by small and medium-sized developing countries. Beyond Protection and Industrial Tariffs It must be emphasized that infant industry protection and the accompanying industrial tariff policies are but one element of industrial policy, which if implemented in isolation from other policies will eventually prove inadequate, and ineffective. These policies need to be supplemented by selective government interven- tions in four additional areas if they are to be success- ful. These are the correction of coordination failures, correction of information externalities, domestic com- petition policy and export promotion. Each of these areas is dealt with separately below. Interventions that address negative coordination and information externalities are essential to correct mar- ket failures. Neglecting such failures would not only make infant industry protection ineffective but also result in an overall inefficient and sub-optimal out- come. This stems from the fact that information and coordination externalities work as disincentives for productive investment and diversification. What is required is targeted government action focused on specific activities (i.e. new technology or a specific kind of training) rather than on specific industries or sectors since it is these activities that are new to the economy and thus need appropriate support (Rodrik, 2004, page 14). In contrast to the first two, the last two of these four areas can be considered to be government interven- tions which can act as safeguards against the compla- cency which could follow infant industry protection. Both domestic competition policy and export promo- tion, through a combination of domestic checks and balances and export performance targets, seek to ensure that the domestic private sector is both held accountable at home and compelled to compete with the world\u2019s \u2018best\u2019 overseas. Indeed, since the purpose of infant industry protection and industrial tariff policy is to provide insulation against foreign competition in order to build up a domestic industrial infrastructure, governments must simultaneously adopt policies that ensure adequate domestic and foreign competi- tion as a safeguard against complacency, mediocrity, rent seeking and the entrenchment of special interest lobby groups. National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 20 Moreover, since infant industry protection is essential- ly a \u2018carrot,\u2019 it needs to be counteracted by a disciplin- ing \u2018stick\u2019 (other than domestic competition policy). Export competition and performance targets can play such a role most effectively since they compel a coun- try to move towards competing in international mar- kets and face the toughest competition. They have many other potential benefits as well. Government incentives such as export subsidies can aid export promotion. However, these only work well if they are selective and targeted at specific products with sig- nificant export potential. They are a good example of performance-based incentives as opposed to input- based ones. Coordination Failures Coordination problems represent the classic \u2018chicken and egg\u2019 situation insofar as they illustrate how and why a particular desirable investment is contingent on another investment being made. This in turn, depends on whether the first investment is actually made. It is therefore quite possible that neither investment will be made without crucial governmental intervention to smooth out and facilitate coordination. Coordinat- ed investments across sectors in certain areas can lead to successful and self-sustaining market outcomes for each of these sectors, even when no single firm or sector would have been able to make such an invest- ment profitable on its own (Murphy et al., 1989, pages 1004, 1005, 1023-1024). The provision of infrastruc- ture, which is essential for industrialization and which governments are best placed to support, is a good example of an area prone to coordination failure. An important and positive facet of the coordination di- lemma is that it, more often than not, only requires government investment guarantees (rather than sub- sidies or other financial outlays) mainly because such investments most often become profitable, if they are simultaneously made (Rodrik, 2004). The key implica- tion arising from this phenomenon is that addressing coordination failures is not likely to have significant budgetary implications for developing countries. An- ecdotal evidence also suggests that countries which have implemented coordinated investment programs have been able to achieve the industrialization of each sector at a lower cost, compared with those countries that attempted to industrialize in a more", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9a8fe18-9817-42d3-96f1-e914fc65ad8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9a8fe18-9817-42d3-96f1-e914fc65ad8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b28a9f8b9dcee52ea1f04a2d91cd0772b5b961e80243646ba60fa17bb049fb90"}}, "hash": "b28a9f8b9dcee52ea1f04a2d91cd0772b5b961e80243646ba60fa17bb049fb90", "text": "ad-hoc fash- ion (Murphy et al., 1989, page 1025). Such coordination failures tend to be more prevalent in factor markets (new skills, risk finance) (Lall, 2004). Infant industry protection is unlikely to be effective in such markets in the absence of effective coordination. Government interventions in these markets will need to be both selective and general in nature. Such inter- ventions should be aimed at sending the appropriate signals to the supplier of the factor in question (e.g. education or capital). Suppliers may then be able to anticipate the needs of producers or gain the neces- sary information to provide what is required in ap- propriate quantities or form. In the absence of market coordination, suppliers may undersupply goods and services, particularly if they are unaware of whether or not the other factors that need to be combined with what they are supplying will be provided. Some coor- dination failures can be best dealt with by general pur- pose interventions such as technical education which has the potential to simultaneously benefit multiple sectors (e.g. India\u2019s IT and health sectors). Other sec- tors will require selective interventions. Selective in- terventions are necessary because most coordination failures are activity or product specific. They will there- fore need specific responses if they are to be corrected. For example, if a particular activity is to be promoted or a product is to be given infant industry protection, the necessary supplier response will be specific to that activity or product. Information Externalities Information externalities are also an important source of market failure. Although critics have acknowledged this fact, they often argue that governments have im- perfect information, and are thus not in a position to deal with the problem. Nevertheless, from a public goods perspective, it is clearly apparent that market and private sector players have less than perfect or complete information compared with governments. Additionally, governments, by their very nature, have a responsibility, and are decidedly better placed, to deal with the public goods dimensions of information. The ideal role for governments is to provide leadership by eliciting the relevant input from the private sector and other stakeholders on their information needs and putting forth potential solutions. Governments will also need to assume responsibility for obtaining and providing information to the private sector and civil society organizations. This information should focus on national objectives and potential solutions Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 21 to national problems, with governments simultane- ously evaluating outcomes as they emerge. The gov- ernment leadership should also conduct and support public R&D and the \u2018foresight studies\u2019 mentioned ear- lier in addition to sharing their analysis and findings with the private sector and other national stakehold- ers. Such action by governments will be a key factor in effectively tackling the national and global infor- mation needs that result from a strategic approach to national trade and industrial policy. Domestic Competition Policy In essence, domestic competition laws should be de- signed and enforced to limit or restrain anti-competi- tive behaviour by large domestic private corporations. These laws should also, in addition to supporting de- velopment objectives, be used to either pre-empt or limit abuses of monopoly power by large transnational corporations (TNCs). Judging by empirical evidence, it is apparent that effective domestic competition policy can eliminate or at least significantly reduce restrictive business practices by private enterprises. In essence, such practices include those which limit entry into the market or regulate supply through collusion, mergers, or predatory pricing. The reduction of these practices can occur through a combination of anti-monopoly (anti-trust) and state aid regulations such as subsidies. Such policies clearly establish the conditions for com- petition, and ensure healthy competition in markets, which eventually translates into an increase in both economic and social welfare. Domestic competition laws are relatively new in de- veloping countries, primarily because they were not viewed as essential in the period preceding the cur- rent environment of deregulation, privatization, and liberalization. In the past, governments assumed the role of \u2018de facto competition authority\u2019, intervening in the functioning of markets when it was deemed necessary. The absence of an independent domes- tic regulatory competition authority may well have contributed to some of the problems of corruption and excessive rent seeking behavior associated with the lobby group pressure which has been endemic in some cases of infant industry protection. Enacting and effectively implementing domestic competition policy and creating and empowering an independ- ent competition authority will, therefore, be critical. In fact, this will be an essential complement to the equal- ly necessary selective but time bound infant industry protection policies.

Developing countries need to learn the right lessons from the ex- perience of countries that have already achieved in- dustrialization. The US, EU, and Japan have each used different domestic competition policy approaches, modifying these over time, as they deemed necessary. The experience of Japan and other East Asian coun- tries is likely to be the most appropriate for develop- ing countries (UNDP, 2003b). Competition policy in Japan has been evolving since the 1940s. The period most relevant for developing countries is 1950\u201373, when Japan was in the process of becoming an in- dustrialized country. The Japanese government coor- dinated its domestic competition policy in a manner which was consistent with its industrial policy during this period of rapid economic growth. Implemented by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI), industrial policy dominated competition policy, which was en- forced by the Fair Trade Commission. MITI sought high rates of profit and reinvestment for industry, actively coordinated investment by rival firms and intervened in the entry and exit of firms in particular industries. Japan emphasized dynamic forces, combining ele- ments of both cooperation and competition. Cartels were not viewed in a negative light, and MITI effec- tively managed the situation by playing oligopolistic firms against one another. MITI also rewarded those with good export performance or technological inno- vation with subsidies and import protection.7 Perhaps the most important lesson from the Japa- nese experience is that developing countries should ensure that they adopt competition policies that are aligned to their circumstances. Such an approach will require adequate domestic policy space since it is crit- ical that developing countries retain the flexibility to regulate competition in a manner that supports their long-term development strategy. Competition policy in developing countries should be formulated taking into account a number of key issues including the level of development, institutional and technological innovation issues, their labour relation arrangements and institutions as well as their place in the world economy. Given the rapid changes in technology and the heightened mobility of capital today, developing National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 22 countries must also incorporate these dynamic factors in developing their competition policies. For example, in Japan\u2019s case, MITI\u2019s promotion of cooperation and competition among cartels and oligopoly firms may have sacrificed static efficiency. This was done for the sake of maximizing long-term productivity growth (i.e. dynamic efficiency) and has clearly worked in Ja- pan\u2019s favour over the years. Another key lesson from the Japanese experience is that selectivity across sec- tors and firms is important. On a broader level, domestic competition policy can help mitigate the risks of inward foreign direct invest- ment, especially in today\u2019s borderless world. Current patterns of globalisation have changed the nature of competition in important ways. The strategic com- petitive advantages of large, established corporations whose size and control of technology gives them a significant edge over smaller and newer entrants from developing countries have significantly increased (Shafaeddin, 2006b, page 8). In this context, a specific threat to competition in developing countries is the rise in the number of cross-border mergers, which can increase the market power of transnational corpora- tions, creating more barriers and less market compe- tition. This is more detrimental for late industrialisers, whose firms are still engaged in the process of build- ing the required capacity to compete in international markets. In such circumstances, there is a need for an appropriate and effective domestic competition poli- cy that works to limit the extent of \u2018national treatment\u2019 that foreign corporations receive in what is an increas- ingly asymmetrical global and national playing field. Domestic competition policy that does not actively address international competition is likely to result in foreign firms crowding out domestic investment and the indigenous private sector, both of which are critical components of an effective national trade and industrial strategy. Growing foreign competition may not only stifle domestic competition and limit growth in domestic productivity, thereby diminishing pros- pects for domestic industrialization, but also contrib- ute to increased domestic prices. Even the most effective domestic competition policy on its own will not be able to achieve this. Current patterns of globalization imply that in order to be ef- fective, domestic competition policy should ideally be complemented by an international agreement on competition policy. Developing countries should co- ordinate competition policy as much as possible with other countries. Member countries of the European Union have done this, and those of Mercosur and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) have also begun sharing information and even harmonizing policy. The APEC agreement is based on a number of core principles", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d6b845d-0ae1-4d03-95e4-5970bcf4662a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d6b845d-0ae1-4d03-95e4-5970bcf4662a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44ec916240dac1b4ee4eb8d5ef8179087a801b34983363e17d5d586242fa3d8b"}}, "hash": "44ec916240dac1b4ee4eb8d5ef8179087a801b34983363e17d5d586242fa3d8b", "text": "such as comprehensiveness, transpar- ency and accountability \u2013 some of these can be a good starting point for any coordination agreement. There is an important reason why such cooperation should be independent of and outside the existing multilateral trade rules. International competition policy should ideally focus on regulatory and social objectives and cover a much broader range of issues than those related to international trade. Its objectives should also be quite different from those of WTO ef- forts to promote free trade through market access. An international competition policy agreement under the current multilateral trade regime is, therefore, unlikely to provide developing countries with the complement to domestic competition policy that they need from an international agreement (UNDP, 2003b, page 294). Exports, Technological Development and Employment This paper has so far made the case for domestic in- dustrialization through selective infant industry pro- tection and other well-conceived selective govern- ment interventions. These include the enactment of domestic competition policy legislation and the crea- tion of an independent body to implement it effec- tively. While such policies are critical pillars of a strate- gic national trade and industrial policy, the promotion of high value-added manufacturing and services ex- ports (themselves, most often, an important product of successful domestic industrial policy) is an impor- tant, additional pillar. The problem in many developing countries, however, has been that exports have been made the principal driver of their national development strategy, rather than one element of an overall national investment policy. If its proponents were right, the export-driven paradigm and the massive increase in global trade over the last quarter century that has accompanied it8 should have resulted in accelerated growth in the world Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 23 economy and a drastic reduction in poverty. Instead, the debt and numerous financial crises experienced in the 1990s, combined with the general deterioration in economic performance in Latin American and African countries that closely followed this prescription, has opened the export-led model to criticism. A funda- mental problem with the model has clearly been its failure to deliver the expected economic growth and employment that would place countries on a path of sustainable, broad-based human development.9 Addi- tionally, the emphasis on maximizing export growth, rather than on increasing its value added component, has undermined the potential contribution of exports to higher levels of employment, domestic production, poverty reduction and human development. Exports have the potential to play many valuable roles in an economy. However, similar to economic growth, greater openness to exports must not be viewed as an end in itself, but rather as a means to poverty re- duction and human development. This will require a strategic approach to the overall design of a country\u2019s engagement in export activities. In support of exports, a valid critique of the post World War II decades when import-substituting industrializa- tion was dominant, was that many countries which fol- lowed such a policy neglected exports. It is significant to note however, that this was not true of Northeast Asia\u2019s success stories in the post World War II period, nor has this been true of China more recently. Govern- ments in the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, province of China established a successful linkage between incentives for domestic industrialization, on the one hand, and the disciplining stick of clear export targets and strategic global engagement, on the other. This distinguished these countries from other import-sub- stituting economies which had prioritized production for the domestic market almost to the exclusion of out- ward looking policies, thereby providing the former with a sound base for building international competi- tiveness. It also helped them adopt global best prac- tices, which have been crucial for their sustained and long-term success. These countries, unlike those that prioritized only domestic industrialization policies in the first three post World War II decades, have been able to transcend the dichotomy between domestic and export markets. Successful industrialization can- not occur without strategically engaging global mar- kets. The need to do this is even more pronounced in today\u2019s context of accelerating technological break- throughs and integrated production networks than it was in the second half of the 20th century. The potential benefits of an export strategy extend well beyond the traditional need to generate foreign exchange earnings to pay for crucial imports and to bridge the balance of payments deficit. Exports can also accelerate learning-by-doing and productiv- ity growth. Large scale production and specialization also makes it easier for firms to overcome high entry costs.

These can yield unrivalled benefits in the form of ac- celerated technological development. Such advances can be derived from exposure to foreign competition, marketing, and, in particular, technological diffusion, which would not be possible in a closed domestic market. Additionally, a significantly export oriented economy is likely to attract greater inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). The overall benefits of exports to the economy will exceed its monetary value pro- vided FDI is selectively attracted and effectively gov- erned. The FDI attracted should also facilitate new and more advanced technologies that will have a positive impact on other domestic economic sectors. Greater international demand will also stimulate in- creased capacity utilization if growing export require- ments lead to the employment of previously idle or surplus land and labour resources. The establishment of export-oriented, low-skill industries, such as textiles and clothing, for instance, possess tremendous po- tential for job creation. This can benefit thousands of previously disadvantaged workers and unemployed people, especially women. For example, despite its limitations, Bangladesh\u2019s ready-made garment export industry is widely credited with the transformation of the national economy along with women\u2019s socio- economic rights and opportunities over the last two decades. When export activities create employment opportunities, they can contribute to the reduction of inequalities within and among groups as well as encourage an increase in their productivity. The ad- ditional household incomes that are generated can then be used to improve living conditions and em- power women workers by giving them a level of eco- National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 24 nomic and social independence. This, in cases like Bangladesh, has been unprecedented. However, this employment may not be sustainable in the long-run unless the increased national revenues from such ex- ports are used for productive value-added investment. This scenario could still unfold in Bangladesh\u2019s ready- made garment export sector, in the post-Multi Fibre Arrangement period after 2008, when the restraints on Chinese textiles and clothing exports agreed as part of China\u2019s protocol of accession to the WTO are removed. The employment and equity aspects of export expan- sion will also be determined to a great extent by the balance between labour and capital intensive exports and its implications for employment generation. A greater emphasis on capital intensive production techniques in developing countries can translate into wage and income inequality and lower levels of em- ployment. Indeed, available data indicates that many countries and regions, including East Asia, which ex- perienced high growth in the last decade, have not been able to achieve a commensurate increase in employment generation. The phenomenon of \u2018job- less growth\u2019 is thus a real consequence of the grow- ing trend in favour of capital intensity, including in the more advanced developing countries. In the Republic of Korea, among the first-tier Asian tigers, \u2018hollow- ing out\u2019 is occurring in the manufacturing sector, as labour-intensive industries face stiff competition from China. As a result, several companies are opting to re- locate to China, in order to take advantage of lower labour costs and higher labour productivity. Public-Private Partnerships The presence and growth of a domestic private sector is essential for strategic national trade and industrial policy to succeed. In fact, one of the key objectives of strategic, selective government interventions should be to encourage domestic private initiatives, which over a reasonable time period, will result in the crea- tion of a mature domestic private sector. Such an out- come is crucial if a country wishes to achieve the twin goals of sustainable domestic industrialization and ex- port competitiveness. Indeed, most instances of suc- cessful industrial policy have been characterized by a combination of concerted government action along with strategic and flexible collaboration between the national public and private sectors. Both parties in such strategic public-private partner- ships must join hands to learn and understand each side\u2019s potentials and constraints so that they can for- mulate a joint course of action to best serve a broader national interest. Governments must lead this part- nership, and guard against becoming hostage to nar- row private sector interests. In order to fully exploit the partnership\u2019s potential, they will also need to find the correct balance between achieving full autonomy from the private sector (which may not be desirable as this will most likely leave governments isolated from and unresponsive to strategic national trade and in- dustrial policy needs) and being fully responsive to the private sector\u2019s every request or whim with all the accompanying implications and dangers that this entails for policy making.

Ac- tivities with potential spillover effects in the economy should also be subsidized. Critics of government intervention are of the view that the government will inevitably make major errors in choosing its strategic private sector partners. This argument may in certain instances be justified since in reality such mistakes are bound to occur. Neverthe- less, it is important to emphasize that it is far better for a government to make some mistakes, especially if it can identify and correct these early on and eventu- ally produce an industrial policy, than for it not to have any industrial policy at all because it never attempted to embark on one. National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 26 Agriculture and Food and Livelihood Security Agriculture plays a central role in most developing economies, primarily because of its contribution to food and rural livelihood security. Although there are significant variations in agriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP within the Asia-Pacific region,10 a common factor is the gradual decline in value addition of the agricul- tural sector to the economy. Nevertheless, the agri- cultural sector still accounts for a significant share of employment in developing countries, including in the least developed countries of the region. Poverty and food insecurity within the region remain a pervasive problem, despite economic growth accompanied by an increased engagement in international trade.11 However, only a handful of countries in the Asia-Pa- cific region rely on agricultural trade for a significant portion of their export revenues. China is the world\u2019s ninth biggest exporter of agricultural products and countries such as Thailand (rice and poultry) and Vi- etnam (rice) are generally regarded as natural agri- cultural exporters. Still, the fact remains that none of the successful economies in the region have achieved high levels of economic and human development by primarily relying on their comparative advantage in agricultural exports. Even natural agricultural export- ers, such as Thailand and Vietnam, who seek greater liberalization of agricultural trade in certain products such as rice, in order to secure greater access to export markets are equally focused on industrial diversifica- tion. Indeed, the general route adopted by all success- ful countries in the region has been through diversi- fication into productive industrial and service sectors which have potential for significant value addition. This has been equally true for Thailand and is increas- ingly the case for Vietnam. As a result, it is reasonable to argue that agriculture is unlikely to emerge as the major pillar of comparative advantage or export strat- egy for the Asia-Pacific region, unlike for significant parts of Latin America. On the contrary, the primary concern of most Asian countries with regard to agricultural trade at present, and for the foreseeable future, is likely to be enhanced domestic food security and rural livelihoods. This is a more pressing concern than increased market access to OECD and other developing countries. In this context, the current food crisis has only served to heighten food security concerns in the region. It has highlighted the vulnerability of an over-reliance on international markets in guaranteeing supplies of basic food products, particularly for large populous countries, in periods of tight supplies and high food prices. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region have taken a number of measures in an attempt to address the crisis situation created by soaring food prices. Some of these measures include expanding safety nets for the poor and reducing consumer taxes on staples; taking steps to build buffer stocks of rice, and introducing ex- port restrictions to dampen the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f71d9ebb-252a-485a-b8a6-666c71b9f053": {"__data__": {"id_": "f71d9ebb-252a-485a-b8a6-666c71b9f053", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afa13edaaabf4bccf73f160db6cd7f5f2eb1ede7e9570f17c6a9459463abb507"}}, "hash": "afa13edaaabf4bccf73f160db6cd7f5f2eb1ede7e9570f17c6a9459463abb507", "text": "impact of the increase in prices in local markets as well as to guarantee ad- equate domestic supplies and restrict commodities trade in future markets. Further, many of the countries in the Asia Pacific region are Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries (LIFDC). As such, they have been particu- larly hard hit by the increase in food prices and face significantly higher food (and energy) import bills. Such countries currently require urgent support from the international community including in the form of budget support. There is overall agreement that, although the price of agricultural commodities will likely go down as a re- sult of the expected supply response to high prices, prices will stabilise at higher overall levels than in the past. Thus, in addition to short-term measures taken by governments and the international community to address the immediate crisis situation, it will also be necessary to address the food security and livelihood needs of many countries in the region in a sustainable manner. This necessitates an understanding of the main causes of the food crisis. The causes of the current high food prices are multiple and diverse. Some reflect structural factors whose ef- fects have accumulated over the years, and others are Sectoral Policies 4 Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 27 of a more immediate nature, contributing as triggers to the crisis. The latter category includes factors such as poor harvests due to unfavourable weather condi- tions and financial factors related to speculation and the weakening of the US dollar. The structural factors leading to the crisis include both the neglect of the agricultural sector in many devel- oping countries over the years and the current asym- metries that exist in agricultural trade at the interna- tional level.12 The strong emphasis on increasing earnings from the exports of cash crops has also led to the relative ne- glect of considerations such as food security and rural development resulting in reduced support for agricul- tural food security, in terms both of national budget- ary allocations and international development assist- ance. As a result, the agricultural production capacity of most developing countries has suffered and many food exporters in the 1970s like the Philippines had become import dependent by the 1990s. This is also partly a result of the fact that many devel- oping countries liberalized their agricultural markets more deeply than most developed countries, either unilaterally or as a result of structural adjustment loan conditionalities. The availability of cheap imports has undermined national both food security and liveli- hoods of small-scale farmers. Under these circum- stances, it is critical for governments and other policy makers to ensure that further import liberalization of staple and other essential food products takes a back seat when domestic livelihoods and food security are at stake. Given the importance of rural livelihoods in the re- gion and the difficulties marginalized farmers face in accessing local and international markets, the policy space afforded by tariffs should be retained by devel- oping countries in order to secure the interests of their small farmers. They should also be provided access to domestic and regional markets. In the WTO context, such policy space should be assured through an agree- ment on a category of \u2018special products\u2019 (identified by developing countries themselves) as well as a special safeguard mechanism incorporating both price and volume triggers, that would be made available solely to developing countries. These mechanisms will allow developing countries to undertake reform in the agri- culture sector taking into account the needs of poor urban and rural households. It will also allow them to respond to volatility in agricultural commodity prices, which is expected to increase in the future for a vari- ety of reasons, including the inextricable relationship between agricultural and energy markets resulting from the biofuel connection, as well as the effects of climate change. Governments will also need to play an important and much greater public investment role in agriculture than has been the case in recent years. Access to land for small producers is a critical aspect of agricultural policy as is investment in both small-scale commu- nity infrastructure projects and processing and stor- age facilities. Governments should also assist farmers by providing them with a minimum support price to encourage production. They should also extend sup- port to and actively promote state trading enterprises which, if properly managed, can play an effective sta- bilizing and redistributive role in the agricultural sec- tor by learning from both the successes and problems of previous experiences in this respect.

How- ever, their admittedly difficult situation as a result of increased food prices should not be used as an excuse to delay the change in the rules for world trade in ag- riculture that were agreed at the WTO\u2019s Hong Kong (SAR), China Ministerial meeting in December 2005. Notwithstanding the fact that agricultural export ex- pansion is of secondary importance for the region, some processed agricultural products can be interna- tionally competitive for Asia, both at the boutique and National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 28 large scale level and also have positive human devel- opment impacts. Such production for export should be promoted as part of a pro-poor, agro-industrial ex- port-oriented strategy and as a complement to devel- opmentally-oriented domestic agricultural policies. At the international level, action to eliminate agricultural tariff peaks and escalation as well as address non-tariff barriers to agricultural exports from developing coun- tries should remain a high priority in the Doha Round of trade negotiations. Services Trade Strategic national trade and industrial policy encom- passes trade in manufactured goods as well as in serv- ices. Although much of what applies to manufactured goods is relevant to trade in services as well, there are some distinguishing characteristics that are worth highlighting. It is also important to note that despite complex non-tariff barriers, global trade in services has grown more rapidly than trade in manufactured goods since the 1980s and has now emerged as the fastest growing sector. It accounts for the predominant share of GDP and exports, not only in many OECD countries but also in some Asian countries such as India. Emerging Services Sectors: The Case of Outsourcing The Republic of Korea and Taiwan, province of China, have successfully increased domestic value addition and made advances in poverty reduction and human development. Their success was primarily due to the pursuit of a process of diversification away from both agriculture and the low-end value textiles and cloth- ing sector into higher value added manufactured goods as well as some areas of services trade. Technological advances and the deregulation of the telecommunications sector globally have facilitated exceptionally rapid growth in developing countries in the cross border supply of business processes through IT-enabled services. India has taken the lead as an off- shore destination across the spectrum of services. Other Asian countries such as China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia are also emerging as promising entrants. However given the prerequisites of such outsourcing, it is primarily mid- dle income developing countries or low income coun- tries with large pools of skilled labour such as India and China, which have developed a comparative ad- vantage. Although regional competition in this area is poised to increase further, outsourcing is likely to remain largely limited to these countries rather than spread to LDCs. From a human development perspective, the rapid growth of global services outsourcing in Asia has so far yielded limited benefits. One positive outcome of global outsourcing has been improved accumula- tion of human capital. This has been made possible by joint-ventures or other technical arrangements between service providers and client companies that facilitate the acquisition and transfer of knowledge and skills. The potential exists for the development of indigenous capabilities resulting from exposure to ad- vanced technology and research and the subsequent diffusion of productivity-enhancing technologies to other sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing. However, these benefits so far appear to have been largely restricted to the IT and outsourcing sectors. This is primarily due to limited backward linkages and multiplier effects, especially in the rural economy. The outsourcing industry has made a substantial con- tribution to the GDP of countries involved in this busi- ness. However, it has failed to create - and is unlikely in the foreseeable future to generate - broad-based employment of the magnitude that is urgently re- quired in most Asian economies. This is especially true for countries which have a large pool of low skilled labour.

Despite some negative social impacts, the industry continues to be able to attract skilled workers. This is primarily because the industry offers more organized working conditions and higher wages and benefits than other comparable employ- ment sectors. Since outsourcing, by its very nature, tends to be located in urban areas, which have supe- rior infrastructural facilities, the industry nevertheless also tends to widen the gap between urban areas and poor, neglected rural areas. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 29 Hence it is crucial that governments play a strategic and forward looking role by adopting a balanced mix of fiscal, trade and investment policies with regard to outsourcing. Governments must exercise caution in prioritizing outsourcing at the expense of other sec- tors of the economy where investments could yield higher and more sustainable economic returns and employment in the long-run. This does not imply an \u2018either/ or\u2019 choice. It is essential to invest in a human resource base that caters to the needs of the grow- ing outsourcing industry across the Asia-Pacific. It is equally important, however, that the priority placed on the higher-end, value-added science and technol- ogy education, training and research in countries such as India is not compromised for relatively short-term computer application courses in the process. From a fiscal policy point of view, appropriate tax breaks and other incentives may serve the purpose of attracting clients and encouraging business growth in the out- sourcing industry. However, it is just as important to ensure that the industry\u2019s profits also benefit other more needy sectors, both in the short and long-run. Short-Term Movement of Workers Individual remittances of workers and the diaspora have assumed an increasingly important role in the economy of several Asian countries. It is important to recognize that the value of these inward remittances in terms of financing and contributing to national de- velopment strategies remains greatly underutilized in the absence of an overarching national policy frame- work which ensures their integration in national de- velopment strategies. One of the reasons is limited access to financial services for both remittance send- ers and their families back home. Some alternatives have started to emerge, particularly in the US, link- ing commercial banks with microfinance institutions in Latin America, and increasing access to financial instruments that allow for savings and favour local investments. Access to these services will allow the leveraging of remittances to enable the expansion of livelihood alternatives in the countries of origin of migrants. Co-operation between the country of origin and destination will also be important in facilitating the establishment of a conducive environment for co-operation among financial institutions across bor- ders. At another level, the movement of people is limited by an array of regulations in both \u2018sending\u2019 and \u2018receiv- ing\u2019 countries. This limits the possibility of expanding the flow of remittances to developing countries in a more orderly manner. This remains the case despite the agreement reached at the WTO by the adoption of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), including the component related to the movement of natural persons (Mode 4). Many developing countries have advocated for en- hanced market access for their service suppliers in the ongoing Doha round negotiations, particularly those in semi-skilled and low skill categories. LDCs such as Bangladesh have put forward a request for the liber- alization of services under Mode 4, focusing on such suppliers. Additionally, LDCs submitted a proposal which would provide them with special priority for market access and allow preferential access for LDCs across all modes of services, including Mode 4. Such an agreement can help in correcting the glaring asymmetry between the mobility of capital and labour in the current globalization process. It could also, if ap- propriately designed and integrated into national de- velopment strategies, result in a significant improve- ment in human development outcomes in developing countries. Regrettably, Mode 4 discussions at the mul- tilateral level are moving at a glacial pace. They have focused primarily on skilled, not semi-skilled workers, and have been further complicated by security con- cerns in the post-September 11, 2001 period. It is important to clarify that the temporary short-term movement of workers does not imply that host gov- ernments are expected to open up to permanent mi- gration from developing countries. It does, however, imply the implementation of a \u201cGATS visa\u201d for tempo- rary workers, with guarantees from source country governments that these workers will return to their country of origin within a specified period.

These agreements provide for close coop- eration between the country of origin and destina- tion throughout the process: from the recruitment National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 30 of potential guest workers in the country of origin to their insertion in the country of destination and re- turn. The experience with these agreements is, that if properly drafted and implemented, they can enhance the developmental impact of migration by addressing problems related to brain drain since they guarantee the return of migrants over a specified period of time. They can also enable the protection of migrants in the country of destination and support the diversi- fication of livelihoods for migrants and their families in the country of origin. Nevertheless, such bilateral agreements are costly to negotiate and implement for an individual developing country, and the option to enter into such negotiations may not be open to all such countries. In this sense, progress on Mode 4 at the multilateral level continues to be the preferred option for the large majority of developing countries. Lessons learnt from the experience of countries which have concluded bilateral agreements on the move- ment of workers could, however, feed into the GATS negotiations and enhance the developmental impact of the liberalization of services in the Doha Round.13 The recognition of qualifications is also important for the effective access of Mode 4 service suppliers. This is a particularly important consideration for the cate- gory of service suppliers of most interest to LDCs and other poor countries \u2013 low and semi-skilled workers. Qualification requirements which prioritize profes- sional degrees and formal studies only disadvantage workers in certain sectors considered low skilled in de- veloping countries, even though many of these work- ers are qualified and have significant and practical experience and expertise. In this context, flexibility in the recognition of qualifications, keeping in mind the particular circumstances of developing countries and/ or the adoption of mechanisms that will facilitate the acquisition by workers of the necessary \u2018formal\u2019 quali- fications will be very important. In fact, a multilateral agreement on a \u201crecognition system\u201d for the qualifica- tions of both semi-skilled and skilled workers (many of whom also suffer from barriers to the recognition of their qualification but to a lesser degree) will be ben- eficial. Measures to facilitate the movement of natural per- sons, especially in categories of special interest to LDCs have the greatest developmental potential rela- tive to other areas under current negotiations in the Doha Round. According to one estimate, increasing temporary workers\u2019 permits in industrial countries by 3 per cent of their current skilled and unskilled work- forces has the potential of generating gains of $156 billion for the developing world (Winters, 2003), espe- cially for the Asia-Pacific region. This is equivalent to more than double the combined projected gains from the agricultural and industry sectors. Although these are computable general equilibrium (CGE) model es- timates, and should be treated cautiously, they nev- ertheless are an indication of magnitude of projected gains that are possible from a genuine Doha Devel- opment Round which prioritizes Mode 4. Apart from the financial aspect (in terms of increased incomes) what is of equal if not greater importance are the non- quantifiable gains. Such gains could include learn- ing, knowledge acquisition and organizational skills which are hard to quantify accurately, but as already discussed, are vital for domestic industrialization and growth. Basic Social Services Efficient and equitable access to infrastructure and so- cial services is critical for a country\u2019s competitiveness, the well-being of its people, and enhanced human development outcomes. The GATS, therefore, has im- portant potential policy implications for the provision of public services, particularly in those sectors where commercial gains should be secondary to the human development objective of ensuring basic well-being through decent health, education, energy and water and sanitation supplies (UNDP, 2005a, page 66). The provision of these services also has a significant im- pact on vital concerns such as equity, human rights, social justice and state responsibility (UNDP, 2003b). GATS implementation will also need to be policy consistent with MDG achievement since a number of MDGs themselves relate to the provision of basic social services (eg. health, water, education. Develop- ing country governments cannot afford to leave basic social services entirely or even partly to private - in- cluding foreign - competition, for all of these reasons. A dose of policy caution and strategic protectionism is thus justified when liberalizing trade in those service sectors that are directly important for human devel- opment advances.

Opening basic services to foreign competition and subjecting them to GATS\u2019s progressive liberalization framework, \u2018request-offer\u2019 modality and plurilateral bargaining option carry the risks that accompany premature deregulation, especially where regulatory capacity is weak, which is the case in almost all developing coun- tries. For example, rapid privatization and commer- cialization of health services without regard to equity and accessibility, combined with pressures to reduce public spending in health, can be especially harmful for human development.14 Privatization of water sup- ply is another area of concern in developing countries, because it can restrict poor people\u2019s access to water services. In fact, the commercialization of water sup- ply has generally produced mixed results at best. In the energy sector, GATS negotiations are aimed at exploration, production, and transportation of energy. While there clearly are human development benefits to broader energy access, liberalization also implies that governments will no longer be able to apply di- rect measures in the energy sector in support of hu- man development goals, but will have to pursue these goals through new regulatory structures and actions in the context of private enterprises (Ibid., page 78). Energy liberalization, if undertaken, should be accom- panied by compensatory measures and conditions for foreign investors (e.g. requirements for technology transfer, social obligations, and prohibitions on anti- competitive practices) so that, if undertaken, they can beneficially contribute to human development. National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 32 T he exchange rate and interest rate are two of the most important macroeconomic indicators in an economy. They are relevant both from the viewpoint of \u2018internal equilibrium\u2019 or moving towards the full employment of domestic resources including labour, which has obvious and important human develop- ment implications, and \u2018external equilibrium\u2019 or a sus- tainable balance on the current account of the bal- ance of payments. The standard definition of a \u2018competitive\u2019 exchange rate is one that makes imports more expensive and exports more competitive. Thus, one route to increas- ing the utilization of domestic resources and raising the rate of growth is adjusting the exchange rate to either reduce the current account deficit or create a current account surplus in the balance of payments. The former ensures that demand-inducing domes- tic expenditures, especially counter cyclical govern- ment expenditures, will not be made ineffective due to increased net imports. The latter is part of a strat- egy of making international demand the stimulus for growth. Similarly, interest rates can be used as an instrument for stimulating broad-based growth. A low average in- terest rate can trigger investment and growth if invest- ment is responsive to the cost of capital. Differential interest rates can be used to favour certain sectors or sections of society for growth or distribution reasons. The use of these instruments in developing countries has not been viewed favourably. The first criticism is that protectionism in many of these countries result- ed in \u2018overvalued\u2019 exchange rates that made imports - in particular those of capital goods - cheap, encour- aging capital intensive investments that reduce em- ployment growth. The second criticism is that this is further accentuated by policies of \u2018financial repression\u2019 that ensure low or negative real interest rates, with the aim of stimulating aggregate investment. The principal theme of these criticisms is that the movement towards achieving an equilibrium ex- change rate and interest rate is often thwarted by gov- ernment policy intervention. However, even if such an equilibrium exists in a world where countries are inte- grated through trade, the growing importance of pri- vate capital flows to developing countries makes the identification and realization of such equilibrium rates difficult. This is because movements in exchange and interest rates have a distinct and separate impact on the capital and current account. Also, relatively auton- omous capital flows influence exchange and interest rates, making management of these instruments ex- tremely difficult in an increasingly globally integrated world. On the other hand, it is extremely difficult for developing countries to successfully and strategically integrate themselves into the world economy without a competitive and stable exchange rate. A managed exchange rate that factors in current and capital ac- count developments and is geared towards ensuring reasonable stability and predictability may be the best option for most developing countries in these circum- stances.

It is based on purchasing power parity and equals the product of the nominal exchange rate and the ratio of the foreign to domestic price level. Given this rela- tionship, it is apparent that trade policies cannot be assessed independently of the exchange rate regime. Exchange rate volatility is not conducive for sustained growth in the traded goods sector. The theory in this regard is confirmed by the experience of successful Asian countries, whose \u2018miracle\u2019 growth was character- ized by sustained monetary stability over a relatively long period. The successful trade performance of the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, province of China, was facilitated to a large extent by relatively stable ex- change rates which played an important role in their successful and strategic integration into the global economy. This is further substantiated by the more re- cent experience of both China and India, which have acquired high levels of competitiveness in the world Macroeconomic Policy and Trade 5 Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 33 market at least partly by maintaining relatively stable real exchange rates over long periods. Indeed, it is relatively stable and competitive real exchange rates, complemented by the other policies and strategies discussed in this paper, that have contributed to sus- tained high growth, without high inflation, in all these economies (UNCTAD, 2005). The macroeconomic regime, in a broad sense, has thus been and remains an important factor behind much of Asia\u2019s relatively good performance compared to Latin America and other parts of the world. Historical evi- dence suggests that exchange rate devaluation was a common route to seeking greater trade competitive- ness in other parts of the world. However none of the countries that primarily or significantly relied on this method achieved sustained improvements in their ex- port and value-added performance to the extent that China, India or even Vietnam have, along with other economies in East Asia (UNCTAD, 2003). China\u2019s case is summarized below because of its glo- bal importance and the enormous media attention its exchange rate policies continue to receive. The balance of payments position of many develop- ing countries has been transformed by macroeco- nomic adjustments made in an attempt to deal with the effects of financial crises and respond to volatile capital flows. The period since the mid-1990s has seen a transformation of current account deficits into sur- pluses for developing countries as a group. While this was initially true only for a set of Asian countries, they have since been joined by countries in West Asia, the Commonwealth of Independent States (included by the IMF in the developing countries and emerging markets group) and Latin America, though not Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. Three questions arise in this context. 1. What are the key factors responsible for the cur- rent account surpluses in developing countries? 2. What quantity of their overall balance of pay- ments surpluses are due to developments in the current account? 3. How are these surpluses utilized? There are three factors that explain developing coun- try current account surpluses. First, there is the Chi- nese case, where the current account surplus has arisen because the country\u2019s competitive position in the international market for goods has yielded a trade balance which more than covers the deficit in services and in income. Second, there are countries like India, which has ensured a current account surplus because its trade deficit has not been significantly increased by its services deficit because of large service income in- flows. Moreover, its aggregate deficit in trade in goods and services is more than covered by a surplus in the current transfers account because of large remittanc- es from migrant workers residing abroad. Finally, there are countries like Bangladesh, which while recording significant deficits in their trade in goods and serv- ices, have been able to make this up through worker remittances which ensure an overall surplus in the current account. This analysis demonstrates that it is not a surplus in merchandise trade but surpluses from the sale of services through physical migration and/or digital migration (India) that have delivered a current account surplus in the majority of Asian developing countries. Current account surpluses are also partly attributable to a deflationary fiscal stance adopted by the gov- ernments of developing countries. Since deflation curtails growth, it is possible to maintain imports at levels that deliver trade surpluses even with a higher import-to-GDP ratio resulting from trade liberalisa- tion. Furthermore, the desire to increase inflows of foreign capital has compelled many governments to adopt a deflationary stance in order to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cf90402-d011-4df3-9759-83eaf8dcbad8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cf90402-d011-4df3-9759-83eaf8dcbad8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "560bc2879f442789d058eeef1c51ed8ed7a2c1f7f1e2e162db526eb975306463"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3c4fa98-3492-4131-bb8e-bbdb57ba0919", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a290eb8ba754bc6d6f4443fada7d68ad4f0c3156dbd295d0cbaab78d11cf687"}}, "hash": "0404d4c460dff498de26baead849624682da02c7be208f18d83768f408428c0a", "text": "anchor the confidence of financial investors. These groups of in- vestors do not favour state deficit-financed spending for a number of reasons. First of all, deficit financing by increasing overall liquidity in the money market, is viewed as being potentially inflationary. Inflation is anathema to investors, primarily because it erodes the real value of financial assets. Second, since gov- ernment spending is \u2018autonomous\u2019 in character, the use of debt to finance such autonomous spending is similar to introducing an arbitrary player (not driven by the profit motive) into financial markets. This is likely to give rise to interest rate differentials which in turn make the determination of financial profits more unpredictable.

Its exchange rate policies in both periods have proven consistent with healthy export growth but have had differential impacts on poverty reduction and the rural-urban divide. An over-valued exchange rate is often viewed as penalizing farmers while devaluation is expected to mitigate urban bias. This has not been true in China\u2019s case since labour-intensive manufactures comprise a significant share of its exports. Moreover, trade patterns and exposure to international trade vary enormously between different regions of the country, as is well known. As a result, the sharp, real depreciation of the Renminbi between the mid-1980s and 1993 corresponded to a sig- nificant increase in the urban-rural income gap. This bias can be largely attributed to the foreign ex- change retention and swap systems which favoured industrial goods. The currency\u2019s depreciation, therefore, did not benefit the poor, a large proportion of whom are located in interior rural areas. Contrary to conventional wisdom, China\u2019s experience suggests, therefore, that devaluation will not benefit rural activities or reduce urban bias in a context of significant intra-regional inequality in both productive assets and trade patterns. It also suggests that, despite some problems, China\u2019s policy of maintaining a stable nominal and real exchange rate since the mid-1990s was an appro- priate policy choice. The dollar peg has also helped overall macroeconomic stability, in addition to leading to a gradual but effective depreciation in the value of the Renminbi as a result of the weakening of the US dollar. The dollar peg has, therefore, helped ensure that China\u2019s adjustment to a more liberal trade regime is gradual, whilst enabling it to avoid a sharp deterioration in its trade balance during this process. Should China Float its Exchange Rate? China should approach a flexible exchange rate regime with caution for a number of reasons. First, a significant appreciation of the exchange rate will hurt its export competitiveness. Second, it will undermine China\u2019s current external financial strength which permits it to borrow abroad and ad- dress its continuing domestic financial fragility. Third, lower import prices will end up hurting Chi- na\u2019s import-competing agricultural and industrial producers and industries, leading to losses in farmer incomes and undermining their livelihoods, and have negative employment consequences in China\u2019s current trade liberalization context. China, therefore, has only two policy options for its future exchange rate regime; to adhere to the current fixed peg with the U.S. dollar or to shift towards a \u2018soft peg\u2019. The \u2018soft peg\u2019 option implies a moderate widening of the currency\u2019s trading band, while allowing for central bank intervention when the exchange rate reaches band limits. The Chinese government appears to have adopted this option. A more radical shift towards a \u2018free float\u2019 regime is clearly inadvisable given China\u2019s cur- rent situation, not least because of its still relatively underdeveloped domestic financial markets and weak banking sector. While the dollar peg may be a potential source of price instability for some products, this can be addressed by pegging the Renminbi to a multi-currency basket (the US dollar, Yen and Euro).

In accounting terms, a current account surplus, in ef- fect, implies that savings in these countries exceed investment. The continuing surpluses also imply that, despite the low level of per capita income in these countries, the potential opportunities represented by current account surpluses are not being channelled towards productive investments - investments that would raise the growth rates of both aggregate and per capita incomes. Since a number of countries with current account surpluses are also net recipients of substantial magnitudes of inflows in the capital ac- count (e.g. India), total savings (domestic and foreign) now exceed investment by an even larger margin for a number of Asian developing countries. The accumulation of foreign exchange reserves result- ing from the factors cited above are now increasingly being used as a basis to argue that the exchange rate in many developing countries is \u2018undervalued\u2019. In the Asian context, this argument is particularly directed at China whose productivity, growth and strength, it is argued, derive from its maintenance of a stable, but undervalued currency. While China has not indulged in ad-hoc devaluations which can lead to volatility and instability, it does appear to have relied on sys- tematic undervaluation, whilst maintaining currency stability. This also appears to have been an important strategy, at least in the initial stages of export devel- opment and diversification of Japan in the immediate post World War II period, and more recently, in other East Asian economies. This may have served them well with China being the most recent beneficiary of such a policy in recent years. However, it is possible to argue that such an exchange rate policy can have a negative impact on the export competitiveness of the least de- veloped and other developing countries in the region, especially in an area such as textiles and clothing trade in the post-Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) period. Nevertheless, a closer examination of the debate on exchange rate regimes and exchange rate levels in developing countries reveals that the perception of undervalued exchange rates in China and other de- veloping countries represents a dramatic reversal of the argument that has dominated the development dialogue in the past three decades. It is indeed ironic that many of the same countries were being accused of pursuing inward looking policies and of being too interventionist in their trade, exchange rate and financial sector policies, until quite recently. As a re- sult, their exchange rate regimes were characterized as \u2018overvalued\u2019 to conceal their balance of payments weaknesses. An \u2018overvalued\u2019 rate is seen as making imports cheaper and exports more expensive. This results in an encouragement of investment in areas that do not exploit the comparative advantages of the country concerned in the medium-term. It eventually leads to an inefficient and internationally uncompeti- tive economic structure. What was required, it was argued, was substantial liberalization of trade, a shift to a more liberalized ex- change rate regime, less all-round intervention, and a greater degree of financial sector openness. Many of these countries have since put in place such a regime, partly at the behest of or under pressure from devel- oped country governments and international finan- cial institutions. Now they stand accused of having \u2018undervalued\u2019 exchange rates. Those who put forward such arguments fail to ap- preciate that the adoption of a liberalized economic regime in which output growth had to be adjusted downwards to prevent current account difficulties and attract foreign capital has certain consequences. It has required governments to borrow less to finance deficit spending, which has often led to lower growth, inflation and import demand. Combined with or inde- pendent of higher export growth, these effects have manifested themselves in either reduced deficits or actual surpluses in the external trade and current ac- counts of many developing countries. Combined with increased capital flows, this has resulted in the pecu- liar distribution of global current account deficits and surpluses and global foreign reserves that exist in the world today. National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 36 An important additional policy lesson from the Asian experience, including the 1997 Asian financial crisis, is that currency movements, whatever their initial driv- ers, have often been associated with significant vola- tility and instability. This, together with the key lessons from Asian countries that have achieved success, sug- gests that government management of the exchange rate may be more important than using devaluation as an instrument of trade and competitiveness policy or appreciation as an instrument to deal with reserve accumulation resulting from capital flows or export success.

The reverse situation will, on the other hand, lead to a liquidity crunch and economic slump. In the worst case scenario there could be a full-fledged economic and financial crisis. A key policy lesson is that governments should maintain the basic stability of the exchange rate. This is equally valid for the cur- rent period, during which the large foreign exchange reserves of many Asian countries have led to pressures and calls for an upward revaluation of their exchange rates. Even if some changes are seen as necessary, these must be carefully managed by the central bank to prevent volatility. A rather different lesson emerges from the experi- ence of significantly aid-dependent LDCs and natural resource export dependent economies. Continued aid inflows and low absorptive capacities in produc- tive activities leave them vulnerable to the so-called \u2018Dutch-disease\u2019. This is especially true in the short- term, or until these countries have diversified their economies and built up their industrial and other capacities. \u2018Dutch disease\u2019 results in a significant ap- preciation in the value of a country\u2019s currency and an over-valuation of its real exchange rate. This makes its exports more expensive and imports cheaper than they would otherwise be. This phenomenon has af- flicted Asian countries such as Nepal, Cambodia and even Bangladesh at different times and is viewed as a current risk for Afghanistan. Continued foreign aid inflows have led to an over-valuation of the real ex- change rate in these countries, resulting in endemic trade deficits. This is due to the combined effects of the exchange rate\u2019s bias against exports and the production of tradeables on the one hand, and the inability of domestic producers to compete against cheaper imports, on the other. Trade liberalization, in this context, can only lead to a worsening of the bal- ance of payments situation (Ghosh, 2004, page 18-19). A longer-term and more serious danger of the \u2018Dutch disease\u2019 is that it will inhibit the emergence of a com- petitive tradeables sector, with potential negative im- plications for productivity, growth and poverty reduc- tion (N\u00e9bi\u00e9, 2006). A laissez-faire approach to exchange rate determina- tion also appears to have accentuated similar \u2018Dutch disease\u2019 problems for some natural resource exporters in Asia. For example, countries such as Cambodia and Timor-Leste face a resource related currency apprecia- tion. In the Asian context, this was also identified as a problem in some of the tsunami affected countries. Natural disaster-related aid inflows have led to an ap- preciation in their exchange rates; this could adversely affect their competitiveness. The \u2018Dutch disease\u2019 effect can also be significant as a result of overseas workers remittances, if these are spent on consumption and not productively managed to build a diversified in- dustrial base. A broader \u2018Dutch disease\u2019 related dilemma which is implicit in all the situations just described, is the chal- lenge of comparing the competitiveness costs of large aid inflows with the potential benefits of additional investment in growth and human development that may result from them. An interesting and controversial implication of this dilemma is that trade liberalization could compound competitiveness problems in situ- ations where \u2018Dutch disease\u2019 effects are in evidence. Should liberalisation efforts in such countries be put on hold while donors significantly scale up their aid, including aid for trade? This could become an impor- tant sequencing policy question for LDCs and other low income countries in some circumstances. All of these considerations merely reinforce the impor- tance of understanding the vital influence of exchange rate policies in terms of providing protection against imports and promoting exports, thereby enhancing a country\u2019s trade competitiveness and export success. As a result, exchange rate management should be given much higher priority than other aspects of trade policy such as import liberalization. This is particularly important for sustained economic and export growth under open trade regimes.

Empirically, however, it is the precautionary mo- tive that appears to have dominated during the 1980- 2000 period. Trade openness (imports as a percentage of GDP) remains important as an explanatory factor. Meanwhile, reserve stockpiling is no longer motivated primarily by the need for a buffer against current ac- count shocks, but because of the increased frequency of financial crisis since the 1980s.15 The financial cri- ses phenomenon goes a long way towards explain- ing the perceptible increase in the foreign exchange holdings of developing countries (Aizenman and Lee, 2005) since 1990, when financial liberalization is often regarded as having begun. In the Asian context, fi- nancial liberalization since 1990 was reinforced by the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 as a major motive for accumulating large foreign exchange reserves. Such stockpiles can be viewed as a form of self-insurance both against preventing and minimizing the cost of future crises. Large reserves also reduce the likelihood of self-fulfilling speculative attacks on a country\u2019s cur- rency (Garcia and Soto, 2004). Moreover, Aizenman and Lee argue that a precautionary strategy of hold- ing reserves saves liquidation costs and leads to large welfare gains of a first order magnitude while the ac- companying reduced welfare costs of liquidity shocks change from a first order to second order magnitude as a result of such a strategy (Aizenman and Lee, 2005). The mercantilist motive is often seen as the principal factor behind China\u2019s large accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. It is argued that export competi- tiveness concerns have led to its large accumulation of reserves. These have been used to slow down cur- rency appreciation, absorb surplus labour, create bet- ter jobs and promote exports (Ibid.). The empirical evidence, however, does not support this thesis for developing countries as a whole, including China. While some commentators still believe that this mo- tive is significant in China\u2019s case, it should not be over- stated since it is only of limited relevance for countries such as China who still actively manage their capital accounts. Another reason why the mercantilist motive cannot be viewed as significant is that the desire to maintain export competitiveness and export growth is not new. In contrast, large foreign exchange reserve holdings are a relatively new and developing country- specific phenomenon, traceable only from the 1990s. The foreign exchange reserves of developing coun- tries have increased significantly, from 6-8 per cent of GDP in the 1970s and early 1980s, to 10 per cent in the late 1980s, to 32 per cent by 2007 (IMF, 2008c). Like- wise, the reserves to external short-term debt (STD) ratio increased from 2.5 to 5 between 1990-2002. Four Asian countries, China, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand held 30 per cent of the world\u2019s foreign exchange reserves by the end of 2007 (IMF, 2008a). While China\u2019s reserves had been less than 10 per cent of its GDP in 1990, they increased to greater than 47 per cent of GDP by 2007 (IMF 2008a and IMF 2008c). The Republic of Korea\u2019s reserves never exceeded 5 per cent of GDP until the Asian financial crisis. They then increased significantly after 1998, reaching 27 per cent of GDP in 2007. Malaysia, on the other hand, maintained average reserves of 30 per cent of GDP through the 1990s which had reduced immediately preceding the Asian financial crisis but rose again thereafter, reaching 51 per cent by 2007 (Ibid.; Garcia and Soto, 2004). While such large foreign exchange reserves are often viewed as primarily a Chinese or broader Asian phe- nomenon, this is not true. Emerging market econo- mies as a whole increased their reserve to GDP ratios from 5 to 16 per cent between the late 1980s and 2002. They increased their reserves to STD ratio from 1 in 1990 to 2.4 in 2002. More surprisingly, Africa\u2019s rise in foreign exchange reserves is as striking as that of Asia since, according to IMF data Africa\u2019s reserves were National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 38 equivalent to about 8 months of imports by 2004 (Ro- drik, 2006a).16 This suggests that increased foreign exchange reserves are not just an emerging market phenomenon but one that now also characterizes the world\u2019s poorest countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6686516b-69c1-4236-9698-969bba6e3eff": {"__data__": {"id_": "6686516b-69c1-4236-9698-969bba6e3eff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "644b2f8fbd7a9797910afc297778132050d2e209d18ea48350ac95928a96b85b"}, "2": {"node_id": "17db4729-bb07-48ee-9da6-ceae7b0f2b65", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c146e45e9e81199e05fe730db661b6e1a004b034870e758c8acc02174cf2c4ea"}}, "hash": "f5dd193ad88674dde0e135721a5432f9f9a2a6b4b9742b80df0bf17638bc5530", "text": "What is true, however, is that this is a developing country, not industrialized country phenomenon, since the latter have main- tained a reserve to GDP ratio of approximately 6 per cent since the 1980s, not significantly different from the 5 per cent average they have maintained since the 1950s (Garcia and Soto, 2004; Ibid.).

Is this a sensible strategy? Is it economically rational? Garcia and Soto of the Central Bank of Chile demon- strate that the recent trends in reserve accumulation by some Asian countries are a sensible way to deal with the risks of financial globalization. Using three different crisis scenarios,17 they conclude that the lev- el of reserves held by the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand in 2003 were justified, even if the cost of a future crisis was low. They go further and argue that even doubling these relatively large reserves would be rational to insure against a mild crisis. Moreover, the current higher reserves to STD ratios in these coun- tries are sub-optimal. The same conclusion is reached for these countries if the severity of the crisis that the reserves are intended to cover is implied from their actual levels. While this is also true for China if World Bank estimates are used, it is not if Bank of International Settlement (BIS) criteria are used. According to the World Bank, China\u2019s reserve holdings are consistent with what would be rational for it to hold against the risk of a mild to strong crisis. On the other hand, BIS criteria suggest that China\u2019s actual requirements are signifi- cantly less than what it currently holds since its reserve level is consistent with a severe crisis while the prob- ability of any type of crisis, mild or severe, is extremely low. It should be noted, however, that this conclusion is based not on the high cost of carrying reserves but on the low benefits associated with them, given that a crisis is viewed as only a remote possibility in China (Garcia and Soto, 2004). Rodrik (2006a) agrees that that there is convincing evi- dence that the liquidity provided by foreign exchange reserves reduces the probability of future financial crises and that the high national output cost and so- cial dislocation caused by such crises make such large foreign exchange reserves reasonable despite their high cost. He even acknowledges that large foreign exchange reserves may have the added benefit of re- ducing a country\u2019s external borrowing costs. However, he cautions that only focusing on building large for- eign exchange reserves ignores other ways in which liquidity can be increased. Liquidity can also be en- hanced through the creation of a collateralized credit facility or by reducing short-term external debt. While developing countries appear to have concentrated on increasing foreign exchange reserves, a more op- timal response would have been to increase foreign exchange reserves whilst simultaneously reducing short-term external private sector borrowing and tak- ing concrete steps to build a regional collateralized credit facility. This is appropriate policy advice if the real social cost of holding large foreign exchange reserves is deter- mined by estimating the spread between the pro- ceeds of investing them in low-yielding US Treasury and other securities and the interest rates charged on short-term external liabilities accumulated by the do- mestic private sector.18 While the costs of the latter, un- like the benefits of the former, are difficult to estimate accurately in the absence of clear benchmark interest rates for private sector borrowing, the available data suggests that this spread is at least a few percentage points. As a result, the social costs of excess reserves held as insurance against the costs of financial globali- zation was estimated at close to 1 per cent of annual GDP for developing countries as a whole.19 This cost is clearly very large and is equivalent to the World Bank\u2019s projected gains for developing countries as a whole from a successful Doha Round of trade negotiations. Nevertheless, as empirically demonstrated, maintain- ing such large foreign exchange reserves is economi- cally rational even in the face of such a significant social cost. However, these holdings do imply that fi- nancial liberalization has proven extremely expensive for developing countries. This is partly because accu- mulating excessively large foreign exchange reserves does not appear to be the optimal policy response. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 39 A more optimal policy response would be for devel- oping country central banks and governments to in- crease liquidity in all the three ways mentioned. For example, in addition to increasing foreign exchange reserve holdings, developing countries should reduce their private, short-term foreign liabilities and create a regional collateralized finance facility such as the Asian Monetary Fund proposed by the Japanese in the immediate aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9b1f5bf-bfd8-4485-bb83-8863c344f702": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9b1f5bf-bfd8-4485-bb83-8863c344f702", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6108bd1075fd7f159cfb061618eb28f75e1b3caaaca3c729d9c0c01e550818c5"}}, "hash": "6108bd1075fd7f159cfb061618eb28f75e1b3caaaca3c729d9c0c01e550818c5", "text": "crisis. However, contrary to what may have been expected, short-term debt to GDP ratios increased in emerging market developing countries between 1990 and 2004. Some speculate that these increases can be explained mostly by increases in trade credits due to greater trade openness. Nevertheless, there are no empiri- cal studies to support this claim and the benefits of accumulating such short-term private debt are far from clear since they have, by and large, not led to productive domestic investment. This seems to sug- gest that accumulating increasing amounts of short- term external private debt may serve the objectives of private national and international financial interests even if they do not serve the national public interest of developing countries. If correct, this is a difficult political economy issue which should be prioritized. It also demonstrates that developing countries as a whole have overly focused on accumulating foreign exchange reserves to the detriment of actively man- aging their capital accounts. The IMF and other inter- national financial institutions have also neglected this area. They have traditionally neither advocated, nor given priority to capacity building support for capital account management techniques in developing coun- tries (Ibid.). It was also only relatively recently that the IMF acknowledged that countries should be cautious about liberalizing their capital accounts prematurely. The idea of an Asian Monetary Fund was also unfortu- nately shelved for a number of years after 1997 when it was first aired, because of strong resistance at the international level. Nevertheless, the Asian financial crisis demonstrated that there is no equivalent to na- tional central banks at the international level in times of national crises. This implies that there is no effec- tive international lender of last resort that can provide foreign currency to solvent countries who have tem- porarily lost liquidity. The IMF is unable to fulfil this role appropriately both because of its onerous con- ditionalities and its limited capital (Feldstein, 1999). While the creation of a regional monetary fund in Asia will not address all these problems, it could help fill an important gap at the regional level and mitigate at least some of them. It will be most effective if pursued in conjunction with the other two liquidity enhanc- ing strategies. Its creation should reduce the need for excessive foreign exchange holdings by national cen- tral banks. Such a regional monetary facility in Asia is certainly possible, given the level of foreign exchange reserves currently available in the region and strong regional technical capabilities. In 1999, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus Three lead- ers (leaders of ASEAN nations and China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea) agreed to enhance self-help and support mechanisms in East Asia. As a result, fi- nance ministers of ASEAN plus Three reached a his- toric agreement to establish an Asian Monetary Fund in May 2007. This multilateral currency swap scheme is to materialize by multilateralizing the Chiang Mai Ini- tiative, a network of bilateral currency swaps in the re- gion to supplement the existing international facilities that have been launched and developed since 2000 (Arner, Lejot and Wang 2007). In summary, most thoughtful analysts believe that it is clearly economically justifiable for countries to build up their foreign exchange reserves in this era of accelerating financial globalization for the reasons discussed in this section. One important remaining policy question, however, is whether the large costs of holding such foreign exchange reserves as self-insur- ance against financial liberalization are greater than the benefits of such liberalisation. It is reasonable to argue that the opportunity cost which they represent is too high for the majority of developing countries since the empirical evidence suggests that advocates of financial liberalization in the 1990s overstated its gains whilst simultaneously understating many of its costs. Despite this, however, some developing coun- tries may believe that the opportunity cost of holding large foreign exchange reserves are less than the fi- nancial, social and political costs associated with IMF lending. Large reserves certainly allow developing countries to become more self-reliant. Nevertheless, the combination of lower foreign exchange reserves, a reduction in short-term private external borrowing and the creation of a regional monetary facility would be a more balanced and less costly policy option. In National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 40 the long-run, it will also be more effective in helping Asian developing countries build and sustain the eco- nomic self-reliance they desire. Monetary Policy If countries want to pursue a development oriented policy, a key ingredient is the maintenance of a low interest rate regime since high interest rates tend to discourage productive investment.

A long standing policy objective of develop- ing countries has been to ensure that low rates do not affect credit access, or pre-empt savings and their direction to chosen sectors and sections of society. A number of developing countries have, therefore, made quantitative rather than price driven credit al- locations a central plank of their development policy. Overall, a managed interest rate structure, and differ- ential interest rates along with pre-emption and direc- tion of credit have been key elements of the preferred monetary policy stance taken by these countries. It is indeed true that low real interest rates, by reduc- ing the relative cost of capital, can encourage capital- intensive investments which in turn can have adverse employment implications. However, the choice be- tween alternative capital intensities, especially when producing for export, is limited in many sectors. This is because technologies are often accessed from the international shelf which displays a capital intensive bias and because specific (and desired) product char- acteristics are associated with specific technologies. Furthermore, where choices exist, as in textiles, alter- native means can be used to influence a more labour- intensive technology choice. One of the predictions of the proponents of financial liberalization measures in the 1990s was that such re- forms would eventually result in reductions in real in- terest rates, though they would initially rise to redress the excessively low interest rates that had resulted from the policies of \u201cfinancial repression\u201d. This was argued to be both necessary and welcome because it was expected to lead to more efficient use of bor- rowed resources and higher rates of domestic saving. Nevertheless, it was argued that greater access to cap- ital from international markets would bring real inter- est rates closer to global levels subsequently, resulting in lower real rates of interest for entrepreneurs. This, in turn, would spur investment. Thus financial liberali- zation was seen as a means of generating both lower real interest rates and higher real investment rates. These outcomes have clearly not always, or even fre- quently, been realized in Latin America and elsewhere. In the case of Latin America, investment and savings rates did not increase significantly in the aftermath of financial liberalization nor did real interest rates de- cline. The Southern Cone experience of the late 1970s and early 1980s suggests that deregulation in those countries did not lead to stable interest rates, that interest rates on the whole remained very high and way above \u201creasonable estimates of the socially opti- mal shadow real interest rate.\u201d On the contrary, the \u201c... combination of free capital movements, and domestic and external financial systems characterized by moral hazard and other imperfections \u2026 set the stage not only for significant misallocation of credit, but also for macroeconomic instability\u201d (Diaz-Alejandro, 1985). Fiscal Policy The case for prioritizing appropriate public investment in human development, research and development, and infrastructure has already been made earlier in this paper. Public investments of this kind will, how- ever, require a sustainable financing strategy. More specifically, governments will need to secure as much fiscal space as possible. Most policy research on fiscal reform has thus far fo- cused on the efficiency of public expenditures, effec- tive tax administration, enhancing efficiency in tax collection, and debt management. Nevertheless, the concept of fiscal space has received increased atten- tion in recent years. This stems from the recognition that macroeconomic stabilization objectives were over-emphasized relative to growth and poverty re- duction in the 1980s and 1990s. The focus on stabili- zation not only diverted attention from growth and poverty reduction, but also led to tight fiscal policies that were detrimental to long-term growth, such as re- stricting the use of public finance for domestic public capital formation in a bid to reduce fiscal deficits. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 41 The recent acknowledgement by the international fi- nancial institutions of the need for more fiscal space is welcome. However, their recommended framework for increasing such space is hampered by the continued focus on short-term solvency and stability as binding constraints and a bias towards infrastructure invest- ment. In effect, this implies that incremental public ex- penditure should only be incurred on projects which demonstrate high economic growth returns. Although this is acknowledged as important, the fact remains that this approach will not address the other public investment needs identified in this paper, especially those related to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8510068-9263-4291-bb92-a5d84a28c696": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8510068-9263-4291-bb92-a5d84a28c696", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d9480ee52b90b36bdac2517f8988d41cb4312365bca04c246feed0a754396d3"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c364a60-348e-4c6e-845f-4e55f2d05719", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "005c64e874c687f3439e33dde01dee46c9c44863f035b33287fa48e75163a438"}}, "hash": "2094e3cf8e114f36b46fbc4ab0d4f65fb0babd5d2b1973ad20c16fd33309507f", "text": "human development. An additional weakness in this approach to fiscal space is that it is also likely to result in restrictive policy recommenda- tions that emphasize short-term, efficiency enhancing measures whilst neglecting the potential for long-term resource mobilization. Policy advice based on such an approach will, therefore, greatly restrict the options available to policy makers in developing countries. Debt-financed public investment has, historically, spearheaded resource mobilisation for growth and development in both developing and industrial coun- tries. The \u2018rules\u2019 for fiscal deficits advocated by former British Chancellor (and current Primer Minister) Gordon Brown, for example, allow governments to borrow for critical public investments. Consistent with this objec- tive, Roy and Heuty (2005) define fiscal space as iden- tifying concrete policy actions for enhancing resource mobilization, and the reforms necessary to secure the enabling governance, institutional and economic pol- icy environment for the effectiveness of such policy actions. This definition regards efficiency gains as nec- essary but not sufficient to achieve development policy objectives and proposes a framework for addressing structural bottlenecks to enhance fiscal space. The approach to fiscal policy which flows from this definition, recently operationalised by UNDP (Roy, Heuty and Letouz\u00e9, 2008), emphasises the distribu- tional and developmental aspects of fiscal space, rath- er than limiting incremental spending to areas that can be financed by efficiency gains. It also requires an assessment of the impact of public expenditure on long-term aggregates and trends. It views short- run deviations from the trend as acceptable as long as these translate into positive outcomes in the long- run. Fiscal policy is seen merely as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself and a key policy implication is a wider range of fiscal policy options available to de- veloping country policy makers in both the short and long-term. An assessment of such \u2018fiscal space\u2019 should facilitate the development of a menu of policy actions designed to widen it. UNDP\u2019s recent empirical work at the country and re- gional level has confirmed the relevance of this ap- proach to fiscal space (UNDP 2005e). However it is important to identify and design modes of domestic resource mobilization strategies that are pro-poor in nature. Equity will be central to the design of such strategies. The instruments chosen should, therefore, minimize the net incidence of incremental domestic resource mobilisation on the disposable income of the poor. This will involve designing a progressive tax sys- tem but also devising ways to access resources from relatively well-off segments of the population through recourse to non-tax instruments, including public bor- rowing. Such an approach to fiscal space, when operational- ised, should help secure a significant, sustainable and pro-poor domestic resource base. This can then be complemented by appropriate international resources which would include both concessional transfers and development-enabling public and private resource flows. It is important to note, however, that while such resources can complement domestic resources for de- velopment, they can neither substitute nor even serve as the principal source of development assistance in the long-term. This is increasingly being recognized in development circles. For instance, the Zedillo report makes the point that \u201cthe domestic economy is virtu- ally always the dominant source of savings and invest- ment\u201d (UN, 2002). Long-term strategic thinking on fiscal space and do- mestic resource mobilization possibilities should ide- ally receive much more emphasis than they command at present. Policy makers need to encourage the main- streaming of such thinking in documents like Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), so that important potential sources of development finance are not overlooked by exclusively relying on short-term doc- trinal evaluations of a country\u2019s domestic fiscal sus- tainability. National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 42 A n assessment of current trends suggests that passive liberalisation has exacerbated inequali- ties and promoted increased divergence rather than convergence between and within economies (Wade, 2004). Where liberalisation has been indiscriminate and unstrategic, it has also made little contribution to economic growth, poverty reduction and human development in the vast majority of developing coun- tries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, parts of Asia and elsewhere. The key to success in the 21st century, however, will not lie in a retreat from globalization, but in its successful management. This will require selec- tive and strategic global economic integration which maximizes the opportunities afforded by globaliza- tion whilst simultaneously minimizing its risks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c364a60-348e-4c6e-845f-4e55f2d05719": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c364a60-348e-4c6e-845f-4e55f2d05719", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d9480ee52b90b36bdac2517f8988d41cb4312365bca04c246feed0a754396d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8510068-9263-4291-bb92-a5d84a28c696", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2094e3cf8e114f36b46fbc4ab0d4f65fb0babd5d2b1973ad20c16fd33309507f"}}, "hash": "005c64e874c687f3439e33dde01dee46c9c44863f035b33287fa48e75163a438", "text": "In this context, the most important lesson for fu- ture trade and development policy in the Asia- Pacific region, and in general, is that international trade can facilitate a two-way virtuous relation- ship between human development and economic growth.

Since economic growth is often used as a proxy indi- cator for mediating the relationship between trade and development, it will be essential to demonstrate and ensure not only that international trade gener- ates broad based economic growth but that there is a strong two-way relationship between economic growth and human development. There is strong evi- dence that economic growth is not sustainable with- out improvements in human development, and that if improvements in the latter are postponed, any eco- nomic growth achieved will not be sustainable. Both will need to be simultaneously promoted if advances in either are to be sustained (Ranis and Stewart, 2005a; 2005b). Ensuring broad-based growth that results in human development gains has become increasingly chal- lenging over the last two or three decades. This chal- lenge has assumed greater importance in the current context of accelerating globalization, since efforts to maximize growth increasingly run the risk of deliver- ing growth that is ruthless (plunder by a few at the ex- pense of the many) and jobless. Such growth can also be rootless (lacking social integration or backward linkages in the domestic economy), voiceless (when a few dominate decision-making and its benefits), and futureless (especially for those who are already poor and marginalized) (Jahan, 2000). Nevertheless, and in spite of these potential dangers, growth can contribute to poverty reduction and hu- man development at both the household and na- tional levels. First, employment-led, broad-based eco- nomic growth raises average household income and consumption. The additional income that accrues as a result can raise the level of human capabilities if it is spent on children\u2019s education, improved nutrition and health care and on acquiring or enhancing skills. All the empirical evidence confirms that this is more likely if the additional household income is managed by women (UNDP 1995). Second, growth can increase government spending. Human development will benefit from increased government revenue particu- larly when this is directed towards reducing income and gender inequality and enhancing education and health care systems at the national level (UNDP, 1996). While economic growth can provide the resources to advance human development objectives, human development on the other hand enhances the ca- pabilities of the economic agents who contribute to economic growth. It is important to emphasize this two-way symbiotic relationship between growth and human development. Balanced strategies, incorporat- ing well-designed, mutually supporting elements of both pro-growth and human development-oriented policies, have the highest chances of success (Ranis and Stewart, 2005a). However in instances of slow economic growth, and a corresponding reduction in the available amount of public resources, governments committed to enhanc- ing human development levels in their countries may face two options. The choice is often likely to be be- tween channelling scarce resources towards raising people\u2019s opportunities and capabilities at the expense of growth or using them to directly raise economic Key Policy Messages and Conclusions 6 Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 43 growth, at least in the short run. Forward-looking gov- ernments should choose to do the former in such cir- cumstances, since higher human capabilities will en- hance human development and will eventually lead to enhanced levels of economic growth (Ibid.). It will be equally important to simultaneously tackle the re- distribution of physical and other assets such as land. The 2006 UNDP Asia-Pacific Human Development Report empirically demonstrates that while East Asia \u201cstands out as a successful case of high growth, high trade and high human development,\u201d the South Asian experience illustrates that substantial economic growth can occur with a much lower level of interna- tional trade engagement than is commonly assumed. Moreover, while growth may be a prerequisite for pov- erty reduction, it is not enough (Ibid.). India\u2019s experi- ence demonstrates how steady advances in human development can help ensure that even modest trade liberalization can lead to a higher trend rate of eco- nomic growth. Additionally, its recent experience in the information technology sector, in particular, dem- onstrates how public investment in a critical human development area (e.g. high tertiary level technical education and skills) can directly translate into high international trade competitiveness, as well as export and overall economic growth.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f6e2755-a437-4524-ac80-2c1d1c3d136a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f6e2755-a437-4524-ac80-2c1d1c3d136a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87e9e90764a37da68e130411573465d41178c3b872ac09d7f238eae6ce94abe4"}, "2": {"node_id": "3234d1d1-79f6-4af2-a361-c7cbfc7d94ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "feec6453a57c7a4115e355c914f488c4cc9443c37c9b284383524d9e98135d3b"}}, "hash": "e634c5cebdd117407db267b4f921ca3de7b17371ccec60409bb79a665379beb2", "text": "A second important message is that a coher- ent strategy of raising the returns to investment through a range of government policies is a key to success.

The role of public investment in raising the returns to private investment is a vital element of such a strategy, while blanket import trade liberalization, at least until a country has in- dustrialized or a particular industry is reaching ma- turity, is not. Overall, developing countries will need a system of cascading tariffs because tariffs should ei- ther rise or fall on particular products in line with the country\u2019s stage of development. Moreover, different industries will require different tariff levels, while the tariff requirements of the same industry will vary over time. Prolonged protection can lead to inefficiencies and the inability of an industry to compete interna- tionally. The flip side of the coin, however, is that pre- mature and across-the-board import liberalisation is likely to lead to de-industrialization and undermine the ability of a country to climb up the technology ladder or add value to its products. A third important message that naturally follows the previous one is that both selective and more general government interventions are essential to improve market outcomes. Indeed, the empirical ev- idence demonstrating that the most successful Asian countries have relied on both selective government interventions in trade policy, FDI, technology trans- fer (e.g., through licensing agreements) and domes- tic resource allocation (see Pack and Westphal, 1986; Amsden, 1989; Wade, 1990; Lall, 1992) in addition to more general government interventions in the areas of health, education, agrarian reform and infrastruc- ture provision, is overwhelming and indisputable. Moreover, the relevant lessons for future policy, based on the experiences of the most successful Asian econ- omies (including more recent ones such as China, India and Vietnam), appear to contradict conventional wis- dom in important ways. They demonstrate at least the following: selective and general government interven- tions can play vital roles in generating growth fuelled by a dynamic industrial policy which encompasses both manufactures and some services; both types of interventions are important and need to be used in complementary fashion; industrial and technologi- cal deepening are directly and positively correlated to selective government interventions; governments are capable of designing and implementing a myriad of complex interventions effectively; and the capabili- ties of governments to do this can be built over time (Lall, 2004). It is worth emphasizing here that general purpose, non-targeted public investments in health, education and other human resource and infrastruc- tural areas, while necessary, will not be sufficient. Such investments need to be complemented by selective governmental policy interventions to diversify pro- duction and livelihoods in a sustainable manner if a high probability of overall success in poverty reduc- tion and desirable human development outcomes is to be achieved. As a result, there is a fourth key lesson and impor- tant task for both national governments and the international development community. Priority should be placed on equipping states and govern- ments with the required capabilities to make ap- propriate and effective public investments as well National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 44 as selective interventions that stimulate a virtuous circle of economic growth, poverty reduction and human development. The need for strategic govern- ment interventions is also indirectly demonstrated by a comparison of the Asian and Latin American expe- rience. Evidence for this can be found in the largely disappointing growth and development experience of much of Latin America since the 1970s where free market reforms and non-intervention by govern- ments in market outcomes went furthest and were implemented most rapidly. What successful Asian and disappointing Latin American experiences have in common is that they illustrate that while markets are powerful forces and can play useful roles, they are far from perfect. A fifth important lesson is that the key to determin- ing success or failure is not whether governments intervene but how they intervene (Ibid.; Rodrik, 2004).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d908a252-49bb-416a-a182-744cdee64703": {"__data__": {"id_": "d908a252-49bb-416a-a182-744cdee64703", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81b94f44ce546d38bce583605685f571edc844a3ff89376aa00ad21ff02359cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ffde7c9-2079-4f3b-a055-6e1bf08966fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30dd63adb7533d8d4b05ffe440516eca350695ca73dfd4603c008a4221261620"}}, "hash": "fcfb463450000b8f76a06c927002b75eeb488bd6600f38a220e41e7f5c251f38", "text": "; Rodrik, 2004). Success will be predicated on the simultaneous presence of a critical mass of the following attributes even in the absence of determined and visionary gov- ernment leadership: selectivity in choosing activities with significant technological value-added and link- ages in the economy rather than indiscriminate blan- ket choice; a \u2018carrot\u2019 approach to providing incentives whilst simultaneously using exports as a disciplining \u2018stick\u2019 in addition to domestic accountability meas- ures; ensuring policy coherence through centralized strategic decision-making with an economy-wide perspective; ensuring policy flexibility and learning; a high quality government bureaucracy which pro- gressively becomes more effective in managing such interventions; ensuring regular engagement with, but autonomy from, a vibrant indigenous private sector; partnerships between the public sector and an indig- enous private sector which is established by using the public sector to fill", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af33f7a7-a8f7-4b2b-b91a-94cb914b2ebb": {"__data__": {"id_": "af33f7a7-a8f7-4b2b-b91a-94cb914b2ebb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b47da77491b00a03cc8c2b519d15bd5eac90cf15ac73f2cfd482b3573db2024b"}, "3": {"node_id": "d725f4b3-aadc-4d12-8550-045c3c18fe97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2d9c7dac1ae939e7876f0d0ada5170c802a211ef1f2356aa01d52be35e95a23"}}, "hash": "1dc0137d991b01247c2aa82a2f20a48ff5be27ff1b8dcc0443fe4bcd601d8e7d", "text": "important gaps caused by market failure or high risks; investing heavily in institution building, skill creation, infrastructure development and coordination between key actors; addressing in- formation externalities; and attracting FDI selectively but governing it effectively. While this is clearly a demanding list of attributes, the successful fulfilment of many (even if not all) of them by a number of Asian countries, both large and small, in the past and at present, amply demonstrates that many governments can make appropriate policy in- terventions with positive effect. Asia\u2019s many success stories contrast with Latin America\u2019s disappointment with free market reforms. There is a widespread view in that region, captured in a UNDP report (2004a) and elsewhere that such reform in Latin America delivered less than what was promised and resulted in far less than what was accomplished during the earlier more interventionist, higher growth period of more active industrial policy. Latin America\u2019s experience demon- strates that it is very difficult, if not impossible, for countries to sustain growth and translate this into eq- uitable poverty reduction and human development gains without a strong, forward-looking and agile developmental state which actively pursues public investment and selective interventions in a strategic manner. A sixth key message is that there is a vital link be- tween a country\u2019s macroeconomic policies and its trade competitiveness. This relationship needs to be properly understood and addressed. Empirical evidence suggests that management of the exchange rate is far more important than using devaluation as an instrument of trade and competitiveness policy or appreciation as an instrument to deal with reserve ac- cumulation resulting from capital flows or export suc- cess. A key policy lesson is that governments should maintain the basic stability of the exchange rate. This is equally valid for the current period, when the large foreign exchange reserves of many Asian countries have led to pressures and calls for an upward revalua- tion of their exchange rates. Even if some changes to exchange rate policy are seen as necessary, such changes must be carefully managed by central banks to avoid volatility. These six messages remain as relevant and important in the current context of accelerating globalization as they were to the post World War II success of Japan, the Asian \u201ctigers,\u201d and China. They are also consistent with India\u2019s experience and that of other successful economies including many of the now economically advanced OECD countries during the 18th, 19th and first half of the 20th century when they were in their early stages of development. It is true that the type of interventions needed may not be exactly the same because the accelerating globalization of the late 20th and early 21st century has reduced the need, relevance or viability of some strategies while increasing those of others. Nevertheless, the essential ingredients of success have not altered much.

The 1996 report of the WHO Ad Hoc Committee on Health Research also concluded that the central problem in health research was what has now become widely recognized and quoted as the \u201c10/90 gap\u201d (less than 10 per cent of global spending on health research being applied to 90 per cent of the world\u2019s health problems). The expression continues to serve as a symbol of imbalance in the allocation of global health research resources. 4 Between 2002 and 2005, total aid-for-trade commitments from bilateral and multilateral donors rose by 22 per cent in real terms, from USD 17.8 billion to USD 21.7 billion (OECD and WTO, 2007). 5 Through, for example, clustering in existing sectors which already demonstrate comparative advantage (see Rodr\u03afguez- Clare, 2005). 6 He acknowledges, however, that this does not often happen in the real world. An example of continuing protection of an industry which should have been phased out a long time ago is the textile and clothing industry in the USA. 7 The case of Japan displays some similarities with Germany, where the government encouraged rather than opposed car- tels in many instances. 8 The importance of exports in the world economy has continued to grow. Their value has more than doubled in the past ten years ($5.3 trillion in 1997 and an estimated $11.8 trillion in 2006), since they have been growing faster than produc- tion.

For sub-Saharan Africa, exports now comprise one-third of GDP (WTO 2007; UNDP 2005b, page 114). 9 One core theoretical criticism is that the export-led growth model suffers from a fallacy of composition whereby it assumes that all countries can grow by relying on the growth of demand for the same product in other countries. Industrial country markets for developing country exports are limited. In such a demand-constrained world, there is a serious danger of a beggar-thy-neighbor outcome in which each developing country simply rivals another to displace its exports from devel- oped country markets, making it impossible for all developing countries to reap the benefits of export-led and dependent growth (Palley, 2003, page 2; UNCTAD 2002b). 10 In 2005, this varied from 46 per cent in Laos to just 4 per cent in the Republic of Korea. In 2005, agriculture accounted for 56 per cent of GDP in Myanmar, 45 per cent in Bhutan and 40 per cent in Afghanistan. Similarly, the share of agricultural employment in total employment in 2005 varied from close to 60 per cent in Vietnam and 67 per cent India to less than 1 per cent in Hong Kong (SAR), China, Macau (SAR), China, and Singapore (FAO, 2007; UNDP, 2007). 11 The Asia-Pacific region is home to 65 per cent of the world\u2019s food insecure, and 53 per cent of the world\u2019s 1.2 billion abso- lute poor who subsist on less than $1 per day (UNDP, 2006). 12 This is manifested not only in high agricultural tariff peaks and escalation, and production and trade distorting export and domestic subsidies in developed countries, but also increasingly in their recourse to technical and non-tariff barriers to trade, such as sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, which work against developing country exports. 13 For more details on the content and assessment of bilateral and regional agreements on the movement of natural persons see UNDP 2008. 14 Combined with reduced state participation and regulation of health services, intellectual property protection has been known to lead to high prices, restricted access to medicines and the demise of domestic pharmaceutical production in de- Endnotes Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 51 veloping countries. Moreover, because of heavy reliance on reverse engineering which patent protection agreements no longer permit, domestic manufacturing of pharmaceutical products in developing countries could come to a halt. (UNDP, 2005d, page 80). 15 Since the so-called first debt crisis which broke in Latin America, specifically Mexico in 1982, there have been increasingly frequent crises in emerging markets, attributed by many to accelerating financial globalization which particularly took root in 1990. The list of such crisis is long and includes Mexico again (1995), East Asia (1997), Russia (1998), Brazil (1999), Turkey (1994 and 2001) and most recently, Argentina (2002) (Ibid.). 16 Over the past ten years, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s international reserves have grown fivefold, from $21 billion in 1996 to $108 billion in 2006, equivalent to about 6 months of imports (IMF, 2008b). 17 Mild (currency crisis) with a cost of 5 per cent of GDP, moderate (currency crash) with a cost of 10 per cent of GDP and se- vere (banking crisis) with a cost of 15 per cent of GDP. These estimates are based on empirical IMF data which has estimates of 7.6 per cent, 10.7 per cent and 14 per cent of GDP, respectively, for these three scenarios. 18 Ibid. Excess reserves exclude reserve holdings necessary to ensure 3 months import requirements. Social cost calculated in this manner is different from more conventional estimates of the fiscal cost of holding reserves which are not relevant from a national standpoint or the social opportunity cost of public capital (which will need to be calculated if the reserves were to be used for domestic investment) which Rodrik argues is a concept which is hard to operationalize. He believes, in any case, that short-term external borrowing by the private sector reflects a more accurate measure of opportunity cost for excess foreign exchange holdings. The spread between the cost of such borrowing and the rate of return on excess foreign exchange holdings invested in US Treasury and other securities was estimated at 5 percentage points for the purposes of this calculation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e272b828-3d99-4104-aaa9-809299e8b169": {"__data__": {"id_": "e272b828-3d99-4104-aaa9-809299e8b169", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9245d6781b85906c55aa24ae6157782677d31174cf32c86ab6ccb69ee5580f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e29148b-a577-43b1-acfb-00de79efa067", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a36e4d123d9b03af8010add3bf4f7782574683d8f7956ca950960cb0e7859c22"}}, "hash": "3c2178ee317fe72364fb3dfa9be90e269486975d6ba2701265de374c56a58694", "text": "19 Ibid National Trade and Development Strategies: Suggested Policy Directions 52 Chantal Blouin Trade and Health in Asia: Challenges of Globalization Chantal Blouin is a Senior Research Associate at the Centre for Trade Policy and Law at Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada.

Financing health systems remains a key issue, both in terms of the quantity of resources available for health care and promotion as well as the equity of financing arrangements. In the poorest countries, the level of public health funding is low in absolute terms and health infrastructure is gen- erally weak. For instance, although the Cambodian government allocates a proportion of its budget to health that is on par with that of Australia and Canada (16 per cent), this represents only 7 dollars per person for public expenditures on health in Cambodia, (for a total of 7 dollars per person of health spending), a very low level of funding if one considers that the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health evaluated that 34 dollars per person would be neces- sary to scale-up health services in low-income coun- tries sufficiently to achieve the MDGs. The problems of insufficient funding for health services is common to many countries in the region, but is most critical in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Lao, Myanmar and In- dia (Table 1). In higher income countries, although there is greater overall availability of financial resources, health fi- nancing arrangements are often inequitable. Indeed, a large proportion of health expenditures in Asia are financed by out-of-pocket payments by the patients, which is the most inequitable mechanism of financ- ing (WHO, 2003). Out-of-pocket payment for health services is one of the leading factors that drag poor households down into greater poverty (Wagstaff et al. 2001). Private expenditure dominates health spending in most Asian countries with out-of-pocket payments accounting for as much as 80-100 per cent of these costs (Table 1). In China, out-of-pocket payments rose from 37 per cent of total health expenditure in 1990 to more than 60 per cent in 2001 (Shi, 2003). By con- trast, private pre-paid plans, such as health insurance, remain limited in the region. In some Asian countries, the shortage of health per- sonnel is the key obstacle that needs to be overcome. Bhutan, Nepal, Cambodia, Indonesia and Bangladesh need more physicians and/or nurses to provide health services to their population (Table 2). On the other hand, some countries like the Philippines have trained large numbers of health professionals, in particular nurses. This has ironically further exacerbated the shortage as it has led to a growing trend in outward- migration by Filipino nurses to other countries. Finally, a major challenge facing health systems in the region is the inequitable access to care. The poorest countries are again at a distinct disadvantage, with very limited access to health services for a significant part of the population. If the percentage of births that occur in a health facility is taken as a proxy for access to health services, it is observed that the majority of least developed countries (LDCs) in the region have a low level of access. This clearly will have consequenc- es on the achievement of the Millenium Development Goal regarding improvements in maternal health (Ta- ble 3). Access is even more limited among the poorest citizens of poor countries (Anwar et al., 2004). In those countries where general access is better, some groups or regions of the country may be excluded from the provision of health services. Typically, patients in ur- ban areas have much better access to services than in rural areas. For instance, in the Philippines\u2019 urban ar- eas, more than 78 per cent of births are assisted by a medically trained person compared to just 28 per cent in rural areas (Gwatkin et al., 2005).

Can the liberalisation of trade in this sector partially rem- edy the issue of inequality in financing and access to services, as well as the shortages in health human re- sources? These are the key questions examined and discussed in this paper. For example, foreign investors are more likely to chan- nel new resources into services that benefit higher- income groups, rather than the poorest citizens. How- ever, it is worth highlighting that foreign investment can help decrease the general reliance on out-of\u2013 pocket expenditures through private health insurance schemes. It still remains unclear as to whether foreign investment will help narrow the gap in terms of access between the urban and rural areas. Another issue that needs to be examined is the impact of trade in health services on the availability of health personnel. The promotion of health tourism in the region poses the real risk of exacerbating the shortage of physicians and nurses in some countries. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 57 Private and Foreign Health Services Providers in Asia 2 S everal countries in the region have, in recent decades, witnessed an increase in private sector participation in the financing and delivery of health services (UNDP, 2003; World Bank, 2002). Private ex- penditure accounts for the bulk of health expenditure in most Asia-Pacific countries with the public expend- iture-GDP ratio remaining very low (World Bank, 2002, page 31). The growing trend towards private provi- sion is reflected in the number of private providers. A majority (60 per cent) of physicians in Asia are in the private sector (Hanson and Berman, 1998), and there is a high level of utilization of services by these pri- vate providers (Berman and Rose, 1996; Thi Hong Ha et al. 2002). The growth in private sector participation in health can be linked to the rise in foreign private investment, which has come to play an active role in the region\u2019s national health system. Available information demonstrates that trade in health services assumes many forms (Table 1). How- ever, evidence on the level of foreign participation and investment in the health sector is still partial and limited. Four broad categories of trade in health re- lated services can be identified, based on the General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS) classifica- tion. With the growth of information and communication technology, the cross-border supply (Mode 1, Figure 1) of health services has become increasingly feasible and convenient. For instance, telemedicine services, such as diagnostic or advisory services, can be offered by using communication networks that does not re- quire either the physical movement of the patients or the provider. Currently, some of the principal areas of application are e-education in health, databases of medical literature and health information websites for physicians and the general public (Singh et al., 2002). However, the electronic supply of health-related ser- vices is still in its infancy in developing countries. Ex- ceptions are medical transcription, medical insurance and claim processing, and back-office services which are becoming an increasing large export industry in India and the Philippines (Singh, 2003; Singh et al., 2002)1. Box 1: Trade in Health Services: The Four Modes of Supply Mode 1: Cross-border A user in country \u2018A\u2019 receives medical advice, diagnostic health information or distance training from abroad through the telecommunications infrastructure. Mode 2: Consumption abroad Nationals of \u2018A\u2019 move abroad as tourists or patients to consume health services. Mode 3: Commercial presence Health service is provided by a clinics or hospitals affiliated to or subsidiary of a foreign-owned and controlled company. Mode 4: Movement of natural persons A foreign national provides a service within \u2018A\u2019 as an independent supplier (e.g. consultant, health worker) or employee of a service supplier (e.g. consultancy firm, hospital). 1 Under the GATS, health education and health data processing and storage services are not classified under health services, but respec- tively under education and computer-related services. Trade and Health in Asia: Challenges of Globalization 58 The second form of supply (Mode 2, Box 1) is through the physical movement of consumers of health serv- ices to the country of the supplier. Mode 2 includes the following: consumers who travel abroad to receive medical care, tourists who incidentally need medical care while abroad, retirees abroad, temporary workers, cross-border commuters who may have multinational coverage options, and residents of multi-national are- as with integrated health systems (Warner, 2003).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f40b8d2a-21de-4c54-85df-6fff68498cfa": {"__data__": {"id_": "f40b8d2a-21de-4c54-85df-6fff68498cfa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "faccd5efaeff346d9b5c4ef9f45abdc0ea87018e29e1b10059483a5ac94a4711"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d66e8d3-3954-4fc2-be7a-720f6c532ceb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad9d3afdab77e4ea9b149561027730bd4efaad5609c2a6487d5f5f0f11887450"}}, "hash": "eb04f701ded3bad56ade236616194688d9b9506feba70646f5e4f7a801f1ed82", "text": "The focus here is on consumers who travel to developing countries expressly to receive care, which is generally termed as health tourism.

Trade in health services in developing countries can also take the form of inflows of foreign investment through the establishment of a commercial presence (Mode 3, Box 1). Such investments can occur in hos- pital and management services, or health insurance. Again, there is still limited information on the volume of investment in this sector. Although existing evi- dence indicates that the level of foreign participation is relatively low, it is prevalent in an increasing number of countries. In Thailand, 24 of the 302 private hospi- tals have received some foreign investment, primarily from investors in countries such as Japan, Singapore, China and Europe (Buddhasri et al., 2003). Finally, exports of health services can also occur by the temporary movement of health professionals (Mode 4, Box 1) such as doctors and nurses. The UK, the Unit- ed States, Australia, Canada, Norway and Middle-East countries are the main recipients of these services. The Philippines, Bangladesh and India are leading \u2018exporters\u2019 of health professionals. In the Philippines, one indicator of the scale of the movement of nurses is the large number of nurses that graduate, but do not register with the national professional associa- tion. For example, over 30,000 nurses that graduated in 2000 did not register (Blouin et al., 2006). It must be emphasised that a significant proportion of the cross- border movement of health professionals consists of permanent migration which is not included in trade in health services. This trend has given rise to concerns that the growth of trade through Mode 4 may exac- erbate the current outflows of health professionals from developing countries which are currently facing shortages of such personnel. The following sections focus on the human development impact of growing trade in health services through commercial presence and health tourism. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 59 T he establishment of foreign providers and insur- ers in developing countries potentially presents a number of possible positive and negative conse- quences for the national health system and human development. However, given that foreign investment and private provision in health services are still rela- tively new phenomena, knowledge on their actual im- pact is limited. Nevertheless, what empirical literature exists can shed some light on the potential impact of expanding the role of foreign providers. It is worth noting that domestic and foreign private investment on the national health system may produce different impacts. For example, a foreign hospital management firm may bring new management techniques that are not domestically available. However, given the limited evidence available, literature on the impact of priva- tisation will be relied on as a proxy for assessing the impact of trade in health services through Mode 3. One positive outcome of the inflow of foreign capital is that it provides additional resources to invest in the health care infrastructure and services of the country. However, the principal beneficiaries of liberalisation are usually those households that can afford to pay for the services offered by foreign suppliers. These could take the form of new services that were not previously offered by the domestic providers. For instance, expe- riences of liberalisation in the provision of health serv- ices in Chile led to rapid growth in the supply of new high-technology services (L\u00e9on, 2003). The inflow of foreign capital into certain parts of the health system could also contribute towards reduc- ing the burden on government resources, thereby allowing the public sector to re-allocate its resources towards those patients who have less ability to pay. In other words, when higher income individuals receive care from a foreign-owned private hospital, the pub- lic sector does not have to provide services to them. Additionally, if these individuals buy their health in- surance from a foreign insurance company, the state would not have to cover the health expenses borne by these individuals. Thus, newly freed resources can be channelled towards other patients. Therefore, the resources brought by foreign investors may not only benefit richer citizens of a country. For example, in South Africa, a chain of private clinics ca- tering to the employed but low-income segment of the population is viewed as having the potential to allow the public sector to concentrate its provision of services on the poorest groups (Palmer et al., 2003). In Vietnam, since the legalisation in 1989 of the pri- vate provision of health services, the private sector has become the leading provider of health services, encompassing all income groups in both urban and rural areas (Thi Hong Ha et al., 2002).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18b70ace-1fba-4860-8431-9e1be29eb2f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "18b70ace-1fba-4860-8431-9e1be29eb2f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d8b166a334c933807576edd8e6f5f1c6bff0082e5264ec2cbf04fd934c55659"}}, "hash": "5d8b166a334c933807576edd8e6f5f1c6bff0082e5264ec2cbf04fd934c55659", "text": "At the other end of the spectrum however, evidence from foreign-owned hospitals in China suggests that most of these hospitals are established in urban coastal areas and not in the rural areas where the addi- tional resources would be most needed (Shi, 2003). In South Africa, private clinics only offer a limited range of services (i.e., no emergency services), along with weak preventive care and chronic care services, rais- ing doubts about their capacity to remove a burden from the public sector (Palmer et al., 2003). Another element to bear in mind when considering the liberalisation of the health sector is to assess the likely impact on political decision making in the field of health. For instance, in countries that possess rela- tively well-developed public sectors offering broad access to health services, such reforms can break or weaken political coalitions that support the public system. When politically powerful groups benefit from a universal social programme, they will see it is in their interest to defend the quality and the funding of the programme. The poor and other groups with low political power will benefit, from the interventions of the richer and more powerful. When powerful groups opt out of the public system, the political support to improve coverage and quality is diminished. The im- Foreign Investment in Health Services: New Resources for Health vs. Equity Concerns 3 Trade and Health in Asia: Challenges of Globalization 60 pact of allowing foreign providers of health services and insurance can be the weakening of the political configuration in support of the public health system. On the other hand, in many developing countries, the existing public health system does not offer equal ac- cess and services to all citizens. Often, public spend- ing on health concentrates on the richer sections of the population (World Bank, 2003). For instance, the poorest fifth of the population in India received 10 per cent of public spending on health whereas the rich- est fifth received 32 per cent during 1995-96 (Filmer, 2003). Under these circumstances, national policymak- ers need to examine if opening the sector to foreign providers will create an opportunity to rebalance the system, by reducing public health spending on richer groups who can afford the services of the foreign pro- viders and insurers, and by increasing the resources and services offered to the poorest groups. One of the key issues regarding the privatisation of health services (including privatisation through the inflows of foreign investment) is the aspect of equi- ty in access to services. The principal concern is that high-quality services offered by foreign-owned estab- lishments would be available only to certain groups. Those would include patients with private or social in- surance covering the expenses incurred, or the high- income patients able to disburse a large out-of-pocket payment. There is a strong consensus among research analysts that user fees for health services result in reduced ac- cess to health services among poor people. In virtually all cases, the increase or introduction of user fees was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in service utilisation. The magnitude of the drop in utilisation was more pronounced and of a longer duration, for the poor sections of the population (Bennett and Gil- son, 2001, page 11). Numerous case studies and com- parative studies document this impact; in some cases the reduction in utilization reached as much as 50 Box 2: Foreign Private Investment and Export Capacity in Health in Low-Income Countries The prospects for foreign investment in the health sector of least-developed countries presents analysts and policy makers with a paradox: although these countries are the ones that most need additional capital and resources, they are the least likely to receive it. Indeed, LDCs are faced with acute needs for investment in health (Commission on Macroeconomic and Health, 2001). However, there is little likelihood that foreign investors will establish a commercial presence in the health sec- tor of these countries. Foreign investors are attracted by social and political stability, ready markets, high rates of return, inexpensive and skilled labour, cheap local inputs and adequate infrastructure (Schmidt and Culpeper, 2003). Therefore, in general, foreign investment disproportionately goes to higher income developing countries. That is because those countries tend to have bigger domestic markets, an educated labour force and better infrastructure. Nevertheless, there are cases of LDCs such as Angola, Lesotho, Mozambique and Cambodia where FDI flows (relative to GNP) are fairly high.

The export capacity of LDCs in the field of health services is extremely limited, given their con- straints in infrastructure and human resources. When there is a low supply of health professionals (e.g. less than 25 physicians per 100,000 people in Bangladesh, Nepal, Cambodia), it is difficult to see how offering services to foreign patients would be possible, without further reducing access to services for the local patients. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 61 per cent (Yoder, 1989; Creese, 1991; Moses et al. 1992; McPake, Hanson and Mills, 1993; Mwabu et al., 1995; Haddad and Fournier, 1995; Creese and Kutzin, 1995; Gertler and Hammer, 1997; Kipp et al. 2001; Meuwis- sen, 2002; Nanda, 2002; Paphassarang et al., 2002; Ridde, 2003). The impact of user fees on the utilisation of services has also led to negative health outcomes. In China, the introduction of user fees has been made for preventive services such as immunizations and treatment of infectious diseases. This resulted in less immunization and higher prevalence rates of diseases such as measles and polio (Liu and Mills, 2002). In principle, such inequitable outcomes can be ad- dressed by regulatory measures. However, the meas- ures used to address this problem have proven diffi- cult to implement. The literature on the introduction of user fees shows that in most cases, exemptions from fees were in principle available to the poor, but in reality the implementation of these exemptions was ineffective (Gilson et al., 2001; Gilson, 1997; Gilson and Mills, 1995; Mills, 1998; Meuwissen, 2002). Never- theless, the experience of Cambodia, which had an earmarked fund entrusted to an independent third- party, clearly illustrates that institutional solutions to the problem of access for the poor caused by cost- recovery can be found (Hardeman et al., 2004). Trade in health services can also take the form of for- eign investment in health insurance. Expansion of private health insurance via the channel of foreign in- vestment is one available option to reduce the heavy reliance on out-of-pocket payments, which is prob- ably the most acute problem afflicting health systems in the region (WHO, 2000). Health insurance also al- lows for pooling or spreading financial risks among participants. Private health insurance funds are still rare in Asia, and judging from the experiences in other regions, it seems unlikely that its expansion will have a significant impact on human development in Asia. The World Bank reports, \u201cBecause of the cost and pro- nounced market failure that occurs in private health insurance, this is not a viable option for risk pooling at the national level in low-and middle income coun- tries\u201d (World Bank, 2002, page 8). The evidence from Latin America shows that private insurers (foreign or domestic) will tend to serve only the higher income and low risk groups which can af- ford to make relatively high financial contributions to receive coverage (Baeza and Cabezas, 1999; Barrien- tos and Lloyd-Sherlock, 2000). This is illustrated by the experience of Chile, where elderly people and women of fertile age face much higher premiums (Sanhueza and Ruiz-Tagle, 2002). \u201cBy charging a premium con- tingent on age and gender, as families become older, and there are is more female members in fertile age, the cost of the insurance rise, and low income people get excluded from the private health insurance sys- tem\u201d (Ibid, page 178). In countries like Chile, the nega- tive impact on women is mitigated by the fact that the public insurance system is available and affordable to low income women. Regulation can be introduced to curtail behaviour such as selection biases by insurers. However, the ex- pansion of private health insurance through foreign involvement also poses an additional risk of fragment- ing the pool. A limited number of large pools or a sin- gle pool are better than small pools as they allow for a greater spread of risks and can benefit from econo- mies of scale with regard to administration.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a862865d-25e0-4999-ace7-6c1c94ffc973": {"__data__": {"id_": "a862865d-25e0-4999-ace7-6c1c94ffc973", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ba2b1ccf36908aa0174cf89760b0feb0050ca2be8ff4b3be05237f1ffa30978"}, "2": {"node_id": "4973d81f-62ba-4ff0-938c-1e02138eb391", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d42075e50de457eaccd6e85fa55c63e549c20c8c534d035463902366da2b3683"}}, "hash": "7ff460724d815008dabb4f72685ad6a8664cc4b9b6226881d4992d752b058bcb", "text": "However, the World Health Organisation reports the following: Health system policy with regard to pooling needs to focus on creating conditions for the development of the largest possible pooling arrangements.

Another aspect that policymakers need to consider when contemplating trade liberalisation in health services is whether they are in a position to harness the potential of foreign investment to achieve the MDGs in health. They need to assess whether they have the capacity to put in place regulatory and finan- Trade and Health in Asia: Challenges of Globalization 62 cial mechanisms to ensure that foreign-owned clinics and hospitals provide maternal and child health care to poor patients. They also need to consider what poli- cies should be adopted to ensure that these providers are full partners in the fight against HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The government has to determine whether it can adopt measures to prevent pool frag- mentation and risk selection as a result of the opening of the health insurance market to foreign investors. Finally, governments must also attempt to leverage foreign investment in health insurance as a means to affect a transition from out-of-pocket payments to- ward more equitable financing for health care. There is however no universal solution for these issues, as there are large variations in the problems facing na- tions in the region, and their capacity to implement mitigation measures. In conclusion, foreign investment in health services has the potential to increase the financial resources available to health systems, one of the key challenges we noted in the introduction. However, it is unlikely to address the problem of inequitable access in health care without complementary government action to ensures that public resources are diverted to the least well off. Box 3: Trade in Health Services in China: Foreign Hospitals and Clinics Between 1989 and 2000, China adopted several policies and regulations to facilitate foreign invest- ment and trade in health services through joint ventures. In 2003, the Ministry of Health conducted a national survey on health trade and investment in China. Of the 46 Sino-foreign health facilities surveyed, 57 per cent were specialized hospitals or clinics, such as ophthalmology hospitals, re- productive health centres, tumour hospitals, and dental clinics. The total foreign investment was relatively small: for 41 per cent of the surveyed health facilities, the foreign investment component stood at less than $600,000. A mere six establishments received investments above $12 million. The joint ventures were basically between Chinese public hospitals and private investors from the United States or Hong Kong (SAR), China. The survey revealed an extremely skewed regional distribution of these Sino-foreign health facili- ties. The vast majority (78 per cent) of these health facilities were located in large cities in the coast- al areas rather than the Central and Western Provinces where the health infrastructure, manpower and the technical capacity were insufficient to meet the health needs of the population. Nevertheless, despite their small scale, a positive outcome from these joint venture establishments was the introduction of new concepts of health management and services, advanced medical technology and an enabling hospital environment. Their presence also led to competitive pres- sures on the public hospitals. Although these establishments mainly catered to foreigners working in China or other high income groups, a few of them also provided essential healthcare services to the community. They provided basic health services to the ordinary population, by using innova- tive strategies to attract patients. For instance, the service charges were set in line with the market environment, taking into account the level of user fees charged by the public hospitals. A large number of public hospitals learnt valuable lessons from the Sino-foreign Joint-venture hospitals. The net result was an improvement (through imitation and learning) in the quality and manage- ment of health services. Source: Shi, 2003. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 63 E very year, millions of patients travel overseas to receive medical care. What is now termed as \u2018health tourism\u2019 encompasses the provision of a wide spectrum of services ranging from health check-ups, hip replacement, cardiac or eye surgery, to maternal deliveries. This trade has been hailed as one service sector in which developing countries have consider- able export potential. The comparative advantage of these countries derives from a combination of lower costs and availability of qualified personnel, and in some cases, a naturally conducive environment for convalescence. Singapore, India, Thailand and Malay- sia have been the frontrunners of this emerging and expanding industry in Asia.

In 2003, the government adopt- ed a strategy to further develop this sector, targeting revenues of $3 billion in foreign patient expenditures by 2012. This is estimated at being roughly equivalent to more than 1 per cent of the GDP and is expected to generate an additional 13,000 jobs, primarily in nursing and paramedical employment. Singapore\u2019s private hospitals offer a broad range of specialties, with a large number of visitors travelling specifically to receive care in cardiology, oncology, urology and obstetrics (HSWG, 2003a). In Malaysia, although health tourism is still in an early stage of development, the government has initiated several measures to promote this new sector. These include tax incentives for hospitals that upgrade their equipment, the creation of a National Committee to promote health tourism through trade missions and the relaxation of advertisement rules (Medical Tribune, 2002). Based on the information provided by seven of the 33 private hospitals catering to foreign patients in Malaysia, more than 72,000 foreign patients received treatment in 2001 (Jui Meng, 2002). In India, it is esti- mated that 150,000 foreign patients visit annually to receive medical care, and that number is growing at the rate of 15 per cent a year (Lancaster, 2004). Cardiac surgery, knee/hip replacement and dentistry have been the main areas of focus, although the use of ay- urveda and spa resorts is also rapidly gaining ground in the industry (Financial Express, 2005). In Thailand, the government has been actively pro- moting the export of health services by embarking on a campaign aimed at encouraging foreigners to re- ceive treatment and services in Thailand. In 2001, the Department of Export Promotion, Ministry of Com- merce conducted a survey of 20 private hospitals, which catered largely to foreign patients. The seven hospitals which responded received 470,000 foreign patients, mainly from Japan, US, Taiwan, UK and Aus- tralia, although numbers coming from the Middle-East and other Asian countries are also climbing (Pachanee and Wibulpolprasert, 2003). By 2004, this number had reached 1.1 million foreign patients. About 60 per- cent of them are expatriates working in Thailand, or neighbouring countries where health services are in- adequate (Pachanee and Wibulpolprasert, 2007). In order to further promote this sector and improve quality, Thailand created the Institute of Hospital Quality Improvement & Accreditation (HA-Thailand). To date, there are 50 hospitals accredited nation- wide, of which 10 are private hospitals. In addition, the government also promotes other health-related services such as health spas, long stay and Thai tradi- tional medicine (including Thai traditional massage). For health spas, the government and Spa Association jointly provide accreditation to the spa facilities that meet the requisite standards to ensure an acceptable quality of services. The Thai Long Stay Management Corporation was established to promote long stay pro- grammes in 2002. Foreigners, in particular the elderly, are encouraged to visit Thailand and stay for a longer period, participating in several activities, including medical examination, sports and recreation, and cook- ing classes. An additional strategy to promote health tourism took place during trade negotiations, where Thailand requested Japan to widen health insurance coverage for Japanese patients to include treatment in Thailand (Arunanondchai and Fink, 2007). There are several positive benefits arising from the growth in health tourism. Exports of health services Health Tourism: Can it Improve Access to Health Care in Asia? 4 Trade and Health in Asia: Challenges of Globalization 64 can become an important source of foreign currency for developing countries. It is not only a source of employment and income for health workers but also for workers in the tourism sector: people travelling to receive health services are also likely to consume tourism-related services such as hotels, transport, and restaurants. The additional incomes thus gener- ated can contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. According to estimates, medical tourism is likely to generate an additional $1.1-2.2 billion in an- nual revenue to India by 2012 (The Economist, 2004). Singapore hopes to generate $3 billion a year in addi- tional revenue by the same year. These additional in- comes can also have a more direct impact on health, particularly if they are harnessed to benefit the health system of the country and the poor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c98f726e-bf8f-414f-827d-20f198603da8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c98f726e-bf8f-414f-827d-20f198603da8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6249632f432131aad9b357fef597f633c2917db780a9efd177827ca1a0cd5eee"}, "2": {"node_id": "d13d849e-1344-4616-99e2-35d10895ab8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "adda92c25efd9a6b4b6d010f28375973680392e3b453b3b8dffc7ec24974d511"}}, "hash": "8cb28af255f070989d1a442ac7a83c10751f09b728383443cdee602033a09946", "text": "For instance, they can be taxed and allocated to improve the supply and quality of health services in the public sector.

If these service providers and facilities are available to local patients as well as foreign patients, an over- all improvement in the quality of care in the country can be achieved. Additionally, the creation of centres of medical excellence to attract foreign patients could also help stymie the \u2018brain drain\u2019 of qualified medical personnel from developing countries, who often mi- grate overseas in search of better wages. However, the growth of health tourism also raises con- cerns about its impact on the overall health system of the recipient countries. A leading concern is that it can create a dual market structure within the health care system: one higher quality, expensive segment cater- ing to wealthy nationals and foreigners, and a lower quality segment with limited resources offering serv- ices to the rest of the population (Chanda, 2001). For instance, the growth of health tourism in Singapore may widen the existing disparity in the distribution of medical personnel and expertise between the public and the private sectors. About 48 per cent of the phy- sicians work in the public sector, caring for almost 80 per cent of all in-patients. By comparison, the private sector admits almost four times fewer in-patients but has more doctors (HSWP, 2003b). Singapore\u2019s expert group focused on the problems linked to the dual structure recommended a possible solution. That is to facilitate the use of the private hospitals by nationals by making the Government\u2019s healthcare subsidy port- able, to be used in the hospital of the patient\u2019s choice. The most pressing concern regarding the impact of health tourism centres on internal \u2018brain drain\u2019. Physi- cians and nurses from the public sector or those offer- ing services in rural areas, move to the urban facilities to take care of wealthy, usually foreign, patients. The case of Thailand provides a clear example of this prob- lem. The resources required to service one foreign patient are approximately equal to what is used to service 4-5 Thai patients. Thus, the workload is equiva- lent to 3-4 million Thai patients or around 3 per cent of the total systems workload in 2001. If the growth trend continues at the current rate, the workload for servicing foreign patients could rise to as much as 12 per cent of the total workload in 5 years. This will re- quire an additional 3,000 full-time equivalent doctors to service urban private hospitals, further exacerbat- ing the shortage of health professionals in rural areas (Pachanee and Wibulpolprasert, 2003). There are also concerns that the current drive to- wards making Singapore the regional hub for medical tourism may lead to a severe shortage of physicians. Indeed, expert groups have projected that there could be a shortage based on domestic needs alone (HSWG, 2003b). In addition to these shortages, the rapid growth in health tourism is likely to result in hu- man resource allocation constraints within the public healthcare system. The Health Summit Working Group reports the following: A booming private sector may recruit trained spe- cialists too aggressively from the public sector and further drive up public healthcare expenditures as the public sector strives to match private sector sala- ries, to retain these specialists. This would put pres- sure on the policy objective to contain the Govern- ment\u2019s healthcare expenditure at 1 per cent of GDP (HSWG, 2003b, page 8) One proposal to stymie the flow of professionals from the public sector is to permit physicians to work part- time in the private sector, thereby reducing the incen- Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 65 tive for these professionals to completely abandon their jobs in the public sector. In conclusion, there is limited evidence to demon- strate how the additional income and resources from health tourism have been leveraged to improve the overall national health system and achieve develop- ment objectives in health. Therefore, for now, we can- not claim that health tourism has improved access to health care services for most people in Asia and there- fore, addressed one of the challenge facing most of the countries in the region. In the other hand, it is clear that providing health services to foreign patients has constrained the availability of health personnel.

The current level of commitments at the GATS on health-related services is relatively low, compared to other sectors (Adlung and Carzaniga, 2006). In Asia, only twelve countries made commitments regard- ing health-related services (Table 4). This group in- cludes high-income countries like Australia, Japan, and Singapore as well as low-income countries such as Cambodia and Nepal. The sectoral commitments are confined mainly to hospital and professional serv- ices, provided by physicians and dentists. Each com- mitment is limited and determined according to the modes of supply and by conditions attached to mar- ket access and national treatment commitments. For instance, India\u2019s market access commitment pertain- ing to hospital services is limited by a foreign equity ceiling of 51 per cent. In Cambodia, the commitment regarding medical and dental professional services is limited to specialized services provided through mode 3 and through joint ventures with Cambodian juridical persons. The government did not make com- mitments pertaining to cross-border supply, such as tele-medicine. In China, the commitment to medical services also included a requirement for joint ventures to provide services with an addendum that \u201cthe ma- jority medical personnel of the joint venture hospital and clinics shall be of Chinese nationality\u201d. China also made a commitment for supply through the move- ment of foreign doctors (Mode 4), once they obtain a license from the Ministry of Public Health. A number of countries in the region (Indonesia, Korea, the Philip- pines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand) however refrained from making any commitments in these sectors. Given the relatively low level of commitments, a WHO- sponsored team of legal scholars appointed to review the implications of the GATS on the capacity of nation- al governments to promote public health, assessed that the impact is very limited at present (Fidler and Drager, 2003). However, if the level of commitments in the health-related sectors rises and new multilat- eral disciplines are negotiated in the future, the agree- ment may have far more serious implications for the capacity of governments to design and implement public health policies. The key problem identified with GATS commitments is the danger of policy lock-in. Indeed, if an unsuccess- ful policy decision is bound in a trade commitment, it becomes difficult to reverse. For example, if an experi- ment with foreign private hospitals leads to a shortage of physicians and nurses in rural areas and reduces ac- cess for the poorest citizens, a national government may decide to reverse its policy and ban the entry of more foreign hospitals. However, if the liberalisation of hospitals services was listed in the country\u2019s GATS commitments, such reversal can become very difficult to achieve. The main question that arises is why governments in Asia would consider making GATS commitments, giv- en the risks involved. The two arguments that support making these commitments are (1) the contention that GATS commitments can serve to attract foreign investment in the health-related sectors by provid- ing a degree of predictability and certainty for foreign suppliers, and (2) the view that they could serve as an important bargaining chip in wider WTO negotiations (Nielson, 2006). There is no available evidence to sup- port the first assumption, but it is possible to visualize a scenario in which commitments in health-related service sectors would be made in exchange for mar- Should Asian Countries Make GATS Commitments in the Health Sector? 5 Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 67 ket access gains. Gains could be made in agriculture or other sectors have the potential to deliver economic benefits, which in turn could contribute to human de- velopment. Developing countries experimenting with options to improve their national health systems and outcomes need to have policy flexibility and space. A high de- gree of certainty is required before countries decide to make any commitments under GATS. In a recent hand- book on GATS and health services prepared under the aegis of the WHO, it is recommended that WTO mem- bers who would like to open their health sector to for- eign providers should consider \u2018experimenting\u2019 with liberalisation outside of GATS before making GATS commitments (Blouin, Drager and Smith, 2006). Such unilateral liberalisation would allow WTO members to experiment with policies in a manner that permits them to change course if the experiment produces unsatisfactory results. Although such an approach is not without risks, the key point is that if the reforms have negative impacts and there are no", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80d90c42-7b03-4fdd-9012-41b8751fa342": {"__data__": {"id_": "80d90c42-7b03-4fdd-9012-41b8751fa342", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b204b9aa0679b885b00fb7105c816ab988f343e1ca680a67c04c03810a3bb9b5"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1301521-1448-4a49-8bf5-c944a7fe588f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d4c08f4eae1cd2ea0a0be2a2601f934fe90f36dd4640770da355f3893cdd8dc"}}, "hash": "1d706104cb51a08db2ebb92748314f0668fc96491c571fb7076152796a7ae1fb", "text": "trade commit- ments in the relevant services sector, the liberalization will not be \u201clocked-in\u201d and policy reversal will be much easier. In making GATS commitments in health-related sec- tors, national governments must ensure that all the market access and national treatment restrictions de- signed to promote health are taken into account. As in other sectors, regulatory measures which are not included in the schedule of commitments are sub- ject to the \u2018list it or lose it\u2019 rule. This in effect means that restrictions must be included with the original sectoral commitments or the government stands to lose its capacity to maintain or adopt such measures. The Malaysian GATS commitments to hospital services provide an interesting example of carefully designed limitations and conditions that ensure that foreign participation contributes to the national health sys- tem and enhances local participation (Mashayekhi et al., 2006). In the case of private hospital services pro- vided through Mode 3, access is conditioned by an economic needs test and is permitted only through locally incorporated joint-venture corporations with foreign shareholding being limited to 30 per cent. In addition, the joint venture can operate a hospital only if it provides a minimum of 100 beds. Within profes- sional services, Malaysia has also made some com- mitments, but only in a few specific medical speciality services, such as forensic medicine, nuclear medicine, and geriatric micro vascular surgery. Asian countries are also involved in a number of re- gional and bilateral trade agreements, some of which involve trade in health services. Few commitments to health services have been undertaken so far. Sev- en members of ASEAN (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) scheduled partial commitments in health insurance during the past two rounds of negotiations, but none to health services (Hiong and Djandam, 2002). Since 2005, the negotiations at ASEAN have include health services as one of the priority sectors for trade liberalisation, to progressively achieve free trade in services by 2020 in the region (Pachanee and Wibulpolprasert, 2007). The negotiators agreed to focus on Mode 3, more spe- cifically liberalisation in private hospital series, since it was subject to most restrictions, but there have been no significant liberalisation of health services under ASEAN yet, except for a weak mutual recognition agreement on nursing services. In addition to sector specific trade commitments, it is essential for policymakers to be aware of the impact of commitments undertaken in bilateral investment treaties or in investment provisions of trade treaties. Indeed, the experience with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) provides a good illustration of how the space to adopt health policy measures can be reduced by foreign investor protection (Johnson, 2004; Sanger et al., 2004). For example, NAFTA\u2019s invest- ment provisions on expropriation can pose an obsta- cle to the expansion of the Canadian public health in- surance system into new areas such as the coverage of prescription drugs or home care. These provisions on measures equivalent to expropriation have been used by foreign investors (in ways that go far beyond the intention of the parties) to challenge public policies that imposed costs on the investors, such as environ- mental policies. Trade and Health in Asia: Challenges of Globalization 68 Box 4: Foreign Investment in Private Hospitals: Indonesia\u2019s Cautious Approach The Indonesian government has identified specific areas in which foreign investment could con- tribute to strengthening the health sector. These include investment in private wings in teach- ing hospitals and in tertiary care hospitals, especially in cities other than Jakarta. The government hopes that such investment will not only benefit the higher income groups which desire access to sophisticated and expensive equipment, but also the population as a whole. For instance, the provision of private wings should result in a broad-based improvement in services in government teaching hospitals, as the revenues generated by services offered to richer patients can cross-sub- sidise services offered to the general population by the same highly qualified health professionals working in these teaching hospitals. Indonesia has not made any commitments on health services at the WTO and has not made of- fers on health services in the current General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS) negotia- tions. However, its current investment rules allow for foreign investment in (a) hospitals, (b) medical checkups, (c) evacuation and transportation, (d) mental rehabilitation centres, (e) clinical laborato- ries, (f) hospital management, and (g) maintenance and calibrations for medical equipment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1301521-1448-4a49-8bf5-c944a7fe588f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1301521-1448-4a49-8bf5-c944a7fe588f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b204b9aa0679b885b00fb7105c816ab988f343e1ca680a67c04c03810a3bb9b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "80d90c42-7b03-4fdd-9012-41b8751fa342", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d706104cb51a08db2ebb92748314f0668fc96491c571fb7076152796a7ae1fb"}}, "hash": "8d4c08f4eae1cd2ea0a0be2a2601f934fe90f36dd4640770da355f3893cdd8dc", "text": "The domestic rules specify that the foreign companies have to enter into a joint venture with Indone- sian companies.

Only 12 of 500 hospitals are actually owned and operated by private enterprises or a limited foreign company. Investment in the health sector is dominated by Singaporean, Malaysian and Australian companies. The government is very cau- tious in opening its market or making commitments on health services at the GATS, as it is intent on ensuring that regulations are in place before completing liberalisation. At present, the principal concern is the regulation of the health profession. Many regulations for licensing, standardization, competency tests, competency-based education are still in the process of being formulated. It is only once a solid regulatory framework is in place, that the government will consider further, albeit still gradual, liberalisation. Source: Untung Suseno Sutarjo, 2003. Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 69 T he impact of the WTO\u2019s Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on access to medicine for poor people has been at the centre of an important international con- troversy. The debates within and outside international organizations led to the adoption of the Doha WTO Ministerial Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health in 2001. It recognized that patents lead to higher drug prices which, in turn decrease the ability of poor to ac- cess drugs. Therefore, WTO members stressed that the TRIPS agreement does not preclude members from adopting measures to protect public health. The Min- isterial Declaration also highlighted the importance of TRIPS\u2019 flexibilities, including the provisions that allow for making exceptions to patent rights on pharmaceu- tical products, such as parallel importation or compul- sory licensing (WHO and WTO, 2002). The TRIPS agreement has been implemented in most countries in the region. The transition period for de- veloping countries ended in 2000 and for LDCs in 2006. With respect to pharmaceutical patents, LDCs have been given the flexibility to request an exten- sion of the transition period to 2016. Countries like India and Pakistan which did not have patent protec- tion for drugs at the time of the signature of the TRIPS, had to provide such protection beginning January 1, 2005. A closer examination of the implementation of the TRIPS into national legislation in Asia reveals that most countries did not take full advantage of the flex- ibilities of the Agreement (Thorpe, 2002; Villanueva, 2004). For instance, among ASEAN members, only the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand have expressly included public health as the basis for the is- sue of a compulsory licence. Moreover, even when in- cluded in legislation, national authorities have tended to under-utilize TRIPS flexibilities. In the Philippines, the failure to resort to these provisions led to higher drug prices, not only when compared to prices in a country like India that did not have patent protection on pharmaceuticals, but even in comparison with Ma- laysia and Thailand (Villanueva, 2004). Even though countries have not taken full advantage of TRIPs flexibilities, there has been a number of cases where countries have used these provisions to ensure equitable access to essential drugs. For instance, in Malaysia, the government decided in 2003 to import generic antiretroviral drugs (treatment for HIV/AIDS) under the \u201cgovernment use\u2019 provision of the TRIPS. The Ministry of Health faced strong opposition in do- ing so, as there were internal pressures not to do so, for fear that it would deter future foreign investment in Malaysia (Munsungu and Oh, 2005). Thailand is another case where the government have been using TRIPS flexibilities, despite international pressure against it. In 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Public Health issued three compulsory licences: two for antiretrovirals, and one a drug for heart disease (ICTSD, 2006, 2007).

The Importance of Taking Advantage of the TRIPS\u2019 Flexibilities 6 Trade and Health in Asia: Challenges of Globalization 70 Although strong patent protection is sometimes presented as the price to pay in order to encourage the discovery of new drugs and vaccines that are rel- evant to the needs of developing countries, empirical evidence does not substantiate this claim. In its study on the evidence, the International Commission on In- tellectual Property Rights (IPR) stressed that the use of TRIPS flexibilities to weaken patent protection on drug will not diminish \u201cthe incentives for research on diseases specific to developing countries, because it is the lack of demand rather than the IPR system which is the determining factor\u201d (Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, 2002, page 39). Two Background Papers for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 71 G iven the growing importance of trade in health services, policymakers in Asia need to integrate the trade dimensions into their national health poli- cymaking. A country-specific assessment should iden- tify the ways to mitigate the potential negative impact of trade in health services. Those impacts include the strain health tourism sometimes places on health personnel availability in rural areas and public institu- tions. \u201cAny negative impact from trade in health serv- ices on access to essential care for local people must be met with a prompt reaction. The shortage of doc- tors and health personnel in the rural areas of Thailand is a good example. Financial incentives as well as non- financial incentives \u2013 for instance, compulsory public service \u2013 or better opportunities for career develop- ment have been implemented in order to retain medi- cal doctors in the public sector, particularly in rural areas. Massive increases in the education of medical doctors, to compensate for their loss through interna- tional trade, have been implemented\u201d (Pachanee and Wibulpolprasert, 2007, page 163). In order to design such policy responses, policy makers in the region need to have a better understanding of the nature of trade in health services in their country. Such assessment also needs to consider how to lev- erage the opportunities coming from foreign capital and technologies to ensure that these support the achievement of the MDGs on health. Analysts review- ing the policy and business literature on trade in health services have stressed that the potential financial re- sources gained from such trade can be re-allocated to national health systems or to public policies improv- ing the conditions for good health (clean water, sani- tation, housing) (Bookman and Bookman, 2007). How- ever, we have yet to see many concrete examples of how this is being done. A national assessment should develop an explicit strategy on how to ensure such re-allocation and harnessing of the potential benefits from trade in health services. The WHO is currently developing a diagnostic tool which would enable Ministries of Trade and Health to work together to conduct such a national assess- ment (WHO-SEARO, 2007). The tool does not only look at trade in health services, but also linkages between trade and health such as the health impacts of trade in harmful products e.g. tobacco and trade in food (food security, diet and nutrition). A draft version of the tool can be made available to interested parties. In the implementation of such a national assessment on trade in health, it is crucial that policymakers en- gaged with a broad range of stakeholders and civil so- ciety organizations. Such involvement in the national and international dialogue improves the awareness of policymakers on the links between trade agreements and human development. For instance, in Pakistan, a wide consultation on negotiations on trade in services, including with the Pakistan Medical and Dental Coun- cil, the Pakistan Nursing Council, led the government to languages in the offer the country was making on trade in health services (Tuerk and Mashayekhi, 2007). \u201cOne of the concerns related to the government\u2019s ability to provide essential services to the poor and marginalized and whether a full market access and national-treatment commitment would compromise this ability. [\u2026] It was in response to these concerns that the final version of initial offer \u2013 in those sector that relate to health - was designed to effectively ex-", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "197161dc-44e6-475b-8136-6ca0247a912b": {"__data__": {"id_": "197161dc-44e6-475b-8136-6ca0247a912b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade on Human Terms: Background Papers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33bee3557e42d0b304103611625271e36131d42adf4ce83b7e00adf0fbcfb378"}, "3": {"node_id": "b71dea3d-b232-4a2e-9dc6-187e3a389ced", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-human-terms-background-papers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7622766a4cc5598cf7b439b23b3f995d2758ea901d9d1a491d4040aaa7c3e71c"}}, "hash": "30a2cb34a56d4d140ff4915a921e93b3b6f92224f62d4d6aa7d64fd3f429ffd0", "text": "clude \u201cservices provided by public institutions wheth- er owned and operated by federal, provincial, district, Tehsil or municipal authorities\u201d from the scope of the commitment\u201d (Ibid, page 269). Caution on Trade Commitments The key problem identified with GATS commitments or other trade commitments related to health serv- ices is the danger of policy lock-in. Policy flexibility is needed by developing countries experimenting with options to improve their national health systems and outcomes. A far higher threshold of certainty is Policy Recommendations: National Impact Assessment of Trade in Health Services 7 Trade and Health in Asia: Challenges of Globalization 72 required before countries decide to make any trade commitments. National governments who would like to open their health sector to foreign providers should consider experimenting with liberalisation outside of GATS, or regional trade agreements, before making trade commitments. Such unilateral liberalisation al- lows WTO members to experiment with policies in a way that permits them to reverse course if the experi- ment produces unsatisfactory results. The questions to be considered when deciding to undertake trade commitments related to health services can be sum- marized as follows: 1. \u201cWill increased trade in these services lead to better health outcomes? 2. Will increased liberalization of trade (more compe- tition from foreign private health care companies) lead to better health outcomes? 3. Will making a GATS [or other trade] commitment in these sectors offer any additional advantage that will lead to better health outcomes? Of course, the implication here is clear: if the answer to any of these is negative, or in doubt, then a country should not make GATS [or other trade] commitments\u201d (Smith, Blouin and Drager, 2006, page 13). Lessons on Policy Coherence in Trade and Health In order to ensure that trade policies contribute to hu- man development, and more specifically to achieving national health objectives, national governments have to strive for policy coherence, i.e. to engage in a proc- ess where conflicts between different policy priori- ties are minimized and synergies maximised (Blouin, 2007a). \u201cA degree of incoherence may sometimes be inevitable, but trade-offs should be made transparent and appropriate measures taken to mitigate negative impacts\u201d (OECD, 2005, page 17). To achieve such co- herence, it is important that Ministries of health take a leadership role and work closely with Ministries of Trade or Finance to ensure that the \u201chealth-lens\u201d is well- represented and the health impacts of trade policy decisions well-understood. Institutional mechanisms to ensure such collaboration need to be created at the national level. These mechanisms may take more or less formal form, depending on the country, but the key point is to create incentive for collaboration, and with time, build trust among actors which have very different perspectives and views on this topic. One preliminary step to build trust is to design opportuni- ties for dialogue and joint fact-finding between trade and health officials at the national, regional and glo- bal level. Such exercise does not result in actors shar- ing the same views, but it can clarify the trade-offs that are at stake and the potential policy responses to minimize negative health impacts.

Copyright\u00a92005 United Nations Development Programme Democratic Governance Practice Team UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok http://regionalcentrebangkok.undp.or.th UN Service Building Rajdamnern Nok Avenue Bangkok 10200 Thailand ISBN: 974-93632-0-5 iii Foreword For more than four decades, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been a leading provider of technical advice in Public Administration and Civil Service Reform, with 90 Country Offices reporting activities in this area in 2004/5. The recent focus on achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) calls for renewed interest in the role of the State and for increased attention to the quality of public sector management, and emphasizes the need for an effective and efficient public administration that is responsive, transparent and accountable, capable of providing quality services to the population and ensuring the broad participation of citizens in decision-making. A study of UNDP\u2019s governance work in the region, undertaken by the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific (RBAP) in October 2003, indicated that other agencies, particularly the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), were becoming increasingly involved in areas where UNDP previously enjoyed an advantage. Public Administration Reform (PAR) was one such area. In 1999, 11 UNDP Country Offices in the region reported activities grouped under \u201cPromotion of an efficient and accountable public sector\u201d, while in 2003 that number had decreased to eight. Further, with only one PAR proposal from the region submitted to the Thematic Trust Fund in 2003, and no PAR proposals submitted in 2004, there were indications that UNDP was gradually shifting its focus to more recently popularized service lines such as Decentralization and Local Governance, Access to Justice, and Human Rights. In 2005,by contrast,five out of the 18 expressions of interest for the Thematic Trust Fund in the Asia-Pacific region were in the area of PAR and anti-corruption, while three others were closely related to this service line. Several of the expressions of interest in the area of decentralization also contained elements of PAR. Further, in several countries where UNDP had pulled out of PAR, governments have now made requests for renewed UNDP support in this area (e.g.,Bangladesh,Bhutan,Mongolia,the Philippines and Sri Lanka). This renewed interest reflects a change in approach with PAR now being addressed from the new entry points of accountability, transparency and performance management. Further impetus for reform and improvement to public administration will be provided by the implementation of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which, once ratified by the required number of countries, will require substantive donor inputs and support. These trends call for a more in-depth analysis of PAR experiences in the region,and of UNDP\u2019s involvement in national PAR programmes in particular,in order to understand UNDP\u2019s contribution to this large area of demand, and to assist UNDP in making well-informed decisions on the allocation of regional and domestic advisory services and resources to the PAR service line. This regional study is a follow-up to the RBAP survey on governance in the region, and aims to: i) increase our knowledge and understanding of PAR in the Asia-Pacific; ii) address trends and challenges in PAR; and iii) identify how UNDP can reflect and respond to these changes. The study is not meant to be an in-depth evaluation of UNDP\u2019s projects and activities in the area of PAR. Such an evaluation would involve impact assessments which are not feasible within the scope of this report. iv This study was commissioned by the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB),with financial support from the Bureau for Development Policy.The study was conducted by Prof. Mark Turner from the University of Canberra (Australia) in collaboration with Patrick Keuleers (Policy advisor on PAR, Governance Practice team, RCB). Research support was provided by Nils Taxell (Research officer, Governance Practice Team, RCB), Seema Joshi (Research Consultant), and Kullawan Arphasrirat(Practice Team Assistant, Governance Practice Team RCB).

In the present day, in the Asia-Pacific it is now de rigueur for all countries to have a programme of public sector reform and many of these programmes have substantial PAR components. The importance of PAR in developing countries was first recognized by the United Nations (UN) in 1951 with the establishment of a Special Committee on Public Administration Problems. Newly independent countries such as India, Malaysia and the Philippines, wanted to establish administrative arrangements which would facilitate national development and sought technical assistance in public administration. A decade later, the demand had increased to such a degree that the UN published A Handbook of Public Administration to guide reforms. The publication not only provided a blueprint for reform, it also emphasized that \u201cadministrative improvement is the sine qua non in the implementation of programmes of national development\u201d (UN 1961, 1). Some of the Handbook\u2019s observations still retain relevance over four decades later (see Box 1). Building on the past 1 Box 1: Relevant or redundant? The UN\u2019s view of PAR from the past The increase in the variety, number and complexity of functions that have to be performed by the modern State has resulted in an administrative lag. A serious imbalance exists between aspirations and performance, between the needs to be met and the adequacy of the administrative machinery to carry them out. This imbalance constitutes a major obstacle to national development. To meet even a part of its growing responsibilities, the modern service State must develop the administrative capacity to implement its programmes of economic and social progress. Public administration is the machinery used by the service State to place itself in a position to make plans and programmes that can be carried out,and to carry out the plans and programmes it has made.To an ever-increasing degree, the effective utilization of national resources depends on the sound economic and social programmes, whose success in turn depends upon an effective public service. To build a good administration is a long and painful task. Quick and easy results are not to be expected. Even for advanced countries with a long history of administrative progress the task was not easy, nor is it ever finished. For the developing countries, where sudden demands on government are often greatest, the task of administrative improvement presents special problems whose solution requires a new sense of direction and a determination to overcome many obstacles. Administrative reform requires a high standard of leadership, sustained and continuous attention and a sizable commitment in terms of men, money and material. United Nations (1961).A Handbook of Public Administration, New York: United Nations. While the importance of public administration was championed in some development agencies and by some academics, it did not assume a central position in the development discourse or in aid funding. Getting policies right, building infrastructure, industrialization and boosting agricultural productivity were seen as higher priorities. However, the disappointments of development in the 1980s led to a rethink of the significance of public administration in the development process. In 1983, the World Bank in its annual World Development Report asserted the importance of public administration for development.Efficient and effective public administration was seen to be an essential component of development success. Studies of so-called economic \u2018miracles\u2019 in countries such as Japan, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), Singapore and Taiwan found good public administration to be a contributory factor (World Bank 1993). It helped to fashion, and was simultaneously part of, the enabling environment for economic growth and led directly to the improvement of human welfare. PAR received another boost with the vigorous promotion of \u2018good governance\u2019 by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and bilateral donors. Public administration and its reform featured in all definitions of good governance. In its 1997 publication, Good Governance and Sustainable Human Development, UNDP identified governance as the means for promoting human development and public administration as one of the three \u2018legs\u2019 of governance. The others were political and economic governance. Heavy responsibilities were placed on the administrative leg, including responsibility for the provision of effective and accountable public services and contributing to an enabling environment for sustainable human development (UNDP 1997). The need to remedy public sector deficiencies was amplified with the adoption of the UN Millennium Declaration, calling for additional efforts to create the capacity to plan and steer the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and related targets. Public administration is currently one of the seven service lines within UNDP\u2019s democratic governance practice and one of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a295df5d-d435-4919-bd5c-0877e92b70b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a295df5d-d435-4919-bd5c-0877e92b70b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e493e2310c02deaaa790d642c0dcd2a6d78784c7eb9acfb9240db5271c57a20"}}, "hash": "7e493e2310c02deaaa790d642c0dcd2a6d78784c7eb9acfb9240db5271c57a20", "text": "the sub-goals in the new strategic results framework in the Multi-Year Funding Framework 2004-2007. Affirmation of the importance of good governance has been provided by Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, who has emphasized that, \u201cgood governance [of which PAR is an important component] is perhaps the single most important factor in eradicating poverty and promoting development\u201d (UNDP 2001). The importance of a well-performing public administration was also reiterated in General Assembly Resolution 57/277 Public Administration and Development, which states that, \u201can efficient, accountable, effective and transparent public administration, at both the national and international levels, has a key role to play in the implementation of internationally agreed goals, including the MDGs\u201d. UNDP has further noted that, \u201can efficient, responsive, transparent and accountable public administration is not only of paramount importance for the proper functioning of a nation; it is also one of the main vehicles through which the relationship between the State and civil society and the private sector is realized and the basic means through which government strategies to achieve the MDGs can be implemented\u201d (UNDP, Public Administration Reform Practice Note). 2 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific As a first step in describing and analysing PAR experiences in the Asia-Pacific it is necessary to consider what is meant by public administration, what initiatives are covered by the concept of PAR and what contingencies influence the design and implementation of PAR. Public administration refers to (UNDP PAR Practice Note): \ufffd The aggregate machinery (policies, rules, procedures, systems, organizational structures, personnel, etc.) funded by the state budget and in charge of the management and direction of the affairs of the executive government, and its inter- action with other stakeholders in the state, society and external environment. \ufffd The management and implementation of the whole set of government activities dealing with the implementation of laws, regulations and decisions of government and the management related to the provision of public services. Within the broad framework of democratic governance, the public administration component thus embodies the aspects most closely associated with the functions of \u2018government\u2019. According to the UNDP Practice Note,PAR relates to a government-initiated process to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, responsiveness, transparency and accountability of specific components of the public sector. PAR can be comprehensive and include process changes in areas such as organizational structures, decentralization, personnel management, public finance, results-based management, and regulatory reforms. It can also refer to targeted reforms such as the revision of civil service statutes. A simple but useful definition of PAR is that it, \u201cconsists of deliberate changes to the structures and processes of public sector organizations with the objective of getting them (in some sense) to run better\u201d (Pollitt and Bouckaert 2000, 8). At first sight this definition appears vague,using the ambiguous term \u2018to run better\u2019. As indeterminate as it seems however, the phrase begs the important question of better for whom? A government bureaucrat\u2019s perspective may differ substantially from that of a poor person and from that of UNDP, the World Bank or a bilateral donor. This definition forces us to consider the views of multiple stakeholders rather than simply asserting that there is a single view of what should be considered improvements in public administration. For UNDP, the concept of \u2018better\u2019 requires consideration of the wishes of the recipient government, as well as the quality and quantity of service delivery in the eyes of citizens.There is also the strong imperative to demonstrate progress towards the achievement of the MDGs. Simply embarking on a reform programme does not guarantee success. Developing countries are full of PAR failures and indifferent results (see Box 2). Thus, our basic definition requires some further qualifications to reflect the practical realities of public sector reform in the Asia-Pacific and other regions of the world. A range of these considerations are listed below: \ufffd Reforms are based on sets of ideas or ideologies that make assumptions about results. There are varying degrees of uncertainty about whether particular actions will work, especially in uncertain environments. Thus, \u201csuccess in getting things to run better should be tested rather than assumed\u201d(ibid., 17); 3 2 What is public administration reform in the Asia-Pacific \ufffd There are multiple actors engaged in trying to shape public sector reform both in policy formulation and implementation. They may have different ideas about the design, implementation, and desired results of the reform; \ufffd There is likely to be resistance to PAR by those who feel threatened. Workers who fear redundancy or departmental heads that see their sphere of influence contracting may oppose reform. There may also be leaders and people", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cffdad7-4a41-40df-a5c9-c5babd4e8506": {"__data__": {"id_": "0cffdad7-4a41-40df-a5c9-c5babd4e8506", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2ad9001fec45d9b213c21ff9e3212f7b1a9dfdd4aa83c5bad762e5362a76824"}}, "hash": "f2ad9001fec45d9b213c21ff9e3212f7b1a9dfdd4aa83c5bad762e5362a76824", "text": "in positions of authority who perceive no personal gain from good governance; \ufffd Local priorities, preferences and environmental conditions mean that there is no one template for reform. What is feasible and acceptable will depend on the specifics of a situation. Unfortunately, while there appears to be consensus that there is no \u2018one-size fits all\u2019 remedy for PAR; inappropriate initiatives are still imported into Asia-Pacific countries; \ufffd Reforms may vary in scope from system- wide to individual agencies, from improving existing practices to introducing entirely new processes, and from minor adaptations of guiding ideas to the import of new sets of ideas. Each type of reform carries risks; the degree of risk varies with the scope of the reform, the commitment of government to reform, and the capacity of government to implement it; \ufffd Administrative improvement may mean different things to different stakeholders, which will be reflected in the politics of administrative reform; \ufffd The introduction and maintenance of reform programmes requires legitimization. Acceptance and support of PAR is not automatic. In extreme cases, PAR may be perceived as a foreign imposition, in others as something that benefits elite officials. It will not have immediate popular appeal unless immediate benefits are evident; and most successful reform programmes are long-term and incremental; and \ufffd Across the Asia-Pacific there is widespread familiarity with the international vocabulary of PAR. Officials and academics regularly employ terms such as \u2018re-engineering\u2019, \u2018decentralization\u2019, \u2018managerialism\u2019, even \u2018reform\u2019. These terms have been used and discussed for many years in forums provided by the Eastern Regional Association for Public Administration (EROPA), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the annual meeting of heads of public services in the South Pacific. Consultants and academics are also disseminators of the international vocabulary of public administration. Yet, experience indicates that the terms used do not always have the same meaning for everybody (e.g., the concept of decentralization has a different political meaning in the Philippines than it does in Lao PDR or Viet Nam). Further, this discourse of reform may be employed to indicate such things as dynamism, improvement and progress when reality may suggest otherwise \u2013 that administrative reform can be more rhetoric than substance. 4 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific Box 2: Successes and failures in PAR Polidano identifies three important conditions for PAR success: \ufffd Keeping the scope of change narrow; \ufffd Limiting the role of aid donors; and \ufffd Giving reform firm leadership while allowing for line management discretion. He identifies a number of reasons for PAR failures including: \ufffd Over-ambition; \ufffd Lack of local ownership; \ufffd Little political commitment to reform; \ufffd Weak coordination of reform; \ufffd Failure of reforms to connect central offices with street-level operations; and \ufffd No accountability for results of reforms. Asia-Pacific countries have experienced these problems to a greater or lesser degree. Polidano,C.(2001) \u2018Why civil service reforms fail\u2019,Public Management Review 3(3) 345-62. 5 3 What is notable today in the Asia-Pacific is the degree of urgency that has been attached to administrative reform. It is not a new phenomenon, yet increasingly over the last decade many stakeholders in the development process have awarded greater importance to PAR than in the past. The most notable proponents of the centrality of public administration in development are international donors and recipient governments. However, private sector organizations and civil society groups have also joined the chorus demanding PAR.The result has been that all countries in the Asia-Pacific are engaged in activities that can be considered to fall under the umbrella of PAR. The reasons for this sense of urgency vary. Moreover, it is often the case that several reasons combine to provide the impetus for PAR. The first reason is that governments in countries such as Malaysia and Thailand make clear and explicit links between the need for PAR and international competitiveness. They consider the administrative apparatus of the State as an enabling device for economic development: As witnessed in a number of countries in the Asian region, an established public administration has been vital to economic development. The enormous economic success of the East Asian New Industrial Countries is not simply the triumph of the market but is also the result of strong state institutions considered the main instruments of effective governance.1 Governments also appreciate that inefficient and sometimes corrupt public administration can have an adverse impact on economic development. Even in poor countries such as Bhutan, Cambodia and Lao PDR there is recognition that in a globalizing world it is necessary for the national system of public administration to support and encourage economic development.

Efficient and effective administration is causally related to the achievement of improved welfare indicators such as in education and health.The rationale is that with better-trained officials, greater decentralization of decision-making, more transparent and simpler administrative processes, and more attractive career structures the organization and delivery of services can be greatly improved. The focus on sustainable human development is linked to the MDGs for development, especially the primary goal \u2013 the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger. Further, the prospects for achieving the other MDGs, such as universal primary education and combating HIV/AIDS,malaria and other diseases also relies in great part on more effective and efficient public administration. Consequently, most of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) have (explicitly or implicitly) included PAR interventions in the range of measures that need to be taken to achieve stated poverty reduction targets.2 Further, while aid has so far targeted management performance in the public sector, there is now a greater focus on strengthening the capacities for policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, with the availability of universally agreed MDG indicators,the orientation of public sector performance is now shifting from an input-orientation to an outcome and impact approach. 1 UNDP Keynote speech at the National Conference on Public Administration Reform and the MDGs,Manila 18 October 2004. 2 E.g.,Mongolia\u2019s Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy aims not only to reduce unemployment,but also to achieve public sector management reforms and improvements in the access and delivery of basic services.The Strategy includes specific steps required to strengthen civil service efficiency,accountability and capacity over the medium term. The growing importance of public administration reform in the Asia-Pacific 6 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific A third factor promoting the urgency of public administration is the need to address the breakdown or weakening of administrative systems. In the Solomon Islands, the bureaucracy\u2019s capacity to deliver services has been undermined by a combination of inter-ethnic conflict, the State\u2019s incapacity to maintain law and order, corruption, and state bankruptcy. In Papua New Guinea, there has been an incremental decline in the capability of the bureaucracy to perform functions to the required levels. In the post-conflict situations of Afghanistan, Cambodia and Timor-Leste it has been necessary to rebuild bureaucracies out of the ruins of war. In all these cases, properly functioning bureaucracies are required as essential foundations for the security of the population and the pursuit of socio-economic development. In all three countries, the issue of wages and incentives is one of the main challenges faced in building up a national civil service. Another factor has been democratization. The concept of democratic governance has been vigorously promoted by UNDP and its partners and today,\u201cover 120 nations with two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, are engaged in building democratic societies\u201d.3 Public administration\u2019s role in this democratic revolution is to become responsive, transparent and accountable. This often requires a major reorientation of bureaucratic culture and the bureaucracy\u2019s relations with society. Public administrative reform in a context of democratization entails popular empowerment and the recognition of human rights. A range of participatory instruments ensures popular involvement with governance. Often, democratization is associated with political decentralization and thus necessitates consideration of inter-governmental relations and changed human resource management (HRM) practices. Both are of central concern to PAR. Democratic practices can also have a positive impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of administration. This occurs especially as a result of concern over popular accountability, access to information and involvement in decision-making. Lastly,and most importantly,the introduction of good governance as the new development paradigm has had important implications on the role of the public administration, which is now a key player within a governance network of public, private and civil society stakeholders. In addition to the traditional efficiency requirements, core principles like responsiveness, accountability, transparency, predictability and participation have now become core values on which public performance is measured. 3 UNDP,Fast Facts: UNDP\u2019s Support to Democratic Governance (www.undp.org). 7 Diversity is the leading characteristic of the Asia-Pacific.The region\u2019s countries have features and environments that vary enormously.

At one extreme are China and India with populations in excess of one billion people;at the other end are the microstates of the South Pacific such as Niue with just 2,100 people, Tuvalu with 10,500 or Samoa with 178,000. There are land-locked and mountainous countries such as Bhutan and Nepal, as well as South Pacific territories such as Kiribati that are comprised entirely of small atolls barely rising above sea-level. Population density can also vary widely, from 273 persons per square kilometre in the Philippines to 2 persons per square kilometre in Mongolia. Population growth is generally slowing across the region, and expected to dip below 2.0 percent in most Southeast and East Asian countries in the period 2001-2015. In some cases, such as China and Thailand, the growth rates are predicted to become less than one percent. In South Asia, the transitional economies of Southeast Asia,and the Pacific,the population growth rates are forecast to be higher, at 2 percent and over, but still represent a decline over the previous two decades5. The level of urbanization is another source of contrast. In rapidly industrializing China, 36.1 percent of the population were urban residents in 2001, with this figure forecast to rise to 49.5 percent in 2015, the equivalent an additional 117 million people. In Bhutan, urban areas accounted for only 7.4 percent of the population in 2001, and the proportion is only expected to rise to 11.6 percent in 2015. However, as the growth will be concentrated in the capital, Thimpu, it is still expected to place strain on scarce government resources. Health indicators show life expectancy to range from 73 years for Malaysia and 69.6 years for Fiji to only 54.3 years in Lao PDR and 57.4 years in Papua New Guinea. In war-ravaged Afghanistan, the figure is a dismal 43 years. Mortality rates for children under 5 years show massive variation from Malaysia with 8 deaths per thousand and Thailand with 28 compared to 107 in Pakistan and 138 in Cambodia. Health expenditure per capita also reveals different patterns, from US$ 345 per capita PPP (purchasing power parity) in Malaysia and US$ 263 in Maldives to only US$ 63 in Nepal and US$ 58 in Bangladesh. Adult literacy is another area of considerable contrast. Many East and Southeast Asian and South Pacific countries have high rates of adult literacy, such as 98.7 percent in Samoa and 90.3 percent in Viet Nam, while some South Asian countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan have poor records, all with rates of less than 50 percent adult literacy, and as low as 41 percent in Pakistan and Nepal.Completion of primary education can be as low as 59 percent in Pakistan and as high as 100 percent in Viet Nam. Pupil-teacher ratios in primary education ranges from 53 in Cambodia to 18 in Malaysia.

Economic growth records provide stark contrasts. China leads the way with GDP per capita increasing by an average of 8.6 percent each year between 1990 and 2002. Other high performing growth economies include Viet Nam with 5.9 percent and India with 4 percent economic growth. By contrast, very low annual growth rates over this period can be found in Pakistan with 1.1 percent, Papua New Guinea with 0.5 percent, Mongolia with 0.2 percent and Vanuatu with -0.1. Aid dependency can also characterize poor countries, especially those with small populations. Official Development Assistance (ODA) per capita to Lao PDR in 2003 was US$ 53, in Maldives it was US$ 88.9 (2002) and in Samoa it was a massive US$ 214.2 (2002). By contrast, the Philippines received US$ 9 per capita, Indonesia US$ 8, and China only received US$ 1. There are also contrasting political arrangements. In transitional economies such as China, Lao PDR and Viet Nam there is one-party rule and little or no commitment to popular democratic elections. Authoritarian regimes still govern in Myanmar and Pakistan. Totalitarianism is found in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. Traditional monarchies rule in Bhutan6 and Brunei.All other countries in the region have some form of democratically elected government. However, there are considerable variations in the institutions and practice of democracy. In Malaysia, there is one-party domination and policy consistency while in the Philippines, shifting coalitions of congressional representatives make policy-making a tortuous business. In Indonesia, democracy is recent and the military still influences political decision- making. Military coups have been mounted in countries as diverse as Fiji, Philippines, Pakistan and Thailand. There are ethnic separatist movements, communist insurgencies or fragile truces in Indonesia, Nepal7, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, while sporadic armed hostilities continue in Afghanistan. Thailand is also facing politico-religious tensions in the southern provinces. Political decentralization has been introduced in some countries. The Philippines commenced democratic decentralization in the 1990s; Indonesia has now delegated most service delivery functions to elected regional governments while elected Commune Councils have been introduced recently in Cambodia. There are equity differences between countries in the Asia-Pacific. In Malaysia and Thailand, less than 2 percent of the population lives on less than US$ 1 per day.Yet,in many Low Income and Lower Middle Income countries the figures are considerably higher. In Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Lao PDR, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines figures range from 14.6 \u2013 37.7 percent. Many Southeast Asian countries are ranked higher on the Gender Development Index than on the overall Human Development Index. Female life expectancy is longer than males in these countries while there are high rates of female representation in the professional and technical occupations \u2013 62 percent in the Philippines and 45 percent in Malaysia. South Asia has less favourable figures for women. In Nepal and Pakistan, life expectancy for women is marginally lower than for men, while adult literacy figures reveal female rates to be only 53 percent and 43 percent of the male rate. China also has female literacy rates that are significantly lower than those for males. Finally, it is also important to mention that, out of today\u2019s 50 Least Developed Countries (LDCs), 6 The draft Constitution that was submitted to the Bhutanese people in March 2005 establishes a multi-party system.The proposal is that representation in the National assembly shall be by two parties established through a primary round of election in which all registered parties may participate (http://www.bhutantimes.com/draft_constitution.pdf). 7 On 1st February 2005,H.M.the King dismissed the Prime Minister and his Government,and assumed full executive powers.At the same time, a 6-month state of emergency was declared,and a number of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Constitution were suspended. 9 14 are from the Asia-Pacific region8.

The challenge of public administration reform in the Asia-Pacific 8 In 1971,there were six LDCs from Asia (Afghanistan,Bhutan,Lao PDR,Maldives,Nepal,and Samoa).Bangladesh joined in 1975,Vanuatu in 1985, Kiribati and Tuvalu in 1986,Myanmar in 1987.Cambodia and Solomon Islands joined in 1991.Timor-Leste joined in 2004.Maldives was to graduate from the ranks in 2005,but these plans were curtailed by the devastating impact of the Indian Ocean Tsunami on the country\u2019s economy (so far only Botswana,who graduated in 1984,has graduated since 1971). 11 5 This section provides brief accounts of the reform experiences of individual developing countries in the Asia-Pacific where UNDP has a Country Office, followed by an analysis of current trends and challenges from which this study then draws conclusions regarding UNDP\u2019s role and positioning in the area of PAR in the region. The country reviews are based on information obtained from web-based research, UNDP reports, and additional information obtained from Country Offices. However, there are provisions to this review. First, not all countries in the region are included. This is either due to lack of information on PAR (DPR Korea and Myanmar) or because countries are classified as High Income according to the World Bank.9 Second, countries are dealt with in greater or lesser detail depending on information, the lessons of their reform programmes, and the level of PAR inputs from UNDP. Tables showing details of UNDP involvement in PAR in particular countries can be found in Appendices 1 and 2 at the end of this report. Third, all cases are only snapshots of what is often a complex business comprising multiple activities over many years. Fourth, in practice there are no precise boundaries delineating PAR from other related activities such as territorial decentralization, partnerships with the private sector and civil society, privatization, and anti-corruption. These initiatives will be noted where they are considered to have a significant interrelationship with core concerns of PAR. Country experiences in public administration reform 9 Not included because of High Income status are Brunei,Japan,the Republic of Korea and Singapore. 5.1 Northeast and Southeast Asia Cambodia China Indonesia Lao PDR Malaysia Mongolia Philippines Thailand Viet Nam 5.2 South Pacific Papua New Guinea South Pacific Island Countries Timor-Leste 5.3 South Asia Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan India Maldives Nepal Pakistan Sri Lanka 12 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific Public administration and its reform In 1979,the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime was overthrown in Cambodia. Its legacy was a nation in ruins. Agricultural production could not sustain the population, poverty was ubiquitous, infrastructure was at best rudimentary, there was no education system, and health indicators were dismal. Further, the infrastructure necessary for a modern state had been completely destroyed and there were few educated people to staff the new institutions. Reconstituting the state bureaucracy was a high priority for the Cambodian Government as it struggled to assert control over its territory and provide some basic services to the predominantly rural population. However, \u201cthe reality of a State with a functioning modern public administration [being] only 10 years or so old\u201d (UNDP 2003b, 2) is that progress has been slow.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "644d094d-e192-49df-85cd-66cb44369bca": {"__data__": {"id_": "644d094d-e192-49df-85cd-66cb44369bca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "803b3ae75627debbbe1e7aecaf98045b1d93e00cd792f5406514a996842be198"}, "2": {"node_id": "905fb789-604e-4bce-9b3f-5d1fda804553", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "305e660d308f8c2e0d7745f94211c6b6a211672cb921baf85cf99843e4ba50ac"}}, "hash": "91fcdb476c806f292852c1e6eee79e528a5d2b54920a9360b1832b683bf76716", "text": "The adverse circumstances under which public administration evolved have resulted in a number of problems in the bureaucracy.There is a shortage of adequately qualified public servants, accountability and transparency are poorly developed, corruption is widespread, there is a weak rule of law,popular participation is negligible, financial flows are unpredictable, and public service salaries are extremely low.

The Cambodian Government has recognized the importance of a well-functioning system of public administration for national development. As in neighbouring Lao PDR, it has taken some time to reach this conclusion and to determine a comprehensive policy for administrative reform. This policy has been set down in the National Programme for Administrative Reform (NPAR 1999) under the direction of the Council for Administrative Reform (CAR), a high-level group located in the Council of Ministers. NPAR has been absorbed under a broad Governance Action Plan (GAP 2001), which straddles many areas of PAR. The GAP comprises crosscutting areas of reform that are considered crucial for Cambodia\u2019s development: \ufffd Judicial and legal reform aiming at establishing basic rules of fairness and predictability; \ufffd Public finance aiming at providing the financial underpinnings through which all governmental activities must take place; \ufffd Public administration aiming at increasing the effectiveness of government and employees in carrying out public programmes; \ufffd Anti-corruption aiming at establishing the framework of behavioural rules that set standards of probity in economic, social and political life; and \ufffd Gender equity, which is critical to the Government\u2019s objectives of poverty alleviation and social justice. The NPAR delineates four specific reform areas, some of which overlap or reiterate the GAP provisions: \ufffd Strengthening the rule of law; \ufffd Good governance for service provision; \ufffd Enhancing the civil service management; and \ufffd Management of changes. These four areas of reform are being implemented in three phases: \ufffd Phase 1: preliminary and priority activities which strengthen the foundation of the public sector; \ufffd Phase 2: institutional restructuring, reorganization and corresponding staff deployment; and \ufffd Phase 3: rationalization of structures and procedures at all levels of government, and development of competence, 5.1 Northeast and Southeast Asia Cambodia 13 Country experiences in public administration reform: Northeast and Southeast Asia responsibility and efficiency of civil servants through comprehensive capacity building. Phase 1 has been completed and has involved such things as strengthening the CAR Secretariat. Attention has now moved to Phases 2 and 3, which involve far more substantial changes and as a result will face much greater challenges as plans are devised and implementation pursued to move the Government towards achieving its PAR policy goals. To accelerate the PAR process, UNDP (2002a) has suggested the need for greater openness and information exchange among stakeholders; establishing a \u2018win-win\u2019 environment for stakeholders; greater involvement of domestic stakeholders outside the state;greater innovation in public administration; improved communication skills in the public service leading to better understanding of PAR; and increased use of modern management tools. There have been some notable advances in PAR recently. First, the Government has taken steps to address one of the fundamental problems of Cambodian public administration \u2013 low pay.The average monthly pay has been raised from US$ 19.5 in October 2001 to US$ 28.1 in May 2002 with the objective of eventually achieving average salaries of US$ 51.5 in 2006.Second,the Government has embarked on a programme of decentralization involving both devolution to democratically elected Commune Councils and deconcentration of authority in service delivery ministries from central headquarters to their offices in the provinces. Third, the concept of Priority Mission Groups (PMGs) has been suggested as a way to address bottlenecks and accelerate reforms by establishing teams of government officials who will receive financial incentives for demonstrated success in designing and implementing reforms. Fourth, the SEILA (literally \u2018foundation stone\u2019) initiative has used a pilot project to demonstrate how decentralized development planning, financing and implementation can be upscaled to build national policies and systems for decentralization and deconcentration. Despite these gains, the challenges facing reform remain considerable and the real gains in terms of increased and improved service delivery are only modest.There is some concern that PAR is donor-driven, that there appears to be a drain of skilled personnel from the public service to donor-funded projects or even non- governmental organizations (NGOs), and that results are only attained by making extra payments to participants working on reform initiatives. The new Government, which took charge after the prolonged hiatus that followed the July 2003 elections, announced its Rectangular Strategy reflecting \u201cunanimous agreement\u201d between the coalition partners. The strategy is intended to, \u201cguide the implementation of the agenda of the Royal Government during its current term in office\u201d. The new strategy puts at the forefront of the agenda four key goals: economic growth, employment generation, improved governance, and accelerated implementation of reforms in all sectors, \u201cto reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development\u201d.

The strategy singles out some reforms that are essential to success; with PAR one of them. Consequently, in November 2004, the Government finalized its National Programme for Public Administration Reform \u2013 Serving People Better. The aim is fora transformed public administration, making it closer to the people, more effective, accountable and transparent. The new PAR programme adopts a four- pronged approach: 1. Improving service delivery; 2. Enhancing pay and employment conditions (with initiatives to pilot electronic bank transfers for civil service salaries); 3. Developing the capacity of people and institutions; and 4. Promoting information and communications technologies (ICTs). UNDP assistance to PAR To support the overall efforts of the Royal Government of Cambodia to promote good governance and create an environment for peace, justice and development, UNDP Cambodia has been actively involved with PAR since 1994. In direct support of the NPAR, UNDP has provided assistance to the CAR to: \ufffd Strengthen the capacities of the CAR Secretariat to deal effectively with strategic 14 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific planning, policy development, donor coordination, national consensus-building and strategic management of the NPAR programme; \ufffd Facilitate the implementation of priority reform initiatives and sub-programmes as well as the development of implementation plans; and \ufffd Support the conceptualization and preparation of the PMG scheme to accelerate reforms and increase the efficiency of public service delivery in priority areas of government administration. The scheme provides financial incentives to teams of government officials based on their performance in predefined key sectors of reform. In this respect, a number of noteworthy results have been achieved in support of the consolidation of the public service foundations, such as establishing a new classification and remuneration regime, preparing the PMG scheme, HRM and development, preparation of tools for organization of work within the administration, and capacity development of the CAR Secretariat. Based on a productive partnership with the Government as well as other donors, UNDP is playing a leading policy definitional role in the area of decentralization, and in supporting the Government's SEILA programme as the successor to the CARERE (Cambodia Area Rehabilitation and Regeneration) projects implemented from 1991-2000. The SEILA programme is a national effort to alleviate poverty through improved local governance and decentralized development planning. It is the collective responsibility of an inter- ministerial body, the SEILA Task Force, and has included a gradually increasing number of provinces since 1996, reaching full national coverage in 2003. UNDP is also contributing to improving participatory local governance for socio-economic development and poverty alleviation in Cambodia through the development and implementation of policies and strategies that enhance the capacities of local stakeholders. Most of UNDP\u2019s other areas of intervention also have a bearing on the support to public administrative and civil service reform and vice versa. This includes specifically, support to strengthen both legislative and judicial institutions, in addition to other forms of reform for the executive institutions such as macroeconomic and fiscal policy reform. Empowering the other branches of government is essential to make Cambodia\u2019s executive institutions more transparent and accountable while creating a new culture of checks and balances that is based on rights and obligations. Further to the completion of its support for capacity development in PAR in September 2003, UNDP Cambodia is currently reviewing its portfolio to respond to the recent developments in the area of PAR (National Programme for Public Administration Reform \u2013 Serving People Better). While civil service reform will remain an important area of support, UNDP\u2019s focus will increasingly shift towards measures that contribute to the strengthening of accountability and integrity in public office. Recent efforts have focused on assisting the Royal Government of Cambodia with the development of an anti-corruption strategy and support to the refinement of the draft anti-corruption law and related options for institutional strengthening. Public administration and its reform PAR has been recognized as a significant component of China\u2019s modernization plans since the country initiated the market-oriented socio-economic reforms drive in 1978.The most fundamental change has been the attainment of greater independence of government in decision-making and operation from the Chinese Communist Party, which has facilitated a number of important administrative reforms overseen by the State Commission Office for Public Sector Reform (SCOPSR). Structural changes have focused on,\u201cenhanced comprehensive management function of government, strengthened policy-making and consulting departments, and social management and service departments, while weakening the micro-management focus of government and merging or reducing the number of special economic management departments\u201d (Wu 2001, 1).

The structural changes have resulted in streamlining in administrative procedures, downsizing in the number of both government departments and personnel, and improvement of cost- effectiveness and efficiency in delivering public services to the public, including the poor. In 1988, party committees relinquished some of their personnel functions with the establishment of the Ministry of Personnel which, since 1993, has been creating, \u201ca public servant system with Chinese characteristics\u201d (ibid., 3). This has included attempts to institute more meritocratic recruitment and promotion processes and more relevant training. A policy of decentralization has meant to relocate service implementation to the administrative levels of city, county and township. Yet, there were times in the 1990s, when the central government attempted to re-establish greater control over local governments.There have also been attempts to increase the responsiveness of governments to popular needs and demands and to increase transparency in the wake of growing awareness of the importance of outputs. Autonomous organizations have assumed a greater role in responding to emerging social needs, and in public welfare and community functions.These are sometimes described as civil society organizations (CSO) or more accurately as government-organized non-governmental organizations. While China\u2019s public administration system is considered as \u2018functioning relatively well\u2019 there are weaknesses and the reform programme still has many items on the agenda. Public participation in policy-making and consultation with the people are still relatively weak in the bureaucratic culture. Many government officials have difficulty in understanding the importance of listening and responding to popular demands, especially from the poor and disadvantaged in society. There is also the popular expectation that government makes decisions and takes care of people\u2019s lives. Transparency and access to information have improved, but are limited, while the arbitrary use of authority remains a problem. Corruption remains a major challenge to clean and transparent government, and bureaucratic bottlenecks still persist, such as in coordination across government on inter-sectoral matters or with overlapping jurisdictions. Red tape still plagues many procedures involving government-citizen or government-business interactions. UNDP assistance to PAR UNDP has been active in supporting China\u2019s PAR for more than a decade.The first phase of its PAR support began in 1991, focusing largely on training, capacity building in the Office of the State Commission for Public Service and Establishment Administration (mainly through computerization, the development of an information centre and the development of capacity for consulting services) and the drafting of administrative laws and regulations. The project achieved important results and met most of its objectives. The second phase of the PAR project began in 1997.The main objectives were to contribute to the design and formulation of China\u2019s master plan for PAR. The master plan was prepared to guide the further strengthening of the capacity of government agencies (planning, finance, investment, etc.) to manage the economy; continuing the separation of the functions of government and enterprises,and the setting up and managing an integrated social security system.The other objectives of the project were to contribute to the design and formulation of plans in the administration of social security, and to contribute to the development of capacities to implement the latter reforms in some pilot sites. The project was rated very successful, although the evaluation report also concluded that China would have pursued its reform plans regardless of whether donor support was provided to the reform programme or not. The third phase of the project is ongoing and aims to support the SCOPSR, in partnership with key ministries and six pilot provinces/municipalities, in their reform efforts in four policy areas, i.e. restructuring the central administrative system to meet World Trade Organization (WTO) requirements; readjusting government structures and functions in the Western Region; reform of management of non-profit and social intermediary public institutions; and strengthening market supervision and administrative law enforcement. In addition, there is to be work on extending and improving linkages between the SCOPSR central information system and 12 counties 16 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific in six pilot provinces/municipalities. Four consultation reports will be prepared and submitted to the central government for the formulation of the new master plan for administrative reform. The results of the project will help the SCOPSR to support better governance to enhance reforms and development as well as to assist China in reducing regional disparities and meeting global challenges; some tentative results had already been achieved by the end of 2004.

As China is gradually moving towards a market economy,the need for greater transparency and integrity in government becomes increasingly acute. The Chinese Government is setting up a comprehensive integrity system that emphasizes standard-setting, prevention and education and targets root causes of corruption. As a close partner of the Government,UNDP has provided support to these national anti- corruption initiatives, and will continue to do so in the future. UNDP\u2019s Promoting Integrity in Governance project, which was launched in 2001, has helped government institutions develop codes of conduct, train anti-corruption personnel, and formulate their anti-corruption policies and legal frameworks. Public administration and its reform In the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, which affected Indonesia more severely than elsewhere, Indonesia has embarked upon a comprehensive democratization programme, known as Reformasi. The Reformasi agenda includes constitutional reform, strengthening of the legislature, independence and reform of the judiciary, electoral reform, PAR, political and administrative decentralization (including special autonomy packages in conflict prone areas), reform of the security and armed forces, as well as strengthening respect for essential civil liberties and human rights and strengthening the ethical basis for public affairs through counter-corruption measures. In addition to PAR itself, a number of other components touch directly on PAR such as decentralization, the strengthening of ethics and counter-corruption measures as well as strengthening respect for civil liberties including freer access to information. Others touch on PAR less directly, such as constitutional reform, strengthening of the legislature, electoral reform and judicial reform. There have been advances made in terms of opening up the civil service to public scrutiny, both at the official level through strengthening of the authority of the Parliament and through reporting by the now independent State Audit Authority, as well as informally through a free and open press and a general communal atmosphere conducive to frank discussion on matters of public concern. One of the earliest PAR successes was to begin breaking down the old system of \u2018mono-loyalty\u2019 by civil servants to the then Government party. This reform has been an important ingredient contributing to the conduct of genuinely democratic elections since the late 1990s by reducing partisan intervention by the Government into the electoral processes. The programme of decentralization has permitted a range of creative local initiatives to develop. These initiatives are taking hold in many areas and some are even becoming the new national standard. Local PAR brought forth by decentralization includes the introduction of double entry bookkeeping, performance- oriented budgeting, transparent tender procedures, fit and proper recruitment testing for government officials, regulations on public information sharing and transparency, regulation on public participation in planning and decision-making processes,service charters to improve service delivery, and reorganization of provincial administrations along the basis of output, not input, orientation. Despite these reforms much remains to be achieved. This is acknowledged at senior levels of government and by other officials, civil society, the private sector, as well as Indonesia\u2019s international development partners.Decades of personalized authoritarian rule has resulted in the creation of a complex set of opaque Indonesia loyalties that often have scant regard for the official administrative chains of command. Extraordinary non-transparency in matters such as the structure of civil service remuneration processes has created great inefficiencies in terms of the productivity of civil servants. The integrity of administrative processes has been severely compromised by an assortment of practices that might perhaps be described as the commodification of state authority. Practices such as job farming,collusion between tax officials and tax payers, overly cosy relationships between officials from state- owned enterprises and private enterprises and the officials who are charged with overseeing or regulating their activities, collusive arrangements that pervade the legal and judicial system, as well as newer forms of corruption such as those involving the newly empowered members of parliament, all represent key challenges to establishing an effective, coherent and democratic system for administering public affairs. Indonesia\u2019s remarkable development gains achieved in the decades before the financial crisis such as substantial reductions in poverty, massive increases in primary education enrolments, the provision of infrastructure and the creation of an environment that encouraged economic growth now appear to have occurred almost in spite of the administrative structures that emerged.

Collectively, these factors built an atmosphere of confidence that obscured the structural weaknesses outlined above. UNDP assistance to PAR UNDP has developed an extensive cooperative relationship with the Government of Indonesia to support its reform agenda. This has included coordinating international assistance to the elections of 1999 and the three sets of elections (parliamentary and two rounds of Presidential elections) in 2004. UNDP also established with the Government of Indonesia and the World Bank and ADB, the Partnership for Governance Reform in Indonesia. This not-for-profit civil law association brings together representatives from the Indonesian Government, civil society and the private sector with Indonesia\u2019s international development partners. Its focus is on transforming the agenda of Reformasi into concrete measures. Included in its wide agenda is PAR. The UNDP approach,as exemplified through the Partnership,is to accept that critical elements of a nation\u2018s political reform agenda, of which PAR is one key component, are matters of sovereign concern. Further, the reform process itself is not likely to be effective if left to a state institution to manage itself. Rather, a multi-stakeholder approach is seen as best able to push this process forward. The PAR approach to-date has been to exploit the momentum for decentralization and regional autonomy and combine this with a push for PAR locally. Among the interesting case studies are some that provided support to local government leaders who sought to ensure merit-determined leadership in key local government agencies through open and transparent recruitment processes. While this approach was at first seen as controversial, the benefits of it have become more accepted subsequently. The Partnership also worked with the mayor of Ambon, the scene of much sectarian violence, to reform the city\u2019s accounting processes. The results produced considerable \u2018savings\u2019 on expenditure that have subsequently been invested in social activities that have helped rebuild trust among community groups that had been in violent conflict. These local reforms have now become the standard for local government across Indonesia. The Partnership has also worked closely with the Governor and senior authorities in the Province of Yogyakarta to reform the regional civil service by transforming the traditional input focus to an output orientation. This has helped ease the process of right-sizing the skills mix and staffing requirements for the civil service in this region. With PAR now a high priority for the newly appointed Cabinet, the Partnership has commenced a programme of support with the Ministry for Administrative Reform that focuses on administrative reform directed at enhanced public service delivery. This will build upon the consultative process that has involved senior officials with the Ministry, as well as 17 Country experiences in public administration reform: Northeast and Southeast Asia representatives of civil society and the private sector and interested donors that the Partnership has facilitated for the past two years. Elsewhere, UNDP has been engaged in improving levels of responsiveness in the local civil service through a programme of working with elected local leaders. This has led to \u2018town hall\u2019type meetings in which senior local officials meet with local citizens to discuss planning priorities and programmes for the forthcoming year. Other initiatives include talkback radio programmes in which the Mayor takes calls, complaints, and suggestions from the public on a weekly basis and uses the feedback to improve services provided. Public administration and its reform In 1975, after more than 20 years of political turbulence, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic was established under the control of the Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party. The country had little infrastructure, was deeply divided, subject to an economic blockade from Thailand and a withdrawal of assistance from the United States, and had experienced an exodus of highly qualified public servants. In these adverse post-conflict conditions, the Government sought to impose a centrally planned and controlled socio-economic order. The results were disappointing, with organizational weakness and financial disorder characterizing public administration at all levels of government. Paradoxically, the centralized socialist system was in practice highly decentralized and only weakly held together. In 1986, the Government decided to abandon the centrally planned route to development and instead followed the market economy path already adopted by China and Viet Nam. Early experiences were of, \u201cweaknesses in the implementation of national policies, lack of norms and standards for minimum service delivery and shortage of technical and institutional capacities at the centre\u201d (Keuleers and Sibounheuang 1999, 206). At the Fifth Party Congress in 1991, the Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party determined to promote administrative renewal towards a more centralized, but still market-oriented, system of government.

Fiscal centralization was quickly implemented while line ministries also reasserted their authority over sub-national public officials and activities. UNDP was called in to assist in this administrative modernization, first with the newly established National School for Administration and Management, and the Department of Public Administration and Civil Service. Between 1994 and 1997, US$ 3 million was injected into various PAR activities through UNDP. Incremental growth in knowledge and familiarity with PAR among party officials led to the creation of the Leading Committee on Public Administration Reform in 1997 following the recommendations of the Sixth Party Congress in 1996. A broad PAR strategy was formulated identifying six major components: \ufffd Role of government: effective strategic management and fundamental restructuring of government; \ufffd Central government: strengthening central mandates,policies and organizational structures; \ufffd Local administration: capacity-building and institutional strengthening at the local level; \ufffd Personnel management: strengthening different aspects of personnel management within the civil service; \ufffd Financial management: ensuring cost-effective use of scarce financial resources at all levels of government; and \ufffd Public sector rules and regulations: improving rules and regulations pertaining to sound governance and public administration. External assistance was sought from UNDP, which committed US$ 1.15 million between 1997-2002 and secured Swiss support to invest a projected US$ 1.35 million in the period 2003- 2006.A range of activities have been undertaken, 18 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific Lao PDR such as strengthening the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, policy advice and law-drafting on central-local relations, delineation of systems of performance management and evaluation, and contributions to the elimination of red tape. Other donors have provided aid for institutional strengthening in particular sectors such as agriculture and education and have made contributions to the creation of a new financial system, including revised government procedures for financial management. Financial reforms are a key aspect of PAR, in transition economies in particular, and are closely linked to organizational and institutional reforms10 as well as reform of personnel management systems, relating directly to issues such as payroll reforms, strengthening of revenue collection and issues related to fiscal centralization or decentralization. Financial reform also provides one of the clearest links between PAR and the achievement of the MDGs as it relates to issues of budget allocation and pro-poor fiscal policies. This explains the centrality of financial management reforms in the PAR programme in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam. The pace of change has been relatively slow as there are obstacles and issues that still impede progress. Lao PDR is ranked 135th in the UNDP Human Development Report (2004). The country has a low GDP per capita (US$ 1,720 PPP in 2002), a life expectancy at birth of only 54.3 years, and an adult literacy rate of 66.4 percent. PAR is further constrained by scarce resources, inadequate staffing levels, weak personnel management systems, low salaries, and a lack of transparency and accountability. There is caution among some party members and civil servants about bureaucratic modernization. Therefore, despite growing familiarity with PAR and a declared commitment to it, the pace of change is still extremely slow. The public service is young and typically based in rural areas. Eighty-two percent of public servants11 in 2000 were under 40 years of age. However, only 10 percent held bachelors degrees while primary school was the highest level of educational achievement for 31 percent. Eighty percent of public servants were appointed to sub-national levels of government. This is desirable as most of the population and deprivation is in rural areas.Yet, it is also problematic in that rural-based public servants are often under-qualified and under-resourced. Since the launching of the Governance and Public Administration Reform (GPAR) programme in 1997, progress has been made and there are now grounds for some optimism. While there have been no requests in Lao PDR for large loans to fund a comprehensive programme of PAR, the pace of reform seems to be accelerating. Policy development under the GPAR programme has resulted in a more comprehensive approach to public sector reforms. This culminated in the adoption of a government policy paper on governance issues entitled Public Service Reform, People\u2018s Participation, Rule of Law and Sound Financial Management. This policy paper, presented to a Donor Meeting in April 2003, prioritizes governance reforms, \u201cas a cornerstone of the nation\u2019s approach to eradicate poverty\u201d, with PAR as one of the key components. Further, over the past year, some of the reforms that had been previously conceptualized have come into their final stages.

With the approval of the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy the recent decentralization policies (mainly aiming for improved administrative deconcentration) have become explicitly linked to poverty alleviation. The Government is now planning to pilot local development funds reflecting the desire for further delegation of authority over local projects and for improving processes and procedures for planning and budgeting and expenditure management at local levels. The Government is also encouraging central ministries to concentrate on budgeting, research,and monitoring and evaluation,and to delegate additional service delivery functions to the provinces and districts. Institutional strengthening is continuing in various agencies and there are visions of the sort of public service that the party and government would like: professional, competent, service- oriented, accountable and efficient, in which appropriately skilled people are appointed to the right job and in which outstanding performance is rewarded and encouraged. However, transforming such visions into reality remains difficult for reformers in Lao PDR. UNDP assistance to PAR The first PAR project (1993-1997) assisted two core government institutions that had been established in the early 1990s: the National 19 Country experiences in public administration reform: Northeast and Southeast Asia 10 The financial departments in the provinces are formally under the central Ministry of Finance.But in practice,the provincial governors have a strong impact on decision-making,often obstructing the emergence of a national revenue collection and treasury system. 11 Public servants in Lao PDR include also the teachers,health workers,judges, as well as employees working i n the mass organizations and the various committes of the Party. School for Administration and Management (1991) and the Department of Public Administration (December 1992). The project addressed the limited capacity of the public service by way of personnel management reforms and civil service training. In addition, work started on the clarification of roles and relationships at central and local levels, supporting the policies of re-centralization that had been issued after the promulgation of the Constitution.The project also helped to improve the information flow within the public service and to the public with a view to making public service decisions, operations and services common knowledge to the public servants themselves and to the citizenry. The initial PAR project was under the supervision of a Project Steering Committee, chaired by the Minister Chief of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. While the project generated a far better understanding and acceptance at many levels of government of the comprehensive, strategic and long-term nature of PAR,disconnected initiatives were lacking the synergy required to achieve more substantial progress. UNDP therefore stressed the need for a more integrated and holistic approach to achieve significant results and impacts. An important milestone was achieved in February 1997, when the Party approved the GPAR framework, prepared with the assistance of UNDP.This document, which was a first attempt to initiate a strategic programmatic approach to public sector reforms in Lao PDR, formed the basis for the current GPAR project. The project was attached to the Department of Administration and Civil Service in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. The UNDP project assisted the Government in managing the process of reform and in supporting key priority reforms (supporting strategic management, capacity building of the Department of Administration and Civil Service and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, implementation of reforms in government organization, structural and procedural reform, implementation of the Decentralization Policy, civil service reforms, and training and research). Rather than embarking on an ambitious and government-wide GPAR programme, the Government adopted a more modest approach, which explains why not all components of the programme were addressed at the same time. One of the main outcomes of the project has been that it has (incrementally) linked PAR to the broader issues of governance with a view to accelerating progress in poverty reduction. In 2001, UNDP and the Government agreed to a second phase of the GPAR project, which is currently in process. UNDP also supported the Government in the development of the policy paper on governance issues (Public Service Reform, People\u2018s Participation, Rule of Law and Sound Financial Management). This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current governance situation and the major policies and priority initiatives that need to be achieved with respect to public administration and civil service reforms, people\u2019s participation and central-local relations, strengthening the rule of law and sound socio-economic management. Since 2002, GPAR pilot projects have been launched in four provinces. Within the PAR portfolio, UNDP has also supported the reform of the Tax and Customs Administrations.Project activities have included central administration restructuring, upgrading of provincial offices,training,computerization of revenue collection, updating and streamlining of procedures and formulation of revenue-", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5dc0e629-296f-4998-8fa3-de2f4d09277e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5dc0e629-296f-4998-8fa3-de2f4d09277e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "445f3dcb6b69bb4e8d4168df60b487da2cb7ec4c6ee89f75105c9a561711dfca"}, "3": {"node_id": "9fa04836-cb7b-46f8-91c0-1f8d71ad9238", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "677486ce11c54b34f2b7c38dbcd25bba5746c90c6553a28b01a0e05b326d8bda"}}, "hash": "81afeb3b9b5d79d8024ee3208469994e884752bbf5a248e6dc95e6c7d919e343", "text": "related policy. A new tax decree was also issued in 1999, introducing new tax forms and measures to improve and facilitate tax collection. The Government also created the basis for the introduction of a value-added tax system. Tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have gradually risen from 6.4 percent in 1989 to 10.6 percent in 2005. Since 2003, Sida (the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) has taken over the tax component of the UNDP Tax and Customs project,while UNDP is in the process of formulating its new support for the Customs Administration, an important move inspired by Lao PDR\u2019s upcoming entry into the WTO. Since 2002, UNDP, through its GPAR project has been assisting the Government with the development of a vision, model and strategy for future decentralization and with the preparation of a policy paper on fiscal decentralization.The establishment of a District Development Fund for basic infrastructure and service delivery will be tested in one of the GPAR provincial pilot projects,and lessons learned will be fed into national policy-making on issues such as inter-governmental fiscal transfers and sub-national expenditure assignments. 20 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific Public administration and its reform The theme of bureaucratic modernization has a long and successful history in Malaysia.Effective and efficient public administration has made a significant contribution to the country\u2019s sustained economic growth and progressive improvement of human welfare indicators. At independence, in 1957, the country inherited an elite civil service, which functioned efficiently and was not politicized.While recognizing these virtues, the Government of Tun Razak (1970-1976) also realized that reform was necessary for public administration to play its role in promoting socio-economic development. A report commissioned from the Ford Foundation reiterated this sentiment, and identified the type of public service required and the means of achieving it; governance would be better served if administrative reform took precedence over political reform (Tharan 2001).The corps of elite generalist,largely Malay, administrators would be retained and their pro- fessional and leadership qualities would be enhanced through training. Cultural change would follow from this professionalization with the bureaucracy oriented to the achievement of national development goals. The public service became the instrument of \u2018effective governance\u2019(ibid.). A commonality of purpose was established and has been maintained between the political and administrative elites \u2013 the pursuit of national development. The autonomy of the public service was guaranteed by rendering it non- party politically with the Public Service Commission regulating personnel matters, although recently a ruling party decision has allowed senior public servants to join its ranks. Ministers have generally upheld the principle of non-interference although there is close consultation with the Prime Minister on senior appointments. However, \u201cpersonnel management, control of establishments and measures to control efficiency are all highly centralized\u201d(RIAP 2001, 144). The mode of reform in Malaysia has been incremental and for almost 40 years has remained steadfastly concerned with bureaucratic modernization.The current reform programmes still appear on the official Internet site as \u2018administrative modernization\u2019 and \u2018ICT modernization\u2019. Somewhat paradoxically, the public service has always maintained an awareness of the latest management trends from around the world, including New Public Management (NPM), and has drawn upon them pragmatically. The public service has demonstrated a very strong commitment to high-quality training especially through the public service college, INTAN. However, the centralized structure of public administration has remained intact. The Public Service Department, located in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department, controls, \u201cestablishments\u2019 (positions and organizational structures), recruitment and promotion policies, training and staff development, and implementation of measures to promote efficiency,\u201dand has a large staff to accomplish this (ibid., 144). The Public Service Commission holds the authority to make appointments but delegates it to departmental heads for lower-level positions.It has also delegated responsibility for disciplinary matters to the departmental heads. The Malaysian Administrative Modernization and Management Unit (MAMPU), created in 1977 and also located in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department, is responsible for managing improvements in the public service. While PAR has been a constant presence in post-colonial Malaysia there have never been grand systemic plans. The public service has been expected to tailor its reforms to the developmental directions set in government policies such as the present Vision 2020, which sees Malaysia joining the ranks of the High Income countries in that year.

Yet, it too has a kinship with the established tradition of bureaucratic modernization and \u201cdoes not challenge or question the central characteristics of traditional bureaucratically organized public service structures\u201d(ibid., 147). Recent developments point to a renewed focus on the strengthening of national integrity structures, with special attention paid to capacity development for the newly established National Integrity Institute of Malaysia and the implementation of a National Integrity Plan (NIP 2004) in line with the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). The NIP identifies a set of priorities and targets. For the first five years (2004-2008), the NIP has identified five priorities known as Target 2008, which are as follows: i) effectively reduce corruption, malpractices and abuse of power; ii) increase efficiency of the public delivery system and overcome bureaucratic red tape; iii) enhance corporate governance and business ethics; iv) strengthen the family institution; and v) improve the quality of life and people\u2019s well-being. UNDP assistance to PAR In response to the recent anti-corruption initiatives taken by the Malaysian Government, UNDP is currently involved in providing support for capacity development within the National Integrity Institute of Malaysia, support to the implementation of the NIP and to the establishment of a National Integrity Information Centre, and assisting with the development of gender-sensitive governance indicators to facilitate monitoring of the implementation of the NIP. The strategy will involve the building of partnerships between various public sector agencies, including INTAN and MAMPU. Public administration and its reform Following widespread popular unrest in Mongolia in early 1990 the country began a peaceful dual transition: from a one-party state to democracy and from a centrally planned economy to an economy based on market principles. The radical and abrupt nature of the changes resulted in initial economic collapse but policy reforms eventually encouraged substantial economic growth by the mid-1990s. The country made major strides in macro- economic adjustment, price liberalization, lower trade barriers and downsizing of the public sector. Mongolia was recognized as one of the leading reformers among transition economies. In the period 1993-1995 the share of the public sector in GDP declined from 51.8 percent to 31.5 percent, but subsequent political turmoil and the return of economic difficulties have created a turbulent environment for national development. Public administration in Mongolia developed under Soviet influence. Before 1990, an irrational and bureaucratic system of public administration prevailed with characteristics of totalitarianism and authoritarianism. Every government activity was highly centralized, command-driven, and based on forced mobilization. The bureaucracy exhibited the various dysfunctions associated with such types of organization. Problems of bureaucratic performance were exacerbated by the sudden systemic changes that public servants had to cope with.They were inadequately equipped to deal with such enormous challenges of rapid transition. However, public administration was recognized as a key area for reform by the Government and external assistance was sought to strengthen and modernize weak state organizations. 22 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific Mongolia 23 Country experiences in public administration reform: Northeast and Southeast Asia The Mongolian Government has faced a long list of public administration difficulties in trying to put its development plans on course.A range of problems has affected the budgetary process. There is poor quality of budget preparation, especially as it relates to policy-making. The latter does not seem to be constrained by budgetary realities \u2013 notably the lack of budget. Bottom-up budgeting undermines fiscal discipline and the predictability of budget outcomes. There is weak capacity in budgetary preparation and planning in the line ministries. Of particular concern is the poor capacity to prioritize,cost,or measure performance. The situation is exacerbated by a lack of trust between central and line ministries and poor accounting and auditing procedures.

Public sector transparency and accountability is also extremely weak. Fragmentation of government departments, overlapping functions and responsibilities between and within line ministries, excessive tiers of government, persistence of the command-and-control mode of functioning and frequent staff turnover are cited as reasons why there are difficulties in formulating and implementing policies, programmes and projects. Further, the public service has been growing and is, in the opinion of the ADB (2003a), \u201cunviable\u201d. The wage bill rose from 5.9 percent of GDP in 1996 to 8.2 percent in 2002. The Government has doubled public sector wages in 2004 and put increased pressure on scarce financial resources. However, Mongolia\u2019s civil service salaries are still very low and compressed. This works as a major disincentive to civil servants\u2019 performance and adds to a poor HRM system. Three major stages in PAR can be identified in the post-Soviet period. Stage one (1990-1993) focused on establishing the legislative and policy frameworks for the new state structure. Major achievements of the first stage included the new democratic Constitution of 1992 and a new state structure and governing institutions. Stage two (1993-2000) aimed at the creation of a professional civil service capable of implementing public policies and government goals. One of the major milestones of this stage was the Management Development Programme (1993-1996), which was the first comprehensive attempt to reform public administration in Mongolia. Initiatives included setting up the State Audit and Inspection Board (currently the National Audit Office) and the State Administrative Service Council (currently the Government Services Council). The legislative framework for public administration was also established through the Law on Government [Civil] Service of 1995. This law determined for the first time, civil service personnel policies, legalized the status of civil servants, and provided an enabling legal environment for public administration and civil service reforms in Mongolia. The Mongolian State Policy on Reforming Government Processes and the General State Structure was approved in 1996 within the overall Management Development Programme. It identified further steps towards privatization of the state-owned enterprises and legal and regulatory frameworks for a market economy; reduction in the cost of government operations, including downsizing the civil service; a new organizational structure for central government based on policy and planning ministries with oversight of executive agencies responsible for regulatory and service delivery functions; and strengthening accountability and oversight through ministry and agency business plans and new financial management systems. Stage three (2000-present) is aimed at strengthening institutional capacities and increasing their efficiency and effectiveness: The main objective of this stage is to create a citizen-oriented, flexible, pro-active, initiative-taking, lean, capable and outcome- oriented civil service. The objectives are to be achieved through organizational development and strengthening competencies and performance of civil servants. This stage has also seen the enactment of the Public Sector Management and Finance Law. Implementation commenced in January 2003 and will involve devolution of personnel decision-making to general managers in line agencies, a comprehensive strategic planning process and accountability for performance in delivering outputs \u2018purchased\u2019 by the Government. During 2002 and 2003, the 1994 Law on Government [Civil] Service was also reviewed and substantially amended to strengthen personnel controls and to increase the emphasis on performance, for example to allow dismissal of administrative staff after two or more adverse performance assessments. 24 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific In April 2004, the State Great Hural (Mongolia\u2019s Parliament) approved the Mid-Term Civil Service Reform Strategy, which confirms the Government\u2019s commitment to maintain and improve its capacity to deliver essential public services and to provide an adequate legal and regulatory framework to encourage the development of an effective private sector. There has previously been concern in some quarters that the PAR model introduced into Mongolia might be inappropriate for its particular situation. There has been a strong affiliation with NPM New Zealand-style, especially as manifested in the Public Sector Management and Finance Law. However, implementation of these reforms remains difficult, mainly due to the lack of a performance-oriented organizational culture and the absence of clearly defined performance indicators and benchmarks against which individual and organizational performance can be measured12. Most recently, Mongolia\u2018s Parliament has just adopted a Resolution on endorsement and support of the MDGs during its spring 2005 session, including a novel initiative to have an additional country-specific MDG 9 on Fostering Democratic Governance and Strengthening Human Rights which also includes a target of achieving zero-tolerance for corruption by the year 2015.UNDP has played an incremental role in this process.

A further reform was carried out for integrated, holistic support of democratic governance through the Capacity Building of Governing Institutions: Support to Democratic Governance project during 1997-2000. This goal has been accomplished through coordination, social communications and the following capacity building mechanisms: \ufffd Policy analysis and oversight capacity building; \ufffd Institutional development, including organization, information, and human resources development; \ufffd Assistance to support systems crucial for long-term sustainability, such as management education, training, consultancy, information systems; and \ufffd A fund for synergistic management for start-up activities, problem-solving, opportunity seizing, proactive promotion of synergies between governance activities. In 2000, after the formation of the new government and building on the learning experiences of two previous PAR and governance capacity-building efforts in Mongolia, UNDP assisted the Government with the formulation of the Good Governance for Human Security Programme. Programme implementation was under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.UNDP also provided support to the Programme Management Unit. The emphasis has been on participatory consultations in formulations as well as consensus building and responsiveness to citizen demands. Outreach activities have prioritized the national parliament, the presidency, the mass media, academia, other opinion formers, and general public opinion. The main objective was to achieve national policies with the involvement of the above stakeholders. Consensus building and 12 As mentioned in the Civil Service Reform Strategy,\u201cidentification of effective performance indicators is probably the most challenging step in implementing output-based management and accountability\u201d.To this end also,\u201ca mechanism will be established to obtain regular feedback on civil service performance from service users or clients,and the results published\u201d. responsiveness to citizen demands can contribute to good governance and the achievement of greater political stability, policy continuity and a more improved enabling environment than has been the case in Mongolia recently. Corruption, citizen frustration and alienation remain the greatest threats to Mongolia\u2019s sustainable development. With the new government and grand coalition in Parliament, and the preparation of a new government action plan, the Good Governance for Human Security Programme has come to an end. UNDP\u2019s support in the area of PAR is now being oriented towards the Office of the President, the National Assembly (in particular the working group responsible for the implementation of the National Programme for Combating Corruption and the implementation of the UNDP supported National Integrity Systems Enhancement project) and the Office of the Government Services Council (code of ethics, conflicts of interest policies and development of a participatory monitoring mechanism as stated in the Medium-Term Civil Service Reform Strategy). Public administration and its reform Considering that the Philippines has one of the longest-running discourses on PAR in Asia, its record of actual reforms is disappointing. Since political independence in 1946 there have been five attempted reorganizations of the Philippine public administration system but these grand plans of systemic change have failed to reach the implementation phase (Turner 2002). Explanations of reform failure have included culture,bureaucratic behaviour,partisan politics and political economy (Varela 1996; de Guzman 1993). President Ramos (1993-1999) came closest to achieving systemic changes with his NPM-style initiative to \u2018re-engineer\u2019 the bureaucracy. However, he failed to get his reform package through Congress because legislators did not want to give the President full authority for re-engineering the executive branch but favoured a joint Executive- Legislative Commission. Ramos\u2019s successor, Joseph Estrada, also failed to get his reform initiatives in place,while the first government of President Arroyo (2002-2004) continued the theme of piecemeal reform despite declaring a two-track approach to PAR: the legislative track for major reforms and the administrative track for reforms which can be designed and implemented within the existing legal framework. Despite the absence of systemic reform there have been a number of notable individual innovations in public sector management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92a8538e-6f38-4a06-bc3d-eb9f656b69bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "92a8538e-6f38-4a06-bc3d-eb9f656b69bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c7e811b2fbab8ba14e1d310e7d8c5c1e00bc2143d5af5f0f65c260519e3edd2"}, "2": {"node_id": "5cf9f8fd-96ae-4d42-a86f-0ed76353fc8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80e352221501d5baa45d84e9af677825bb29e1a8bbfb3f7f2258694ed11da673"}}, "hash": "8fe410cde922ad23ea83790467826501095edcff1fd7adca7dba58131f727af1", "text": "For example, in the 1990s, the Civil Service Commission introduced a Do-Away-With- Red-Tape (DART) initiative and followed it up with a quality improvement programme (\u2018the citizen now not later\u2019) to improve the public service\u2019s image, increase accountability,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e63adaaa-1e7b-40dc-b05b-cb9d3a1503fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "e63adaaa-1e7b-40dc-b05b-cb9d3a1503fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9102d39d66dc640acf88a11caa0100c8622fffccf144d0d0fd05cc820933602e"}}, "hash": "9102d39d66dc640acf88a11caa0100c8622fffccf144d0d0fd05cc820933602e", "text": "and encourage performance improvement (Sto Tomas 1995). There have also been initiatives in HRM such as efforts to enhance performance evaluation, the development of a common personnel information database and a study of position classification and compensation. Concerns over budget deficits have increased the urgency of reforms in public expenditure management. The objectives of public expenditure management reforms are to strengthen fiscal discipline and to set in place a performance orientation in government. Initiatives include a more realistic medium-term fiscal plan, clear definition of public investment priorities, an organizational performance indicator network to facilitate priority ranking of programmes and projects, and an agency performance review which will feed into future budgetary decisions. Procurement has also been a cause of concern with measures introduced to achieve a streamlined, uniform, and effective system which should bring 20-30 percent savings in procurement of goods and services across government. Major actions include the passage of the Government Procurement Reform Act and its implementing rules, the establishment of the Government Procurement Policy Board, and professionalization of procurement personnel.A set of standard bidding documents has been produced to reduce transaction costs while technological innovation in the form of the Government Electronic Procurement System is aimed at increasing efficiency,effectiveness and transparency in procurement. The deepening fiscal crisis in 2004, after the election of President Arroyo, precipitated a number of reform measures each 25 Country experiences in public administration reform: Northeast and Southeast Asia Philippines 26 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific aimed at reducing public expenditure or increasing government income.Downsizing the bureaucracy, cost-cutting, anti-corruption measures, and the pursuit of tax avoiders are among the initiatives being pursued by the Arroyo administration. Transparency and accountability have long been problems in government, a fact corroborated by public opinion polls and rankings by organizations such as Transparency International. However, government has attempted to address such problems by authorizing the Office of the Ombudsman and the Presidential Anti-Graft Commission to conduct lifestyle checks on government officials. Integrity development reviews have been undertaken in the Department of Education and the Office of the Ombudsman to map out corruption vulnerabilities, enhance integrity and improve anti-corruption effectiveness. The introduction of information technology has been an important element in the Bureau of the Treasury\u2019s efforts to increase efficiency and reduce corruption. Similar aims have driven the Bureau of Customs\u2019 efforts to streamline cumbersome procedures through the use of information technology. Several government agencies have adopted schemes whereby public feedback is obtained via text messaging and e-mail. However, although Philippine leaders periodically boast of their strong stance against corruption, due to low salaries,nepotism,red tape and the overlapping mandates and accountabilities of the 13 agencies involved in the fight against corruption, the laws, institutions and related action plans have not been effective (Quah, quoted in Wescott, 2004, 8). The most significant public sector reform in recent years has been political decentralization through the Local Government Code of 1991. The initiative was inspired by \u2018people power\u2019, which triumphed over authoritarianism rather than through managerial arguments of improved efficiency. Locally elected councils were installed at provincial, city, municipal and community (barangay) levels and given responsibility for a range of functions \u2013 agriculture, health, public works, social welfare, and environment and natural resources \u2013 and substantial additional funding was allocated by the centre to perform these new functions. The consensus is that real gains have been made in terms of popular participation and enabling local governments to run more of their own affairs. There is also evidence of innovation and experimentation as local governments seek solutions to the problems they face. Local government has opened up further opportunities for NGOs,which are numerous in the Philippines and have been active at all levels of government in terms of advocacy, advice, service delivery and project implementation. There are some concerns, however, that they have been captured or at least become dependent on funding provided by government and donors.

The Government of the Philippines-UNDP Governance Portfolio contains a three-point strategic agenda addressing governance issues in public sector reforms, institutional strengthening as well as human rights mainstreaming across programmes and projects.

UNDP has made significant contributions towards strengthening the capacities of government, CSOs, the private sector and the media to work together to promote transparent and accountable practices in the bureaucracy, improve public awareness and develop a culture of ethics in government. Initiatives include participatory audit and sectoral performance audits of the Commission on Audit; ethics and accountability training programmes of the Civil Service Commission; and the organizational review and capacity building programmes of the Office of the Ombudsman. Civil society-initiated programmes were pursued in the areas of government monitoring, budget advocacy, investigative journalism, anti-corruption campaigns and consultations on the anti- corruption agenda. 27 Country experiences in public administration reform: Northeast and Southeast Asia UNDP has contributed to the strengthening of the Inter-Agency Anti-Corruption Committee and the formulation of a Covenant among key agencies that defines the guiding principles among key players/agencies against corruption in the public sector;strengthening investigation and prosecution capabilities of the Office of the Ombudsman in the efficient disposition of cases; the development of an ethics-based assessment test in the civil service, which provides a new screening process for public servants; increased public awareness and action through the anti-corruption campaigns led by civil society and community-based organizations such as the Transparency and Accountability Network; and the research and advocacy efforts of media groups such as the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism and the Center for Community Journalism and Development. Partnerships with community organizations such as the Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Government were also forged to replicate the best practices on participatory monitoring of government projects nationwide.There has also been support for the Philippine Governance Forum, a national network of public policy reform-oriented organizations. The Philippine Governance Forum conceptualized and launched initiatives such as the Budget Advocacy Project, Government Watch (G-watch), Transparency and Accountability Network, and the Philippine Governance Report.These CSO-led initiatives continue to be funded by various donors. UNDP has supported the institutional strengthening initiatives of the Presidential Committee on Effective Governance, the body mandated to oversee and coordinate the institutional reforms in the bureaucracy.This has been done through the formulation of sectoral and organizational studies,which help to define government\u2019s role and functions and how they can be performed effectively and efficiently. UNDP has also contributed to the Programme Framework on Rationalizing and Improving Public Service Delivery, which was formulated by Presidential Committee on Effective Governance, but which is still awaiting approval by the President. A key programme to be addressed under the framework is the finalization of the National Transparency and Accountability Programme. Further assistance has been given to the Department of Budget and Management in its Agency Performance Review. Generated issues, concerns and areas for improvement will be inputted in the subsequent implementation of the Agency Performance Review. The Civil Service Commission has benefited from UNDP support for its reforms on personnel management through enhancement of the performance evaluation system, as well as on improving front-line services of government agencies through simplification of processes. Key UNDP contributions towards addressing public sector reforms at local levels have included the development of instruments and measurements to gauge local governments\u2019 performance (State of the Cities\u2019 Report and Local Government Unit Capacity Assessment Framework); documentation and replication of best practices (Local Governance Good Practices Replication Administration or GO-FAR); CSO engagement in local governance initiatives to include policy research on local sectoral representation and strengthening CSO Networks; and profiling and mobilizing local resources or academic institutions for capacity development of local governments. Strong partnerships have been forged between UNDP and the Department of Interior and Local Government, the different leagues of local government units as well as academic institutions were established to build capacity and empower local governments to address basic entitlements of its constituency. Recently, UNDP supported the organization of the National Multi-sectoral Governance Festival Engaging the People and Communities: Advancing Governance Reforms towards the Realization of the Millennium Development Goals. The conference also included a cluster on \u2018Public Administration Reforms: Enhancing the Administration of Service Delivery\u2019,which aimed to recognize and discuss the role of public administration in poverty alleviation and in achieving the MDGs. Public administration and its reform The origins of modern Thai bureaucracy can be traced back to the reforms of King Chulalongkorn in the late 19th century. By the 1930s, \u201cthe foundations were laid for a functionally competent, centralized system of Thailand 28 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific state administration\u201d (RIAP 2001, 70).

Older state traditions such as a deep concern with status hierarchy and social esteem intermingled with newer managerial features of modern bureaucratic forms of organization. These are still much in evidence today. However, while civil servants still command respect and have considerable authority, the situation has changed since the heyday of bureaucratic polity. Economic growth produced new elites while democratization has further broadened the power base in Thailand. Until the economic crisis of 1997, bureaucratic consolidation rather than its reform was the dominant characteristic. Plans were often made but changes in government and deeply embedded patterns of bureaucratic behaviour worked against significant PAR. The economic crisis precipitated serious re-evaluation of the bureaucracy among a population, \u201clong- accustomed to consider their government officials as all-powerful and technically competent\u201d (RIAP 2001, 100). A comprehensive reform programme was adopted in 1999, including the establishment of a high-level Public Sector Reform Commission. The programme incorporated both existing and new initiatives.These included: \ufffd Revision of roles, functions and management practices of departments and other agencies in the public sector; \ufffd Budget, finance and procurement management reform; \ufffd Personnel management reform; \ufffd Legal reform; and \ufffd Reform of cultural and public values. The package was categorized as \u2018New Public Management\u2019 although this misdirects attention away from the fact that diagnosis of the ills of public administration and recommendations for treatment were often internally determined. It should also be noted that Thai public administration has a history of pragmatic external borrowing of policies and institutions extending back to King Chulalongkorn. A government White Paper presented in December 2000 reported various initiatives in each of the identified reform fields indicating the Government\u2019s commitment to implementation (OCSC 2000). Other reports noted slow implementation, a reliance on demonstration projects, heavy reliance on external consultants, and that much of the public service remained untouched by reform initiatives (RIAP 2001). Resistance by inertia was also identified. In 2001, in line with the new principles imbedded in the 1997 Constitution, the Prime Minister issued a Regulation on Good Governance, stressing the need to promote transparency, improve the quality of public services and strengthen integrity in public life. The Instruction aims to prevent, inter alia, corruption, misconduct, and malpractice for personal benefit and gain in both the public and private sectors, and to ensure a high level of transparency, fairness, equity, efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services to the citizen. More recent evaluation has reported significant progress in public financial management reform, strong gains in tax administration, and substantial progress in reorganizing structures and functions of ministries (World Bank 2003a). Implementation of decentralization has been slow while accountability and transparency mechanisms are judged to need strengthening. The Thai Government has maintained its commitment to PAR. In October 2002, the Public Sector Reform Commission was replaced by the Public Sector Development Commission and in March 2003 the Cabinet approved the Strategic Plan for Thai Public Sector Development which aims to improve the quality of public services, right-size the government bureaucracy, increase the competencies of public sector employees, and promote democratic governance (World Bank 2003a). Seven strategies have been established and appropriate measures of performance identified. In 2003, the current Government also issued a Royal Decree on Rules and Procedures for Good Public Administration (2003), focusing on responsiveness, results-based management, effectiveness and value for money, transparency, and cutting down red tape.The decree assigns a key role to the Public Sector Development Commission. 29 Country experiences in public administration reform: Northeast and Southeast Asia Decentralization has moved slowly in Thailand, however in 2003, in order to implement national policies in a more integrated and effective manner at the provincial level,the roles and responsibilities of provincial governors were redefined through the application of a CEO (Chief Executive Officer) management style and holistic approach to provincial administration (Government of Thailand-UNDP 2004). Also being transferred to local administrations from central agencies are 228 duties along with 35 percent of the budget by 2006. Thailand has now adopted a performance- based, output-based public administration approach. Service delivery units are required to set targets of delivery for their budgets; managers at different levels are required to enter into a public service agreement that sets specific targets and goals. From the point of view of public-sector development and reform, information to support accurate assessment of service delivery units is crucial. UNDP assistance to PAR UNDP has supported public sector reform and the decentralization process in Thailand in the context of the 1997 Constitution of Thailand and the 8th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2002-2006).

In the various projects that UNDP has supported, the most prominent features of PAR efforts lie in the introduction of a working process that is bottom-up and participatory. The process also involves a tripartite relationship between governmental agencies, NGOs and CSOs, using NGOs and CSOs as effective means to reach the people. Some projects also promote governmental capacity to work with local communities, both directly and through other institutions, including regional universities, civil society groups and local governments, particularly the Sub-District (Tambon) Administration Organization. UNDP has also supported pilot projects on financial and personnel transfer from the central government to local administration as provided for in the Constitution and the Decentralization Act. Besides working directly with governmental agencies, UNDP has developed a modality to tackle PAR initiatives quickly. This involves working through a non-profit,non-partisan,and well-networked institution, such as the Thailand Development Researchs Institute. Thus, the Thailand Development Research Institute was used to provide catalytic support to governmental agencies as needed. UNDP Thailand was approached by the Government to help in identifying, selecting and adapting an appropriate \u2018participatory monitoring\u2019 (or social audit) methodology that could be used by a multitude of national and local organizations to identify critical service delivery constraints and, most importantly, to formulate locally relevant solutions. Thailand has now decided to adopt a two-pronged approach to the process: i) an outside-in approach as a third party evaluation approach, where the CIET social audit methodology fits in; and ii) an inside-out approach of self-evaluation where such tools as the Citizens\u2019 Charter and the Public Sector Excellence Programme (originating from the Philippines) fit in. A social and people\u2019s audit was introduced to Thailand under the framework of UNDP-Thailand Partnership for Local Empowerment Through Democratic Governance (PLEDGE). Public administration and its reform Over the past decade, the idea of PAR in Viet Nam has moved from the fringes of the policy agenda to assume a prominent position in national priorities for development. In 1992, the Seventh Party Congress acknowledged the need for an administrative apparatus that was, \u201cconsistent, competent, capable and effective\u201d. At the Eighth Plenum in 1995 the term \u2018public administration\u2019 received its first formal mention and involved calls for institutional,organizational and human resource reforms.It was identified as a component of the country\u2019s overall renovation programme and an important element in Viet Nam\u2019s socio-economic development. The ensuing reforms were modest in that they absorbed limited technical support and made only very minor differences to the overall Viet Nam 30 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific system of public administration. They were piecemeal as they were not part of a strategic plan or overall PAR framework. Further, they were incremental rather than systemic,focusing on specific elements or activities. However, the reforms did familiarize party and government officials with the concept of PAR, what it could involve, and why it was important, thus laying some important groundwork for the future. This patient work received a boost in 1998, when the Prime Minister established the Public Administration Reform Steering Committee. This action helped to emphasize the importance of PAR in national development. The Committee perceived a lag between the demands of rapid socio-economic transformation and development and the slow pace of PAR. A comprehensive review of PAR issues was undertaken in 2000-2001, which paved the way for a Master Programme for Public Administration Reform 2001-2010. This document represented the first attempt to deal with PAR in a comprehensive and strategic fashion. Strategic objectives were set and key reform areas specified: \ufffd Institutional reform; \ufffd Organizational reform; \ufffd Human resource management and development reform; and \ufffd Public finance reform. Seven sub-programmes were delineated to achieve reform objectives, namely: 1. Programme to renovate the development, issuance and quality improvement of legal normative documents. 2. Programme on roles, functions, organizational structures of the agencies in the administrative system. 3. Programme on staff downsizing. 4. Programme on improving the quality of cadres and civil servants. 5. Programme on salary reform. 6. Programme on renovation of financial management mechanisms for administrative and public service delivery agencies. 7.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b0ce872-ef71-44aa-9bd0-7a62cb89b25a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b0ce872-ef71-44aa-9bd0-7a62cb89b25a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "354396fba7cead6f824ee59a54618731c3331e49f3063b3852367fbcd78a0c19"}, "2": {"node_id": "92431219-bd60-4efc-8952-a3ff5ca86996", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "105fabd0d036282bde81f27371ae22421eb63f9ab0283f59873027c941390730"}}, "hash": "bc6c883f86fba0fa0a8cc91494f4bdac0b611248c6f1b585ec99601aafea3d77", "text": "Programme on renovation of financial management mechanisms for administrative and public service delivery agencies. 7.

However,the Master Plan does have some novel aspects. First, it defines the field of public administration in Viet Nam and identifies key principles which should guide the PAR process: \ufffd The commitment of leaders to guide and implement PAR; \ufffd PAR to be implemented in line with renovation of the political system; \ufffd PAR should be carried out simultaneously at both central and local levels; \ufffd The sufficient allocation of financial and human resources; and \ufffd Strengthened information dissemination and communication activities for public awareness and involvement. Second, the Master Plan is comprehensive and strategic. PAR is no longer a series of free- standing projects but is a programme led by a vision of what the Government hopes to achieve in the decade: A democratic,clean,strong,professionalized, modernized, effective and efficient public administration system\u2026public cadres and civil servants will have appropriate capacities and ethical qualities able to respond to the requirements of national building and development. A third novel aspect is that the Master Programme, apart from UNDP and bilateral donor contributions, is being funded through a loan. The current US$ 45 million loan from ADB is far more than the US$ 26 million in grants that had flowed into PAR until now. 31 Country experiences in public administration reform: Northeast and Southeast Asia While the Master Plan has the strong commitment of government and the enthusiastic support of donors there are undoubtedly implementation difficulties. These include the opaqueness and secrecy of Vietnamese bureaucracy, possible problems in coordination across agencies at both the same level and at different levels; the persistence of complex and cumbersome processes; and some individuals and organizations that feel threatened by PAR may use the existing bureaucratic culture to adversely affect implementation of the Master Plan. There is agreement, however, that although Viet Nam has made great strides in economic reforms and in strengthening a wide range of public institutions, there is no room for complacency: Private sector growth continues to be hampered by an excessively regulated business environment, also acting as a major deterrent to foreign investment and trade; the public administration remains heavily influenced by former centralized and bureaucratic management systems and a weak human resource base; the quality of the legal framework leaves much to be desired and law enforcement is generally inconsistent; and the institutions of the legislature have limited capacity and space to exercise their oversight and representative functions.Although projects have been characterized by a strong sense of national ownership, a long-term outlook, strategic inputs of international expertise, and a regular and open policy dialogue \u2013 a consistent message is needed to link support for governance reforms more closely to the overall poverty alleviation agenda, as guided by the MDGs and reinforced by the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy of Viet Nam (CPRGS \u2013 Viet Nam\u2019s PRSP). UNDP assistance to PAR UNDP has cooperated successfully with the Government of Viet Nam in the field of PAR for more than a decade. This cooperation, which is seen as sensitive and complex but essential, has become an increasingly crucial component of UNDP\u2019s overall development programme to assist the country\u2019s transition process as guided by the Government\u2018s doi moi (restructuring) and socio-economic development strategies. In the initial period (1992-1995), UNDP assisted the Government in identifying new concepts of PAR. A significant output was the formulation in March 1995 of the first government PAR programme, focusing on three main reform areas (legal/institutional, organizational, and human resource management and development). In addition to helping to build general reform capacities (legal development, state machinery organizational system, human resource development and management), this project facilitated the establishment of a framework for donor mobilization and the formulation of nearly 10 PAR project proposals, most of which have now been successfully implemented with donor support. In the period from 1996-2000,five projects were developed and implemented at both the national level in the Government Committee on Organization and Personnel and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and at the subnational level in Quang Binh, Hai Phong and Ho Chi Minh. While the projects at the centre focused on the reform of government system, those in the provinces concentrated on pilot schemes in a wide range of areas, including: \ufffd One-stop shop service delivery models piloted in Ho Chi Minh City and Quang Binh, and replicated in other provinces; \ufffd Block grant and staffing in administrative agencies in Ho Chi Minh City; \ufffd Local service contracting-out in Hai Phong; \ufffd Local government autonomy through the Decentralization Decree for Ho Chi Minh City", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9123b60f-a585-4fe4-978e-3093dc7105d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9123b60f-a585-4fe4-978e-3093dc7105d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af8bead665a627742f357fb77d894f80574a01550b789459f905d53b6376de56"}, "3": {"node_id": "490490bd-fa43-432f-8670-cf8507857321", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c59b8b7f4c76d368a66c81fe5f3e2fe2739eddee651cd73ebe7926b385263d1"}}, "hash": "3715a1ce8f6d0bcb142b37f6ca3c633b13b4cd493ad4ab977fb03b6fa232cd4e", "text": "and urban management and planning coordination in Hai Phong; and \ufffd Initial computerization toward e-Government in Ho Chi Minh City. In the same period, a UNDP-coordinated PAR partnership was established, providing a mechanism for government-donor information sharing and resource coordination. Between 1999 and 2001, UNDP coordinated donor assistance to support the Government in conducting a comprehensive review and in developing the PAR Master Programme (2001-2010). This PAR strategy provides a comprehensive framework, which has been discussed in the previous section. In 2002, in a joint effort with the Government, UNDP and five bilateral donors (Canada, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland) developed a new PAR programme, with the Ministry of Home Affairs playing the executing role in coordination with key central agencies 32 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific (Office of the Government, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Finance and the National Academy of Public Administration). This new programme supports the Government in undertaking a coordinated and programmatic approach to PAR and in developing sound steering and coordinating systems for the effective implementation and management of the PAR Master Programme. Built upon the lessons learned from the past reform decade with an aim of contributing to achieving the MDGs and facilitating the CPRGS process, this programme concentrates its support on: \ufffd Enhancing the coordination and management capacity for the successful implementation of the overall PAR Master Programme and its programme areas; \ufffd Enhancing departmental and provincial PAR planning and management capacity; \ufffd Promoting advocacy and mainstreaming of the PAR Master Programme among the stakeholders; \ufffd Promoting policy research, departmental and local innovations and replication; and \ufffd Strengthening government-donor partnership to promote dialogue and resource mobilization and coordination. Launched in 2003, in close connection with the above programme are the second phases of two other projects.One is a project to support PAR in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.The other is helping to tackle the socio-economic development issues of the leading economic centre, Ho Chi Minh City. The lessons of these two projects will be shared and replicated nationwide. UNDP\u2019s assistance is thus becoming more closely linked with the overall poverty alleviation agenda of Viet Nam, as defined by the MDGs, Viet Nam Development Goals and the CPRGS, and geared towards initiatives that explicitly promote accountability, transparency, equity and participation as key principles required for the development of a sound system of governance. Public administration and its reform PAR has been a constant presence in Papua New Guinea since political independence in 1975.For the first decade the leading policies of public sector reform were incremental in nature: localization, public sector growth, training and restructuring. However, there was one radical change \u2013 decentralization. This involved the establishment of elected provincial assemblies and the transfer of various service delivery functions and the associated public servants to provincial control. In 1983, the World Bank noted some problems but judged public administration to be a, \u201cgenerally well- functioning system, with well-controlled budget procedures\u201d(World Bank 1983,1). This phase of \u2018tinkering with the bureaucracy\u2019 was followed by a period combining existing initiatives with some more significant innovations (Turner and Kavanamur 2002). Despite these efforts, public administration moved into \u2018creeping crisis\u2019. To address existing problems and create a more responsive, efficient and effective public administration, a Project Management Unit was created with World Bank assistance. The most important change was the replacement of the independent Public Services Commission with the Department of Personnel Management. This heralded the politicization of the public service. There was much diagnosis of organizational problems and suggested remedies. A resource management planning system was designed but never implemented. Meanwhile, bureaucratic efficiency declined as dysfunctions multiplied. As the mid-1990s approached, the World Bank (1995) reported a health system that was, \u201cdeteriorating\u201d (ibid., 12), an education system that, \u201cdoes not appear to be improving\u201d (ibid., 16), \u201ca totally inadequate sum\u201d (ibid., 19) of government money devoted to agriculture, and, \u201cconsiderable scope for increasing the effectiveness of infrastructure expenditure\u201d (ibid., 22).Everybody agreed that the public was not being served well and that the situation was getting worse. The creeping crisis in public sector management appeared to have transformed into an acute crisis. A steady stream of reports reiterated the need for action to address serious problems in almost every aspect of public sector management.The result was a corresponding stream of reform initiatives.These derived both from the external pressures of donors and from domestic initiatives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "490490bd-fa43-432f-8670-cf8507857321": {"__data__": {"id_": "490490bd-fa43-432f-8670-cf8507857321", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af8bead665a627742f357fb77d894f80574a01550b789459f905d53b6376de56"}, "2": {"node_id": "9123b60f-a585-4fe4-978e-3093dc7105d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3715a1ce8f6d0bcb142b37f6ca3c633b13b4cd493ad4ab977fb03b6fa232cd4e"}}, "hash": "5c59b8b7f4c76d368a66c81fe5f3e2fe2739eddee651cd73ebe7926b385263d1", "text": "However, performance did not improve.

The latter had a long engagement with Papua New Guinea, especially in capacity building. Strengthening of the financial system was identified as a priority and much effort has been put into this pursuit. A range of other initiatives, such as the revitalization of the Public Service Commission, have been funded in an effort to rescue a State which is weak and an economy which has a record of poor performance.It will be difficult to create a properly functioning bureaucracy in these conditions. However, the 2004 National Budget reiterates the importance of PAR with the promise to build a performance-oriented public service with a performance management system for departmental heads and merit appointments. It also indicates investment in reorienting personnel management systems to improve service delivery as well as a Service Improvement Programme to re-engineer cumbersome government processes. A recent radical initiative by Australia involves the placement of Australian personnel in key positions in government agencies in order to arrest bureaucratic decline. 33 Country experiences in public administration reform: South Pacific 5.2 South Pacific Papua New Guinea 34 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific The South Pacific Island Countries can be joined together to form a special case as they share certain characteristics that delineate them from other countries in the region.13 Items on the following list apply to a greater or lesser degree to individual countries in the South Pacific: \ufffd Small resident populations going as low as 2,100 in Niue; \ufffd Small land areas; \ufffd Limited natural resources; \ufffd Limited economic opportunities; \ufffd Diseconomies of scale; \ufffd Susceptibility to natural disasters and crises which can have a much greater effect than similar events in larger countries (e.g., typhoons, the Asian financial crisis, military coups in Fiji); \ufffd Dependency on migration, remittances, aid and bureaucratic employment (much less so in Fiji than elsewhere); and \ufffd Diverse cultures and languages. Most South Pacific countries achieved political independence in the 1970s and proceeded, in the 1980s,to build large governments relative to population size. In the 1990s, governments and donors became greatly concerned by the \u2018Pacific Paradox\u2019 comprising, \u201clow rates of economic growth despite high levels of foreign resource inflows and high rates of investment\u201d (ADB 1998,2).All States experienced fiscal crises brought on by combinations of poor economic management, ballooning debt, excessive public sector growth and unsustainable budget deficits. The situation was compounded by a future scenario of declining foreign aid, the adverse effects of the 1997 Asian financial crisis on exports, and growing popular dissatisfaction with the quality of governance and public service provision. This situation made PAR a high priority on South Pacific governments\u2019 policy agendas. The leading strategy, still evident today, was downsizing of the public service. In the Cook Islands, public sector employment was reduced by 57 percent over 1996-1998, in Solomon Islands the payroll was reduced by 9 percent between 1998-2000, in Vanuatu 10 percent of the Government workforce was shed in 1996, and even in tiny Niue the public service was slashed by 50 percent in 1995. In some places, such as the Cook Islands, departments were amalgamated in restructuring exercises. The policy of saving money has been complemented by the policy of improving the management of what was left and even trying to extract a bit more. Public expenditure management received considerable attention and in some places, such as Fiji, and in Samoa, a value added tax (VAT) was introduced. Concerns over fiscal responsibility led to efforts to improve accountability and transparency in government financial systems. There were also initiatives,such as in Samoa,to introduce output budgeting to encourage focus on results in addition to inputs. Contracting out was promoted to improve efficiency and effectiveness in government spending. In Samoa, reforms have moved further forward than elsewhere and include many items from the NPM menu. There has been a considerable degree of success. In addition to output budgeting and a VAT there have been improvements to the budget planning cycle, the drafting of a treasury manual and the enhancement of the accounting systems. Financial devolution has involved the authority to shift expenditure among cost items, increased ceilings expenditure that can be approved by line agencies, and experiments in revenue retention (ADB 2000). Some personnel functions have been devolved to line agencies and departmental heads have been placed on performance-based contracts.

South Pacific Island Countries 35 Country experiences in public administration reform: South Pacific who is actually driving the reform agenda.While donors acknowledge the importance of local ownership of reforms this is not necessarily the reality. In the Federated States of Micronesia local ownership declined as political and personal costs rose.Disorder in Solomon Islands derailed all reform efforts and almost brought the Government to a standstill. Intervention by Australia and other Pacific nations has helped to restore order and rebuild capacity14. In Tuvalu, the civil service grew beyond its planned size while questions have been raised as to why an imported system of output budgeting should be the only way for performance improvement. The introduction of best practices in fiscal management into the Pacific has been criticized for its excessive demand on absorptive capacity and the tendency to crowd out good practices (Hemming 1999). In Nauru, the decline of phosphate revenues has severely affected government income and hence its capacity. In Vanuatu, it is not clear whether the reforms promoting efficiency have brought any improvement in service delivery. Measures that are approved by parliaments may not be implemented. For example, in Tuvalu, 11 reform measures endorsed by the Cabinet in January 1999 had not been acted upon by 2002.Cultural aspects also seem to have been overlooked15. The overall situation in the South Pacific is one of a few successes, notably Samoa, a recovering disaster in Solomon Islands and, for the other countries, a case of slow progress with reforms often lacking local ownership. Service delivery has been overlooked in the quest for greater efficiency in central fiscal management and an externally promoted push for the substitution of the private for the public sector.However,the latest pronouncements of the reinvigorated South Pacific Forum promise improvements in service delivery across the Pacific. Public administration and its reform Timor-Leste is the newest state in the Asia- Pacific. Previously under Portuguese and then Indonesian rule, Timor-Leste emerged from the violence and destruction of September 1999 and progressed rapidly \u2013 electing the Constituent Assembly in August 2001 and formally achieving independence as a sovereign nation in May 2002. Yet, the basis for development was weak. In 1999 there was,\u201cno government, no official language or currency, no system of law, no media, no schools, and no shops\u201d(UNDP 2002b).There was an \u2018institutional vacuum\u2019 with none of the organizations normally associated with running a modern state. Further, about 8,000 public servants had fled to Indonesia, including key people in the bureaucracy. In designing a new system of public administration it was necessary to avoid the deficiencies of the previous order:overstaffing;a culture of dependence on the centre and the top levels of bureaucracy; complexity involving too many layers and duplication of functions; pervasive corruption; and lack of public participation (UNDP 2002b). The initial responsibility for rebuilding the nation was placed in the hands of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). Creating the basis for an effective public administration was a high priority for UNTAET. This involved hiring a large contingent of international staff and recruiting qualified East Timorese. By April 2002 almost 11,000 East Timorese had been recruited into government service against 15,000 approved positions, although there were many gaps at higher levels where there were few qualified candidates. Progress was also made in, \u201cestablishing basic legal and regulatory frameworks, civil service management systems, procedures and processes, as well as institutional mechanisms for effective resource mobilization and public expenditure management\u201d(UNDP SURF 2004,5). At independence there was a functioning administration but it was based, on \u201ca wide variety of technical inputs, management cultures, approaches and solutions (and to a large extent UN systems, regulations and working methods)\u201d(UNDP SURF 2004, 5).

Other donors have also made contributions to public administration such as Australia, Brazil, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, the World Bank and ADB. The dire economic situation of Timor-Leste coupled with its low skill base has necessitated dependence on donor funding. Timor-Leste clearly stands at a crossroad. In May 2006, the UN Mission will depart, formally concluding the political responsibilities of the Security Council.The challenge now is to develop a coherent transition strategy, effectively implement it with appropriate level of financial and human resources, and shift smoothly to the \u2018normal\u2019 development assistance, and how achieve development independence in addition to political independence. Fortunately, there are strong signs that development assistance will be well sustained beyond the Security Council mandate and that Timor-Leste will not suffer from fading donor interest now that the emergency phase is over.Following the government\u2019s approval of the 17 Sector Investment Programs, there is now a clear shift towards sectoral approaches to development.In this regard, the World Bank is spearheading a multi-donor Planning and Financial Management Capacity Building Programme to support the key agencies in charge of planning and financial management. Another partnership lead by AUSAID and UNDP is joining forces to design a support programme for capacity development related to civil service and human resource management, mainly targeting the agencies responsible for personnel management, training and coordination of capacity development efforts. UNDP assistance to PAR At the Donors Conference in Lisbon (June 2000), UNDP was designated as the lead agency for capacity building in the Timor-Leste public administration. UNDP supported the former National Planning and Development Agency with the preparation of a sector-wide Capacity Development Programme for Governance and Public Sector Management, which was approved by Cabinet in August 2001. The focus of the programme was twofold: i) to prepare the ground for the transition to a new administration; and ii) to develop and strengthen basic cross-sector capacities essential for the functioning of a lean public administration supportive of a market economy in a democratic system of governance. A Capacity Development and Coordination Unit (CDCU) was established, to be the central coordinating entity for all capacity development related activities in the Government, the Parliament, the Judiciary and the President\u2019s Office. The CDCU is currently attached to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. UNDP has played a leading role in laying the foundations of post-conflict public administration in Timor-Leste, in particular through support in the following areas: \ufffd Civil service HRM; \ufffd Capacity development in the public service; \ufffd Accountability, transparency and responsiveness in the civil service; and \ufffd Decentralization. Since 2002, UNDP has been implementing the Capacity Development for Human Resource Management in the Civil Service Project. This project marks a move from rebuilding public administration to reform. The early years of UN administration were about constructing a new system in its totality. Now the task is, first, to ensure that the indigenization of the system of public administration is conducted with the least disruption to a system that is functioning but is still fragile. Second, there is a need to strengthen and modify what exists so that it reflects local needs and conditions. This means that a capacity to conceptualize and implement change must be developed among public servants. Initially, the project\u2019s objectives focused on the development of legal and regulatory frameworks and systems and procedures in the area of HRM and support to the National Institute of Public Administration. The project aided in the drafting of the first Civil Service Act for Timor-Leste and organized a series of consultative Organizational and Team Diagnostic Clinics targeting a total of 13 ministries, including the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers and the Secretariat of Parliament. As a result of these assessments, the Government, UNDP and the United Nations Mission of Support for East Timor (UNMISET) revised their capacity-development strategy and adopted a three-pillared framework to address the strengthening of the state administration: i) skills and knowledge; ii) management systems and processes; and iii) culture, attitudes and behaviour. Consequently, the objectives of the HRM project were also revised to bring them in line with this capacity development strategy. This shift also requires a stronger role for both the CDCU and the National Institute of Public Administration.

At the time of liberation, there had been a three-year drought, infrastructure and social capital had been destroyed, human resources were severely depleted, state institutions were not functioning, and 7 million people were vulnerable to hunger. All development indicators showed appalling levels of human development. One of the first actions following liberation was the appointment of an Interim Administration for an emergency period of six months and then a Transitional Authority, elected by the traditional Loya Jirga for two years from July 2002. According to the latest report from the Afghan Government, it will require US$ 27.5 billion over the next seven years to reconstruct the country and raise the annual per capita income to a modest US$ 500. A legacy of poor administration and lack of human capital investment over the last 20 years has left Afghanistan with an aging public service whose skills and abilities have depreciated over time during this neglect (UNAMA 2004, 59). To facilitate the renewal of Afghanistan, a central role has been awarded to PAR. The broad vision includes a civil service that exhibits efficiency, transparency, and accountability. In order to achieve this desirable state of affairs, major problems must be overcome. UNDP (2003c) has detailed a long list of challenges including: \ufffd Government structures are fragmented with many overlapping functions, some of which are unnecessary; \ufffd Lack of inter-ministerial coordination; \ufffd Poor policy-management capacity; \ufffd Unclear lines of accountability; \ufffd Weak personnel management including shortage of information on personnel; \ufffd Shortage of skilled personnel; \ufffd Legacy of excluding women from public employment; \ufffd Pay scales unattractive and payments unreliable in provinces; \ufffd Lack of civil service training facilities; \ufffd Poor physical infrastructure; and \ufffd Slow administrative systems unaided by modern information technology. Such difficulties are to be expected in the post-conflict conditions of Afghanistan. What is perhaps surprising is that, \u201cthe administrative structure of the State as it currently exists is far more robust and functional than anyone had expected\u201d (World Bank 2003b, 1). Processes and structures that were in place before the war have survived and continue to be used despite personnel, resource, and telecommunications shortages. This suggests that there may be a useful platform of common understandings and discipline on which present and future reforms might build. Four preconditions have been identified as necessary for effective PAR in Afghanistan: \ufffd A lead agency for PAR; \ufffd Inter-ministerial dialogue; \ufffd Shaping a reform strategy; and \ufffd Building of a strong partnership with international donor support. These preconditions have been largely met.The Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC) has been established with Afghanistan\u2019s Vice President as Chair.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f8997f5-1b8e-46e5-8290-0a5fff07d1c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f8997f5-1b8e-46e5-8290-0a5fff07d1c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "842220aa077ecb0c049bee2e2ef9552e9a5f05ea7ede41faf6486279e14df78f"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e355a6a-fd8a-4dfd-b8d0-e202409c0ac2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f876afc0ef0aa4080a052b815b82dda33aef8e02031b5a7ac64b1738e368e61"}}, "hash": "580957a0c8eaf5d8bc569b9874acdfc89ef04a3985e2231ed5716d31e05d1063", "text": "Deriving its authority from the Bonn Agreements, the Commission has gradually Afghanistan 5.3 South Asia 39 Country experiences in public administration reform: South Asia gained in influence and credibility and has proposed a comprehensive programme for the transformation and renewal of public administration.

The Committee provides an important degree of political legitimacy for the difficult choices that inevitably must be made. In addition, focal points in ministries have been designated to facilitate the collection and dissemination of information on the PAR programme. The programme consists of seven capacity building blocks (see Box 3), a workplan, a method for reform implementation, and the design of a communication strategy. As PAR in Afghanistan is a long-term challenge it is especially important that the workplan identifies the urgent tasks that will prepare the ground for later initiatives. Among the top initial priorities are the development of a civil service legislative framework; recruitment and appointment procedures for senior civil servants; civil service pay; streamlining structures and functions; capacity building; and accelerated budget execution and transfer of funds to the provinces. The PAR methodology is to combine participation (i.e. initiative belongs to line ministries) with coordination (an inter-ministerial group on administrative reform). Partnerships with international donors and other actors are essential for the success of PAR in Afghanistan and support has been forthcoming from multilateral and bilateral donors. UNDP has taken a lead role in the early stages of national reconstruction and renewal and has contributed substantively to PAR design and implementation, in collaboration with other donors, in particular the World Bank and ADB. One of the key drivers for structural and functional reforms is the Priority Reform and Reconstruction (PRR) Programme, which was launched in July 2003 to kick-start the process of reforming the most critical functions of Government.The PRR process allows the staff of entire ministry/agency or selected department undertaking core functions to be placed on an elevated pay scale for a fixed term in exchange for restructuring. Approximately 1,653 civil servants were placed on the PRR pay scale; by early 2004 this number was expected to rise to 5,000 (UNAMA 2004, 60). The Cabinet also approved a major decompression of the civil service pay scale for all civil servants (excluding teachers, police and military).The objective of the pay reform was to make salary levels for professional staff more attractive to help to retain qualified staff. However, pay increases were also implemented at the lower levels; as a result, salary levels for unskilled labour are at the upper end or slightly above those observed in the private sector (ibid.). A major challenge remains the existence of a second public sector, comprising the national staff of donor governments, international agencies, and NGOs who are involved in traditional government work, including the coordination of expenditure, the reporting and monitoring of that expenditure, the implementation of projects, and the delivery of public services such as education and health care. This second public service draws a large number of the most talented candidates from the civil service pool by offering higher wages and better conditions. Other challenges involve the need to undertake a more systematic pay and grading review than the current ad hoc PRR approach allows, and the need to redouble efforts to invest in the skills and development of civil servants, and provide them with the physical infrastructure and operations and maintenance expenditure to do their jobs (UNAMA 2004, 59).

Their role was to audit the current civil service law and to draw up an inventory of the issues the Commission will have to tackle with the view to reforming and modernizing the Afghan civil service.

Since October 2002, UNDP has provided the Commission with expertise on civil service issues in order to progress in defining the strategy, the mission and the work plan. In collaboration with the Ministry of Communication, UNDP is executing and implementing the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Capacity Development Project that will provide an opportunity for the Government and Afghan people to enter the digital era. Some of the project\u2019s aims include supporting national ICT policy development and enabling civil servants to apply effective ICTs in meeting the challenges of the transitional government. UNDP has contributed to ICT policy development, training of ICT specialists, technical and management support to the Ministry of Communications,and the establishment of ICT training centres in Kabul, Khost, and four regional capitals. In April 2004, 78 civil servants graduated from the courses offered through the ICT project. UNDP also implemented the Afghanistan Information Management Services Project in order to strengthen the capacity of the Government and community in the collection, analysis and management of data and the dissemination of information to enhance the planning and implementation of relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction in Afghanistan. Other achievements include the distribution of hundreds of maps, blueprints and schematic drawings to government departments; the introduction of standard protocols for data sharing in over 100 organizations; and the provision of direct capacity-building support to 11 government departments and Kabul University. UNDP provided assistance to the Government in managing and coordinating foreign aid flows to Afghanistan. Relevant activities included the creation of a donor assistance database; facilitation of the National Development Budget preparation process; and the establishment of a Public Information Unit at the Office of the President and an Aid Management Unit in the Ministry of Finance. The Islamic Transitional State of Afghanistan and UNDP also signed a project agreement to promote South-South cooperation. The aim of the Technical Cooperation between Developing Countries Project is to support and build the institutional capacity within the Government by learning from the experiences and good practices in other developing countries. UNDP has presented the Technical Cooperation between Developing Countries Project concept to various ministries and engaged in consultations and negotiations with potential contributors of technical assistance and other donors. UNDP designed a project for Institutional Capacity Development for the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs aimed at providing technical assistance and capacity building support to the Ministry. The project is particularly focused on the Training and Advocacy Department of the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs and other ministries in support of the Ministry\u2019s strategic approach to the institutionalization of the gender mainstreaming process and the strengthening inter-ministerial collaboration. Activities include training in the areas of gender awareness, gender mainstreaming and public administration, and office and financial management.UNDP has also worked closely with the Minister as part of the Gender Advisory Group. In 2004, UNDP began assisting the Training and Development Department of the IARCSC in conceiving and organizing training and development programmes for qualified civil servants and to build capacity within the Department. Based on the immediate priorities identified by the Government, UNDP supports the IARCSC in the: i) formulation of an overall training policy; ii) the development of a short-term training and development strategy; iii) the development of a leadership development strategy; and iv) the development of a training and development strategy for the provincial and district level. Recent developments concern the strengthening of the capacities of key senior civil servants in priority national government institutions.To this end, a Top Leadership Training Project was designed to assist the Government in implementing a Civil Service Leadership Development Strategy that was developed with UNDP assistance. Implementation of this Leadership Development Strategy requires the design and launch of several competency- based development programmes aimed at strengthening the capacity of the top civil service cadre so that they are able to assist the Government of Afghanistan in implementing the many far-reaching reforms that will be needed in the years ahead. The project will target at least 550 civil servants. UNDP also launched a project to advance women and create equal opportunities in the Afghan Civil Service. The project will provide initial support to the IARCSC in developing and launching a multi-dimensional long-term strategy in order to increase the gender balance and promote equal opportunities in the Afghan civil service. Also important to mention is UNDP\u2019s assistance in building up the capacities of the Secretariat of the National Assembly. Public administration and its reform The origins of public administration in South Asia date back to the 13th century.

The colonists continued the bureaucratic emphasis in public administration and by the time they departed in 1947, India (then incorporating Bangladesh) had, \u201cone of the most developed civil service systems in the world\u201d (ibid., 28). Twenty-four years later when Bangladesh seceded from Pakistan it was anticipated that rapid progress would be made in public administration. Bangladesh already possessed the basic elements of a modern bureaucracy and it was believed that through reform and nationalist commitment, an efficient and effective system of public administration could be produced. This could be achieved by removing the bureaucracy\u2019s, \u201celitist character, illiberal outlook, formalistic operational style, intolerance of politicians and\u2026dogmatic, patronizing attitude\u201d(ibid., 53). This optimistic scenario has not come to be; instead there has been little progress in PAR. Maintenance of the status quo has been the dominant operational goal. There have been attempts to reform the bureaucracy,as recorded in a multitude of reports, commissions and committees (see Box 4). However, the recommendations of these instruments have generally been in favour of only minor incremental reforms and there has been little enthusiasm elsewhere in government to advocate more radical changes. Even multilateral and bilateral donors have been unable to promote substantial change. UNDP, World Bank and DFID (the United Kingdom Department for International Development) have all engaged in projects aimed at advancing the design and implementation of PAR. Their sponsorship of reform, especially under the umbrella of \u2018good governance\u2019, gets entangled, distorted and discarded in the political battles between the two leading political parties and in the opposition of elite civil servants to major change. This means that although PAR has received a lot of attention over the past three decades it has not been translated into practice. Instead of progress in public administration there are persistent and sometimes worsening dysfunctions in the civil service. Public administration is still, \u201clargely centralized, excessively reliant on hierarchy and multiple layers of decision-making\u201d (Keuleers 2004a, 6). Downsizing either the number of ministries or staff has never been a policy concern despite 41 Country experiences in public administration reform: South Asia Bangladesh the increase in both. Human resource planning has been non-existent, while the performance management system has never worked towards the improvement of bureaucratic performance. Training is not linked to career planning or other aspects of personnel management, let alone better public service delivery. Promotions at the upper levels (ranks of secretary and additional secretary) are generally confined to the generalist cadres (especially the administrative cadre), who continue to resist any reforms that would pose a threat to their privileges17 and career prospects18. Moreover, the devolution of career management functions of certain cadres to the ministry/division level has resulted in the compartmentalization of the senior civil service, with each cadre developing their own organizational culture19 (Keuleers 2004a, 7). Corruption remains a serious problem and has led to waste and inefficiency. Budget management is disorderly and financial accountability is unenforceable (Zafarullah et al. 2001). Politicization of the bureaucracy has had adverse effects on performance, while obsolete techniques and management practices continue to characterize the public sector. Successive governments have not learned from the successful reforms of other countries and have not sought to adopt and adapt these positive lessons to the environmental realities of Bangladesh. Finally, the little that is known about public opinion reveals widespread disillusionment and citizen dissatisfaction with the public sector (World Bank 1996). However, the possibility of creating efficient,effective,and accountable development organizations in Bangladesh has been demonstrated by the NGO sector through large undertakings such as the Grameen Bank and Bangladesh Rural Development Committee, each of which operates nationwide. There were some signs that the Government is moving beyond the rhetoric on PAR. In early 2003, a Cabinet Committee on Administrative Reform and Good Governance was established, and a special Good Governance Cell was set up in the Cabinet Division. But government commitment remains doubtful and progress continues to be frustratingly slow. UNDP assistance to PAR UNDP started its interventions in PAR in Bangladesh in the 1980s.

The main purpose of the Study was to explore ways to support the Ministry of Establishment, the Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre (BPATC) and the Staff Training Institute. The Study recommended strengthening training of public officials at intermediate and lower levels, redefining the missions of the existing training institutions, establishing a training wing in the Ministry of Establishment and small training cells in all major ministries. The Study also proposed setting up a Training of Trainers Institute within BPATC to enhance the quality of training instruction. Recommendations were made in the area of personnel management, including the development of a personnel planning system, and a more decentralized personnel management system administered through personnel officers in the different ministries. A number of recommendations were implemented (e.g., merging different training institutions such as NIPA, COTA and BPATC into one,creation of a training wing in the Ministry of Establishment etc.), but most of the more important and far-reaching reform proposals (e.g., government-wide job analysis programme, development of an open system for career advancement) did not materialize. In 1989, UNDP sponsored the preparation of a report titled Mobilization and Management of Public Resources in Bangladesh. The report focused largely on deficiencies in public expenditure planning and budgeting and accounting, but also contained a section on the civil service. The report emphasized that no single institution was responsible for civil service reform and that there was a lack of coordination between different agencies responsible for recruitment, training and promotion of civil servants. Further, training rules and regulations had not been embodied in any coherent policy framework. The report recommended the preparation of career development plans for all civil servants, and linking them with their training needs. Many of these recommendations,still valid today,did not receive sufficient attention from the concerned institutions. In 1993, UNDP sponsored a comprehensive Public Administration Sector Study for Bangladesh.The Study covered five key areas: i) organization and structure of government; ii) civil service management; iii) performance and accountability; iv) decision-making issues; and v) human resource development (HRD), education and training. The Study made a set of recommendations aiming for a more streamlined,merit-based,and results-oriented public administration. The Study also proposed to strengthen the Public Service Commissions, to decentralize the implementation of personnel policies to ministries, and to replace the cadre and class system with a personnel management system based on position classifications and grades. Systematic training needs assessments were also proposed as well as the appointment of a special reform implementation commission. Bureaucratic resistance once again obstructed further implementation of the reforms. UNDP\u2019s most recent involvement in PAR involved support to the Office of the Auditor and Comptroller General, and the Support to the Administration Reform Commission project. The latter was undertaken from October 1997 till March 2001 and funded by UNDP at a cost of US$ 1.3 million.

Many of these proposals are in line with the basic concepts of the NPM thinking concerning performance-based and results-oriented administration in view to achieving better and more cost-effective service delivery. At the end of the project, the Commission was dismantled and its recommendations are still under consideration. The report was seen by some to be too piecemeal and disconnected (e.g., simplification of payment of travel tax, modernization of registry in the Secretariat, use of A4 paper size in government offices, and preparation of a draft Freedom of Information Act). However, the Commission also made recommendations on substantive and politically sensitive reform issues (e.g., reduction in the number of government organizations and staff through rationalization and contracting out; reorganization of field administration and speeding up the process of decentralization and devolution to local governments; introduction of a Senior Management Pool to ensure representation of all cadres and facilitate fast-track promotion for all meritorious officers; and measures for combating corruption including the establishment of an Independent Anti-Corruption Commission and Criminal Justice Commission). It is also important that, for the first time, a donor directly supported a government-led initiative. The Public Administration Reform Commission, itself a temporary body, recommended the creation of a Public Administration Reform Monitoring Commission to be located in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office instead of securing a sustainable institutional set-up to manage a reform process. In 2003 the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister reiterated the Government\u2019s commitment to development management through improved professionalism of civil servants at all levels and sought UNDP\u2019s cooperation in this regard. As a programmatic response, UNDP Bangladesh has been in negotiation with the Government to support its PAR agenda. The objective of the Developing Civil Service Capacity for the 21st Century Administration Preparatory Assistance Project, prepared in 2004, is to ensure further capacity assessments in selected institutions and broad stakeholder consultation in view of preparing UNDP\u2019s long-term support to capacity development for civil service reforms and administrative modernization for the 21st century. During this preparatory assistance, the project will prepare the groundwork and initiate selected activities to start capacity development in the BPATC, which is to become the apex training institution and think-tank for the public administration. Public administration and its reform Bhutan is a small landlocked country nestled in the Himalayas between China and India. Until the late 1950s there was a self-imposed policy of isolation. The economy was subsistence based and non-monetized,while there was no modern road infrastructure or formal school system. Even today, agriculture is the dominant occupation for about 80 percent of the population, while the adult literacy rate is only 47 percent. Bhutan has cautiously opened up to external influences and the idea of modernization. Its approach to development seeks to achieve harmony between economic forces, the environment and spiritual and cultural values (UNDP 2000a). Preservation of its unique culture is especially important as it defines Bhutan\u2019s national identity. Thus, it is Gross National Happiness rather than Gross National Product that is the measure of success for Bhutanese development. Bhutan was one of the last countries in the Asia- Pacific region to establish a modern system of public administration, despite this slow start between 1977 and 1987 the numbers of public servants doubled from about 5,500 to over 11,000. Subsequent growth has been more modest with about 14,000 public servants in 2000. The Government has declared that its objective is to create and maintain, \u201ca small, compact and efficient civil service\u201d. Growth must be contained. Much PAR activity has focused on strengthening the institutional capacities of the public service as the lack of skilled personnel has been identified as a constraint on achieving national development plan objectives. Thus, there has been considerable investment in HRD ranging from short competency-based training courses through to overseas scholarships.

Reforms involving HRM and HRD are supposed to complement two other major PAR policy objectives of government \u2013 decentralization and promotion of the private sector. Decentralization has been identified as the way to produce efficiency, transparency and accountability in government. However, translating the ideals of decentralization into reality has proved to be a long-term affair and is still incomplete. The public service also has a considerable distance to go to provide effective and sustained assistance to the promotion of the private sector, described in one UN document as still being in an \u2018infantile state\u2019.The role of public administration will be one of creating an enabling environment for private sector development and perhaps even instigating some private sector involvement in what, until now, has been exclusively public sector work. A new Public Services Act is currently being drafted and is expected to be tabled in this year\u2019s National Assembly session. The Act will provide the much-needed legal framework for the civil service and will provide a detailed outline of the institutional setting and clear TORs for the civil service and the Royal Civil Service Commission. In 2001,His Majesty,the King of Bhutan,initiated the drafting of a new Constitution. The final draft was submitted to the Bhutanese people for review in March 2005. The draft was distributed through the media and made available on the web, both in Zhungkha (the national language) and English (http://www. bhutantimes.com/draft_constitution.pdf ). Bhutan\u2019s draft Constitution establishes a Democratic Constitutional Monarchy. It also provides for the establishment of various constitutional agencies that have key roles to play in the public sector such as the Royal Audit Authority, the Royal Civil Service Commission, the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Pay Commission. Once ratified by the people through a referendum,the new Constitution will replace the current Royal Decree under which Bhutan has been run for more than 50 years. Interestingly, it is proposed that the Constitutional positions would be appointed by the King, but on the joint nomination by the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice, the Speaker of the National Assembly, the Chairperson of the National Council and the Opposition Leader. UNDP assistance to PAR UNDP has been a key development partner of the Royal Government of Bhutan in its PAR initiatives. In the recent past, UNDP assistance has primarily focused on building the institutional capacities of key ministries and other government organizations to facilitate the achievement of national development plans. The Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Royal Court of Justice, the Royal Civil Service Commission, the Ministry of Communications, the Royal Institute of Management, the Department of Planning, the Department of Budget and Accounts have all received assistance. UNDP has contributed to enhancing capacities for policy evaluation, restructuring, and human resource development and management. Some interventions have involved elements of financial management and budget-related procedures as well as initiatives in the Civil Service Training Institute. In addition to building the capacities of civil servants at national and district levels, UNDP has taken PAR down to the grassroots level by targeting district and block level functionaries. District Development Committee and Block Development Committees are comprised of elected officials to whom certain developmental functions have been decentralized. Prior to UNDP intervention there had been no formal training programmes for these officials. However, the Government\u2019s policy of decentralization and people\u2019s participation has meant that increasingly these functionaries are at the centre of development programmes. Interventions at this level have been largely strengthening skills in planning, implementation, monitoring, budgeting, and financial management as well as overall knowledge in management in areas such as leadership skills and time management. UNDP has also played a role in the promotion of ICT to bridge the digital divide and as a tool to facilitate development. ICT initiatives include support to the Ministry of Communications in operationalizing its regulatory role, planning, drafting policy, and building up the information infrastructure. Specifically, UNDP has provided support to the drafting of the Bhutan ICT Policy and Strategy as well as the ICT Act.The Strategy has now been adopted by the Government and the draft ICT Act is expected to be tabled soon. UNDP is also currently providing support for drafting of an Information Access and Telecentre strategy. Auditing in Bhutan has so far been limited to \u2018traditional\u2019 financial auditing. UNDP will provide support to the Royal Audit Authority through capacity development for performance auditing that will lead to increased responsiveness in service delivery.

Initially, recruitment was restricted to British subjects but after 1935 the number of Indian appointees grew considerably and provided the experienced officers who assumed administrative control after independence in 1947. The civil service grew rapidly after independence as the State assumed new functions and expanded others. In 1951, there were 1.5 million public servants employed by central government, 2 million by 1960, and 3.7 million in 1980. Today, there are approximately 8 million public servants divided almost equally between the central and state civil services. These 8 million employees are divided by a rigid personnel classification,which involves numerous ranks and grades. Indian public administration has been accused of exhibiting many bureaucratic dysfunctions that have contributed to under-performance. Familiar criticisms include: seniority dominates over merit, routine over creativity, procedural accountability over accountability to the public, and generalist orientation over technical expertise.Public sector organization is based on hierarchy with communication flowing vertically downward. Buck-passing is alleged to be commonplace, while corruption is identified as a major problem. Public administration is judged by some as over-secretive and typified by delaying tactics and indifference (Paul 2000). The bureaucrats are seen as distant by the public they are supposed to serve. They have even been characterized as a separate caste.The public service has been described as a prisoner of its existing framework and its officers of having a reputation for resisting change (Khan 1998). There has been no shortage of commissions, committees and experts to study public administration and recommend reforms to India\u2019s system of public administration since independence in 1947. However, very little progress has been made as few of the recommended measures have been implemented. Despite the urgings of international organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bureaucratic inertia has worked against systemic change. However, internal pressure from the public, CSOs, media and politicians has been mounting for PAR and there have been some experiments and innovations. For example, e-Governance has attracted attention with experiments in such things as supplying market information for farmers, issuing land titles, and the collection of utility and other payments (see Box 5). Initial results of PAR activities reveal a range of risk factors such as frequent changes in administrative leadership, hurried implementation and over-ambition.In a few states (e.g., Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh) citizens\u2019charters have been introduced to boost efficiency in the delivery of services and to increase accountability and transparency in government. However, problems have arisen such as the inadequacy of information provided to the public and too little thought given to staff training and equipment. Participation has been vigorously promoted by CSOs and has been manifested in such initiatives as citizen feedback through report cards in Bangalore or citizen juries to shape visions of the future for rural development in Andhra Pradesh. These initiatives must be considered against a backdrop of limited progress in rationalizing the multitude of different laws, manuals and rules that determine bureaucratic operations. Capacity building needs remain massive.Talk of introducing a performance orientation to public administration has not been translated into reality.For example,performance budgeting has met with little success while annual staff appraisals do not measure performance. The notions of value for money or results-based public administration have not made significant headway in the bureaucracy. The idea of privatization has been gaining ground, especially regarding non-core functions. There has, however, been no attempt to corporatize 46 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific India 47 Country experiences in public administration reform: South Asia government organizations. Budgetary pressure may yet prove to be an extremely strong imperative for PAR with the central government adhering to a fiscal deficit of no more than 5 percent. Another impetus for PAR has come from government\u2019s increasing interest in governance. The Tenth Plan (2003-2007) places more emphasis than ever before on governance and considers it as a key factor for achieving the developmental targets set in the Tenth Plan. It identifies particular governance priorities many of which have direct relevance for PAR. First, there is emphasis on greater people\u2019s participation in decision-making through panchayati raj institutions (rural local government institutions), local bodies, self-help groups, women\u2019s groups, user groups, associations and trade unions. Government partnerships with civil society are seen as becoming more important, especially in the drive for poverty eradication.

Third, the Tenth Plan stresses the need for judicial reforms to speed up the process of delivering justice, including more frequent use of alternative delivery mechanisms and a new National Charter for Social Justice. Fourth, there is specific civil service reform that is intended to: \ufffd Enforce the right to information guaranteed through state government Right to Information Acts and the central government\u2019s Freedom of Information Act; \ufffd Minimize discretion; \ufffd Achieve greater transparency in policies; \ufffd Build capacity and increase; \ufffd Right-size government; \ufffd Strengthen accountability at all levels; \ufffd Facilitate stability of tenure of civil servants; \ufffd Revamp the system of rewards and punishment; \ufffd Improve professionalism; \ufffd Reform to eliminate unnecessary procedural controls and regulations; \ufffd Formulate a master plan on e-Governance; and \ufffd Revamp present systems of performance appraisal, promotions and lateral movement. In 2003, the Surinder Nath Committee submitted a comprehensive report to the Government of India on the system of performance appraisal,promotion,empanelment and placement for the All India Services and the higher civil services of the Union Government. Box 5: Improving citizens\u2019 access to information in India Using access to information as a means of achieving accountable, transparent and participatory government has been the scope of a UNDP sub-programme in India. Its aims are: \ufffd To sensitize public authorities to the need to provide information and to develop a better understanding of the issue of the right to information; \ufffd To improve information management systems and implementation of development programmes; and \ufffd To enhance capacity of citizens to make reasonable demands for information, and increase participation, especially of women and marginalized groups, in governance. Under this sub-programme, information kiosks are being set up to provide information in the local language to citizens in five locations: Jhalawar (Rajasthan), Mandya (Karnataka), Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), Bhuj (Gujarat) and Kalahandi (Orissa). These initiatives aim to establish one-stop contact points for citizens to access various government services and information. The services and information to be provided under this project include online submission of applications, grievance redressal system, details of ongoing development work, below poverty line list,online agricultural prices, and information on Public Distribution System. During the same period, the Yugandhar Committee submitted a report on building up of skills and competencies by providing training to All India Services Officers at different stages of their service careers. The findings of the Committee revealed the immense training requirements that still remain. While both reports were still under review in February 2004, the previous Government appointed a new committee with a comprehensive TOR to examine a range of civil service reforms. The purpose of the new report was to make proposals to render the civil service responsive and customer-friendly, transparent, accountable and ethical in its actions and its interface with the people.The report also made recommendations to make the civil service more e-Governance friendly. Recent developments in PAR are linked to the governance initiatives undertaken by the new Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh. The Prime Minister emphasized the need for reform of public institutions at the state and central levels to ensure accountability in the provision of public services, transparency in handling of public funds and aligning incentives with desired outcomes. The Prime Minister also pointed to the need to build a national consensus on the fundamentals of governance, over and above the interests and ideologies of political parties. He has called for an effective and inclusive public delivery system,focused on the people, ensuring equal opportunities for vulnerable groups. Two recent changes coming out of the Prime Minister\u2019s governance initiatives that have taken place are the passing by parliament of the amended central Right to Information Act in May 2005 and the introduction of a new performance appraisal system. The amended Right to Information Act provides for the regime of right to information for citizens to secure access to information under the control of public authorities, in order to promote transparency and accountability. The Act also provides for the establishment of a Central Information Commission, as well as State Information Commissions, with powers equivalent of a civil court (e.g., to decide on appeals, requisition public records, summon persons and compel them to give evidence etc.). The changes in the performance appraisal system for the bureaucracy include the replacement of the existing system of assessment based on an Annual Confidential Report by the Performance Appraisal Report. The Report will evaluate government officers against 15 to 20 performance indicators e.g., work output, personal attributes, functional competency,etc.A new system of peer review of senior officers by an Eminent Persons Group", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc3ff67c-aa3e-40b5-91ec-da24db496c50": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc3ff67c-aa3e-40b5-91ec-da24db496c50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75c50f4b3b75d6516e3642bf1518501f115bc06153f24ba679dc58e7a8a93565"}}, "hash": "75c50f4b3b75d6516e3642bf1518501f115bc06153f24ba679dc58e7a8a93565", "text": "has also been introduced.

UNDP assistance to PAR In India,UNDP is seen as politically neutral,has a positive standing with civil society, and can connect to a network of resources to facilitate informed decision-making among all stakeholders rather than impose particular agendas or policy choices. These combined elements favour partnerships between UNDP and government and CSOs in the governance area, particularly for governance reforms that are pro-poor,pro-women,and pro-marginalized. Some of the changes effected through UNDP-supported PAR programmes have been: \ufffd Introduction of a systematic approach to training, specifically addressing the following stages of training: assessment of training needs (training needs assessment tool kit); planning and preparation of training packages (design of training); delivery (direct training skills); and evaluation of training; \ufffd Augmenting distance-learning capacities by developing distance-learning packages that can facilitate decentralized training and strengthening of sub-state training centres in the districts; \ufffd Enhancement of public policy training capacity in India by developing a long- duration training programme in public policy targeted at mid-career civil servants from a mix of cadres; and \ufffd Preliminary work has begun on establishing a virtual knowledge network in the area of civil service training and public policy. 48 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific 49 Country experiences in public administration reform: South Asia Of particular interest to UNDP, government and society has been access to information initiatives aiming to support accountable, transparent and participatory governance. These efforts have attempted to address: \ufffd Assessing and strengthening of the existing legal and policy framework in respect of access to information; \ufffd Enhancing capacity of civil servants and elected functionaries in local bodies to supply information; \ufffd Putting in place more systematic management of information that enables easier access, e.g., through use of ICT; \ufffd Enhancing awareness and capacity of the citizens to demand information, and facilitating the process through CSOs; and \ufffd Building perspectives of and providing a platform for interaction of a diverse set of stakeholders on the issue. In line with the recent developments initiated by the new Prime Minister and mentioned earlier, UNDP has provided assistance to the Government by sharing relevant knowledge for the development of a Code for Good Governance, which will be discussed with the states and result in efficient delivery of services to the citizens, and effective implementation of programmes. Public administration and its reform Maldives is an Indian Ocean microstate comprised of small islands with a population of about 300,000.The country was never colonized and so did not experience the administrative implants and histories of the larger South Asian states. Indeed, Maldives has demonstrated substantial gains in human development since the 1970s when it began to actively trade and interact with the rest of the world (UNDP 2000b). For example, in 2001 life expectancy at birth was 69 years,adult literacy was 97 percent, while GDP per capita was US$ 2,082 (UNDP 2003a). The Government has placed considerable importance on education and health, and is committed to improvements in the amount and quality of service delivery.Thus, it invests over 10 percent of GDP in these sectors. As a result of these developments, Maldives is now due to graduate from the ranks of the LDCs, making it the second country that will have done so since the establishment of the LDC group in 1971. Yet, the Maldivian islands remain vulnerable because of their small size and low elevation in times of rising sea-levels and changing monsoon patterns. The country has 1,190 islands, of which 198 are inhabited. Of these islands, only 33 have a land area greater than one square kilometre. One third of the inhabited islands have a population of less than 500,and 70 percent of the inhabited islands have a population of less than 1,000.This extremely low population density makes Maldives unique, even among small island archipelagic states. It also raises the cost of delivering social services and of public administration, as there is little scope to generate economies of scale. Under the Fifth National Development Plan (1997-2000) the Government set the course for establishing a responsive and efficient system of governance that includes streamlined and efficient public administration, an effective system of justice and adequate involvement of people in the setting of priorities, and in the implementation of development programmes (UNDP 2000b, 70).

Laws from other Islamic nations have been examined to determine their appropriateness, in modified form, for the Maldivian situation. To ensure official responsiveness and give voice to the far-flung population, a number of representative committees have been established: Atoll Development Committees, Island Development Committees and Women\u2019s Development Committees. Limited local capacity for planning and management has meant that these institutions have not had the desired effect. However, the Government has persevered in promoting the decentralization of the planning and management of development activities. It Maldives 50 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific has also established its National Vision 2020, which provides the goals and strategies that require the support of an effective system of public administration. The impact of the Indian Ocean Tsunami in December 2004, as well as global warming (which will have serious implications for Maldives within a 50-year timeframe), has accelerated the process of population concentration on fewer and safer islands. However, this strategy is expensive due to the need for sea-walls and other tsunami protection measures. The number of focus islands therefore needs to be limited to about one per atoll, where there are essential services. The development of a national broadband network to provide access to Internet-based public services within atolls is also an important element of the Government\u2019s strategy to improve the coverage and quality of local government. A revision of the 1998 Constitution is in progress and the revised Constitution will soon be distributed to the wider public. UNDP provided financial, technical and logistical support and assistance to the Maldives Law Society. The review of the Constitution is in line with statements made by the President highlighting the need to modernize the system of governance and the distribution of powers through a clearer separation of powers, with an effective and accountable system of government. Public administration and its reform Nepal is one of the poorest countries in Asia with 38 percent of its population living in poverty. Its already weak economy suffered a sharp downturn in 2001-2002 due to a Maoist insurgency, political instability, and unfavourable developments in the global economy.This deteriorating situation coincided with the start of the Government\u2019s Tenth Five Year Plan (2003-2007) and also its poverty reduction strategy. According to the Plan, improvements in governance are key requirements for Nepal\u2019s development and PAR is seen as a component of governance which has a major role to play in generating progress. Efficiency and effectiveness are lacking in a bureaucracy that seems to suffer from a multitude of ailments. As concluded in the 2003-2007 National Plan,\u201cweak governance is a key determinant, which cuts across and exacerbates the impact of other factors on the poverty pattern, including ineffective government, poor resource allocation, weak implementation and service delivery performance and corruption and leakages.\u201d Others have noted the slowness of service delivery, in part a result of the hierarchical nature of public sector organizations, and the lack of people orientation among public servants. Corruption is acknowledged to be a problem, while salaries, benefits and opportunities are said to be unattractive to high-performing university graduates. Performance evaluation is a formality rather than a process which measures and rewards competence; seniority rules over merit. There are allegations that the skills and knowledge of many public servants are inadequate or obsolescent. Accountability to the public is poorly developed, while decision-making is undertaken away from the public gaze and without public consultation. Finally, the bureaucracy appears not to be representative of Nepalese society, as the three higher castes dominate public service employment. There have been previous efforts to reform the bureaucracy, but the recommendations of commissioned reports have often remained unimplemented or official actions have only resulted in minor adjustments to administrative structures and processes. However, the current crisis of economy and governance has forced the Government to take more concerted action for PAR.This includes a US$ 35 million loan from the ADB. Even before this loan commenced the Government had taken steps to strengthen tax administration and to make tax laws and procedures simpler and more transparent. Measures have included a self-assessment system for taxpayers, legislative and procedural changes to streamline VAT, excise and customs, and a new Inland Revenue Department has been created by merging the Department of Taxation with the Value Added Tax Department. Further, there have been moves to contain public expenditure and improve efficiency in its utilization. Public enterprises have also come under scrutiny, as they appear to have poor profit records and are hampered by the politicization, rather than professionalization, of Nepal 51 Country experiences in public administration", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cef91d7e-950e-4cf6-9aa3-da94f67359cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "cef91d7e-950e-4cf6-9aa3-da94f67359cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b2392095dcbcbb4b31630b8abe4b47e1cc29fdc0494f9ce59f98b34cb240ce6"}}, "hash": "1b2392095dcbcbb4b31630b8abe4b47e1cc29fdc0494f9ce59f98b34cb240ce6", "text": "reform: South Asia their boards and staff.

Improving the legal framework to improve corporate governance is a high priority of government as is some privatization. For the remaining public enterprises, stricter accounting and auditing practices will be enforced. In order to contain current expenditure and generate savings the Government has plans to downsize the bureaucracy. The number of ministries has already been reduced from 26 to 23, while a voluntary early retirement scheme has been introduced. Pay has been increased and a reward system reportedly prepared. A total of 7,518 vacant posts are to be eliminated, although progress has been slow. The removal of these posts will reduce the openings for political and patronage appointments. To complement this initiative the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of General Administration will also implement a stricter appointment process involving professional job assessment. A computerized personnel database has been installed to improve efficiency in HRM. To combat corruption the Government has introduced new legislation and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office has assumed the task of preparing a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy. The components of this strategy include: \ufffd The establishment of a citizen\u2019s charter; \ufffd A mechanism for the time-bound delivery of services; \ufffd Improved auditing and accounting standards; and \ufffd Measures against revenue leakage (2003b, 19). The new laws provide for a National Vigilance Centre and the declaration of property and income by all public servants. Strengthening of the Commission for the Investigation of the Abuse of Authority has also been set in motion. By winning over 40 convictions in 2002-2003 the Commission has shown that the reforms have had a significant effect \u2013 it only won one case in the previous twelve years. Decentralization of financial and administrative authority is a major commitment of government which is not only meant to empower the largely rural inhabitants of Nepal but also bring greater efficiency and effectiveness to the delivery of services. Until now, inadequate financial and human resources have hampered decentralization.The new plans involve introducing a poverty-based formula for the allocation of block grants,improving HRM in local governments, strengthening the capacity of district technical offices, and decentralizing agricultural extension, basic health, education and postal services. These changes will be challenging. Budget constraints will limit available funds for block grants, while there needs to be considerable capacity building to enable local governments to take over central functions and to construct new relationships with line ministries. The handing over of school administration, including appointments of teachers and principals, to school management committees of local people has moved slowly. Unfortunately, most of the reforms are now stalled, as the Maoist insurgency is hindering the implementation of government plans for decentralization. The ongoing conflict has resulted in severe disruptions of administration at district and village level in many areas of the country. Village Development Committee Offices have either been destroyed or abandoned, and central and local government buildings have been targeted by insurgents. Recruitment and posting of staff in both rural and urban areas outside Kathmandu is a major challenge. Since February 2005, when the King dismissed the Prime Minister and his government, a state of emergency has been in place. The King has assumed full executive powers,and a number of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Constitution have been suspended. UNDP assistance to PAR UNDP Nepal has been extensively and substantively involved in the area of decentralization and local governance, especially after the restoration of multi-party democracy in 1990. Support at the national, district and local level is aimed at promoting decentralized local governance. The major programmes are: \ufffd Participatory District Development Programme (PDDP); \ufffd Local Governance Programme (LGP); \ufffd PDDP/LGP Bridging Phase; \ufffd Rural Urban Partnership Programme; and \ufffd Decentralized Local Governance Support Programme. UNCDF has provided support through the Decentralized Financing and Development Programme while PDDP, LGP, PDDP/LGP Bridging Phase and their successor programme, the Decentralized Local Governance Support Programme have been supporting the local bodies at the district and village level.The Rural Urban Partnership Programme has focused its attention on the municipalities. All of the above programmes are geared to promote decentralized governance in Nepal through the provision of support to central level agencies in the preparation and implementation of Acts and Guidelines, building capacity of the local bodies to manage and deliver basic services at the villages level, and empowering the communities through social mobilization programmes, especially targeting disadvantaged groups, indigenous minorities, and poor people including women.

Districts have adopted a Participatory Planning and Monitoring System. UNCDF\u2019s support is in the area of fiscal decentralization, including the piloting of a performance-based budget allocation system. In accordance with the Local Self-Governance Act, the Government has announced the devolution of four sectors (agriculture, education, health and postal services) to the local bodies. The Decentralized Local Governance Support Programme will support the implementation of sector devolution guidelines and the Local Service Act, which is still in the process of being drafted. Due to the Maoist insurgence, most of these reforms are now on hold. Another major area of UNDP support is the empowerment of communities through the social mobilization process, especially targeting disadvantaged groups and indigenous minorities, including women. The programme, which is managed by a board of local representatives and community leaders, is being implemented in 662 out of 3,913 villages. More than 19,000 community organizations have already been mobilized benefiting nearly 2 million people. Public administration and its reform Public administration in Pakistan shares a common heritage with Bangladesh and India. The foundations of administration were laid down in the pre-colonial societies of the sub-continent, while British colonial authorities introduced modern bureaucracy. Following independence Pakistan,like neighbouring India, experienced rapid bureaucratic growth as the number of agencies, enterprises and public servants multiplied. Public administration also developed the dysfunctions that characterize other South Asian bureaucracies and which have proved so difficult to overcome. It appears that, \u201cthe capacity and quality of public institutions has been declining over time\u201d (World Bank 2004c, 1). There are pockets of excellence, however the overall picture is of a public administration that needs substantial improvement if it is to make a significant impact on poverty alleviation and provide the enabling environment for private sector development. Although the growth of budgetary expenditure slowed down during the 1990s, structural imbalances worsened. Defence and interest payments accounted for up to 70 percent of federal expenditure by the end of the 1990s. Although there have been cutbacks in budgetary expenditure the prospect for further reductions is limited. Indeed, more funds are required for essential operations and 52 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific Pakistan maintenance of key infrastructure, social services such as education and health, and investment in high priority projects (World Bank 1998, ii). A comprehensive overhaul of public expenditure was recommended by the World Bank in 1998, but progress has been slow in implementing needed reforms. The recommended reforms included (ibid., vii): \ufffd Rethinking the role of government; \ufffd An integrated medium-term approach to planning and budgeting; \ufffd Effectively prioritizing among broad spending categories; \ufffd Restructuring public sector institutions and service delivery; \ufffd Decentralization of management; \ufffd Civil service reform; and \ufffd Greater accountability for public expenditure. While civil service reform is identified as one of the necessary measures to ensure Pakistan\u2019s development,all of the other recommendations for actions rely on civil service reform. Prominent among the problems of public administration is weakness of technical and managerial skills. Competence in both these areas has been declining largely due to the inadequacy of resources devoted to HRD. Also, the recruitment exams for civil service entry rely on outdated syllabi and inappropriate application criteria.Promotion criteria have been queried by external agencies while there is no systematic policy on placements and transfers of personnel. The proportion of the workforce in public sector employment in Pakistan is not large by international standards but its productivity is poor. The employment is heavily skewed towards lower grades. The gap between public and private sector salaries has steadily increased in favour of the private sector. There is little lateral movement in the public service with personnel staying within their hierarchical organizations and defending their operational areas against other functional bureaucracies. There is also little accountability to the public. The Government has recognized there are severe problems afflicting public administration in Pakistan and, in 1999, created the Cabinet Committee on Civil Service Reforms. Subsequently, there have been reforms in devolution, police, tax administration, and public financial management and procurement.

Among the many, planned reform initiatives are an Executive Development Programme, a Professional Development Programme, strengthening of the Ministries of Finance and Commerce, the promotion of more effective devolution, pay and pension reform, recruitment and promotion reform,and improved monitoring and evaluation. Public administration and its reform The history of PAR in Sri Lanka is one of missed opportunities and ad hoc initiatives that have had little beneficial effect on improving administration and alleviating poverty. Since 1970, there have been six attempts at PAR, but lack of political commitment, resistance from within the civil service, piecemeal approaches and the absence of permanent institutional settings to entrench the reform process were considered the main reasons for subsequent failures20. 53 Country experiences in public administration reform: South Asia 20 The latest commission was established in 2000,to make proposals for a comprehensive salary review.The report of the commission was published but not taken into consideration by the then new Government.The recently elected Government has requested the National Council for Administration to revisit the recommendations made in the 2000 report of the Salary Commission. Sri Lanka 54 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific A major reform was outlined by the Presidential Administrative Reforms Committee in 1986 but the recommendations, although accepted, resulted in \u2018no serious action\u2019. A decade later, another major reform was designed and adopted by government. The reform was enthusiastically endorsed by the President and external authorities who even saw the recommendations as, \u201cserving as a general model of civil service reform for other South Asian nations\u201d (Root et al 2001, 1358). However, resistance among political actors and within the bureaucracy itself resulted in a loss of momentum and direction \u2013 \u201cthere was no tangible outcome\u201d (ADB 2004, 7). Moreover, even PAR reforms relating to specific sectors, such as health and education, \u201chave not led to any serious attempts at effective implementation\u201d (ibid.). There is currently a new initiative with the creation of an Administrative Reforms Committee under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. There are many longstanding impediments that face the Administrative Reforms Committee. Inter-service rivalry has undermined the efficiency and effectiveness of the bureaucracy while quality has been adversely affected by a steady lowering of entry standards (Root et al. 2001). The merit principle has been subverted by politicization of the civil service. Demoralization and overstaffing have been the results of this development. Observers allege that patronage has become a dominant principle of public administration. This has contributed to the development of a public service where officers are reluctant to take decisions, communications between superiors and subordinates are neither open nor frank, in-fighting between administrative cliques is common, the voice of the public is ignored, responsibility is denied, results and outcomes are subsumed by recourse to quoting rules and regulations, and informed decisions about investment and implementation priorities are impossible to make given problems of information availability (ibid.). Decentralized authorities do not have appropriate power or control over human resources and financial matters. In short, there has been an avoidance of reform. Policy management has been poor with sector and sub-sector ministries initiating the unilateral introduction of policies. Inter-agency coordinating mechanisms are absent at the centre and between the centre and devolved authorities, while institutional memory is lacking. Public expenditure management has remained a critical problem especially as resources are denied to provincial councils leaving them dependent on the centre. Human resource problems have intensified with political considerations determining decisions in this area. Even a recruitment freeze has been subverted by the granting of exceptions to facilitate extra appointments. In fact, with the change of government in April 2004, the recruitment freeze has been totally lifted. Low compensation has exacerbated the quality deficiencies of personnel in the public service, whether they are recruits or senior officers seeking promotion. Training is often irrelevant while centralization of personnel matters undermines the declared commitment to devolution. The delivery of public services has been a constant concern of post-independence governments resulting in an ever-lengthening menu of services provided by the State. Unfortunately, this has contributed to a decline in the quality of services delivered,\u201cin terms of access, equity, efficiency and sustainability\u201d (ibid., 15).

The Government has acknowledged that a primary responsibility is, \u201cto ensure that public resources are used productively and that the public sector can significantly improve its performance\u201d. Strategies and legislation are emerging to fulfil these ambitions. The establishment of the National Operations Room in 2003 to monitor implementation of programmes and projects could make a significant impact on performance management. The Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act 2003 could make a major contribution to fiscal management. It aims to contain budget deficits within 5 percent of GDP by 2006 and ensure prudent management and predictability in finances. However, efforts to set up a revenue authority to enforce oversight of income tax, customs duties and excise duties, which could have contributed to reducing corruption and enhanced revenue collection, has been rejected by the new Government. Regarding HRM, the Government has instituted strategies to attract better staff, basing all appointments on job- specific requirements, \u2018restructuring and retooling\u2019training institutions,and asserting the political neutrality of public servants. The challenge of these and other reforms will be, \u201cto avoid ending up with a fractured, uncoordinated and disjointed list of reform activities\u201d and to ensure that the reforms are implemented (ADB 2004, 28). 55 Country experiences in public administration reform: South Asia The peace process, which started in 2002, provided new opportunities to redress the situation and to mobilize the country\u2019s rich potential of resources to restore trust in the economy and revitalize the key governing institutions. The process was halted in April 2003, when the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) withdrew from the negotiations. The elections that were conducted in 2004 brought a new government to power. The Government has pledged its commitment to continue the peace process, yet the situation remains fragile. Today, the country finds itself at historic crossroads. If the right direction is chosen, Sri Lanka has the potential to regain its status as a strong economic power in South Asia (Keuleers, 2004c, 1). Within this uncertain political climate, there is general agreement that public institutions are in need of fundamental reforms. The main problems facing public administration in Sri Lanka relate to issues of: i) accountability (between policymakers and service providers,policymakers and citizens and citizens and service providers); ii organizational efficiency and effectiveness (hampered by outdated working methods/ organizational culture and archaic rules and practices for personnel and performance management); iii) cumbersome relationships between central ministries and the field administration (provincial councils) and between the divisional secretaries and local governments (lack of clarity over the accountability relationship of the central, provincial and local governments); and iv) insufficient financial resources. The Government recognizes the importance of sound public management as a prerequisite for achieving equitable growth and poverty reduction, and has therefore again put public sector reform on the priority agenda.PAR is now one of the main clusters under the National Economic Development Council. However, the institutional framework for PAR appears complex with a risk of overlapping responsibilities between several bodies and departments (Keuleers, 2004c, 6). UNDP assistance to PAR UNDP assistance to the public sector dates back to 1989, when attempts were made to strengthen the management capability of the Government\u2019s apex public service training institute, the Sri Lanka Institute for Development Administration. Another initiative involved establishing the Restructuring Management Unit to enhance public sector management. At the end of three years these two projects produced the following results: \ufffd Rationalization of structures and cadres of eight selected ministerial departments; \ufffd Rationalization of structures and cadres of three provincial councils. A task force was established to formulate strategies and programmes to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in the functioning of the provincial councils; \ufffd Work procedures and systems were improved in three areas: pensions, land administration, and titled registration; \ufffd A comprehensive manual containing financial guidelines for divisional secretariats was prepared; and \ufffd A project for the establishment of a computerized divisional level accounting system was designed. At the conclusion of these two projects in 1994, a further project as preparatory assistance was implemented for public sector management improvement. It enabled the Government to establish the Centre for Enhancement of Public Sector Management. The objective of this project was to prepare an action plan for public service reform.The Cabinet approved this action plan in January 1997. In order to implement this plan,a further project was designed with UNDP assistance in 1997. The objective of this project was to enhance the efficiency of the public service to successfully implement government development activities, but using the private sector as the engine of growth in the context of economic liberalization and a decentralized structure of government.

In 2004, UNDP received two official requests from the new Government to support public administration improvements in the Ministry of Education and in the Ministry of Finance and Planning. Both ministries play key roles in the poverty reduction strategy and the achievement of the MDGs. Assistance to the Ministry of Education offers an excellent opportunity for UNDP to facilitate the development of a more people-centred education administration, by creating new forums for managing people\u2019s participation in the service delivery process. Assistance to the modernization of the Ministry of Finance and Planning will not only have an impact on the quality of revenue collection and expenditure management, but would also provide a venue for supporting the process of making the financing of service delivery transparent and accessible to the population. UNDP would further support capacity development to promote and support the ongoing change management initiatives in the Ministry, to prepare a model methodology for process re-engineering/functional reviews, the development of an ICT strategy for the entire Ministry and also to further the agenda in the area of HRM (Keuleers 2004c). Two preparatory assistance projects have been developed planning for reforms to be undertaken on a pilot basis in close collaboration with the National Council for Administration,the Public Sector Reform Cluster of the National Economic Development Council and the Public Service Commission, and the Ministry of Public Administration, Management and Reforms. Further, in September 2004, the UNDP Country Office in Colombo received a concept note from the Commission for the Investigation of Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) to strengthen the functioning of the Commission. CIABOC was established in 1994 under the 17th Amendment to the Constitution, and the Bribery Commission Act No. 19 of 1994 and has considerable powers to investigate and prosecute allegations of corruption against public officials. Although the Commission has brought in a number of actions against senior government officials including former ministers, it is handicapped by a lack of modern office infrastructure including a computerized environment and training for staff. The Commission needs improved capacity to investigate the complaints it receives from the public and to effectively prosecute cases brought before it. An important element in the UNDP assistance project\u2019s strategy will be the application of a rights-based approach to development. Using CIABOC as the primary duty holder, and the people subjected to, and affected by corruption, as claimholders. The strategy will aim to increase the accountability of duty bearers and empowerment of claimholders. It will also assist Sri Lanka to comply with the requirements of the UNCAC and provide technical assistance to CIABOC as the lead anti-corruption agency. 56 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific 57 Historically, the Asia-Pacific region has had a number of strong governments that have steered development from the top down (e.g., China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea and Singapore). Highly centralized bureaucracies delivered many economic rights and achieved notable reductions in poverty. For many developing countries in the region today, achievement of MDGs 2 to 6 depends to a large extent on the quality of their service delivery, the building up of human resources and the professionalism of the public service (Keuleers 2004d, 5). Thus, it is not surprising that the focus of attention has remained largely on the executive branch of government and, consequently, that the dominant theme in PAR in the Asia-Pacific has been the modernization of bureaucracy. While it has been appreciated that there are severe shortcomings with the actual bureaucratic structures and processes that have operated in the Asia-Pacific this has not dimmed the enthusiasm for a Weberian ideal-type construct of bureaucracy (see Box 6).This model has retained a loyal following among public service elites who have most often been able to direct the design and implementation of PAR. They are attracted by what the model has to offer rather than by the pathologies that frequently characterized bureaucratic operations in the region. The retention of the bureaucratic ideal does not mean that elites have not been interested in PAR. On the contrary, there has been considerable interest but the preferred method involves incremental adjustments. Even systemic reforms may not disturb the commitment to the bureaucratic model. For example, in Viet Nam, a Public Administration Reform Master Programme has been introduced for the period 2001-2010. This comprehensive approach to PAR builds on small-scale incremental changes over the previous decade. While the Vietnamese Government\u2019s new programme promises much bigger changes across the public administration system,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4367bc20-5338-4b43-bfad-8adb4ebd4d2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4367bc20-5338-4b43-bfad-8adb4ebd4d2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9597e462e1bd672eb351c6a634a728375d8723051ee48cdcff398245fff65544"}}, "hash": "9597e462e1bd672eb351c6a634a728375d8723051ee48cdcff398245fff65544", "text": "it still involves bureaucratic modernization. As such, the programme fits with an established pattern of change. Trends in public administration reform in the Asia-Pacific 6 Box 6: Attraction and deficiencies of Weber\u2019s Model of Bureaucracy Max Weber adopted a sociological approach to bureaucracy looking at it as a particular type of organization.His ideal-type bureaucratic construct was characterized by a clearly defined division of labour, an impersonal authority structure, a hierarchy of offices, dependence on formal rules, employment based on merit, the availability of a career and the distinct separation of members\u2019 organizational and personal lives. Such a form of organization represented,said Weber,the \u201crationalization of collective activities\u201dand was \u201ccapable of attaining the highest degree of efficiency\u201d. It was increasingly found in the professionalization of administration in the modernizing societies of the late 19th century, both in the public and private sectors. Elements of the model could also be found in much older civilizations such as China. Many bureaucratic leaders in the contemporary Asia-Pacific region have often been socialized to believe in the efficacy of the Weberian ideal type. They are attracted by the appearance of rationality, the promise of predictability, the safeguarding of hierarchy, the clear differentiation of functional areas, and the seeming devotion to merit principles. The champions of bureaucracy sometimes turn a blind eye to its shortcomings or,at minimum,understate them. However, there is ample evidence of cumbersome processes, lack of transparency, red tape and rent-seeking. Loyalty may often be valued over capacity, while employment can be based on who you know rather than what you know. The prime orientation is to process rather than outputs and outcomes. All of these dysfunctions are protected by minimal accountability, especially to the public that is being served. The popularity of bureaucratic modernization has been challenged by NPM. Emerging in the 1980s in a group of English-speaking OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries (Australia,Canada,New Zealand, the United Kingdom and USA) and gathering momentum in the 1990s, this new managerial approach to the public sector borrowed from the private sector and sought to introduce some of the principles and disciplines of the market into public administration. Among the characteristics attributed to NPM are that it focuses on results; it features flexibility in HRM; it is concerned with measuring performance; and it opens service provision to market forces (see Box 7). However, NPM has been described as a \u2018slippery term\u2019 (Manning 2001; Turner 2002), as a multitude of initiatives has congregated under its broad umbrella. This did not dim the enthusiasm of governments in NPM\u2019s countries of origin and in multilateral agencies for exporting NPM both within the OECD and to developing countries (Minogue 1998). While there are some examples of experimentation with the NPM in the Asia-Pacific (e.g., Malaysia, Mongolia and Pacific Island States) it is evident that most policy makers have not been moved to engage in the wholesale import of NPM. There are two reasons for this. The first is the perception that NPM is a threat to established patterns of bureaucratic authority and state authority in general. This occurs because NPM demanded the adoption of a new ideology of public administration involving a shift from organizing principles of bureaucracy to those of markets. The second reason is that some of the items on the NPM menu are inappropriate for the countries in the Asia-Pacific as NPM derives from a few Anglo-Celtic countries of the OECD and has been designed and implemented to fit with conditions prevailing there. Much of continental Europe has been less enamoured with the fundamental ideas and prescriptions of NPM. Why then would countries with radically different organizational environments and levels of development in the Asia-Pacific be expected to embrace NPM? But NPM has not been entirely avoided by Asia-Pacific governments.This would be difficult as the NPM menu is long and includes some items that are familiar to Asia-Pacific countries and others that do not appear particularly threatening to major stakeholders. Where there has been sustained incremental PAR over several decades, such as in Malaysia and Thailand, items from the NPM menu have been adopted. Malaysia has strong bureaucratic institutions and a long tradition of incremental reforms oriented to promoting greater efficiency. Its legal and state structures have British roots. Thus, Malaysia has the conditions that encourage and allow the selection and experimentation with NPM initiatives.Thailand\u2019s embrace of elements of NPM has been more recent but enthusiastic. Other countries in Asia have been more hesitant in importing NPM-style reforms but have done so where they fit with their established patterns of public sector reform.

Schick (1998) has stated that developing countries should be cautious about NPM-style reforms. They need to have the discipline and skills to adopt them. Others have issued more general warnings about transferring institutions and organizations to alien contexts (Turner and Hulme 1997; Bale and Dale 1998). In the Pacific Islands for example, where NPM has been introduced in a number of countries, there has been an overall bias towards the macro- economic aspects of reforms and reducing public expenditures, often at the expense of 58 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific Box 7: Major features of New Public Management 1.

Questions related to equitable service delivery, mechanisms for client feedback and clear and transparent regulations seem to have been less prioritized. Cultural aspects also seem to have been overlooked. For example, it is not clear how departmental autonomy on hiring and wages combined with fixed-term contracts would work in practice in a small society (Samoa) where family and kinship ties are particularly strong (ADB website). However, there is also an alternative view that the \u2018new contractualism\u2019 that lies at the heart of New Zealand\u2019s NPM reforms may be adaptable to new environments such as Mongolia (Laking 1998). The challenge for the future is to explore the possibilities offered by bureaucracy. This would involve both building bureaucracy and then loosening it up. Building bureaucracy is most important in those countries where public administration has collapsed. Post-conflict societies such as Afghanistan, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste are countries where public administration requires complete rebuilding. There are also cases where the type of bureaucracy that has developed has become increasingly characterized by dysfunction \u2013 red tape, slowness, excessive centralization, lack of attention to outputs, insensitivity to clients, and corruption. Many Asia-Pacific bureaucracies demonstrate such characteristics in varying degrees. Loosening up bureaucracy concerns increased responsiveness, client focus, output orientation, transparency, and accountability. The emergence of these desirable characteristics occurs when there is movement towards democratization and where there is a properly functioning bureaucracy on which to build.Evidence of this loosening can be found in many Asian countries in initiatives such as the Client Charter in Malaysia, the quality management programmes of the Philippine Civil Service Commission, government-civil society cooperation in some Indian states, people\u2019s audits in Thailand, output-oriented budgets in Samoa, and outsourcing to the private sector and NGOs in many countries. 59 Trends in public administration reform in the Asia-Pacific Box 8: New Public Management in New Zealand Throughout the 1990s, New Zealand went through one of the most far-reaching public sector reforms ever attempted anywhere in the world, mainly featuring privatization and reform of public sector operations in accordance with market concepts of competition and efficiency. It resulted in the widespread dismantling of vertically integrated departments, the institutional separation of policy from operations, the flattening of management hierarchies and the creation of autonomous delivery agencies. Public management moved from a rule-based approach to a results-based approach. Senior managers were granted considerable discretion over operations, but the autonomy was constrained by reporting, monitoring and accountability requirements. Accountability was based on performance agreements. The reforms came at a high cost. Many lost their jobs and those who remained in the public sector were subject to an increasingly stressful work environment and reduced job security.The reforms that were cited by so many as the model reform of the recent times appeared to be less successful than anticipated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74a622a6-fea9-4bac-aa3f-7c3dcb0328bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "74a622a6-fea9-4bac-aa3f-7c3dcb0328bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1867b473dfedaca9859e2f5cab273c506ae219ec4e2d897fa4a1a0cac978ac92"}, "2": {"node_id": "0fe36778-ed22-48fa-bccb-994fad00e2ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a37d841946dd40f84e0462d5b99f1402859ca319ab843c5c5426bb8765eaf398"}}, "hash": "805251f2ff3e538026005a7d251bab58b0a2eddedafa99e4e520e8a3d7dd24b0", "text": "One of the concerns raised was that the dismantling of a unified civil service through the devolution of the employment function had eroded a sector-wide ethos of service, while constant restructurings had sapped staff morale (Shaw 2003, 3; Lawton 2003,6).Since the change in government in 1999,consecutive centre-left ministries have begun to address the institutional damage sustained during the first generation of the reforms (Shaw, 2003, 1), a process that appeared to be warmly welcomed by the civil servants themselves.In May 2003, the Cabinet agreed to a Human Resource Framework that will coordinate the training and management of staff across each of the government departments.Work is also being done on simplifying the accountability arrangements that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b57362a-2974-413f-950c-c5a2b6697895": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b57362a-2974-413f-950c-c5a2b6697895", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac47853ca007aa56529cf5cb26b46870b9d488aa181eacdd17d49a72460faab2"}, "3": {"node_id": "06957150-cbdf-4dfd-9c78-daa04d754c0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eeb317205c8b5cfeed0804ee674f2d4b97880042c47b3c3b16a119d0133c9121"}}, "hash": "18928c0640e0132348a0f2d9dd38bd9c8a864cdd4313436af6460a12dffde374", "text": "apply to departments and on shifting departments\u2019focus from the production of outputs to the achievement of outcomes (Shaw 2003, 11).

Source: Keuleers,P.(2004b) \u2018Civil Service Personnel Management \u2013 Key Issues for Consideration When Assisting Civil Service Reforms in Developing Countries\u2019,paper presented at the UNDP Global PAR sub-practice retreat in Bratislava. UNDP has a longstanding record of being the most active player in PAR in the Asia-Pacific. Over the past five years there have been a large number21 of PAR or PAR-related UNDP-funded projects in most developing countries in the region. These PAR interventions have been described in the preceding country studies and summarized in the country tables found in Appendix 1. These tables are based on information obtained from most of the Country Offices22. It should be noted that one project may cover more than one area of intervention in the tables. At the extreme, a single project may involve activity in all eight identified areas of PAR activity (e.g., the GPAR project in Lao PDR, the PAR Master Programme in Viet Nam or the support to the Good Governance for Human Security Project in Mongolia). There has been considerable variation between countries in the number of projects and areas of intervention, the amount of funding and the nature of the PAR activities. Countries with large PAR portfolios (currently or in the recent past) are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Lao PDR, the Philippines,Sri Lanka,Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. While some other countries had fewer PAR projects they were either very large in scope (e.g., the Mongolia Management Development Programme in the 1990s) or were politically crucial within the development portfolio of the country and enabled UNDP to play an active, visible and leadership role in PAR (e.g., Cambodia,Viet Nam and Lao PDR).Yet, the data clearly demonstrate that UNDP has been involved to a significant degree in all areas of PAR across the Asia-Pacific region.The data also show that UNDP\u2019s interventions in PAR have been most intensive in North and Southeast Asia. In the South Pacific region UNDP has been restricted in its PAR activities and so has only a modest profile. In seven of the countries in which it has been active, there has been involvement in only one or two areas of PAR. For example, in Samoa there were initiatives in the categories of finance and ethics, accountability and transparency23. In Fiji, UNDP was only engaged in one HRM project.It should also be noted that as the populations of South Pacific countries are extremely small \u2013 most below 1 million and many under 300,000 \u2013 the amounts of investment have been correspondingly small. This is not due to a lack of demand or need for PAR, but is due to the involvement of other actors such as ADB, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand. Indeed, when counting all donor contributions, there has been more PAR funding, whether measured in terms of numbers of public servants or populations, in this region than in South Asia or East and Southeast Asia. The presence of these other donors has meant that UNDP has not been much required or called upon in the PAR field. For one South Pacific country (Timor-Leste) it has been a different story with heavy UNDP involvement in PAR. This fits a pattern found elsewhere that sees UNDP as the leading agency in rebuilding public administration after complex political emergencies. In Timor-Leste24, UNDP has been engaged in the full spectrum of PAR activities including policy, organization, work processes, HRM, ethics and accountability, and training institutes. In Northeast and Southeast Asia, UNDP has been extremely active in many countries, sometimes assuming the role of leading donor or donor-coordinator for PAR. At various times the latter has been the case in Cambodia,China, Lao PDR, Mongolia and Viet Nam. Each of these countries can be described as transitional, having economies that are moving from centrally planned to market, albeit at different 61 UNDP and public administration reform in the Asia-Pacific 7 21 Based on the (incomplete) information received,the number amount to over 70 PAR or PAR-related projects. 22 More detailed data on projects implemented over the past five years are still lacking for a number of countries. 23 Information obtained from the UNDP Results Oriented Annual Reporting (ROAR).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06957150-cbdf-4dfd-9c78-daa04d754c0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "06957150-cbdf-4dfd-9c78-daa04d754c0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac47853ca007aa56529cf5cb26b46870b9d488aa181eacdd17d49a72460faab2"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b57362a-2974-413f-950c-c5a2b6697895", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18928c0640e0132348a0f2d9dd38bd9c8a864cdd4313436af6460a12dffde374"}}, "hash": "eeb317205c8b5cfeed0804ee674f2d4b97880042c47b3c3b16a119d0133c9121", "text": "23 Information obtained from the UNDP Results Oriented Annual Reporting (ROAR). 24 It should be noted that this report has classified Timor-Leste as a South Pacific nation but others might place it in Southeast Asia. paces.

In all of these countries UNDP has been involved in the various PAR sub-fields shown on the tables in Appendix 1. The Philippines stands out as the country with the most PAR interventions over the past five years, followed by Viet Nam and Lao PDR. In South Asia, UNDP involvement in PAR has also been considerable, but projects are not as numerous as in East and Southeast Asia. There have been UNDP projects in all South Asian countries with all countries showing activities across a broad range of PAR sub-fields. For example, in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka, the reported data show activities in most of the PAR sub-fields. One of the major recipients of UNDP PAR funding has been Afghanistan which, like Timor-Leste and Cambodia, is a post-conflict society where public administration required total reconstruction. It should be noted that the World Bank classifies most South Asian countries, with the exception of Iran, Maldives and Sri Lanka, as Low Income. By contrast, the countries of the South Pacific and East and Southeast Asia are more mixed, involving countries spanning the entire range from Low Income to High Income. UNDP involvement in PAR can also be analysed in terms of the types of activity. A summary of this information can be seen in Appendix 1. The most obvious observation is that UNDP has been involved in the full range of PAR activities in all sub-regions (albeit to a lesser extent in the South-Pacific). The policy and processes sub-fields boast the most activities (see Appendix 2). Interventions in support of training institutes may be somewhat exaggerated, and probably include project activities that involve training,rather than direct capacity development and support to training institutions. What is apparent, however, is that projects always span several sub-fields, sometimes all eight. This is certainly the case with the larger programme-type of PAR interventions (e.g., the CAR support project in Cambodia, the GPAR project in Lao PDR, the Management Development Programme in Mongolia, or PAR projects in Viet Nam). 62 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific Through its long involvement in PAR in the Asia-Pacific, UNDP has built up some key strengths in these activities.These include: Trust: Having been involved in PAR for much longer than other donor organizations, UNDP has built considerable social capital among Asia-Pacific governments. This intangible, yet vital, social asset is represented in networks built and maintained on trust. This can be especially so in smaller countries where there is sometimes the feeling that large multilateral or even bilateral agencies are exerting too much influence on the shape and pace of PAR.A UNDP survey in the Asia-Pacific corroborated these observations noting that, \u201cthe organization\u2019s widely regarded status as a neutral and objective development partner over the years has accrued considerable trust from government\u201d(UNDP 2003d, 28). Expertise: Due to long involvement in the field or in specific countries there is the widespread belief that UNDP has considerable technical expertise in the field of PAR or at least is skilled in accessing appropriate expertise. This is a reasonable claim given the current and past portfolios of UNDP\u2019s PAR activities in the Asia-Pacific.Due to the differential nature of PAR activities between countries, types of expertise may be more apparent or concentrated in some countries than others. If there is good knowledge of this distribution within the organization then it can be deployed effectively as required. In addition to the quality of its support, UNDP\u2019s comparative advantage and niche should also be seen from the perspective of the wide-ranging nature of innovative projects that it has undertaken in the broader area of PAR. Long-term investment: UNDP has demonstrated to a number of countries that it is prepared to view PAR as an incremental process that takes time to get moving and longer to see beneficial results. This is especially the case where governments are anxious about venturing into new territory and need to build up their own confidence in designing and directing the reform process. Lao PDR and Viet Nam are good examples of UNDP\u2019s long-term investment and confidence building. Partnerships: The term \u2018partnerships\u2019 is used widely today to apply to almost any inter- organizational relationship. It is also imbued with the idea of being something positive and desirable. However, in many cases it simply represents a shift in terminology to describe types of relationships that already existed. For UNDP,the idea of partnership is well established both with host country governments and also with bilateral donors. In many instances, UNDP has been able to forge partnerships with these bilateral", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b40cae22-6d0a-41b9-830c-94cc7cfc3c0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b40cae22-6d0a-41b9-830c-94cc7cfc3c0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2404594955bef8af657ac8f29d35086d1bb6422202e858a826edea90df9a0bba"}, "3": {"node_id": "571e4b92-5faf-47a6-89f3-9a6f2f8be7a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b27ea5d13969c3d97809d4b71f7d04bc3b50ba614fda85350cf69b6c77f21ba"}}, "hash": "68c29ed31d84a9ae7cbbf4df1ade27d224975de187b06df70fe6ebd92996d888", "text": "donors so that resources are combined and coordinated to achieve maximum effectiveness. Coordination: As a logical corollary of its commitment to partnerships, UNDP has necessarily built up its skills in coordination.This is especially manifested in coordinating the inputs of multiple donors.It is less clear whether UNDP has managed to facilitate coordination among government agencies working in overlapping policy areas. This is a more challenging task in situations where ministries and even their component parts jealously guard their functional territory. 63 UNDP strengths in public administration reform 8 Specialization: While this survey of UNDP\u2019s involvement in PAR in the Asia-Pacific revealed participation in a wide range of activities, there are nonetheless some obvious specializations where UNDP has developed comparative advantage: \ufffd Post-conflict countries where UNDP has taken the lead in rebuilding public administration and has often coordinated the activities of other donors (e.g., Afghanistan,Cambodia and Timor-Leste); \ufffd Transitional countries which are moving from centrally planned to market economies (e.g., Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Mongolia and Viet Nam); and \ufffd Least developed countries of which there are 14 in the Asia-Pacific region (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Lao PDR, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu and Vanuatu). However,UNDP has not developed expertise in PAR in the small island LDCs judging by the limited number of projects in these countries. 64 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific In the 2003 UNDP/RBAP survey25, 12 out of 21 Country Offices reported that \u2018PAR and anti- corruption\u2019 was a priority area (UNDP 2003d, 4). Only one priority area, decentralization and local governance, outranked PAR with a score of 17. Another table in this same survey uses a larger number of categories or service lines but confirms the perceived importance of PAR among the region\u2019s governments.If overlapping categories from this table are added to the specific PAR category then there is even more interest in the broader field of PAR (e.g., e-Governance and Access to Information). More recent surveys (MYFF 2004) show that Access to Justice has now become the dominant service line, followed by Decentralization and Local Governance. Given the role of the public administration in achieving the MDGs, PAR is set to remain as a leading item on the broad governance agenda in the Asia-Pacific region. However, for UNDP to continue as an effective participant in PAR there needs to be reflection on its achievements and strengths. UNDP\u2019s future contribution to PAR must build on experience, capacity and opportunity. It does not simply mean doing the same things but will require adjustment and innovation if it is to retain its position as a major contributor to PAR in the region. Opportunities will be available for strategic initiatives based on the strengths developed over years and on the ability to identify new possibilities where UNDP can utilize these and newly emerging strengths to add value to governments\u2019 plans for improvements to PAR. Given the reported interest coupled with the amount of PAR activity in the region it is thus somewhat surprising to read in the 2003 Survey that a few Country Offices expressed \u2018some caution\u2019 over UNDP\u2019s future in PAR. Two of them even suggested that UNDP, \u201cdiminish or move away from its activities in civil service reform\u201d (UNDP 2003d, 29). At first sight this seems to be at odds with the demand from many of the region\u2019s governments for assistance with PAR. However, this is not necessarily so. What these opinions indicate is that UNDP is facing a number of pressures in its environment relating to PAR and needs to consider its strategy very carefully. Withdrawal seems extreme and undesirable but there may be other options that should be considered, such as fewer types of PAR activities or activities in a reduced numbers of countries. The leading environmental influences and challenges that are affecting UNDP in its PAR pursuits are set out below. The widening field of governance: The field of governance has become the leading concern for UNDP, but there have been a growing number of activities that have been placed under this umbrella. Projects concerned with legislatures, electoral systems, economic governance, e-Governance, ICT policy, gender equity, CSOs and partnerships and anti- corruption are among the wide range of \u2018areas of interest\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "571e4b92-5faf-47a6-89f3-9a6f2f8be7a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "571e4b92-5faf-47a6-89f3-9a6f2f8be7a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2404594955bef8af657ac8f29d35086d1bb6422202e858a826edea90df9a0bba"}, "2": {"node_id": "b40cae22-6d0a-41b9-830c-94cc7cfc3c0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trends-and-challenges-public-administration-reform-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68c29ed31d84a9ae7cbbf4df1ade27d224975de187b06df70fe6ebd92996d888"}}, "hash": "4b27ea5d13969c3d97809d4b71f7d04bc3b50ba614fda85350cf69b6c77f21ba", "text": "This means there has been increasing competition for funds and human resources among these different aspects of governance.

If a broad definition of PAR is adopted then it also involves decentralization, public finance and possibly other areas of governance. Decentralization is of special concern as it has been identified as the leading area of interest by the region\u2019s governments.It is difficult to disentangle decentralization from 65 Issues for UNDP in public administration reform 9 25 The survey was based on a questionnaire sent to all UNDP Country Offices in the region,aiming to take stock of UNDP\u2019s governance interventions in the region over the period 2000-2003. PAR. Decentralization involves inter- governmental relations and impacts on important matters such as the size of government, HRM issues, the delivery of services, financial transfers and the distribution of authority between territories. The issue for UNDP is whether separation into current service lines works against an integrated approach and the most effective and efficient utilization of resources. Multilateral and bilateral agencies: There has been growing involvement of multilateral and, to a lesser extent, bilateral donors in funding PAR.Until relatively recently,the World Bank and ADB had been little involved in PAR loans. However, that situation has now changed dramatically with the two multilateral agencies giving major loans for PAR activities. For example, the ADB has loaned US$ 45 million to Viet Nam and US$ 35 million to Nepal for their PAR reform programmes. In Thailand, the Government authorized the use of US$ 100 million of a US$ 400 million Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan (World Bank) to support the public sector reform programme. UNDP cannot match the investments made by the World Bank and ADB and so can no longer claim to be the lead agency in PAR in many countries. UNDP simply does not have the resources and runs the risk of being pushed out of the field or at least to the margins where it would play only a minor role. Even bilateral agencies may assume the lead in some parts of the Asia-Pacific region. In the Pacific for example, Australian and New Zealand aid combined with ADB loans and EU grants has kept UNDP on the sidelines of PAR for the island territories. In Timor-Leste, AusAID has announced its plan to invest massively in capacity development for public sector management. In Bangladesh, DFID has been a major source of funding for PAR. Coordination: The increased investment of the World Bank and ADB in PAR programmes raises questions about the traditional role of UNDP as a coordinator of PAR. This traditional role evolved out of the desire of bilateral donors to make efficient and effective use of small investments and UNDP\u2019s willingness to take the lead in an activity in which it had been involved since the 1950s. However, if UNDP is being transformed into a minor PAR player because of loans for extensive programmes of PAR then questions arise as to the suitability of UNDP as a coordinator of PAR activities for the smaller bilateral investors.The key is whether UNDP can persuade such players of the worth of an integrated PAR programme under UNDP coordination. Further, UNDP must be adept at both identifying opportunities and acting quickly when they arise. For example, in Viet Nam, UNDP is no longer involved in public expenditure reform but does maintain a small project that supplies advice to the Minister of Finance. This places UNDP in a strong strategic position at the centre of decision-making on government finance matters. Capacity: A relatively unexplored issue is the capacity of UNDP to design and deliver PAR activities. There is an assumption that because of longevity in the field and a profile of projects spreading across the region that UNDP has considerable capacity for PAR. This needs to be examined empirically. With such high levels of competition within UNDP for scarce resources in governance there is the possibility that the organization\u2019s internal resources for PAR may be stretched thinly. In a recent survey of UNDP\u2019s Country Offices in the Asia-Pacific, queries on this matter were largely ignored,but from those who did respond the results were mixed as to, \u201cwhether lack of internal capacity was a hindrance to achieving good results and impact at the country level\u201d(UNDP 2003d, 29). It should be acknowledged that there may be some definitional problems about what is meant by capacity \u2013 for example, resident technical knowledge versus the ability to respond quickly to requests using the wider UNDP network, SURFs and Regional Centres as well as external partners or consultants.

In theory the matter is simple \u2013 better public administration means better use of resources resulting in improved services, especially to the poor. In practice, matters are not so simple.For example, the links between investing in PAR and improved health, income or education outcomes is difficult to prove in practice. PAR is interrelated with other environmental factors that influence national and local development. Yet, such complexity should not be an excuse for overlooking investigation into the effectiveness of PAR. Questions arise as to whether particular interventions, activities or situations have led to 66 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific the best results. Westcott (2004) has provided a thorough review of the conditions for effective PAR in the Asia-Pacific region based on an evaluation of the experiences of ADB reform initiatives (see Box 9). His conclusions are not new, and some could be questioned, but drawn together as by Westcott,the essential conditions provide a most useful framework for judging the likelihood of success. A general lesson that can also be drawn from Westcott\u2019s analysis is that we have ample information on PAR initiatives to make informed decisions about what is likely to work and be effective and what is not. We cannot predict everything that will happen but we do know that if certain conditions prevail then the chances of success are much higher. In order to determine the future of UNDP support to PAR there is a need to address a series of interrelated questions. The most fundamental question is whether UNDP should continue to be active in PAR in the Asia-Pacific region. The answer to this should be positive based on UNDP\u2019s accumulated experience, its good relationships with governments in the region and the continued demand for PAR activities. If it is accepted that UNDP should be involved in PAR in the Asia-Pacific, the dilemmas it faces concern the challenges posed by a changing PAR environment and the lessons it has learned from its long experience in PAR.These dilemmas are outlined in a series of questions that derive from this analysis of PAR in the Asia-Pacific and UNDP\u2019s role in it, and are detailed in the next section. 67 Issues for UNDP in public administration reform Box 9: Successful PAR and the lessons of experience Conditions needed for reforms to take hold: \ufffd Leadership: heads of state and other top officials have a crucial role in putting reforms on the policy agenda and determining how important they are; \ufffd Vision: comprehensive reforms that take hold are founded on a coherent vision of goals, broad objectives, and notional timetables for bringing about improved public administration; \ufffd Selectivity: reforms take hold when they are important, and have a good potential to be carried out in a timely manner, and to be a catalyst for additional reforms; \ufffd Sensitivity: each country has its own unique historical, political, and cultural context that needs to be factored in; and \ufffd Stamina: any fundamental reform takes time to take hold, and needs to be sustained across changes in government and changes in donor funding. Broad lessons from experience: \ufffd Begin with diagnostic work: governments, development agencies, and other stakeholders are often not fully aware of the administrative challenges faced; \ufffd Test for readiness: pilot initiatives can test the readiness of the Government and society for more fundamental reforms; \ufffd Move at the right speed: this will vary according to circumstances; and \ufffd Implement effectively: such things as vision statements, plans and strategies are of little value unless properly resourced and implemented.

Should UNDP focus on particular types of countries or situations? UNDP has built its greatest PAR expertise and experience in LDCs, in post-conflict countries and in transitional economies. Continuing to undertake and coordinate reform efforts in these countries makes sense. However, UNDP must be prepared to hand over lead agency status to the World Bank and ADB when they become involved in high-cost and often system-wide PAR reforms. However, such situations should be watched closely as the success of these large-scale undertakings is yet to be proven. UNDP can still perform coordinating roles in such situations, but needs to demonstrate to its bilateral partners why it should still be regarded as a lead agency. This requires experienced PAR practitioners who are not always available in each Country Office.

Nonetheless, there are recent cases (e.g., Bangladesh, Mongolia and Sri Lanka) where UNDP has been requested to resume its support to PAR after having withdrawn from the sector some years ago. Should UNDP focus on particular situations? UNDP has been at the forefront of efforts to rebuild countries which have suffered from war and genocide.This is a specialized and vital field in which UNDP has established considerable experience and has the moral obligation to assume leadership over the whole field of governance in these situations. But UNDP does not have a monopoly on post-conflict rehabilitation as has been demonstrated by Australia-New Zealand cooperation in Solomon Islands and recent developments in Timor- Leste. Therefore, the ability to deliver timely quality assistance is one of the most critical elements of UNDP\u2019s success in these post- conflict situations26. Should UNDP focus on particular public administration reform activities? The profile of UNDP projects between 1999- 2003 reveals activity in all the sub-types of PAR. However, should UNDP develop specializations within PAR which would make it the leading source of skills and knowledge in those particular fields? While such a strategy would facilitate role clarification and efficiency for UNDP it might not be so popular with client governments who might expect UNDP to be responsive to their particular needs.There is also the risk that today\u2019s popular PAR specializations will be replaced by others requiring constant shifts in skill-sets by UNDP. Nonetheless, there is now also a clear trend to use accountability and transparency and the human rights-based approach as the key entry points for PAR (and decentralization).It is to be expected that UNDP will increase its interventions in the area of anti- corruption and support to the implementation of the UNCAC. Many activities planned or undertaken at country and regional levels aim to strengthen UNDP\u2019s internal knowledge generation and sharing in this area (e.g., comparative practical experiences with designing tools to promote citizens\u2019assessment of service delivery, comparative study of institutional arrangements for combating corruption). 69 Shaping the future of public administration reform 10 26 The initial years of a post-conflict situation offer many challenges,but also many opportunities that need to be acted upon immediately.Delays in delivery can jeopardise the trust that donors and the government had placed in UNDP to take the leading role in civil service capacity building (Keuleers 2004f,19). Be reactive, proactive or both? Like other external development agencies, UNDP faces the dilemma of how it orients itself to recipient governments: simply react to governments\u2019 requests, actively seek out projects, or combine both orientations. Sometimes multilateral agencies can be regarded as acting upon countries, a criticism that has even been levelled at some bilateral agencies.By contrast,UNDP has built a very high level of trust with partner governments through the perception that UNDP is a neutral actor. Maintaining such strengths is a priority. This suggests that the reactive orientation will predominate over the proactive. Should public administration reform be more closely integrated with decentralization and other service lines? In complex organizations engaged in producing multiple outputs it is necessary to differentiate structure. Nevertheless, organizations also need coordinating devices to bring the different components of work together.Thus, all complex organizations are faced with the dilemma of how much differentiation and what integration is needed to promote efficiency and effectiveness. UNDP has progressively differentiated its products into multiple types of governance. Whether this has been done at the expense of coordination should be investigated. The case of PAR\u2019s relationship with decentralization (as well as with Access to Information and e-Governance) is of particular interest. What is the desirable level of internal capacity for public administration reform? If UNDP is to continue with PAR activities in the Asia-Pacific region then it is advisable to estimate what its internal capacities for such work should be. The task is complicated by uncertainty of future demand and resource limitations.The question of effectiveness should guide such a review. What PAR capacity is needed to ensure that projects will be well chosen and designed, as well as adequately monitored and having the desired impact? Reference to the MDGs is necessary in this regard although, as noted above, clear causal relationships between PAR and human development improvements are often difficult to determine. Obviously, in those countries where UNDP plays a major role in PAR, there is a need to maintain, if not strengthen, Country Office capacities in the area of PAR and anti- corruption. What relationship should UNDP have with multilaterals as regards public administration reform?

The scale of the banks\u2019 investments means that UNDP is no longer the leading organization in the sector. Does this mean, however, that UNDP should withdraw from what might be seen as an overcrowded sector and focus on other urgent priorities in governance? As UNDP has built such social and technical capital in a sector for which there is considerable demand, withdrawal is too extreme a response. However, UNDP may need to withdraw from certain countries (e.g., Middle Income) or activities (e.g.,finance) and may have to adopt supporting roles in other situations. There should be closer scrutiny of how UNDP can still play an important coordinating role for bilateral donors and the nature of partnerships UNDP enters. Cooperation with the multilateral agencies is already apparent in some Asia-Pacific countries and needs to be further developed. Maintaining good communication with these organizations will help to build partnerships with them and in doing so, will contribute to UNDP remaining a significant player in the region\u2019s PAR network. 70 Trends and Challenges in Public Administration Reform in Asia and the Pacific 71 This report has shown that all governments in the region, from Pacific microstates to the Asian giants of China and India,have PAR programmes and are continuing to seek external assistance in their design and implementation.The official recognition of the need for PAR is given additional domestic impetus from a private sector and civil society that are increasingly demanding better services and more accountability. Knowledge sharing and global access to information allows citizens to compare their national systems of public administration with services provided in neighbouring and foreign countries, hence enhancing the pressure for matching achievements in well-being made in other countries. Multilateral and bilateral donors have also put their weight and their resources into PAR thus creating a PAR juggernaut that will keep rolling at least for the next decade. The report also indicates a recent increase in UNDP\u2019s PAR activities in a number of countries, with a strong focus now on accountability, transparency, anti-corruption, and ICT including e-Government. In this regard, an important impetus for public sector reforms is also provided in the UNCAC. Articles 7 to 10 of this Convention identify a series of reforms to be undertaken in the public sector, calling for members states to improve civil service personnel management procedures, in particular for the selection and training of individuals for public positions considered especially vulnerable to corruption; to promote adequate pay and remuneration; to ensure education and training programmes; and to promote ethics, and integrity and proper performance for public servants. Special attention is also paid to enhancing transparency in public administration, including with regard to its organization, functioning and decision- making processes and on simplifying administrative procedures. While the main responsibility for coordinating the ratification of the UNCAC lies with United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (which also responds to technical and political issues regarding UNCAC27),UNDP has a key role to play in assisting in the capacity-building activities required to support the implementation of the UNCAC. As highlighted above, PAR will constitute an important segment of the UNCAC implementation strategies adopted by the State Parties of countries where UNDP is on the ground.

Simon Alexis Finley and Sophie Khan of the UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre led the overall development of the report . 2 Introduct 2 Introduction Emerging from the Cold War at the end of the 1980s, a number of Asian countries were catapulted from communism or conflict to democratic elections . The collapse of totalitarianism as a viable and sustainable mode of governance was accompanied by a push for democracy . Demonstrations in Mongolia led to the first post-communist legislative elections in 1990, while in Cambodia in 1993, following decades of war and political upheaval, the United Nations was called in to administer elections . Reflecting this rapid growth in democratic systems, between 1990 and 2010 the number of electoral democracies in the world, as reported by Freedom House, increased from 76 to 116, rising from 41 percent to 60 percent of the world\u2019s nation states .1 During this time though a view developed within the international community that elections were the ultimate goal of democratic development, an end-point that could beacon exit strategies for democratic and military involvement in fragile states . In this case, while the number of nominal electoral democracies was increasing, many states were not achieving broader democratic reforms such as widening political participation, improving representation, increasing accountability or utilizing elections as a legitimate political change management strategy . Accordingly, electoral democracy has come at a high price in many countries . Each year hundreds of people lose their lives in connection with competitive elections . Electoral violence can suppress voter turnout, affect voter registration, prevent candidates from running for office, acerbate divisions in society, or even postpone an election or prevent it from taking place at all . While electoral violence is a longstanding phenomenon, ballots such as those in Afghanistan in recent years have brought attention to the challenge of establishing a secure environment that can facilitate free and fair democratic elections . But electoral violence is not the preserve of transitional or fragile states . Established democracies in Asia all report some electoral violence: from street protests in Thailand that have gained international 1 Freedom House, \u2018Freedom in the World 2010: Erosion of Freedom Intensifies\u2019, selected data from Freedom House\u2019s annual survey of political rights and civil liberties, 2010 . tion 3 attention since the 2006 coup that disposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, to the 2009 Maguindanao massacre in the Philippines that saw 57 people killed, including 34 journalists, as they drove in convoy to register a candidacy for the 2010 elections . These examples serve as reminders that in order for elections to be successful and non-violent, the goal of democratic development must go beyond the electoral \u2018event\u2019 . Instead, seeing elections as a test of democratic development rather than a goal of it provides a better conceptualization of the processes that are needed to ensure free, fair and peaceful elections . For electoral processes to achieve these objectives they need to rely on the preparation and engagement of key stakeholders including electoral management bodies, political actors, government agencies and security bodies, civic and media groups, and national purveyors of justice to play positive roles in the process . Accordingly, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has become increasingly involved in moving electoral assistance from a focus on periodic elections to one on sustained planning and implementation that places elections within a framework of democratic governance . This report highlights this approach by investigating electoral violence in Asia through analyses of case studies commissioned by UNDP for seven countries in South and South-East Asia: Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand . The ultimate objective of these publications was to draw empirical lessons from each country as helpful guides for policy, legislation and institutional change to promote", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b6e5dfa-2766-4c49-ad80-e7725b0386fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b6e5dfa-2766-4c49-ad80-e7725b0386fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Electoral Violence in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "922f1aa1003c322255052b89d7b8534d70ba79d5e4bc3940995fef6223416917"}}, "hash": "922f1aa1003c322255052b89d7b8534d70ba79d5e4bc3940995fef6223416917", "text": "greater democratic governance . Overall, the country studies illustrate that the key to understanding how each circumstance (fragile or not) perpetuates violence is to contextualize the politics and historical background of each country with its specific electoral and democratic institutions and processes . While the structure and design of the political system are important, understanding the enabling conditions of electoral violence (e .g . a system that promotes a winner-takes-all scenario) requires addressing other important drivers of violence that revolve around real and perceived fraud; corruption; clientelism; patronage; patriarchy; a belief that politics is merely a mechanism for solidifying business interests; and ethnic, religious and socio-economic conflicts and grievances . Each case study was also developed with the benefit of focus group discussions . In addition to the historical background and a description 4 4 of the institutions that underpin the electoral system in each country, the studies are strengthened by the perceptions, recollections and feelings of people on the ground that have been affected by electoral violence . Drawing on information produced by these case studies, this report seeks to clarify key concepts of electoral violence, outline the state of electoral violence in the region, identify who the main actors involved in electoral violence are, and present a brief overview of every case study with recommendations for reducing violence in each country . 5 What is Elec What is electoral violence? Considering the contextual nature of electoral violence it is not surprising that the form it takes differs from country to country . Additionally, definitions can be reconstructed within a country depending on the politics of the violence . To ground the concept however, the types of electoral violence identified in each country study have been consolidated and matched against recent UNDP and academic analysis to produce the following definition: Any acts or threats of coercion, intimidation, or physical harm perpetrated to affect an electoral process, or that arise in the context of electoral competition. When perpetrated to affect an electoral process, violence may be employed to influence the process of elections \u2014 such as efforts to delay, disrupt or derail a poll \u2014 or to influence the outcomes: the determination of winners in competitive races for political office, or securing the approval or disapproval of referendum questions.2 When breaking down the different components of electoral violence there is general consensus on three main forms . The first, and most obvious, is that electoral violence involves acts of physical harm . Assaults and attacks on communities or candidates, gender-based violence, mob violence and political assassinations during the election campaign may force political contenders to leave the electoral process or prevent elections from taking place . The second is that violent
