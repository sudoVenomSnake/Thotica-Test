ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 72 funding, production diversification and develop- ment, and implementation of environmentally sound methods of production. This is a vital issue for many developing countries where small-scale fisheries are a crucial source of livelihoods. Some have expressed reservations about discussing fisheries subsidies at the WTO. Several small-island developing states (SIDS), including Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and the Maldives, proposed \u2018special and differential\u2019 treatment in fisheries for developing coastal states in general and for SIDS in particular. The SIDS were also the first to attempt a broader definition of \u2018artisanal fishers\u2019 and proposed that any new disciplines on fisheries subsidies should exempt government programmes aimed at raising income levels of artisanal fishers. Phasing out subsidies designed to enhance capacity will have major social implications for the fisheries sector in several developing countries and result in significant unemployment in coastal fisheries. Ways of providing alterna- tive employment, either in fisheries or aquacul- ture or in other economic activities, have to be explored. Any investments toward developing such alternatives should certainly be treated as non-actionable subsidies. Policy Directions for Agricultural Trade Developing countries face some complex choices for policies on agricultural trade. They have to consider the impact of such trade on different groups in the population, and examine especially the effect on the most vulnerable groups. Most countries want to maximize exports to earn the foreign exchange needed to finance critical imports. The choice is simpler for those that can produce enough food locally while also being able to export commodities, including food, in order to earn foreign exchange. But even countries that do not have enough good land or other agricultural resources to feed their own populations could conclude that it is economi- cally more efficient to devote some of these resources to high-value commercial crops for export and then use the foreign exchange to import food. This may seem rational from the point of view of economic efficiency, but it may be irrational from the perspective of human development. For while increasing trade in this way might boost economic growth \u2013 and benefit poor consumers \u2013 it is also likely to depress local prices and undermine the livelihoods of poor farmers. Such a policy would also weaken national food security. In principle, all countries should, if necessary, be able to buy food from world markets. But in practice, most countries prefer to reduce future vulnerability by sustaining domestic production of staples. They may, there- fore, prefer to restrict liberalization, fearing that an external shock, like a sharp increase in oil prices or a rise in interest rates, would leave them unable to import sufficient to meet national needs. These different circumstances and scenarios imply that each country is likely to have its own priorities, which will colour its stance in trade negotiations. Exporters like Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and Viet Nam will favour most elements of liberalization, whether this concerns widening market access, reducing sub- sidies or generally increasing competition. Other countries will be more interested in limiting agricultural trade liberalization in order to ensure food security and protect domestic liveli- hoods. These differences are understandable, so donors or international agencies should resist the temptation to straitjacket countries into a single common policy on agricultural trade. Nevertheless, even if all developing country interests do not fully coincide, they may overlap to a certain extent. As a result, there is usually some degree of solidarity in the developing- country camp. This suggests three general stra- tegies: CHAPTER 3: MAKING AGRICULTURAL TRADE WORK FOR THE POOR 73 \u2022 Highlighting inconsistency by the developed countries. The richer countries are often demanding greater access to markets in the developing countries while also demanding the right to protect their own farmers; \u2022 Protecting sensitive products. Agreements should include safeguard measures, especi- ally for \u2018sensitive\u2019 products, in order to protect livelihoods and ensure food security; \u2022 Arguing for differential treatment. Develop- ing countries believe that they, and the poorest countries in particular, should be able to count on a degree of differential treatment. In these circumstances, a number of deve- loping countries will need to maintain agricul- tural tariffs to protect their small farmers and ensure that they", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21005da4-a68d-49f2-b22b-4599e3d48c4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "21005da4-a68d-49f2-b22b-4599e3d48c4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0a992ee280d08da8edd9999b08ad46a5d03f0747e9d8cc627c5cb6dcf2b43a0"}}, "hash": "b0a992ee280d08da8edd9999b08ad46a5d03f0747e9d8cc627c5cb6dcf2b43a0", "text": "can still compete on local markets. But at the same time, they must strengthen the future position of such farmers through land reforms and investment in rural development infrastructure, processing and storage facilities and inputs and, where neces- sary, offer price support. This may seem to privilege farmers over poor urban consumers, and therefore, governments should also ensure the availability of basic foods at affordable prices \u2013 which implies a continuing role for state trading enterprises or the establishment of targeted safety nets. But there can be no ideal common package. Each country will have to fashion its own set of policies, depending on whether it is a food importer or exporter, on the mix of small and commercial farmers and the competing demands of rural and urban areas. No cookie-cutter set of rules will meet the human development needs of all. Harnessing Intellectual Property For intellectual property protection, much more research has gone into the legal and adminis- trative aspects than into its economic benefits. Indeed, the TRIPS agreement itself was drawn up with \u2018remarkably little analysis of its expected economic impacts\u2019.46 This could be costly for developing countries. For most poor countries, this would represent a substantial proportion of the development budget and might more fruit- fully be invested elsewhere. Again, however, there can be no standard model of IPR protec- tion; countries will choose the model that matches their resources and their development prospects and fears over costs. Geographical Indications There is a much stronger case for strengthening protection for well-known GIs \u2013 which tends to cost less than protecting Intellectual Property Rights.47 For most Asian countries that are embarking on this enterprise, the first task is a national effort, ideally at the grassroots, to catalogue what they have and what they might wish to protect and develop. This would include foods, beverages, clothing and crafts, for example, as well as bioresources like plants, herbs and trees. They should also estimate the value of out- put and how it could increase, given sufficient legal, marketing and technological investments. They should also be able to indicate how many people will benefit from the increased output, disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, and income- group. A Fisheries Policy Framework Just as developing countries, and particularly the LDCs, should have some leeway for protecting their poorest farmers, they should also be able to protect fishing communities. This would demand action from both the importing and the exporting countries. The importing developed countries would need to avoid support or subsidies on exports to their own producers, and ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 74 resist efforts to protect them from fair compe- tition from developing countries. But much more also needs to be done in the developing countries that export fish. First, they need to introduce management measures to prevent fisheries in their national waters from being overfished or fished to their biological limits. This would include regulations on mini- mum mesh sizes, establishing closed areas/ seasons, and prohibitions on catching certain species and listing species that cannot be exported below a minimum size. In some cases it should also be possible to redirect the fishing effort to other areas. A number of Asia-Pacific countries are already taking such steps, but these need to be generalized and strengthened. A second option is to produce more of the output through aquaculture. China, for example, has a zero-growth policy for marine capture from its inshore and offshore waters and intends to further boost output from aquaculture and distant water fishing. But because aquacul- ture can be environmentally destructive, China has also introduced what it calls \u2018ecological aquaculture\u2019, to incorporate principles of natural and social ecology, planning for \u2018community development and concerns for the wider social, economic, and environmental contexts of aqua- culture\u2019.48 Other priority fisheries areas are: \u2022 Food safety standards. Develop effective and enforceable national food safety stan- dards and establish their equivalence with those prevailing in import markets. For this purpose, the LDCs in particular should be able to rely on international development assistance. \u2022 Catch certification. As a precursor to inter- national ecolabelling schemes, some deve- loping countries should be able to embark on national certification programmes \u2013 pooling the efforts of national- or state-level fisheries authorities, together with fish- worker organizations and the scientific community. With this experience, Asian countries could be involved in establishing an ISO Technical Committee on fisheries that could work towards an international \u2018ecolabel\u2019 protocol. \u2022 Negotiations on subsidies. In the long run, subsidies should be phased out in most countries.

For capacity-enhancing subsidies \u2013 they could argue for complete exemption for the LDCs. Policy Priorities In summary, the key areas for policy are as follows: 1. Ensure a consistent focus on agriculture. Most of the world\u2019s poorest depend on agriculture and on access to secure supplies of food. Effective policies on agricultural trade are, therefore, crucial to human development and should be kept at the forefront of public debate. 2. Promote solidarity among developing countries. In agricultural trade, developing countries have many interests in common. They can unite, for example, in exposing the inconsistencies of developed country poli- cies. They can also together argue for diffe- rential treatment for the most vulnerable countries, especially LDCs. And as a group they will want to ensure stable prices for food and non-food agricultural products. 3. Accommodate different national interests. Each country must, however, also fashion its own set of policies, depending on whether it is a net food importer or exporter, for example, on the mix of small and commer- cial farmers and on the competing demands CHAPTER 3: MAKING AGRICULTURAL TRADE WORK FOR THE POOR 75 of rural and urban areas. These inherent differences and conflicts of interest need to be recognized and discussed in an open and transparent fashion at national and international levels. 4. Promote the interests of the poor. Trade liberalization is not an end in itself; it is of value only if it benefits the poor. Trade policy must, therefore, incorporate a com- prehensive range of instruments, including tariffs and various types of support for weaker groups. Without this more inclusive approach, public support for any type of liberalization is likely to collapse and provoke wide-scale protectionism. 5. Harness geographical indications and intellectual property rights. One priority should be to establish and protect Geographical Indications, thoroughly cataloguing national assets and the benefits that can be derived from them. Some developing countries could also create national systems for protecting intellectual property rights, though for many this could prove too expensive. 6. Reform national fisheries. Developing countries need to defend the interests of small-scale fishing communities and promote sustainable fisheries in both marine capture and aquaculture, through more effective management. But they also need to respond to current and future international developments by establishing food safety standards, for example, and developing new forms of catch certification. 7. Invest in rural development. In the long term, international agricultural trade is likely to increase. Developing countries should, therefore, help rural communities to be more resilient, by promoting equitable rural development through land reform and carrying out other measures that increase productivity with equity while promoting human development. CHAPTER 4: ADJUSTING TO A NEW ERA FOR TEXTILES AND CLOTHING 79 Developing countries now account for half of the world\u2019s exports of textiles and almost three- quarters of exports of clothing.1 This represents a dramatic turnaround: the sector used to be dominated by the developed countries, but by the 1980s the developing countries had over- taken them and now rely on textiles and clothing (T&C) for a substantial proportion of their industrial production and employment. Many economies in East and South-East Asia have been very prominent in this trade, using the T&C sectors as industrial launching pads: Hong Kong (China), Singapore, Taiwan (China), the Republic of Korea, and Malaysia led the way, to be followed later by China, Viet Nam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Even this expansion falls far short of the full potential. The developed countries, worried about the speed of the decline in their own industries, had established strict quotas by country on imports from developing countries. Under the auspices of the GATT in 1962 they negotiated a Long-Term Arrangement Regard- ing International Trade in Cotton Textiles and Substitutes, which was extended in 1974 to become the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA). This reduced aggregate imports and restricted exports from large producers such as China and India, but it also benefited smaller countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal, whose quotas were sufficient for them to establish new industries. Many countries in Asia, like the developed countries before them, embarked on large- scale trading in industrial goods through textiles and clothing. And from the 1960s several poorer countries in the region were able to capitalize on a quota system that offered preferential access to markets in developed countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33e720d7-fefd-4b1d-a754-86f188d30066": {"__data__": {"id_": "33e720d7-fefd-4b1d-a754-86f188d30066", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9894e09f3c6f30290944cb44dc0007215de51e667f4397df3a839b9bc825bdb8"}, "2": {"node_id": "ddb38bb6-5ba7-4686-8f4a-332ed4ade406", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64a166e4d2073cb228c9e08a903e96e741ae5f6b59f53ce59b06053dbf4b9ca1"}}, "hash": "ee6bdcb1eef2a9099bed9c331eecb36b998d4f69bf7a9213fd469d0653768bf3", "text": "Now that era is over, and a number of countries are struggling to adjust to the prospect of fierce competition, particularly from China.

Women in parti- cular seized these new opportunities. Even in traditionally secluded societies, many more women were able to enter the workforce. This could be an empowering experience: for the first time many women had independent incomes and a greater say in household decision-making. Apart from promoting gender equality, this brought positive benefits for society as a whole \u2013 as women were more likely to use this new income to invest in the education and health of their families. These new industries also brought wider economic benefits. They gave the exporting economies the opportunities to acquire new skills and raise productivity and also diffused knowledge and technology and stimulated other industries and services that grew up around the new factories and their workforces. A healthy textiles and clothing sector in a country has been shown by cross-national statistical analysis to be associated with a higher-than-average income.2 But this economic advance also had social costs. Working conditions in the T&C sector can be harsh and exploitative. The demand for clothing is seasonal and unpredictable, so the industry employs a high proportion of its work- force on a part-time or piece-rate basis without Developing countries now account for half the world\u2019s exports of textiles and almost three- quarters of exports of clothing ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 80 offering job contracts or health or other employ- ment benefits. Women have been especially vulnerable: they might have gained a degree of independence by working outside the home, but they often face discrimination within the factories being paid less than men and obliged to take non-managerial jobs with little opportunity to enhance their skills. Now the era of quotas has come to an end, and the global T&C sector is in the midst of a dramatic upheaval. The smaller exporting countries can no longer rely on the quota regime that favoured them for 40 years and are exposed to much tougher international competition. This chapter examines the implications of these changes and explores ways in which the textiles and clothing sector can better contribute to human development. Trends in Global Trade in Textiles and Clothing Over the past 40 years the global trade in textiles and clothing has grown 60-fold. Between 1962 and 2004, it increased from $6 billion per year to over $450 billion (Table 4.1). Today, textiles and clothing is one of the most dynamic product sectors, representing about 7 per cent of total world exports of manufactures. Clothing is the larger of the two, representing 57 per cent of total T&C trade. It is also growing faster: between 1997 and 2004 textiles exports grew on average by only 3 per cent per year but clothing exports grew by about 6 per cent.3 This trade is also strikingly international: around 130 countries produce and export textiles or clothing. However, fewer countries have substantial imports, around 30, the largest being the United States, the EU and Japan.4,5 Shifts in the Pattern of Exports The most rapid shift in the balance of exports occurred between the early 1980s and 2000. Over this period, the developing countries\u2019 share in world textile exports increased from 8 to 46 per cent, and their share in world clothing exports increased from 9 to 60 per cent.6 By the early 2000s, not only did the value of developing countries exports in textile and clothing increased, but also transition economies began to register a presence on the global scene (Figure 4.1). The leading developing-country exporters of clothing are China, Hong Kong (China), Mexico, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia. For textiles, the leading developing country expor- ters are China, Hong Kong (China), Taiwan (China), India and Pakistan. Recent trends for major exporting countries are summarized in Table 4.2 and 4.3.

China is the second-largest exporter for both textiles and clothing worldwide and close to number one for clothing. While individually other Asian count- ries do not command a large market share, collectively the region has emerged as an impor- tant player in the global market for exports. On the import side, there have been no significant changes. The major importers are mainly the US, the EU and Japan. China too is a major importer of textiles, but mainly as an input to its clothing industry. Such has been the expansion of the T&C sector in Asia that many countries are now highly dependent on this trade. This is less of an issue in the larger countries. For China, for example, T&C exports are only 16 per cent of total merchandise exports and for India they are 21 per cent. Other, smaller countries rely on this sector much more heavily: Cambodia, 71 per cent; Pakistan, 68 per cent; Bangladesh, 59 per cent; Sri Lanka and Nepal, around 50 per cent (Figure 4.2).

ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 82 T&C exports are considered as a proportion of manufactured exports, with the percentages being higher. Employment The expansion of the textiles and clothing sector has created millions of new jobs. Just how many is difficult to say, because national statistics do not generally distinguish between those working for the domestic market and those involved in the export trade \u2013 and miss many people who work in the unorganized sector. With this caveat, estimates of employment are given for a selection of countries in Table 4.4. Other estimates suggest that the T&C sector employs around 340,000 people in the Philippines, more than a million in Indonesia, and close to 3 million in Viet Nam, mostly female migrants from rural areas.8 The majority of these workers are women \u2013 with the proportion as high as 90 per cent in Bangladesh and Cambodia, and 87 per cent in Sri Lanka (Figure 4.3). This was partly because the pace of expansion increased employment generally and drew more people into the labour force, but also because the sector favoured part- time or piece work, circumstances in which female workers have tended to predominate.

This has frequently led to a very exploitative and hazardous working envi- ronment, including excessively long hours, lack of freedom of association, continuous exposure to toxic substances and the prohibition of rest breaks9 \u2013 well-illustrated by the treatment of garment workers in some Delhi production units (Box 4.2). In addition to poor working condi- tions, parts of the industry have a poor environ- mental record. For instance, the textile industry uses solvents, pesticides, dyes and bleaches in its production processes, but often makes little effort to treat effluents, leading to water pollution. Gender-related Disparities Women are employed in large numbers in the T&C industry, but they are still far from being The expansion of clothing exports from Bangladesh resulted in increased employment opportunities for Bangladeshi women, who now comprise 80 per cent of the 1.8 million workforces in the sector. Women\u2019s incomes have effectively risen, as their daily wage rates in the garments industry are twice as high as the agricultural and construction wages. As with all female employment, there are positive ripple effects on the family: Women employed in export-oriented garment production contribute around 46 per cent to the family income, and their earnings have been instrumental in keeping a large number of their families above the poverty level. Also, by having some control over part of their income, women invest in health, education, and tend to save more. Rising incomes in this industry have also had a positive effect on women\u2019s education levels: survey results show that 78 per cent of women had at least one year of formal schooling in 1997, compared to 65 per cent in 1990 (Paul-Majumder and Begum 2000). Economic independence and opportunities to improve educational levels have increased their empowerment within the household (Bhattarcharya and Rahman 1999). Nevertheless, within the industry, women are still subject to gender discrimination: Wage Disparities. Even though nominal as well as real wages in the T&C sector have increased over the last 20 years, women have benefited substantially less than men. Wages have risen most for skilled workers, who are usually men. Between 1990 and 1997, the gender-related wage gap widened: Female wages fell from the equivalent of 66 per cent of male wages in 1990 to 59 per cent in 1997.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0df678ac-5252-40ef-9eb1-df2fbff215e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0df678ac-5252-40ef-9eb1-df2fbff215e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31a91da8d6e79a7271096bd80b6ab04d19afa121aaed92a9911275afa5842441"}, "2": {"node_id": "d71f6d96-9631-44aa-8b0b-6df180e037e1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c34c3faf3a0736c5eea3f69efb44ba40c06c3038a4c5b054d1745aa8fae7b03e"}}, "hash": "531143019d4448435c8a34474c86a5153b6215d4ef51af1455a5d52001f4d6d7", "text": "Even after controlling for skills, the gender- related wage gap persisted.

BOX 4.2 SWEATSHOP CONDITIONS IN DELHI\u2019S GARMENTS INDUSTRY In north India, an overwhelming 90 per cent of the garment units producing for the export market are located in the Delhi metropolitan area. These units employ nearly 103,000 workers \u2013 6 per cent of the total industry workforce \u2013 and in 2001 they contributed 35 per cent to the country\u2019s earnings from garment exports. The industry is highly diverse. Large mechanized factories producing standardized products coexist with a wide network of subcontractors producing labour-intensive items, only 20 per cent of which are registered in the \u2018formal\u2019 sector. Irrespective of whether they are large factories or smaller karkhanas (workshops), these units try to offset the high overheads by cutting operating costs. They are run like sweatshops, where workers are bound by informal contracts, have to work long hours with limited break, and use outdated machinery. Costs are kept low by keeping wages low and circumventing the obligations required of employers in the formal sector. Flexible production systems have also led the de-skilling of workers, which has effectively weakened the traditional caste-based system of skill formation. Source: Verma, 2004. ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 84 treated on a par with their male counterparts (Box 4.1). In most countries women are paid less than male workers for the same work, and they are usually employed on the lower-skilled, and consequently lower-paid rungs of the industry, such as weaving and spinning, with few oppor- tunities for skill enhancement. Even in the Sri Lankan industry, where gender-related wage dis- parities are not as high, female workers endure other forms of hardship such as harassment, problems in commuting to and from work, and the dual responsibilities of family and work. Women workers are also subject to other forms of maltreatment. In India, for example, as more women enter the labour force there seems to have been a rise in domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies this could be because women who move beyond their domestic role to become family breadwinners are perceived as threats. Even outside their family and social settings, female workers have often been the victims of exploitation, oppression and harass- ment at their workplace. A Changing Trade Regime The Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) controlled imports of textiles and clothing by assigning quotas for exporting countries. Large producers such as China and India soon reached the limit of their quotas, but a number of other countries found themselves with quotas they were not filling, and developed T&C industries to take advantage of them. The Philippines, for example, which had not previously been a significant exporter, rapidly expanded its industry, which by 2004 was sending more than 80 per cent of its total garment exports to quota markets in Europe and the US. LDCs such as Bangladesh and Cambodia had a further advantage, since their LDC status entitled them to both quota-free and duty-free access to the EU (Box 4.3). That era is now over. As a result of pressure from some of the larger exporting countries, as well as from retailers in the importing countries, the WTO in 1994 set up the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC), under which from 1995 onwards, the MFA quota restrictions would be lifted in a series of stages. By 31 December 2004, quotas in product categories of interest to poor-country exporters disappeared completely, and textiles and clothing were fully integrated into the WTO system of free trade.10 However, the full force of the ATC has been offset by number of factors that have continued to constrain imports from some Asian countries: Protection from disruption by China. When China entered the WTO in 2001, the accession agreement included a safeguard to protect importing countries from possible \u2018market disruptions\u2019. This allowed importing countries to request a \u2018restraint limit\u2019 that would be in BOX 4.3 LDCS: MAJOR BENEFICIARIES OF THE MULTIFIBRE ARRANGEMENT The Multifibre Arrangement was particularly advantageous to a number of LDCs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "056cea8b-cab0-42c3-8165-3fb247b6c1ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "056cea8b-cab0-42c3-8165-3fb247b6c1ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa5e0c57deb460a35fce0fd5707f67147023e3033f6a232c5b17d5a9fc0aa678"}, "2": {"node_id": "7926668a-bdf3-45af-9923-132178805b82", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10ea951181b8483a239fb2988468e8d33beed1d64c130a0c2b08c4bcab4d3f88"}}, "hash": "19822389fc22ddcb76657ec42ee6514cc96cf55220d0eb3adc81cf7695f87632", "text": "Bangladesh.

Garment exports were the most lucrative export items and brought in $162 million in 2003, although this declined by 18 per cent in the first eight months of 2004 (EIU 2004). At its peak in the early 1990s, the Nepali textile sector employed more than 100,000 people. Cambodia. Over the past decade the quota regime for garment exports allowed Cambodia to become one of the fastest-growing garment exporters: between 1995 and 2003, export earnings rose from $26 million to $1.6 billion, by which time they accounted for 90 per cent of the country\u2019s merchandise exports. The industry has become the largest sectoral employer in the country. Around 90 per cent of workers are from rural areas. Remittances are typically around two-thirds of their monthly incomes of $60- 70. These remittances have had a tremendous impact on rural poverty, as they often are the family\u2019s only source of cash, and help generate peripheral and supporting jobs in the rural areas. As 90 per cent of the workers in these factories are women, the expansion of this industry has also had an empowering effect. CHAPTER 4: ADJUSTING TO A NEW ERA FOR TEXTILES AND CLOTHING 85 place until the end of 2008. This applied to all products, but the effect was likely to be greatest for textiles and clothing. Import tariffs. The importing countries no longer apply quotas, but they do discriminate between exporting countries through tariffs. This is a powerful tool, because tariffs are far higher on textiles and clothing than for other industrial products. In the US, for example, the average industrial tariff is 3.5 per cent but for textiles and clothing it is 14.6 per cent. For the EU the figures are 3.6 and 9.1 per cent respec- tively, and for Japan 1.7 and 7.6 per cent. How- ever, the importing countries offer concessions on these tariffs to certain favoured countries. The US, for example, offers lower tariffs to countries in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), and also offers preferential rates to a number of African countries through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The EU similarly offers tariff-free entry to exports from all member countries, which includes several Central and East European countries that pro- duce textiles and clothing. Also, through its Everything But Arms Agreement (EBA), the EU offers tariff-free access to goods from all LDCs. Anti-Dumping Legislation. Importing countries may also decide to stop imports from countries that appear to be off-loading goods at very low prices, even below the cost of production. The EU, for example, has repeatedly initiated anti- dumping measures. Between 1993 and 1998 it took action against cotton fabric items from India, Indonesia and Pakistan. Often such action has been based on spurious information.11 It seems unlikely that such actions will diminish following the removal of quotas.12 Technical barriers. Countries can also introduce new technical standards. The clauses in the Uruguay Round leave considerable scope for ambiguity, saying merely that technical stan- dards have to be applied in a way that does not prove to be discriminatory between foreign and domestic buyers. So far, however, there does not seem to have been any increase in their use for protectionism.13 Winners and Losers The changes to the international trade regime, and the range of ways in which importing coun- tries can shape the pattern of imports, have created uncertainty in the global textiles and clothing industry. Among the winners in this new environment are the T&C buyers in the import- ing countries, who now have greater freedom to source from countries or suppliers that offer the best combination of price, quality and speed of delivery. Also likely to gain are the larger export- ing countries that previously were constrained by quotas; here the more efficient producers should be able to expand their operations \u2013 employing more people and benefiting consumers through lower prices. The losers will be some of the smaller countries that exploited quotas within the MFA. While they might have been able to take advantage of the window of opportunity, their textiles and clothing industries may still not be internationally competitive, so they are likely to lose export markets \u2013 with severe economic ramifications for employment and incomes. A number of studies have attempted to assess the overall impact of this new environ- ment. They differed in a number of respects, but they did agree that overall there would be an increase in exports from Asia and that the benefits would be shared unequally. The main winners would be China and India,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "621171cf-7054-4e64-ae7f-d307dc92098c": {"__data__": {"id_": "621171cf-7054-4e64-ae7f-d307dc92098c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd440698d41e08fa0cb654bebd341f7a1abf0c5f60656cad007f1f07e682d384"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc953af3-9309-4e1d-a778-d8700bc0af4b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ab29237a12f84061a430f14941eb8fff3cc382b3d979e754ebb5e8b8934f92f"}}, "hash": "8d7beaf4333231801b93c7eade47b654cc8527cabd2131aed7324304191c4a1d", "text": "which were in a position to deliver competitively at every level of price and quality.

Although only a short period has elapsed since the removal of quotas, the outcome seems to have been broadly as predicted. The UNDP analyzed the flow of textiles and clothing to the US and the EU,14 a snapshot of which is presented in Tables 4.5 and 4.6. An analysis of the US and EU figures for 12 countries of Asia in the early post-quota period yields the following tentative conclusions: 1. In 2005, the market share of the 12 major producers in total T&C exports to the US increased by 8.4 per cent and to the EU by 6 per cent. This is in line with historical growth rates. Therefore, the end of quotas has not yet visibly led to enhanced import penetration in these markets \u2013 or therefore to the displacement of domestic producers and employment losses. Despite enhanced competition, unit prices of imports have not fallen dramatically, and this has enabled textiles and clothing manufacturers in the US and EU to withstand competition. In addition, safeguards of the type described below have been invoked, especially against Chinese imports. 2. The 12 major Asian producers and expor- ters have collectively increased their share to both the US and EU markets. Overall, in both markets combined the share has increased from 44 per cent in 2004 to over 51 per cent in 2005. This has come at the expense of the countries of Latin America, Caribbean, Africa and elsewhere. 3. Within Asian exporters, the biggest gains have been experienced by China and India. In the two markets combined (EU and US), China\u2019s share has increased from 20 per cent to 27 per cent, while that of India has gone up from around 5 per cent to over 6 per cent. The shares of Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam have remained largely unchanged. 4. The initial losers, in terms of the decline in value of exports to the US and EU markets combined are Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan (Figure 4.4). China Even during the era of quotas, China had become the largest exporter; in 2003, it had 20 TABLE 4.6 SHARE IN VALUE IN TEXTILES AND CLOTHING (%) Country US EU 2004 2005 2004 2005 Bangladesh 2.3 2.6 5.6 5.0 Cambodia 1.7 1.9 0.7 0.6 China 17.2 24.2 23 30.7 India 4.6 5.4 6.8 7.5 Indonesia 3.0 3.3 2.6 2.2 Lao PDR - - - - Nepal 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 Pakistan 2.9 3.1 3.6 3.0 Philippines 2.1 2.0 0.5 0.3 Sri Lanka 1.8 1.8 1.3 1.1 Thailand 2.5 2.4 1.9 1.6 Viet Nam 3.0 2.9 1.1 1.1 Asian 12 41.3 49.7 47.2 53.2 Rest of the world 58.7 50.3 52.8 46.8 World 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Source: Adhikari and Yamamoto 2006.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc953af3-9309-4e1d-a778-d8700bc0af4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc953af3-9309-4e1d-a778-d8700bc0af4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd440698d41e08fa0cb654bebd341f7a1abf0c5f60656cad007f1f07e682d384"}, "2": {"node_id": "621171cf-7054-4e64-ae7f-d307dc92098c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d7beaf4333231801b93c7eade47b654cc8527cabd2131aed7324304191c4a1d"}}, "hash": "5ab29237a12f84061a430f14941eb8fff3cc382b3d979e754ebb5e8b8934f92f", "text": "TABLE 4.5 US AND EU IMPORTS OF TEXTILES AND CLOTHING 2004 AND 2005 Country US + EU Imports Value ($ 000\u2019s) Volume (kg 000\u2019s) 2004 2005 % 2004 2005 % change change Bangladesh 6,831,529 6,986,371 2.3 772,398 805,074 4.2 Cambodia 2,077,287 2,309,302 11.2 139,582 157,337 12.7 China 33,184,188 48,328,640 45.6 3,415,846 4,902,913 43.5 India 9,461,662 11,498,711 21.5 1,201,657 1,336,645 11.2 Indonesia 4,780,437 5,061,899 5.9 475,909 496,362 4.3 Lao PDR 149,135 150,918 1.2 10,145 10,330 1.8 Nepal 229,322 189,297 \u201317.5 18,921 13,358 \u201329.4 Pakistan 5,438,106 5,393,774 \u20130.8 947,320 1,000,860 5.7 Philippines 2,319,502 2,187,351 \u20135.7 162,364 145,930 \u201310.1 Sri Lanka 2,646,967 2,727,200 3.0 212,297 206,596 \u20132.7 Thailand 3,665,385 3,519,697 \u20134.0 330,086 332,717 0.8 Viet Nam 3,478,990 3,687,055 6.0 273,593 274,902 0.5 Asian-12 74,262,510 92,040,215 23.9 7,960,118 9,683,024 21.6 Source: Adhikari and Yamamoto 2006.

It also has excellent shipping connections that allow rapid transit times to the US and Europe. With the ending of quotas, Chinese compa- nies are moving quickly to seize a huge opportu- nity. At present China imports around half its textile needs, making it the world\u2019s third largest importer, just behind the EU and the US. It is also the world\u2019s largest importer of raw cotton and amongst the top importers of wool in the world. But in future Chinese suppliers will be able to source more of their textiles locally. In 2004 they imported $4.5 billion worth of up-to- date textile and clothing machinery, 43 per cent of which came from the EU, which should enable Chinese manufacturers to make higher-quality products to tighter delivery schedules. All this will produce a substantial rise in employment. China\u2019s export expansion will, however, face some constraints. In the short term, importing countries that become alarmed about a surge of Chinese imports can protect themselves by imposing quotas. In the medium term, as its own consumer market grows, China is likely to absorb more of its own production as well as imports from other countries. And in the longer term, China, like other industrializing countries, is likely to shift away from the manufacture of relatively simple goods like textiles and clothing and put more emphasis on high-tech industrial products such as electronics. As expected, China\u2019s exports rose rapidly following the end of the quota regime. Between 2004 and 2005, exports to the US and the EU increased by 46 per cent in value and 44 per cent in volume. These increases were for almost all categories of apparel. However, there could have been special factors that boosted these figures. In some cases the exports substituted for goods that previously might have come via the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau as well as Taiwan (China). And some traders will have seen this as a window of opportunity to increase shipments before the US and the EU retaliated with protective measures. As expected, the US and the EU started imposing restrictions. On 23 May 2005, for example, the US imposed restrictions on cotton knit shirts and blouses, cotton trousers, slacks and shorts, and cotton and man-made fibre underwear. On 27 May, it imposed limits on cotton yarn, men\u2019s and boys\u2019 cotton and man- made fibre shirts (non-knit), man-made fibre knit shirts and blouses and man-made fibre trousers. It thus appears that the categories on which limits have been reintroduced were among those for which quotas were the most restrictive during the ATC regime. The companies producing these goods, most China is certain to be the principal beneficiary of the post-MFA global trading regime Figure 4.4: Growth in value of exports of textiles and clothing to the EU and the US 2004-05 Source: Adhikari and Yamamoto, 2006.

Since they filled their new quotas within a couple of months, they had to stop production for the rest of the year. This affected some 140,000 jobs, most of which are occupied by young girls or women from rural areas who are not covered by China\u2019s limited social safety net. Following these measures and subsequent additional requests for safeguard action, in November 2005 the US and China arrived at a broad pact. In exchange for guaranteed access to the US, China agreed for three years to limit its exports for 34 categories of clothing, account- ing for 46 per cent of Chinese textile imports into the US. The agreement allows an annual average growth of 11 per cent \u2013 considerably lower than the Chinese demand of 20-30 per cent.

But by late August 2005, Chinese manufacturers had already met or exceeded these quotas, and since the above- quota goods had already been despatched they were impounded in Europe \u2013 more than 75 million garments. After further negotiations the European Commission agreed to allow half of these goods to enter, and China agreed that the rest would be deducted either from its 2006 textile quota or switched to other unfilled-quota categories. In addition to its agreements with the US and the EU, China has undertaken its own unilateral measures to dampen down exports. It has, for example, lowered the VAT rebate rate on T&C exports and imposed export duties on a number of lines to encourage Chinese enterprises to switch to higher value-added products \u2013 although it later revoked some of these following the US and EU restrictions, to prevent Chinese textile exporters from being doubly penalized.15 Bangladesh Bangladesh had expanded its T&C exports very rapidly under the quota regime. This was largely based on having some of the world\u2019s lowest wages \u2013 although offset by low productivity. In 2004, 500,000 workers were employed in knitwear and 1.3 million in woven apparel;16 80 per cent of the workers are women. In recent years Bangladeshi enterprises had made considerable improvements, reducing lead times, increasing the value added, and becoming more price-competitive. Nevertheless, Bangladesh remained highly reliant on quotas, sending 98 per cent of its exports to the US and the EU. Most analysts assumed that without these quotas its T&C sector would collapse. The result has been more mixed \u2013 with a stronger performance in the US and a weaker one in the EU. What appears to be happening is that, for woven garments, EU\u2019s stringent rules of origin appear to be more constraining than US\u2019s tariff barriers. CHAPTER 4: ADJUSTING TO A NEW ERA FOR TEXTILES AND CLOTHING 89 So far there has been no evidence of signi- ficant factory closures or retrenchment of workers; indeed, one survey found that 19 out of 35 firms had increased the number of workers,17 while employment in the rest was unchanged. There could also be improvements in working conditions, since another survey found increasing pressure to meet the different codes of conduct and social standards set by different buyers.18 However, these burdens fall upon employers\u2019 and then workers\u2019 shoulders, without too much support from buyers or from government. The demands will also differ from one buyer to another; one buyer may require workers to be provided with sandals, while another requires work shoes. Work hours have also been reduced as buyers demand that factories meet the legal limit of 60 hours a week. Though this is an advance in one respect, it also means people now earn less income and miss out on snacks provided for overtime workers. Cambodia Cambodia too had fared well under the quota regime. Investors from Hong Kong (China), Taiwan (China), and Singapore, along with local businessmen, many of Chinese origin, had built up an industry with 200 clothing factories that in 2004 exported $1.9 billion worth of goods. But Cambodia appeared vulnerable to the removal of quotas. Some 40 per cent of its exports were to a US retailer, Gap, which also sourced about one-sixth of its clothing in China. Since Cambodia\u2019s production costs were around 25 per cent higher than those in China, and transportation to foreign ports took far longer, it was feared that much of this production would migrate to China. In the event the outcome has been better than expected, as exports to the US and EU increased by over 11 per cent in value and 13 per cent in volume in 2005. This appears to be the fruit of Cambodia\u2019s efforts to improve factory conditions and its participation in an ILO inspection programme that made the country more acceptable to foreign buyers. Cambodian workers have the right to strike. Many are organized into independent unions. A recent report found no forced labour, child labour, or discrimination. Apparently because of these better working conditions, the US provided Cambodia with preferential treatment in the form of higher quotas and lower tariffs.19 How- ever an ILO report cautions against bureaucratic practices and rampant corruption, and a report from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions shows increasing pressure on trade union rights that threatens to tarnish the country\u2019s image.20 India India\u2019s T&C industry accounts for 14 per cent of total", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c63b7e7-f557-4f52-b541-7573b1f5804a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c63b7e7-f557-4f52-b541-7573b1f5804a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa4bbd055d15df4026b378eb0c90ebef066e79fb9c820acafbf1c6b3c4a8043e"}}, "hash": "aa4bbd055d15df4026b378eb0c90ebef066e79fb9c820acafbf1c6b3c4a8043e", "text": "industrial production and nearly 30 per cent of total exports. In the 1960s India exported about half of its products to the USSR and Eastern Europe, but from the late 1970s shifted more towards the US and European markets, where it ran into quota restrictions. Most studies have concluded that India would benefit from the lifting of quotas, and some consider that India alone has the ability to be competitive with China. Potential revenue gains have been put at $2 billion annually.21 India seems to have gained in both textiles and clothing. Between 2004 and 2005, exports to the US and EU grew by 22 per cent in value and over 11 per cent in volume. In absolute terms, the value of exports grew by almost $2 billion, as anticipated. But India has lost market share in cotton trousers, though gaining in cotton fibre dresses and men\u2019s cotton knit shirts. Although no job losses have been reported yet, many female workers are expected to lose their jobs when the textile industry replaces handlooms by machine looms. Because of better working conditions, the US provided Cambodia with preferential treatment in the form of higher quotas and lower tariffs ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 90 Indonesia Indonesia\u2019s T&C sector is the country\u2019s major contributor of non-oil and gas exports. Directly and indirectly, about 3.5 million people are now working in the sector. According to the 2004 National Labour Force Survey, 1.1 million people were officially employed in the sector in 2004, down from 1.4 million in the previous year. In addition to factory workers, the T&C sector, especially ready-made garments, hires many informal workers. In Bali, for example, sewing is contracted out to village groups. Wages are among the lowest in the region, averaging $0.27 per hour. In export processing zones the basic wages for females workers in the garment sector were found to be $55 to $74 per month, when the minimum wage was around $74. Thus, women are not earning above minimum wage in the garment industry.22 Between 2004 and 2005, the sector incre- ased its output: exports to the US and EU, which account for about two-thirds of exports, show an increase in value of 6 per cent. Nevertheless, there is evidence of factories laying workers off as a result of falling orders and rising costs. Nepal In the early 1980s Indian exporters, constrained by the system of quotas, turned to Nepal and established export-oriented garment manufac- ture there. Output of ready-made garments peaked in 2000 then declined over the next two years in anticipation of the end of the quota regime. The value of exports declined sharply, by 18 per cent in value and 29 per cent in volume, to the US and EU markets in 2005. Pakistan Overall, the T&C sector accounts for 60 per cent of exports. In 2000 it employed 2.3 million people, including informal workers \u2013 43 per cent of manufacturing employment \u2013 and is the second-largest employer of women, after agri- culture. This is mostly a cottage industry: around 90 per cent of work is subcontracted to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Between 2004 and 2005, Pakistan lost some of its exports to the EU while expanding in the United States. Overall, however, there are some doubts about the growth of the sector following the removal of quotas. The value of export declined by 1 per cent, while volume increased by around 6 per cent. The impact on employ- ment is not yet clear, though there are signs of male production workers being replaced by female ones.23 Sri Lanka Sri Lanka\u2019s success has been partly achieved through supportive government policies \u2013 lower corporate taxes, duty-free imports of machinery and raw materials, and subsidies and duty rebate schemes. But Sri Lanka has also had a parti- cularly large share of export quotas and enjoyed relatively secure markets through bilateral agreements with the US, the EU, Canada, and Norway. Most of the T&C sector here is in clothing, since there is no significant textile industry. But even before the quota regime was disbanded, labour costs had been rising and garment exports had been shrinking. With the ending of quotas some analysts estimated that as much as half the local industry would have to close.24 In a 2005 survey there were 733 apparel fac- tories, and employment seems to have been fall- ing, from 340,367 in 2003 to 273,600 in 2005. Some 85 per cent of these are women. Some of this reduction has been due to the consolida- tion of the industry, though other factories have closed abruptly, without paying any compensation.

The EU granted Sri Lanka GSP-plus benefits in 2005. But without a strong textile processing sector, the country will not benefit much from the scheme. Viet Nam Viet Nam had also seemed likely to be a loser from the reduction in quotas. So far, the results do not appear to have been negative; exports in value to the US and the EU increased by around 6 per cent in value and half of 1 per cent in volume in 2005. Nevertheless, there is a climate of uncertainty among national producers. Viet Nam has benefited from the reintroduction of restrictions against China, which increased Viet Nam\u2019s sales somewhat. However, according to government sources, the outlook is not very promising \u2013 not just because of the removal of quotas, but also because of relatively high production costs.25 Impact on Workers and Communities If countries and suppliers are to survive in the new global trading environment, they will have to become more competitive. In efforts to do so, however, they could pass on the pressure to their workers \u2013 reducing wages and demanding more unpaid overtime and threatening to close or move if workers do not comply. Increased com- petition could also lead to less-secure forms of employment, such as piece-rate jobs \u2013 which would mean greater health and safety risks for workers as well as a loss of benefits such as medical insurance. However, there may also be pressures to improve working conditions. Consumers in the importing countries are asking retailers to prove that goods are not produced by sweatshops. This could improve standards for many workers, though there is also the risk that retailers\u2019 de- mands will be so stringent that they drive some developing-country suppliers out of business. A decline in the garment industry in any country will see job losses, especially for women. Even in countries that maintain production, women\u2019s employment may fall because of increased mechanization and the transfer of work to larger factories that employ more men. The introduction of new technologies often leads to greater redundancies among women: first, because the new technologies will replace jobs such as weaving, traditionally performed by women; and second, because women, with their lower access to skills, often lack the knowledge to operate the new equipment. Women working on piece rates in the infor- mal sectors could also be particularly vulnerable if better working conditions moves more pro- duction into factories; unable to find work in more modernized garment factories, these women are more likely to turn to marginal micro-enterprises, such as taking in laundry and street vending. National Policy Directions The textiles and clothing industry worldwide is on the threshold of major changes, with gains in some countries offset by losses in others as factories close and unemployment increases. But even countries that manage to boost their export earnings will not necessarily provide more work or better labour conditions. Higher levels of trade in textiles and clothing can lead to higher levels of human development, but only if governments and employers take the necessary action. In the long run, the only way to survive in a competitive global market is by upgrading the industry and removing some of the barriers to increasing both the quality and quantity of output. Decent Work Countries that do not have legislation should enact labour laws to guarantee the rights of ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 92 workers, particularly women. Such guidelines, following ILO recommendations, should cap weekly working hours, while offering firms incentives to attain competitiveness through increased labour productivity. Meanwhile, coun- tries that have already enacted such legislation need to be more proactive in ensuring compli- ance and in taking punitive action against off- ending enterprises. In the current climate, international retailers and garment manufacturers are closely scruti- nized in their home countries with regard to the labour conditions in the factories of their suppliers. Cambodia, for example, has already demonstrated how improved working condi- tions can help boost exports. It is important, however, that developed countries do not use such requirements as a substitute or pretext for increasing tariffs and other forms of pro- tection. Exporting countries can take advantage of such concerns by following the codes of conduct developed by some major retailers to protect basic labour rights in their contracted factories. These typically include adequate wages and work hours, job security, health and safety guarantees, and the right to form independent", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "059b8f63-0385-4199-9d5e-d8ac8eabd3c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "059b8f63-0385-4199-9d5e-d8ac8eabd3c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c198e41ee4576476afd31dd4e83f7d3906977bdea3edaade8582dbc48467669"}}, "hash": "8c198e41ee4576476afd31dd4e83f7d3906977bdea3edaade8582dbc48467669", "text": "labour unions. Countries that have labour laws consistent with these codes of conduct \u2013 and the means to enforce them \u2013 could then market themselves to the socially more conscious US and EU retailers and manufacturers. Environmental Protection The textiles and clothing sector can only pro- mote sustainable human development if it is environmentally responsible. All developing countries need relevant and enforceable domes- tic regulatory frameworks that can mitigate the industry\u2019s negative effects on the environment \u2013 using cleaner technologies, reducing water usage, avoiding pollution and promoting more efficient use of process chemicals. Offsetting the Effects of Quota Elimination In countries where job losses are anticipated, the states need to ensure protection and rehabili- tation of affected workers. To manage this, they could set up cells in government departments to track changes in the sector. The most vulnerable countries are those with inefficient and low-productivity industries that produce poor-quality goods. These are unlikely to survive. In a quota-free world, enter- prises have to compete on grounds other than cheap labour. Governments must, therefore, help create the conditions for alternative employ- ment: for example, by improving infrastructure, particularly telecommunications. Governments also need to negotiate new beneficial trade agreements for other products \u2013 possibly work- ing through groupings and trading blocs where they can share resources and information. At the same time, government and industry will need to work together to find ways of mov- ing up the value chain \u2013 diversifying product lines, developing indigenous sources of textiles and other inputs. \u2022 Responsible closure of units. Governments need to adopt responsible closure guidelines, including notification requirements and phased implementation of closure. All firms \u2013 including large retailers that source pro- duction in Asia \u2013 should have social safety nets to protect workers who are laid off. These workers should also be paid before other creditors. Most countries have laws to protect workers against summary dismissal, but enforcement is unreliable and factory closures will need to be carefully monitored to ensure that workers receive due severance pay, social security and pension payments, along with social safety nets and training and programmes for reemployment. \u2022 Labour restructuring programmes. Dis- Countries that do not have legislation should enact labour laws to guarantee the rights of workers, particularly women CHAPTER 4: ADJUSTING TO A NEW ERA FOR TEXTILES AND CLOTHING 93 placed workers can be helped to gain new employment through labour market adjust- ment programmes. These can include disseminating labour market information, creating job banks, providing employment subsidies and training, and retraining in alternative skills for employment in sectors akin to textiles and clothing. Particular attention needs to be paid to informal workers, and especially to women, who should be given opportunities to upgrade their skills. But these programmes need to go beyond classrooms to provide skill-specific and on- the-job training. For this purpose, some governments have entered into partnerships with private-sector and community orga- nizations. In Bangladesh, for example, the Nari Udyug Kendra \u2013 the Centre for Women\u2019s Initiatives \u2013 has conducted a study of worker retraining needs, and the govern- ment plans to improve the skills of 40,000 garment workers in partnership with the NGO BRAC (known as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee). This type of training can help diversification into higher-value-added production such as fashion-sensitive women\u2019s wear. Some countries have already initiated the process: in Sri Lanka, for example, the government has levied a garment tax to fund technological upgrading and skills enhancement. Credit schemes could also be set up to help retrenched workers begin their own small businesses. \u2022 Improving infrastructure. Many garment- exporting countries are hampered by poor infrastructure, inadequate power supplies, high telecommunication costs, poor roads and rail networks, and high turnaround times at ports. According to World Bank estimates, the average customs clearance time for sea cargo is more than ten days in South Asia, compared with only two days in developed countries. This is a serious handi- cap for fashion-sensitive items. Countries need to invest in dry ports and new export processing zones while developing suppor- tive services and industries and removing shipping and customs bottlenecks. Electro- nic data interchanges at ports and customs houses, for example, can ensure faster clearance. \u2022 Raising levels of skill. Training is especially important at the entry level, particularly in countries such as Cambodia, which have weak education systems that severely limit workers\u2019 productivity. Training is necessary at two levels: First, for the workers, with a view to enhancing their skills, speeding up the production process and minimising waste; Second, for mid-level managers to enable them to supervise works more effec- tively, communicate well with buyers or their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3848b8a3-5017-4169-9ba3-57988d942219": {"__data__": {"id_": "3848b8a3-5017-4169-9ba3-57988d942219", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6b6079200decd163a6acfaf5a7572aeb778daaef348b361ab4568ea0d1b0fec"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ceb9cab-5f4b-45f1-8385-714803655f52", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6aa42ab932b7f0ab5f0551462286e4b1f0b50dd2eaabff49d3bb8e530fd3a12f"}}, "hash": "cffd26b641a3252d5579cfa888521f823bf68a24a4f3ff558bfb4c73f6b0c06c", "text": "agents, and process the orders efficiently. This is an area where there is wide scope for public-private partnership. \u2022 Upgrading technology. T&C is generally a low-tech sector. Even so, enterprises in most LDCs and low-income countries are hampered by their inability to invest in latest technologies \u2013 including computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacture \u2013 not just to increase their efficiency but also enhance quality and respond to buyers\u2019 requirements. These technologies are common in middle-income countries, and larger exporters in Bangladesh have instal- led them. In other LDCs and low-income countries, however, such facilities may not be feasible. Here one possibility is for firms to work together as groups to use such equipment. Another option would be to make use of foreign direct investment through South-South cooperation. \u2022 Fiscal support. In some countries fully export-oriented enterprises are accorded special privileges, such as full-duty ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 94 drawbacks and exemptions from import taxes. These fiscal incentives could also be extended to firms that export only a part of their output. Other incentives could include: reducing or eliminating tariffs on key intermediate inputs; allowing garment exporters the freedom to choose between using local and imported fabric, as in China and Pakistan; lowering taxes on the sale of \u2018export-reject\u2019 T&C products in the local market; reforming export credit guarantee schemes covering pre- and post-shipment risks and financing needs; and extending the time limit for repayment of export credits. In Bangladesh, for example, the government is eliminating taxes on electricity and utilities used by garment factories. \u2022 Promoting reputations and brands. Govern- ments can help smaller enterprises build reputations for quality, reliability, and compliance with product and process standards. They might, for example, target quality niche products such as bed linen or, as Cambodia has done, seek an advantage through well-publicized compliance with international labour and environmental standards. They can do some of this work through trade fairs and missions abroad, as well as by helping domestic producers establish contact with the largest retailers. International Measures to Increase Market Access At the same time, governments in both exporting and importing countries will need to take action at the international level to ensure that the trade in textiles and clothing promotes human development in the poorest countries. The developing countries need to ensure that human development considerations are included in trade agreements. Apart from trying to preserve access to markets, they also need to maintain advantages where they have indi- genous manufacturing capabilities. As part of its terms of accession to the WTO, Mongolia, for example, had to eliminate its export restrictions on raw cashmere. This has undermined the competitiveness of its clothing enterprises, since their main competitors in China can now purchase high-quality Mongolian cashmere. Despite a per-capita GDP of less than $1,000, Mongolia was not permitted to maintain export subsidies, a provision that WTO members at similar levels of development enjoy. The objective should be to seek greater market access along with margins of preference for the LDCs \u2013 but without requiring reciprocal reductions that would undermine indigenous manufacturing, especially in the traditional handloom and handicraft sectors that employ substantial numbers of women. Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties The T&C sector has long been affected by anti- dumping measures. Between 1994 and 2001, the EU, initiated 53 anti-dumping and counter- vailing actions in the textile sector, while the US invoked 28 safeguard measures under the ATC between 1995 and 2001.26 In the more libera- lized trade regime for textiles and clothing, there is a general expectation that developed countries may increasingly resort to such measures. Dis- cussions on WTO rules should, therefore, aim at reducing the scope for this \u2013 with a moratorium on actions against producers in the LDCs. Promoting South-South Cooperation Traditional markets such as the EU, the US, Japan and Canada still account for almost 80 per cent of world imports, but their future growth is expected to be marginal. In contrast, the markets of the larger developing countries are growing very fast: China is already the world\u2019s fourth-largest market for apparel, accounting for 5 per cent of demand.

But one problem that can be addressed quickly is tariff protection. Many of these markets have high tariffs; in India and Mexico, for example, the average import tariff for textiles and clothing is 35 per cent. One option is to use the Agreement on Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing Countries (GSTP), administered by UNCTAD, to help deepen the scope of tariff preferences amongst the G-77. Larger and more advanced developing countries could use this to give preferential market access to LDCs, helping them find new outlets that might compensate for losses in traditional markets. Preferences for the LDCs The developed countries grant unrestricted market access to T&C exports from some, but not all, LDCs. The US offers this to LDCs in sub- Saharan Africa under the AGOA, but not to any Asian T&C-producing LDCs such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal. The EU, in contrast, provides duty-free access to exports from all LDCs under its \u2018Everything But Arms\u2019 (EBA) initiative, though exporters would be able to make better use of this if the EU harmonized the rules of origin so that benefi- ciaries do not have to fulfil different criteria in different preferential schemes. But even large developing countries, such as China and India, could consider extending such preferences to Asian LDCs. Addressing these issues would have very beneficial human development outcomes, especially since many women in LDCs are employed in this industry. Major Changes Ahead The textile and clothing industry worldwide could be on the threshold of major changes. In the long term, trade liberalization through the removal of quotas could provide more jobs in certain countries and improve human develop- ment. At the same time, vulnerable countries could face disruptions if factories close and unemployment increases. But market access is not sufficient. Export- ing countries also need to improve competi- tiveness, including investing in developing skills, upgrading technology, diversifying products and markets, and integrating better into global supply chains. Moreover, increasing volumes of trade and expanded export earnings do not necessarily translate into increased employment and, given the sweatshop conditions in many garment units, increased employment does not automatically translate into higher standards of human development. With so many women workers in this sector in Asia, there are also significant gender implications, both positive and negative. CHAPTER 5: SELLING SERVICES ACROSS FRONTIERS 99 Asian countries continue to rely on the inter- national trade in goods. But over the last three decades they have been taking advantage of the opportunities to boost the trade in services, and as a result international trade has become much more complex and diverse. This chapter focuses on three forms of cross-border movement: in the first type, the seller moves, as in international labour migration; in the second type, the work moves, as with business outsourcing; and in the third type, the buyer moves, as with interna- tional tourism.1,2 All three types of movement have increased significantly. For migration, millions of lower- skilled workers continue to travel abroad on short-term contracts, especially from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Nepal, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. An estimated 10 per cent of the Filipino labour force and 12 per cent of the Sri Lankan labour force now work over- seas. Labour migrants have improved their quality of life, and even some of the poorest have earned enough to lift their families out of poverty. Asia has also been a pioneer in the off- shoring of IT and business process services. In some cases IT workers continue to travel over- seas on short-term assignments in developed countries, but advances in information and communications technology and falling Internet Economic development in all countries has involved shifting the focus from agriculture or manufacturing to the service sector. The same is true at the international level \u2013 as technological advance and falling transport costs have made it easier to trade services across national borders. The Asia-Pacific region has been at the forefront of these changes \u2013 particularly through labour migration, outsourcing and the tourist industry. But policy makers will need to take firm action if the international trade in services is to offer more benefits to the poor. Chapter Selling Services Across Frontiers 5 connectivity costs have allowed more and more of these services to be delivered remotely \u2013 providing jobs for highly educated young people, who might otherwise have struggled to find work that took advantage of their skills.

Tourism can offer new sources of employment even to the remotest regions. There are, of course, many other services that are traded across borders, including health services, financial services and environmental services. In the sections that follow, this chapter looks specifically at three of the main forms of economic service. Short-term Migration Asia has long been subject to large migration flows \u2013 both within and beyond the region. In the nineteenth century, for example, millions of indentured workers left countries in South Asia and China \u2013 some to other parts of Asia, others to North America, the Caribbean and Africa. In the twentieth century, many people left the region for long-term settlement in Europe and North America. Nowadays migration flows are often more Asia has long been subject to large migration flows ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 100 complex, but migrants typically fall into one of three groups. The first group consists of more educated and skilled professional workers, who are heading primarily for the developed coun- tries \u2013 chiefly the US, Western Europe, Australia or New Zealand. The second group consists of unskilled or lower-skilled workers, who have gone to a greater number of countries, either outside the region \u2013 to the Gulf States, for example \u2013 or to the faster-growing Asian coun- tries. The third, though much smaller group, consists of business and professional people, who are being transferred within transnational corporations. The overall patterns of movement of unskilled labour are indicated in Box 5.1. Migration can be considered as a response to international imbalances \u2013 as workers move from countries with labour surpluses to those with labour deficits. In practice, however, the destination countries tend to control the flow as they seek to fill gaps in their labour markets \u2013 either at the top, for highly educated professio- nals such as teachers or doctors, or at the bottom, for unskilled workers in plantations or construction sites. Within the region, the most significant destination countries have included Japan, Singapore and the Republic of Korea, but from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, economic booms also created labour shortages in Malaysia and Thailand and attracted workers from neighbouring countries. Outside the region, the most significant destination countries have been the oil-exporting countries of West Asia and the Persian Gulf \u2013 which have not only drawn in unskilled and semi-skilled workers for construc- tion and other services, but also attracted large numbers of professionals, especially those work- ing in engineering, accountancy and the health sector. While West Asia remains the most signi- ficant for short-term overseas work, the US and Europe have and remain important for migra- tion in general. More recently, there has been an increase in short-term movement of software professionals to the US. Every country in the region has supplied migrants, but the largest single source has been the Philippines. Filipino workers of varying skill levels have travelled all over the world, though have tended to cluster in specific destinations: domestic helpers, for example, are concentrated in Hong Kong (China) and Saudi Arabia, entertainers in Japan and other South-East Asian countries, and IT professionals and nurses in the US and the UK. Benefits of Short-term Migration Migration brings many advantages \u2013 economic and social \u2013 both for individual migrants and for the countries they leave behind. Remittances. For the source countries, one of the most direct benefits is the flow of remittances, as migrants send or bring their earnings home. In the 1980s and 1990s most of the source countries, particularly India and the Philippines, enjoyed a steep rise in remittance income (Figure 5.1). For many countries, remittances represent a significant source of foreign exchange. In Viet Nam, for example, between 1999 and 2002 remittance inflows rose from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. They now account for around 10 per cent of export revenues and are roughly equivalent to the annual flows of overseas BOX 5.1 MOVEMENTS OF UNSKILLED LABOUR IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION Source countries Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Viet Nam Destination countries Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong (China), Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan (China) Both source and India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand destination countries Note: The classification here refers only to the larger flows of lower-skilled workers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7268ba51-88e7-4ce9-9700-0991ca50609d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7268ba51-88e7-4ce9-9700-0991ca50609d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06ef05b2c3d20c1d143118383775b5e1c230be3a304465241143794e4274882c"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d83eadf-9b39-4ad5-ba59-5752e8bcc44a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8c2d769161d6c61e56f88bac8305bff9d8c09604df82f170762cc279c180743"}}, "hash": "a24259964fc458d213926a3e45be2cfdf015444f0efc6b1744cbaad9d630ff6a", "text": "It does not include seasonal cross-border shifts of neighbouring populations, often part of a centuries-old pattern in these economies Source: Based on Wickramasekara 2002.

As well as being on a large scale, remittances have the further advantage of being more reliable than other flows: often they come from migrants working in the service sector, which is less susceptible to the fluctua- tions of business cycles in host countries. Individual migrants and their families use this income for many different purposes. Some will spend it on immediate needs: food, for example, or education or health care. Others will buy houses or invest in businesses (Box 5.2). For many communities, migration has served as a route out of poverty. Remittances are also used for community activities as migrants build up transnational networks and provide funds that benefit their home villages or regions. For example, migrants from the Indian state of Gujarat who have become shopkeepers, hotel owners and businesspeople in the UK and East Africa have helped develop infrastructure as well as the health and education systems in their home state. Similarly, workers from the state of Kerala helped finance the construction of an international airport to facilitate travel between their home and work countries.4 Generally, the largest flows of remittances come from short-term economic migrants. By contrast, long-term migrants are less likely to send money home. Professional workers who settle in developed countries usually want to retain more of their earnings. And when they do send money back, this is typically for investment on which they are seeking a return. Experience and Skills. Migrants bring home more not only money but also valuable work experience, enhanced skills and useful networks that can promote economic activity, innovation and entrepreneurship. Equipped with these, the migrants themselves can make better use of their remittances. This skill transfer is particularly important for the professionals, especially in the emerging IT-related industries. In the process of outsourc- ing, for example, service companies will send key consultants and specialists to customers to acquire knowledge and to transfer back to the companies in Asia information about technical applications, products, processes, and marketing techniques. Similarly in the field of health, returnee doctors and specialists have been able to transfer knowledge about cutting-edge techniques \u2013 raising standards of health care and generally improving health service delivery. Empowerment of Women. Migration also has important social effects, particularly in the empowerment of women. Over recent decades, Figure 5.1: Flows of remittances to selected Asian countries, 1983-2003, $ billions Source: World Bank 2005. BOX 5.2 USE OF REMITTANCES IN BANGLADESH A survey in Bangladesh found that expatriate workers spent around 30 per cent of their income on personal consumption abroad, sent 45 per cent back home and saved the remaining 25 per cent. Of the amount sent home, 50 per cent was used for consumption, including spending on food, education and health care, 29 per cent was invested in land or other property, and 21 per cent was used for housing improvements, including upgrading existing property. The same survey also found that a relatively prolonged, stable flow of remittances allowed families to move from wage employment to self- employment and to move from cultivation to a range of non-farm activities.

ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 102 Asian women migrants have come predomi- nantly from three countries: Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, where they make up 60 to 80 per cent of all legal migrants (Figure 5.2). Some of the least developed countries, such as Bangladesh, also have a smaller, but still significant, proportion of women migrants. Most of these women are employed in health care and domestic service. The Philip- pines, for example, is the world\u2019s largest source of nurses. During the 1980s there was a huge outflow of Filipino nurses to the US. Subse- quently, between 1995 and 2001 an average of 5,700 nurses migrated annually, primarily to the UK and Saudi Arabia.5 Women from Indonesia and Sri Lanka are primarily travelling for domestic service, mainly to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Disadvantages of Short-term Migration For all its benefits to migrant-sending commu- nities, migration also has some negative aspects. Migrants can find themselves working in very difficult circumstances, and their departure can also create problems in the country they leave behind.

They may also find that the host country does not recognize their qualifications and requires them to pass new exams; architects might have to work as draughtsmen, engineers as technical staff, nurses as nursing aides, or dentists as dental assistants. Social Effects on Families. For families, migra- tion is financially beneficial but socially disrup- tive. Prolonged separation can lead to illicit relationships, and lonely spouses left at home may resort to alcohol or gambling. Conse- quently, migrant families often have higher divorce rates. Migration also tends to delay marriage, and migrant women in particular may have difficulties finding spouses when they return. Children too can suffer due to the absence of parents, especially their mothers, and face psychological and behavioural problems or difficulties at school. BOX 5.3 DISCRIMINATORY WORK VISAS Depending on the nature of work, poorer migrants, usually from South Asian countries and the Philippines, have occasionally been subject to exploitation in destination countries. This is especially the case when receiving countries have different visas for different categories of labour. Some West Asian countries, for example, issue two types of visas to temporary migrant workers. The \u2018Type B\u2019 visa is issued to migrant workers hired by companies in the formal sector of the economy. These workers are protected by labour laws, have greater rights and are permitted to live outside the work premises. The \u2018Type A\u2019 visa, however, permits the employer to confiscate the passport of the migrant worker, to confine her or him to the house and to dictate work conditions and hours. Housemaids, for example, qualify only for Type A visas, which makes them dependent upon their employers for their minimum rights, and many have complained about excessively long workdays, loneliness and ill health, difficulties in communicating with their family, and sexual harassment.

Migrants can find themselves working in very difficult circumstances and their departure can also create problems in the country they leave behind CHAPTER 5: SELLING SERVICES ACROSS FRONTIERS 103 Increasing Inequalities. Migration can dramati- cally boost the income of a small number of families \u2013 making them richer than their neigh- bours and generally giving rise to skewed patterns of income and consumption. In the Philippines, for example, remittance inflows have been found to increase local income inequalities.6 Reintegration. Returnee migrants can also face social and economic problems when they come home. In Sri Lanka, for example, both male and female migrants generally reintegrate fairly smoothly. However, because of their low level of education, some people may not find the kind of work that they aspire to: those who have worked overseas as housemaids, for example, may be unwilling to do such work in Sri Lanka, where it has a low social status. And their work experi- ence in more developed countries can give them unrealistic salary expectations. Brain Drain. The destination country may gain the skill of migrants, but for the source countries this can represent a significant loss. In the Philippines, for example, where more than one- third of migrants are professional or technical workers, their departure has led to serious staff shortages in the health sector and to driving up of wages. Between 1995 and 2000, the number of registered nurses in the country fell from 27,272 to 5,874. Many doctors have also migrated, particularly to the US and Canada. Migration and Meeting the MDGs Migration can thus have positive and negative effects. These can also be considered in relation to the MDGs. MDG1: Poverty. Higher incomes from remitt- ances cannot only help reduce poverty and hunger, but also accentuate existing inequalities and perpetuate poverty among unskilled and powerless migrants. MDG2: Education. Migration can help parents pay for education, but if it splits up families, it may also serve to remove children from school. MDG3: Gender Equality. Women may be empowered if they get independent incomes, but can also be vulnerable to exploitation. MDG4: Child Mortality. Higher incomes and more knowledge about health should make children healthier, but some may lose out if they too have to migrate to more difficult envi- ronments. MDG5: Maternal Health. Women working overseas can have more opportunities to be better informed, which could lead to health- seeking behaviour.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "463166f5-1048-47b6-b79a-31cabbb51c68": {"__data__": {"id_": "463166f5-1048-47b6-b79a-31cabbb51c68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35b00c38a76f8363be5f98203413d0a825aef10736195ed64efd3a66bf47ad1e"}, "2": {"node_id": "83b543e2-f72b-4c3d-a220-6130bc44d5cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "343bcb2aef333f25e945a4bd9d67abd3cd4f38fecbbbe89557ade9cd25d59cb8"}}, "hash": "056d36b795a4fcd8913aca58dd051cc43301be06370f14aae470d964c83bd647", "text": "However, they could face restrictions on their movements and other forms of exploitation, which inhibit this health seeking behaviour.

Migration may result in a better understanding among cultures and societies, leading to greater possibilities of creating a global partnership for development. But unregulated migration can also result in a backlash against migrants among local popu- lations. For families, migration is financially beneficial but socially disruptive ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 104 From the perspective of the MDGs, and of human development generally, it is clear that migration is intrinsically neither beneficial nor detrimental (Box 5.4). Much depends on the circumstances. What can policy makers do to promote the positive aspects and minimize the negative ones? Source Country Measures Though many aspects of migration appear to be under the control of the destination countries, in fact, there is also a great deal that the source countries can do to make migration a more productive and fulfilling experience, especially for unskilled and semi-skilled workers and for women. Viet Nam, for example, has shown how effective such measures can be (Box 5.5). Governments in source countries should there- fore develop national strategies for migration. These could include: Increasing Access to Information. Most migrants get information on migration opportunities from networks of migrants and former migrants. This tends to concentrate the BOX 5.4 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES OF MIGRATION Channel of Impact Nature of impact Human development outcomes Positive Impacts Employment and Provides employment to unemployed or underemployed.

Governments can create a more level playing field by making relevant infor- mation on markets and employment opportu- nities available throughout the country and across all income categories and social groups. Recruitment Agencies. Many migrant workers fall victim to unscrupulous recruitment agencies that can charge exorbitant fees or fail to deliver the promised employment. Governments need, therefore, to regulate and monitor recruitment agencies and close down illegal ones. Conversely, they can reward effective agencies \u2013 by recogni- zing their role and treating them as partners in the social development process. Skills Training and Resources. Workers will be in a much stronger position to take advantage of migration opportunities if they have certified skills. In addition to creating more training institutions, governments should therefore ensure that these and other government agencies and higher educational institutions obtain national, regional and international accredita- tion. This will provide potential employers with a measure of quality assurance \u2013 especially for skilled and semi-skilled labour.

Cultural Adaptation. Poorer emigrants will often find themselves very isolated in a new environment. To ease the adaptation process, governments in the source countries can provide language immersion classes and educational programmes that introduce migrants to the cultural nuances of the destination country. Rights Awareness. Migrants will be in a stronger position to protect themselves from exploitation if they are more aware of their rights and know how to protect themselves from discrimination and abuse.

The Government officially guaranteed jobs to most Vietnamese but their incomes and living standards were very low and there was widespread poverty and even starvation. To help alleviate the problems the Government carefully managed migration abroad under strict regulation. Recognized recruitment agencies, subject to government regulation, were given the autonomy to explore new markets for short-term workers, develop contacts with foreign partners and directly enter into labour contracts with migrant workers. These agencies were encouraged to enter into new forms of cooperation, such as sub-contracting, turnkey contracts for construction projects and joint ventures with foreign partners. The Government also encouraged migrants by allowing them flexibility on using their income. Migration increased steadily in the 1990s, and the country now sends around 40,000 workers abroad each year (DAFEL 2003). In Dong Thap province for example, a combination of incentives was provided to encourage and equip locals to work abroad. The Government provided loans for travel through a combined financing programme \u2013 80 per cent from the central government and 20 per cent from the local government through local public sector banks. A local agency, the Centre for Job Services, provided vocational training and conducted language classes to enable people to apply for work in Malaysia, Taiwan (China) and Japan. With the help from local officials, potential migrants could also apply for passports from home instead of having to travel to Ho Chi Minh City. These incentives helped to triple migration from the province in 2002. Source: Huy et al. 2003. ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 106 strengthen embassies in countries that employ significant numbers of their migrant workers, by offering the necessary support through the posting of labour officers experienced in hand- ling worker welfare and legal issues. Channelling Remittances. So far, governments in the source countries have done relatively little to channel foreign exchange remittances into specific development projects \u2013 such as building local infrastructure or improving health and education services. Governments could therefore encourage the financial sector to develop the appropriate instruments and financial products. Return Migration. Few Asian source countries offer any support to returnees to help them deal with the social, economic and psychological effects of return, sometimes after a relatively long period abroad into what could be very changed societies. Government agencies could do more to counsel returnees and help them settle. For migrants who have returned with significant funds, the government can provide seminars on entrepreneurship and other self- employment opportunities. For migrants with more limited resources, the government can provide soft loans and offer skills training pro- grammes to help them establish small businesses. Destination Country Measures The destination countries have security and other concerns about immigration. They there- fore control the arrival of different types of migrants and limit their rights. Recently, they have been increasing these protectionist measures \u2013 restricting the number of arrivals, introducing administrative and procedural delays in processing visa applications and work permits, and making renewals and extensions more difficult and expensive. They have also been less willing to recognize the qualifications and experience of such workers. In the IT sector, for example, there are no formal accreditation procedures, and the outcome can often be opaque and discretionary. One particular area of concern is the appli- cation of an \u2018economic needs test\u2019 for the arrival of certain professionals. Some governments oblige employers who propose employing a migrant to demonstrate that they have failed to recruit a comparable national worker.

Migration could also proceed more effi- ciently if recipient and source countries arrive at mutual recognition agreements (MRAs). They might start, for example, with less contentious areas like the accreditation of higher educational institutions \u2013 establishing equivalences in educa- tion levels, degrees, and the quality of graduates. Subsequently, they could move on to the recog- nition of licenses, professional certificates and experience. The private sector, particularly pro- fessional associations, can help here. MRAs can be negotiated at a multilateral level, but this process is often difficult, lengthy and tedious, and therefore bilateral or regional agreements might be more feasible for specific professions and occupations. ASEAN, for example, has lifted visa requirements for its member countries to increase movement of citizens, a precedent that could be extended across the region. Destination country governments could also reduce the number of temporary migration visa over-stayers by working more closely with employers. Under such schemes, the sponsoring employers cooperate with governments moni- toring of their employees and also take responsi- bility for workers\u2019 return travel \u2013 and face the possibility of sanctions if found in breach of the requirements. Evidence suggests that the most sustainable temporary migration programmes are those that are appropriately regulated and Government agencies could do more to counsel returnees and help them settle CHAPTER 5: SELLING SERVICES ACROSS FRONTIERS 107 enforced. Bilateral or regional agreements can play an important role in this. Multilateral Action For migration, the most important trade agreement, which operates under the aegis of the WTO, is the 1995 General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). This was designed to allow developing countries to obtain more liberal access for temporary migrants, and make such migration more secure and sustainable. In practice, however, it does not offer much by way of liberalization and seems to have had little effect on migration patterns in Asia and the Pacific. One problem is that it is quite narrow. As might be expected, GATS does not cover migrants working outside the service industries and tends not to cover foreign domestic service workers, although this issue is still a matter of controversy. And since it favours relatively higher-income and highly skilled people, it could even be seen to aggravate inequalities both among and within countries. Moreover, since GATS is not a migration agreement but a trade agreement, it is silent on issues such as the treatment of persons working abroad and on forced migration and trafficking. Source countries could nevertheless use the GATS framework to promote desirable short- term economic migration. There are a number of ways in which this can be done \u2013 as outlined in Box 5.6. Migration could also proceed more efficiently if recipient and source countries arrive at mutual recognition agreements BOX 5.6 MIGRATION OPTIONS IN THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TRADE IN SERVICES Delinking Immigration and Employment Policies. Developed countries are reluctant to make more binding commitments on Mode 4, fearing that this would give them less flexibility on immigration legislation and procedures. There should therefore be a mechanism to de-link a legitimate immigration policy from restrictions on migration for temporary employ- ment. Governments should also relax or remove various market access barriers to Mode 4 movement, such as quotas and quantitative restrictions, wage conditions and administrative procedures. Adopting the GATS Visa. One proposal, from India, is to have a \u2018GATS visa\u2019 that would be issued to individuals or professionals who have been invited or recruited to perform temporary services in another country. It would thus be timebound, employment- specific, and temporary; moreover, it could not be converted to another type of visa or used to seek permanent employment or residence. This would separate labour migration from the often cumbersome immigration procedures needed to obtain temporary entry. Strengthening the Emergency and Safeguard Clauses. A commitment under GATS is a permanent obligation. So even when destination countries accept the need for more migrants, they may be nervous about making permanent commitments. However, these concerns can be addressed if GATS rules instead allowed countries to invoke emergency safeguard measures \u2013 or permitted a timebound commitment. Countries could still apply economic needs tests, though in a less arbitrary manner. For migration, the most important trade agreement, which operates under the tutelage of the WTO, is the 1995 General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).

While this is of benefit to developed countries that are the source of most such investment, it offers much less to developing countries that would like to see greater movement of individual professionals and service providers independent of corporate presence. Expanding the Classification List. The WTO classification of professionals is insufficiently detailed and different countries interpret it in different ways. Instead, it should break these down further to identify workers more clearly \u2013 possibly by adopting the International Standards Classification of Occupations. This should provide a list of individual professions that is independent of professional firms or sectors and thus would be more meaningful to developing countries. ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 108 phenomenon is growing rapidly (Box 5.7). One estimate suggested that between 2002 and 2006 business process outsourcing (BPO) alone would have risen from $570 billion to $1,200 billion.9 Outsourcing typically involves shifting functions from higher-wage to lower-wage economies in efforts to increase efficiency and lower costs, enabling the company to concen- trate more on its core operations. Thus, compa- nies in the US and Europe started to outsource to countries such as India, China, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa and Viet Nam. Initially, the work they sent was primarily concerned with data entry and the maintenance, delivery and management of IT functions. Since then the range and complexity of services has expanded rapidly \u2013 and blurs the boundaries between sectors and activities. Services are now provided all along the value chain, from data entry to highly skilled tasks such as 3D modelling (Box 5.8). Outsourcing Business Processes Nowadays many more companies are passing some of their non-core operations to third-party service providers. Such outsourcing of business processes occurs both within a country and outside. Cross-border outsourcing, or offshor- ing, is a new form of trade in services that is enabled by information and communications technologies. Typically, companies use this form of \u2018global outsourcing\u2019 for business processes and back-office functions. This takes advantage of technological advances and falling costs in information and communications technology that now permit delivery over the telephone and the Internet of a wide variety of services at all levels of skill and complexity.7 The current scale of outsourcing is difficult to assess, but OECD estimates that in 2001, IT and business process services outsourcing was worth around $260 billion.8 Undoubtedly, the BOX 5.7 OUTSOURCING BUSINESS PROCESSES \u2013 IMPLICATIONS FOR WIDENING EMPLOYMENT A special contribution from Narayana Murthy, Chairman of one of India\u2019s largest outsourcing companies, Infosys. The global business process outsourcing (BPO) industry today performs services that range from human resources, research and financial activities, to design and engineering functions. Worldwide, BPO revenues were expected to touch $133.7 billion in 2005, an 8 per cent growth from $123.8 billion in 2004. The BPO industry in Asia is estimated to grow by over 13.8 per cent annually through 2008, and job creation is expected to accelerate, resulting in up to 6 million new jobs by 2015. Asia\u2019s outsourcing advantage stems from its growing pool of highly skilled, low-cost workers \u2013 in India, around 3,000 educational institutions train more than 200,000 software professionals and an equal number of non-engineering English-speaking graduates every year. China trains an estimated 400,000 graduates a year. At the same time, aging populations and falling fertility rates in Western Europe and the US mean emerging labour shortages in developed countries. It is estimated that at present productivity levels, the US alone will need 15.6 million more workers by 2015 to maintain current living standards. India accounts for over 40 per cent of the global BPO market; from 2000 to 2004, the country saw an estimated 260,000 jobs created within the sector. The industry has also seen competing, low-cost destinations emerge across Asia \u2013 the Philippines, China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c273541-5b34-4206-903e-124801db0248": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c273541-5b34-4206-903e-124801db0248", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f4a3185a300365743cfa40b529255730913b852c6b531cdf3492e1d7a7072a9"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c31c29c-93cd-4899-a871-1a405f3e9c3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a3c85f9825033d027f16d642ae808760aebb23767b379ce6109490c873ab4bf"}}, "hash": "59b1b0fadad91565a377bd2733cd52454aee012550ef847e7aea8ffbeedb374c", "text": "However, to take advantage of the opportunities from outsourcing, countries must remove existing impediments to growth.

In India today, an estimated 40 per cent of children drop out of school by the age of ten; across Asia, 46 million children are out of school. Clearly, countries must expand the reach of elementary education; academic institutions must focus on modernizing curriculum and aligning higher education with the needs of the industry. In addition, we must establish innovation systems of industry, science and research centres, and universities, to create new knowledge and technology. China\u2019s reformist leader Deng Xiaoping once said, \u201cTo get rich, you must first build a road.\u201d This adage holds as true in the Information Age as in the Industrial Age. To fully realize the gains of the outsourcing industry, countries must concentrate on upgrading their infrastructure to support industry clusters \u2013 modernizing their power facilities, technological infrastructure, airports, highways, and shipping ports. Additionally, effective legal and regulatory frameworks are essential to address security and privacy concerns of outsourcing firms. Outsourcing typically involves shifting functions from higher-wage to lower-wage economies in efforts to increase efficiency and lower costs CHAPTER 5: SELLING SERVICES ACROSS FRONTIERS 109 As a result, the outsourcing flows between countries are becoming more complex. For instance, several Indian IT firms and some inde- pendent BPO providers are outsourcing to other developing countries like China and the Philippines that offer special skills, or to deve- loped countries like Canada that offer proximity to US clients. Singaporean companies such as Singapore Computer Systems are in turn estab- lishing their own outsourcing facilities in India and China. These new patterns of outsourcing are driven by the need to diversify production bases, pool risks and take advantage of indivi- dual country strengths. A number of Asian countries have been seizing these opportunities. According to one study, five of the top ten outsourcing destina- tions are in Asia. In 2001, for business process operations, for example, India was the leader with $7.7 billion, while China accounted for $1.1 billion. This compares with $3 billion in Israel, $0.5 billion in Mexico and $0.4 billion in Eastern Europe. But many other countries have been establishing themselves as outsourcing destinations.10 Bangladesh is a host to medical transcription services such as Digital Divide Data. Cambodia provides outsourced data services to business and public customers both at home and abroad, and is at present engaged in the task of digitizing Harvard University\u2019s archives. China is a key product development centre for GE, Intel, Microsoft, Phillips, and other large electronics firms, for hardware design and embedded software. India has IT companies such as Infosys, TCS, Wipro, and Satyam that provide IT support, technical help desks, web support, and infrastructure services to overseas companies. There are also companies working in product BOX 5.8 OUTSOURCING SERVICES ALONG THE VALUE CHAIN Global outsourcing of services can be classified into five broad categories, based on their contribution to value and their skill requirements: 1. Data entry, digitization, conversion, transcription. At the lowest end of the value and skill chain are back-office functions such as data entry, digitization, and conversion activities, and basic clerical services that do not require domain knowledge or specialized expertise. One of the most common of these is transcription services, whereby dictations by doctors or lawyers are converted to written medical or legal records. 2. Rule-based processing and simple support services. Next in the value chain are teleworking services, which involve rule- based processing and simple voice and on-line customer relations services, based on rules set by the client. These include call-centre services, email-processing, data processing, billing and payments, account opening, and screening of credit card applications \u2013 all at rates as low as $10 per hour. 3. Activities involving problem solving and decision making. Slightly higher up the value chain are activities that involve problem solving and decision making, such as developing solutions for improving processes or streamlining systems. In developing countries like India these command rates of $10 to $15 per hour. 4. Complex multimedia support services. Next on the value chain are teleworking services that involve direct interaction with customers and more elaborate transactions with the client, but moving beyond pure voice-based support to mixed media-based support services and beyond writing routine software applications to the remote management of sophisticated networks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afc34b31-b61a-404f-a61e-901834b613ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "afc34b31-b61a-404f-a61e-901834b613ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ad30eccbaa1132b05b65d27382165c3f5b1d26f0bbcd7cddef21d19974bfcb5"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb386625-8597-4675-aed5-f8d3ad983832", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "994c42ce0495eabba695e69b5ec46d8902227cb8016c482256ca3f782132eea1"}}, "hash": "97811be0140682c082ecd73eafee60607cccf0dc7a754b2d5e6df0c8edc2cc14", "text": "These include activities like web support, telemarketing, providing customer help desks, technical back office processing, e-customer relationship management, website design, software development for entire business processes, and hardware support services. 5.

Philippines is a host to outsourced work by some 8,000 foreign companies, covering services such as graphic design, architectural blueprints, telemarketing, accounting, and software code writing. Singapore has service providers engaged in leading-edge functions like remote robotics management, health care, and genetic diag- nostics. Viet Nam carries out simple coding jobs for IBM, Cisco, Sony, Nortel Networks, and NTT, but is also increasingly engaging in higher-value activities connected to geographic informa- tion systems, computer-aided design, finance, factory automation, healthcare and computer animation. Clearly, there could also be opportunities for outsourcing in geographically isolated states \u2013 landlocked countries, for example, and small island developing states \u2013 especially in those, such as Bhutan and Mongolia, that have a significant English-speaking population or relatively high education levels. Reasons for Outsourcing Global outsourcing is driven by many different factors. In some cases, companies will outsource to an overseas company that provides specific skills. But generally enterprises are seeking to cut costs on more basic activities, and so they will be looking to countries and companies that can provide low-wage, highly-educated workers who offer a broad range of skills \u2013 and can do so through good low-cost, high-bandwidth tele- communications infrastructure. Other factors \u2013 in both the buying and selling countries \u2013 that influence the choice of outsourcing partners are indicated in Box 5.9. The principal reason for outsourcing is usually to cut costs, and therefore most out- sourcing goes to low-wage economies. For example, in the US telephone operators and medical transcribers earn around $13 per hour, while in India they would receive less than $2 per hour.11 Similarly, in the US a financial analyst might earn around $35 per hour while a counterpart in the India might get $6 to $15 per hour. One survey concluded that the monthly cost of keeping one high-tech employee in Silicon Valley is $15,000 per worker, while someone in New Delhi with the same skills, responsibilities and job package would cost $2,500 a month. This translates into savings of $12,500 per month, or $150,000 for a year. By outsourcing 10 jobs to India, a start-up in the US can thus cut payroll costs by $1.5 million. Initial invest- ment costs are also far lower: setting up a call centre in Delhi, for example, costs only around one-third of what it might cost in the US.12 Many outsourcing firms have realized, however, that they are saving even more as a result of productivity gains \u2013 fewer errors in data processing, for example, or fewer defects in computer programs, or a higher quality of Many outsourcing firms have realized that they are saving even more as a result of productivity gains BOX 5.9 FACTORS SHAPING COMPETITIVENESS IN GLOBAL OUTSOURCING In the service-providing country \u2022 Availability of labour and skills, the quality manpower and related educational investments \u2022 Competitive wages \u2022 Strength of domestic IT industry and its export orientation \u2022 Physical infrastructure \u2022 Government incentives and support \u2022 The business environment \u2022 Intellectual property legislation \u2022 State of regulation in supporting areas such as telecoms and the Internet In the purchasing countries \u2022 Business cycle conditions \u2022 Availability of skills and labour \u2022 Relative wages \u2022 The need for diversification, risk pooling, and cost reduction \u2022 Technological developments and possibilities for dis-intermedia- ting services \u2022 Legislation concerning outsourc- ing \u2022 Data protection and intellectual property requirements \u2022 Legislation on immigration \u2022 International certification for quality \u2022 Diaspora and others with con- tacts in the providing country CHAPTER 5: SELLING SERVICES ACROSS FRONTIERS 111 transcription.

Many developing countries in the region do not have legal systems that can meet international standards in these areas. Even countries with considerable experience in outsourcing can run into problems. India, for example, is now having difficulty recruiting enough skilled people: the education pipeline is not producing sufficient educated young people; turnover rates are high, wages are rising and service providers are poaching among them- selves. In addition, there are constraints imposed by the outsourcing countries. Some of these might be indirect, such as greater restrictions on temporary work visas for professionals who need to spend time overseas preparing and main- taining outsourcing contracts. Other constraints are more direct, as workers in the outsourcing countries object to a loss of jobs. In the US, labour unions, like the Communication Workers of America, are lobbying against outsourcing by US companies or demanding parity in wages bet- ween developing and developed country service providers. In December 2002, for example, 22,000 engineers in Seattle threatened to walk out to protest Boeing\u2019s decision to outsource work to Russian engineers \u2013 as a result of which Boeing halved its employment of Russians. In response to such pressures, several states have been restricting outsourcing by public bodies. In 2002, New Jersey, for example, passed a bill banning the outsourcing of government contracts to other countries. It is difficult to gauge the net impact of such protectionist pressures. Bans on government outsourcing are not likely to have a major impact, since in countries like India such projects constitute 1 per cent or less of outsourcing. However, the protec- tionist challenges could grow and start affecting the volume and type of business outsourcing. Employment Impact of Global Outsourcing. Outsourcing employs relatively small numbers of people at the top end of the labour market and might be thought unlikely to affect poverty directly. India, for example, has just over a million people working in software and IT- enabled services, but this amounts to just one- quarter of 1 per cent of all workers. Even if the sector were to grow fourfold over the next few years, it would still account for only 1 per cent of the work force, and the opportunities would be limited to those who have basic literacy and computer skills and access to training oppor- tunities. However, such work does have some advantages for human development. First, it draws in a wider social spectrum than many Outsourcing employs relatively small numbers of people at the top end of the labour market; the availability of relatively high-paid jobs helps to stem the \u2018brain drain\u2019 ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 112 other forms of employment. Call centres, for example, which employ around 50,000 people in the Philippines and 150,000 in India, have quite inclusive employment policies: in countries facing shortages of skilled labour, companies are happy to hire people who might traditionally have been outside the labour force, including women and retirees. In India, for example, Wipro has 5,000 employees, of whom almost half are women; and for ICICI One Source and DakshIndia the proportion of female employees is around 60 per cent. Some companies are also experimenting with locating data centres and telecentres closer to residential areas, or allowing people to work from their homes \u2013 making it easier for home- makers and retirees to participate. Others have deliberately focused on expanding employment opportunities beyond the usual target group of graduates and the economically well-off. The Cambodian NGO-initiated enterprise, Digital Data Divide, a digitization and data-entry ser- vices provider, offers jobs to physically chal- lenged people, those affected by land mines and polio, and orphans, at monthly rates ($65) that are higher than those in manufacturing ($40). Half of the company\u2019s workforce of a staff of 93 are females.13 Thus, global outsourcing can enable less visible and even marginalized groups to integrate with the labour market. Moreover, as wage rates in this business tend to be higher than elsewhere, it can provide them with a big improvement in their standards of living. Outsourcing can also help boost national levels of skill. This can happen both overseas and at home. Overseas employees can take in workers to learn about their technical applica- tions, products, processes, and marketing tech- niques. But even the workers who stay at home will acquire many skills in customer relationship management \u2013 thus learning to focus on quality and timeliness. The workforce thus acquires greater discipline, a more professional work culture, and a greater sense of accountability. The availability of relatively high-paid jobs also helps to stem the \u2018brain drain\u2019.

Indeed, there is some evi- dence of reverse migration: a number of compa- nies are relocating expatriates to offshore operations, and many senior professionals and managers are also returning voluntarily to their country \u2013 attracted by the internationally com- parable salaries, improved working conditions and changing image of their countries. However, not all the employment effects are positive, and there is some evidence that outsourcing can also lead to de-skilling. This is because outsourcing companies can tempt even highly trained people to take lower-skilled but highly paid jobs. In Bangladesh, for example, doctors are accepting work as medical tran- scribers; and engineering and science graduates are often employed in routine tasks such as software programming and web applications design and support. As well as underutilizing skills, this also risks skewing national education and training policies towards meeting short-term needs for lower-skilled people and away from education in more fundamental disciplines and the longer-term research and development that will be needed to help build indigenous manufacturing capabilities. Spillover Employment Effects The benefits of outsourcing are not just, of course, felt by people directly employed. These workers will spend their wages and produce important externalities and spillover effects. Most outsourcing employees tend to be in their 20s and 30s, an age group that stimulates demand for consumer durables and other services. The Gurgaon district of Delhi, one of India\u2019s main outsourcing hubs, has seen a rapid CHAPTER 5: SELLING SERVICES ACROSS FRONTIERS 113 expansion in shopping centres and related infra- structure in response to demand from employees in the BPO industry. Outsourcing workers also stimulate a wide range of ancillary services \u2013 in housekeeping, security, catering, transport, real estate, tele- coms, and computer equipment provision and maintenance. Caterers are required for shift catering services. Cleaners, janitors, and other support staff are required to maintain world- class premises. In the absence of reliable public transport, fleets of vehicles and drivers are hired to ferry call centre employees to and from their homes. Thus, while the sector itself may be directly geared to a certain kind of employee profile, it can indirectly create equitable employ- ment opportunities, which are neutral to gender, type of business, and skill level. Outsourcing also triggers the creation of new training institutions and infrastructure, such as computer technical schools, diploma progra- mmes, and IT training and applications courses in colleges and universities. As outsourcing providers look further afield, these institutions are now appearing beyond the metropolises in the smaller cities and towns \u2013 helping to distribute income and employment benefits. Social Impact of Outsourcing Outsourcing can have many positive social benefits \u2013 by providing age- and gender-neutral employment to many thousands of people. But it can also have social costs. Some of these are related to difficult working conditions. These include adverse health effects due to working night shifts, the sedentary nature of the jobs, and the constant use of computers. Long night shifts at call centres can also prevent young employees from having a normal social life and may isolate them from their communities. The rapid growth of the outsourcing industry is also widening disparities. In India, for example, Bangalore\u2019s explosive growth has aggravated inequalities between cities and rural areas and small towns. Within the city, too, while some special enclaves are being developed for teleworking establishments, other areas are being neglected. Meanwhile, the urban poor are suffering from rising costs, deteriorating civic amenities, and an influx of migrants. Out- sourcing can thus contribute to a labour market and information divide that cannot be in the interests of sustainable long-term development. Fiscal and Trade Impact Given its scale, outsourcing might be an impor- tant source of tax revenue that could enable developing-country governments to spend more on social services. Often, however, the fiscal benefits are fairly limited. In order to encourage such activities, many governments have exempted them from taxes \u2013 or from import duties on hardware and telecoms equipment. Indeed, the government may have spent consi- derable amounts in building communications infrastructure for teleworking establishments. As a result, in fiscal terms outsourcing firms may not be net contributors but net recipients. Likewise, on the trade front, although out- sourcing contributes to export earnings, there is also a significant foreign exchange outflow from outsourcing providers \u2013 buying bandwidth from telecommunication firms, for example, or purchasing hardware from the outsourcing economies.

The Vietnamese Government too is encouraging overseas train- ing institutes from Australia and India to train thousands of Vietnamese in dedicated centres across the country. Labour Standards and Regulation. Some of the negative social, cultural and occupational outcomes can be mitigated if governments focus on core labour standards, human resource management practices, and domestic labour laws. Governments and industry can also work together to combat high attrition rates, by providing more training and development and offering structured career paths.

Malaysia has invested heavily in IT infrastructure (Box 5.12). Regulatory Framework. Governments may need to introduce internationally compatible laws and regulations concerning the protection of intellec- tual property rights and Internet transactions, data privacy, consumer protection, e-gover- nance, and spectrum liability. Fiscal Policy and Incentives. While tax breaks may be necessary to encourage growth in the initial stages of a business, the long-term aim should be to bring the outsourcing providers into the tax net, so that part of their profits are reinvested in the society. Negotiation through GATS Domestic strategies need to be supplemented with international action. The recent surge in opposition to global outsourcing in key markets like the US and the UK makes it all the more important to address this issue through multi- lateral, regional, and bilateral negotiations and agreements. Currently, the electronic marketplace is largely free of explicit trade barriers and WTO members have agreed to temporarily exempt electronic commerce from customs duties and taxes. These commitments now need to be bound into agreements to preclude the introduc- tion of new barriers to e-commerce. Some of the most important opportunities for multilateral action on outsourcing should be through the negotiations on the General Agree- ment on Trade in Services (GATS). However, in areas such as distribution, advertising, architec- ture, legal work, accountancy, and computer and related services, less than half of the commit- ments in the relevant clauses of GATS are full or unrestricted \u2013 mainly due to the lack of commit- ments by developing countries. This kind of liberalization is best addressed through a \u2018positive list\u2019 to allow countries to pace the degree and scope of liberalization in accordance with their needs and their ability to prepare supporting domestic regulations. Countries can also pursue their interests in outsourcing through regional and bilateral trade and investment agreements, which can prepare the ground for regulatory frameworks that can later be extended to the multilateral level. Partnerships Governments should also be able to rely on support from bilateral aid organizations, various parts of the UN System, and the World Bank \u2013 for developing infrastructure, organizing training and providing policy advice. They can also help in improving national statistics on outsourcing. In addition, private enterprises, national and multinational, and their industry associations can assist in efforts to liberalize markets and counter protectionist threats. In India, for BOX 5.12 CREATING COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE FOR OUTSOURCING IN MALAYSIA Labour costs are far higher in Malaysia than in China and India. Nevertheless well-developed infrastructure and government support have made it an attractive outsourcing destination. As part of its multimedia Super Corridor project, the Government has invested around $10 billion in setting up two IT cities \u2013 Cyberjaya and Putrajaya \u2013 with hi-tech parks, fibre-optic networks, new roads, and laws promoting e-commerce. Malaysia is also emerging as a hub for research and clinical services in biotechnology. Based on local capabilities in a variety of Asian languages, like Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, Bahasa Malay, Bahasa Indonesia, Tamil, Hindi, Thai, and Japanese, the Government is promoting the country as a high-end contact centre for customer services in the Asia-Pacific region and a pan-Asian hub. Outsourcing is expected to provide employment to 50,000 persons in the corridor cities by 2011.

A New International Division of Labour Global outsourcing represents a new interna- tional division of labour. While in manufacturing production was split across countries based on competitive advantage, in outsourcing different countries will occupy different parts of the global services space. For many developing countries, this can be a valuable source of growth and economic and human development \u2013 creating employment and incomes, and empowering many sections of society and promoting growth with equity. It can also transfer new skills, technologies, and processes. Realizing the potential of outsourcing will, however, require determined and focused government action to spread the benefits beyond small enclaves and ensure that it stimulates broad-based growth by integrating outsourcing activities with the rest of the economy. To accomplish this government will need to invest in physical and social capital and try to ensure that enterprises move steadily up the value chain. Overall, global outsourcing must be seen not as a single engine of growth but as another poten- tial avenue for promoting economic and human development. International Tourism After oil and petroleum, the world\u2019s second- largest industry is travel and tourism. Globally, in 2005 this was expected to generate $6.4 trillion of economic activity, equivalent to 3.8 per cent of global GDP, though if one also considers the many other parts of the economy that also depend on tourism, the \u2018travel & tourism economy\u2019, the proportion rises to 10.6 per cent. Directly the sector employs 74 million people, 2.8 per cent of total world employment; indirectly it employs 222 million people, 8.3 per cent of total employment. A tourist, according to the United Nations and World Tourism Organization definition, is someone who is staying outside his or her usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business or other purposes. Some of these people may not travel very far; others will traverse half the globe. Since this report is about international trade, it is con- cerned specifically with tourism across inter- national frontiers, though many of the same considerations apply to domestic tourism, which can often make a more significant contribution to human development (Box 5.13). In 2004 there were 763 million international tourists, spending around $623 billion. But by the year 2020, WTO predicts that the number of international arrivals will reach 1.6 billion \u2013 spending a total of $2 trillion per year.14 Of these worldwide arrivals in 2020, 1.2 billion will be those of intra-regional travellers and 0.4 billion will be of long-haul travellers. BOX 5.13 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DOMESTIC TOURISM With the recent decline in long-haul travel post-9/11, SARS, the Iraq war and the Asian tsunami, many destinations, especially in the larger countries, have come to place greater reliance on the domestic market. This has significant advantages over international tourism: domestic visitors are more likely to support smaller local enterprises, help even out the seasonality patterns \u2013 and help conserve foreign exchange. China has the world\u2019s largest domestic tourism market. In 2004, the number of domestic tourists reached 1.1 billion, and domestic tourism revenues totalled $57 billion, accounting for 67 per cent of China\u2019s gross tourism revenue. India too has a huge domestic market. Unconfirmed estimates suggest more than 350 million domestic tourists, around one-quarter of which is pilgrimage traffic. Although national tourists spend less than international tourists, they travel in large numbers and tend to stay longer, and thus help create more jobs (Aibara and Gopalani 2005). After oil and petroleum, the world\u2019s second largest industry is travel and tourism ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 118 As elsewhere in the world, tourism in the Asia-Pacific region was greatly disrupted by the triple shocks of September 11 in 2001, the SARS outbreak and the war in Afghanistan as well as in Iraq. The September 11 attacks alone caused a 10 per cent drop in travel worldwide \u2013 up to 30 per cent in some countries \u2013 and cost 6.5 million jobs. In 2004 there was a spectacular rebound: while tourism grew in all the world\u2019s regions, in the Asia-Pacific region it increased by 29 per cent \u2013 though a number of tourist desti- nations in the region were later hit by the tsunami in December 2004. The distribution of these arrivals is indicated in Table 5.1. The significance of tourism to a particular country can be considered in a number of ways. One is through the total number of arrivals. This tends to be greater for the largest countries \u2013 with China in the lead, followed by Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore respectively, all of which in the past decade have developed huge tourism infrastructures.

This gives some indication of how economically dependent a country is on tourism. For those countries with GDP figures available, the Maldives is at the top of the list with tourism representing 32 per cent of GDP, followed by Vanuatu and Fiji respectively. Were the data available, other Pacific Islands would also rank highly. A third way of assessing the distribution is to consider tourist arrivals per head of population (Figure 5.3). This too indicates the degree of dependence on tourism but also gives an idea of the social impact. In this case, Palau comes out ahead followed by the Maldives, but even Singapore has more annual tourist arrivals than its total population. Finally, one can consider arrivals from the perspective of poverty. The most popular desti- nations seem to be the middle- and upper- income developing countries. Nevertheless, Many more of these people are arriving in the Asia-Pacific region. In the 1950s, the region contributed less than 10 per cent to global tourist volume, but by the early 1970s, its contribution had risen to 20 per cent, and by 2004 to 40 per cent.

The Human Development Impact of Tourism From the human development perspective, the most important effect of tourism is to create employment. The tourist industry employs people at many levels of skill, from holders of MBAs to unskilled migrants from the rural areas. They can have a broad range of skills \u2013 hotel managers, fitness instructors, drivers, masseurs, beauticians, chefs \u2013 and some are employed directly, others indirectly, in support sectors such as retail trade, transport, or arts and crafts.

Another aspect of employment is highlighted in the table: which the proportion of the total workforce employed in tourism. In the Maldives, for example, this is very high, at around two-thirds. For the region as a whole, it is close to 7 per cent. Currently, many countries of the region are focusing on the development of domestic tourism, which is showing fast growth (Box 5.13). Compared to other modern sectors, a higher proportion of benefits in the travel and tourism industry go to women \u2013 whether through formal or petty trade and informal employment. According to the ILO, women constitute 70 per cent of the entire tourism workforce, though the percentage varies enormously by country, and in Muslim countries can be less than 10 per cent.

In India, for example, it has been calculated that a $23,000 investment will generate 89 jobs in the hotel and restaurant industry, compared with 45 in agri- culture and only 13 in manufacturing.15 Many of these jobs are low-paid and seaso- nal, but they do offer low-skilled workers oppor- tunities to move up the income ladder. Many poor people, who have lost work in agriculture as a result of more liberalized and competitive global food markets, have been transferred to the tourist industry either to work permanently or as part-time or casual labourers during the high season. The poor can have a direct stake in the tourism industry not just through jobs but also through many business opportunities, particu- larly in the informal sector, where there are many small-scale, locally run tourism enterprises. These benefits can also be geographically dis- persed. Although high-volume tourism can be concentrated in beach resorts, cities or famous sites, there are also opportunities to create tourism-related jobs in remote areas that have few other options. In addition to its contribution to poverty reduction through employment, tourism also helps boost government revenues through taxa- tion. This can be generated directly through a tourism tax that is paid either to the local or national authorities, or through taxes on the pro- fits of tourist-related businesses. These revenues can then be invested in public services. More indirectly, by boosting foreign exchange earnings tourism supports macro-economic stability, which again contributes to poverty reduction. However, it should also be noted that much tourist revenue leaves the country \u2013 through payments to foreign-owned hotel chains, imports of goods for the tourism industries, or revenues accruing to foreign airlines. In small island nations these \u2018leakages\u2019 can be quite large \u2013 though not necessarily higher than for other sectors such as manufacturing. For its contribution to poverty reduction, tourism can be considered in three main segments: business travel, leisure travel, and nature-based eco-tourism. Business Travel. In the Asia-Pacific region, business travellers are most likely to go to large urban centres like Bangkok, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Shanghai and Singapore. Here they, like other travellers, create a demand for services, though the extent to which these services are provided by the poor will differ from city to city \u2013 greater in Mumbai and Shanghai, for example, which have millions of poor people living in urban slums, than in wealthier Singapore. In addition, business travellers can help combat poverty since they further their own businesses; this should in the longer term boost economic growth, which, if equitably distributed, will expand opportunities for all.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6b82a77-15f6-4d10-bd94-a009b05213b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6b82a77-15f6-4d10-bd94-a009b05213b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9fb2ac89ec58e607ec854b1c49b4c8b86b0b39f97653604aa4eef07a4c3cd7e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc58637d-7652-446a-9017-55c6e8495b33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae45564c138d832c73b240065ac36bc7ed7ad88297ca47d21582a50ffaa0b717"}}, "hash": "280f329c93360fe41839554068bd67cb31fa04fe80e8ffac9c40179c08e19940", "text": "Leisure Travel. As with business travellers, the impact of leisure travellers on poverty will depend on their choice of destination. Also important, however, is how they interact with the local environment. People travelling on package tours, especially those going to enclave developments or all-inclusive resorts, or who are arriving on cruise ships, may meet very few local people. They will certainly encounter waiters or receptionists, or others formally employed in the tourist industry, but they will generate less work for informal businesses. Budget tourists, on the other hand, although they spend less in total on their trip, may spend more on local goods and services. Nevertheless even the income from high-end tourism can help combat poverty if it is redistributed through government spending.

And with an economically active population of 88,000 people, this provides 25,000 jobs, though 6,800 of these are held by expatriates. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Maldives had no choice but to promote the mid-scale tourist segment \u2013 till such time as the islands attained the critical mass required to sustain and encourage commercial air traffic and the requisite infrastructure. Lately, however, given the small size of the country and its fragile ecosystems, the Government has taken a conscious decision to focus on high-end tourism and has encouraged the growth of boutique-style, luxury resort developments. This approach has helped maximize revenues generated for both government and private sector investors while maintaining environmental and social sustainability. The Maldives does still offer a mix of properties to cater to different groups, but it also hosts some of the world\u2019s top resorts. These are clearly attractive since the visitor repeat rate is 20\u201330 per cent. These are also very profitable, and the high rates of return for most projects are encouraging many investors and top hotel chains to establish a presence. Source: World Bank, ADB and UN 2005. there has been a noticeable shift towards niche, special-interest and experiential tourism. Leisure visitors are increasingly seeking to spend time on understanding the culture, heritage and natural environment of the places they visit \u2013 a trend that bodes well many rural and remote areas. The fastest-growing form of special- interest tourism is eco-tourism \u2013 which refers to travel to natural areas in responsible ways that conserve the environment and sustain the well- being of local people. Bhutan and Nepal, for example, and the relatively underdeveloped North-East region of India, are uniquely placed to build on their comparative advantage in this area. Indeed, Asia as a whole has many of the world\u2019s major Buddhist heritage sites. Nature- based tourism offers many advantages for poverty elimination. It takes place in remote areas where residents are likely to be poor. It involves a higher proportion of independent travellers who may spend more locally. It also contributes to the conservation of the local heritage and to biodiversity. But it also brings risks. Nature-based tourism does not necessarily have low impact, particularly if it occurs in fragile areas. It can also suffer from high \u2018leakage\u2019 if it requires importing supplies and skills. Potential Negative Impacts of Tourism As with other components of economic growth and globalization, tourism can also have some negative effects. Inflation. Investment in tourist destinations can push up prices of land, accommodation and food \u2013 in some cases driving poor people out. Resource Conflicts. Tourist enterprises can also harm many livelihoods by taking over natural assets such as land or beaches or by polluting waterways. People in coastal communities in many Pacific Islands, for example, rely on fish for their main source of protein and income and can see their food security and livelihoods undermined by tourist development. Burden on Services. New tourist enterprises put pressure on water supplies, for example, and on waste management services \u2013 burdens that are often passed on to other local residents and businesses. Environmental Destruction. Mass tourism is generally associated with high consumption of water and energy. Hotels are often concentrated in small areas, and they contribute to the increasing traffic congestion and air and water pollution. In some cases tourists who are attracted by the remoteness or beauty of locations can effectively destroy what they have come to visit \u2013 as roads and hotels intrude on natural vistas, for example, or trekkers erode paths. And in coastal areas, activities such as snorkelling and scuba diving can endanger fragile marine ecosystems. Spread of Disease.

Tourism has also spawned hitherto-forgotten industries in stone carving and handicrafts \u2013 and boosted many other local enterprises. This success is attributed to the quality of the temples themselves, the ambience of the area, with its tall leafy trees, and the combined efforts of the Government, the private sector and NGOs. Now a region that had been exporting workers to the rest of the country is importing labour.

Cultural Issues. Many tourists, who are typically richer than the local population, can undermine age-old cultures by introducing consumerist values. Their hedonistic lifestyles can also offend the sensibilities of conservative communities. In addition, adapting local culture to tourism, through special performances, for example, can lead to a loss of identity and authenticity. Exploitation of Women. Women may while gain new jobs in the tourism industry, here, as in most other sectors, they are often at a disadvantage. Since they have less control over land and other properties, they find it more difficult to take full advantage of economic opportunities. Being vulnerable, women can also be subject to sexual exploitation. Pro-poor Tourist Development While tourism can lead to developmental problems, these can be resolved or minimized with proper planning and management. Among the priorities should be: Planning and Support. Governments need to be involved in establishing national and regional parameters for the industry as well as in creating support institutions, such as tourist boards and training institutes. Infrastructure. This is particularly important in remote regions, where tourism represents one of the few economic development opportunities \u2013 though in some cases the lack of infrastructure may be beneficial if it deters mass tourism to environmentally sensitive destinations. Cultural Diversity. Governments need to protect cultural diversity \u2013 allowing local people to participate in the economic benefits of tourism, while protecting their cultural heritage. One of the most remarkable examples of rapid develop- ment of infrastructure for tourism is at Angkor in Cambodia (Box 5.15). Training. Jobs in the industry do not normally require academic qualifications, and in many countries the major hotel groups and travel com- panies tend to rely on their own inhouse training facilities. This puts smaller enterprises at a disadvantage. Government agencies may, there- fore, work with the private sector on training, mentoring and short education courses that will help more people benefit. Linkages for the Poor. Economic \u2018leakages\u2019 need to be examined and, where possible, counte- racted. Large tourist operators can, for example, build partnerships with local small- and medium-size enterprises \u2013 purchasing local materials, outsourcing laundry and other such services, showcasing handicrafts and creating packages of local excursions. The operators can thus take into account commercial returns, while While tourism can lead to developmental problems, these can be resolved or minimized with proper planning and management CHAPTER 5: SELLING SERVICES ACROSS FRONTIERS 123 simultaneously seeking to optimize benefits for the marginalized. The New Trade in Economic Services The Asia-Pacific region is in the forefront of the international trade in services \u2013 in particular, through international migration, business outsourcing and tourism. But in all these areas policy makers will need to take firm and wide- ranging action to ensure that these dynamic sectors fulfil their potential to promote human development. For migration, both source country and destination countries can do more to make migration a more productive and fulfilling experience. Source countries can ensure that migrants are well informed, financed and trained before they depart, and destination countries can make the migration process simpler and more transparent. For business process outsourcing, govern- ments have a range of policy options to ensure that it makes a stronger contribution to human development, including building infrastructure, training the workforces and ensuring the best regulatory and fiscal environment. Regarding tourism, many of the problems can be resolved or minimized with proper plan- ning and management \u2013 building the appropriate infrastructure, for example, providing training to people working in smaller enterprises, and ensuring better economic links between larger tourist operators and poor communities.

In practice, the scales are heavily weighted in favour of the larger and more advanced countries. The developing countries, and particularly the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), find themselves in a much weaker position. The Asia-Pacific region is home to 37 per cent of the world\u2019s LDC population, with 14 of the 50 LDCs. They are: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Lao PDR, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. All qualify as LDCs because they satis- fy three criteria: low incomes, human resource weakness and economic vulnerability.1 Even so, they are clearly a very diverse group. Indeed, the region is home to the world\u2019s most populous LDC, Bangladesh, and the least, Tuvalu. Geographically too they can be very different: four are landlocked countries, for example, while seven are island states2 (Table 6.1). The LDCs are vulnerable on many fronts: \u2022 Economic. Exposure to exogenous shocks that adversely affect incomes, employment, domestic production, distribution, markets, consumption, and the stock of wealth. LDCs also have a limited capacity to deal with such shocks. When it comes to integrating into international trade, the Least Developed Countries are in a very vulnerable position. They typically have small economies, difficult topographies, and are located far from international markets, in which they are minor and weak players. They do benefit from some concessions from the developed countries, but will need fairer treatment at the WTO, as well as international assistance, if they are to use international trade to promote human development. Chapter Trading Opportunities for the Least Developed Countries 6 \u2022 Environmental. Exposure to calamities induced by natural or human-made factors. Small island states of the Pacific, for example, are often hit by droughts, floods, hurricanes, and volcanoes and earthquakes, while mountainous countries in Asia are prone to flashfloods, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. \u2022 Social. Exposure to factors that undermine social cohesion, introduce systemic social pathologies, and erode social capital. Because the LDCs have little capacity to respond, these events tend to recur. \u2022 Institutional.

Over the same period the adult literacy rate increased from 60 to 71 per cent, life expectancy rose from 58 to 62 years, and the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births rate dropped from 77 to 55.

They have few natural resources and are prone to natural disasters. CHAPTER 6: TRADING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES 129 LDCs and Liberalization One area where LDCs are especially exposed is international trade. For many LDCs trade \u2013 exports plus imports \u2013 represents a significant proportion of economic activity. In fact, their trade-to-GDP ratios are often higher than those of many developing countries, or even developed ones: 127 per cent for Cambodia in 2002, for example, and 152 per cent for Maldives. They also tend to have very open trade regimes, with low tariff or non-tariff barriers. According to the IMF\u2019s index of trade restrictiveness, of the 46 LDCs around the world for which data were available in 2004, only four had average tariff rates above 25 per cent. Moreover, for 29 countries their non-tariff barriers were either low or minor.3 However, these open trade regimes are not primarily the result of multilateral commitments negotiated during the Uruguay Round or with the WTO. More often, LDCs have taken unilateral steps to open up their economies as part of broader programmes of domestic reform. Of the 21-percentage-point cut in average weighted tariffs of all developing countries between 1983 and 2003, two-thirds was the result of autonomous liberalization.4 Why do LDCs not Benefit Sufficiently from Trade? Conventional wisdom suggests that increasing exports of any kind should be beneficial \u2013 pro- viding much-needed foreign exchange to invest in economic development and alleviate poverty. Unfortunately, although LDCs have often had dynamic export sectors since the late 1980s, they have not achieved commensurate economic growth, or a significant reduction in poverty. Why have the LDCs not been able to use trade to boost economic growth? Many of the constraints are the same as those that hold back economic development generally: low levels of skill and technology that lead to low produc- tivity; poor infrastructure; few linkages between productive sectors; and the lack of a financial sector that can provide capital at reasonable interest rates. Many also face serious geographic obsta- cles. Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar, for example, have some very inaccessible mountainous terrain. Since road construction is expensive, these countries can link many of their regions only by air transport or tortuous, winding roads, adding greatly to the cost of doing business. Economic development can also be slowed if populations are very scattered across the landscape \u2013 whether over mountain ranges, or widely separated islands, as in the Maldives, for example, or the Solomon Islands. This not only makes it more difficult to pro- vide social services but also slows economic integration. Geography hampers not just national economic development but also international trade. Many landlocked countries face high transport costs that eat into the revenue from exports, and also add to the costs of imports. These countries are also vulnerable to policy changes in the neighbouring countries through which their goods have to transit. But geography can impede trade even for countries with their own coastlines. The poorest countries tend to have only a few major ports, so exporters located far from those ports are at severe cost disadvantages. Indeed, if their export volumes do not justify regular ship calls, expor- ters might have to use ports in neighbouring countries.5 LDCs with small economies can thus find themselves with multiple cost disadvantages.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94b5340e-71c8-4041-af5c-7eeb9687ef42": {"__data__": {"id_": "94b5340e-71c8-4041-af5c-7eeb9687ef42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5ea63f33c884c50bf772a037ee8367509b368260e98adf6b11ace0e2c05574a"}, "2": {"node_id": "db3a6a55-da88-4198-8e5b-857bf49aab76", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c81a1684e3395ff097edc812e8c79f34fc7e182b4b81cfb744e611bbf09a868"}}, "hash": "ea2a68fddea8fb7ffba8e092ca4e0f3a51f4097e48354fc93f3b0b08015cc70b", "text": "One estimate suggests that telephone services, electricity services and personal travel in micro- states cost around twice as much as in the average country and are particularly damaging to trade \u2013 sea freight costs can be three times as high.6 Trade represents a significant proportion of economic activity LDCs with small economies can find themselves with multiple disadvantages ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 130 LDCs also suffer in international trade because they are minor players.

In the short term, this can deliver a sharp economic shock or in the longer term, push them into a \u2018poverty trap\u2019.7 They are also vulnerable if they have a limited range of exports. LDCs have to specialize in products in which they have a comparative advantage, and as a result, many still rely on agricultural goods: for Kiribati, for example, agricultural products account for nearly 89 per cent of exports, and for Vanuatu 54 per cent.8 Even countries that export manufactured goods tend to concentrate on one sector such as textiles and clothing \u2013 which in 2003 accounted for 40 per cent of exports from Nepal, 76 per cent of those from Bangladesh, and 95 per cent of those from Cambodia. Of the 4,162 products exported by the LDCs to 30 major trading partners in 2000, 127 accounted for 90 per cent of their total export trade.9 For all LDCs, the export concentration ratio \u2013 the share of the principal export product in the total export value \u2013 has remained high and largely unchanged since 1980.10 Trade integration has also had a limited impact on poverty because it encourages an \u2018enclave-type\u2019 growth pattern. Certain sectors do reasonably well, but leave the rest behind. Even the agricultural export sector tends to have few links with the subsistence agrarian activities on which most people depend for their livelihoods. In these circumstances, it may not be obvious why LDCs would want to gain access to the World Trade Organization and the further liberalization that this implies. For most, however, the alternative is worse \u2013 margina- lization or bilateral control by one or two major powers. The multilateral WTO is still a better option if it offers some consistent basic ground rules.11 Accession to the WTO can offer: \u2022 Binding commitments to stable policies \u2022 Predictability of market access \u2022 Shelter against unilateral pressures from powerful countries \u2022 Access to a powerful dispute settlement mechanism \u2022 Expectations of a role in shaping the future of world trade Experience with Trade Integration In the past, most LDCs have liberalized trade unilaterally. In future, however, they are more likely to do so on a reciprocal basis, multilateral, regional or bilateral. Their main multilateral option is the WTO which currently has 149 members. Of the 50 LDCs, 32 are now WTO members, and 8 others are in the process of accession. A few Asian LDCs, such as Bangla- desh, were founder members of the WTO when it was signed into existence in 1994, but others joined later. Of the Asia-Pacific LDCs, Bangla- desh, Cambodia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal and the Solomon Islands are now members, while Bhutan, Lao PDR, Samoa and Vanuatu are in the process of joining. Many LDCs find this accession process very difficult. They lack the trained people needed to understand the implications of trade agreements \u2013 either the commitments or the policy flexibi- lities. Even the few Asia Pacific LDCs that have missions in Geneva can devote only a few staff members to participate in WTO negotiations. As a result, even well-meaning officials may be un- able to exploit opportunities during negotiations and can sign agreements that compromise natio- nal interests and human development priorities. The same limitations are evident in civil society organizations. They too lack the Trade integration has had a limited impact on poverty because it encourages an \u2018enclave-type\u2019 growth pattern CHAPTER 6: TRADING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES 131 resources and capacity for specialized research, and few can conduct informed advocacy at the policy level. Consequently, they may have to base their campaign strategies on their perceptions of how trade agreements work, which may not necessarily accord with reality. The situation is even more difficult for the LDCs now trying to join. Because the rules for accession to the WTO are vague, incumbent members have been able to exploit them to impose onerous conditions on the acceding countries.

WTO-plus conditions are additional obligations that are either not a requirement of the WTO or have not been undertaken by its existing members. These conditions can have serious impli- cations, because the WTO rules, unlike those for GATT, influence national policies, including many that are critical for human development. Poor countries acceding to the WTO now find it more difficult to obtain special and differential treatment to allow them to delay some commit- ments. However, certain agreements within the WTO do provide more policy space. For example, the General Agreement on Trade in Services respects members\u2019 rights to pursue their human development objectives \u2013 allowing them to retain certain conditions related to market access and national treatment. Even at the time of accession, some countries have used this opportunity to negotiate reasonable terms (Box 6.1). Although these demands on newly acceding countries cover a wide range of issues, they can be considered in two groups \u2013 those related to policy space and those related to systemic issues. Policy Space These refer to restrictions on freedom of action. Generally, the founding and existing members have retained considerable freedom of mano- euvre while giving new arrivals much less scope. They use a number of instruments that compress the policy space of newly acceding members, including: \u2022 Tariffs. One of the most important issues is the flexibility to alter tariff rates. If, within BOX 6.1 NEPAL\u2019S CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO LIBERALIZING SERVICES At the time of accession to the WTO, Nepal liberalized 11 service sectors and 70 sub-sectors. This seems like a lot, but in fact, Nepal managed to negotiate liberalization for only a select group of services: First, those in which the Nepalese private sector may never get involved, given the huge investment cost and high gestation periods \u2013 such as pipeline transportation; second, those in which the Nepalese private sector is already competitive and able to outperform foreign service suppliers \u2013 such as banking services; third, sectors that have a high potential to employ local people \u2013 such as computers and related services. A few other measures of restriction negotiated by Nepal include: (a) capping foreign investment in most sectors at 51 per cent; while in some others at 66-67 per cent and only in two sectors at 80 per cent; (b) the requirement that a majority of the board members of basic telecom providers should be Nepalese nationals, and in the case of financial institutions, the composition of the board should be proportionate to the shareholding pattern; (c) foreign banks, with minimum \u2018B\u2019 rating by a credit rating agency, can only establish branches in Nepal for wholesale banking, not retail banking; (d) incentives and subsidies should be available only to enterprises wholly owned by Nepalese nationals; (e) not allowing foreigners to purchase or own land in Nepal; and (f) movement of natural persons to be limited to intra-corporate transferees at the executive, managerial or specialist levels, with a proviso that the number of such transferees shall not exceed 15 per cent of the number of local employees in the firm.

However, some acceding countries have been compelled to eliminate export duties or bind them at a certain level. \u2022 Services liberalization. In various service sectors acceding countries have been asked to make commitments far more extensive than those of incumbent members. BOX 6.2 SPECIAL AND DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT PROVISIONS IN THE WTO Developing countries have been granted some flexibility in applying the conditions of membership of the WTO through \u2018special and differential treatment\u2019 (SDT). This treatment applies to both binding and non-binding provisions. Binding Provisions Some of these can be implemented unilaterally, without having to wait for action by others. Under this heading, there are two kinds of SDT. (a) Permitting developing countries to assume lesser obligations. In the Agreement on Agriculture, for example, the de minimus levels of domestic support to agriculture are 5 per cent, but for developing countries they are 10 per cent. Similarly, the developed countries have to commit to 36 per cent tariff reductions but developing countries to 24 per cent; for the reduction in subsidies, the corresponding proportions are 20 per cent and 13 per cent. (b) Providing transitional time periods, which are higher for the developing countries. In TRIPS, for example, developed countries have only a one- year transition period to implement the commitment, while developing countries were given five years and LDC were given even more generous treatment. Other binding provisions require action from others, particularly developed countries. For example, Article 66.2 of TRIPS required developed-country members to provide incentives to enterprises and institutions in their territories for the purpose of promoting and encouraging technology transfer to LDCs. Non-binding Provisions These are also known as best-endeavour clauses. For these the SDT concessions are of three types: (a) Requiring WTO members to safeguard the interest of developing countries \u2013 as with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS), which requires members to take into account the special needs of the developing countries and LDC members. (b) Requiring developed countries to provide technical assistance to the developing countries and the LDCs. For example, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) requires members to provide technical assistance to developing countries and the LDCs, on mutually agreed terms and conditions, for the establishment of national standardizing bodies. (c) Requiring developed countries to enhance trade opportunities of the developing countries and LDCs. For example, the need to provide market access: Article XXXVII.1 of the GATT requires the developed members to accord high priority to the reduction and elimination of barriers on products currently or potentially of particular export interest to developing member countries. CHAPTER 6: TRADING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES 133 \u2022 Intellectual property protection. For the protection of new plant varieties, the deve- loping countries often prefer to use their own systems that better suit their social, eco- nomic and environmental needs. The deve- loped countries, however, argue that the only effective sui generis system is that of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) and are trying to impose this model on each acced- ing country.16 China and Cambodia, for example, have been cajoled into signing on to UPOV as a part of their accession deal \u2013 though Nepal was able to fend off these pressures due to the collective efforts of the government and civil society organizations. Although the data protection measures are not mandated by TRIPS, new count- ries are also being required to enforce these, Cambodia being an example (Box 6.3). \u2022 Plurilateral agreements. These are commit- ments that were agreed to by only a limited number of members, at the founding of the WTO.

Tens of thousands have already died, and within the next five to ten years 200,000 people, including children, could develop HIV/AIDS (Ouyahia-McAdams 2002). Combating HIV/AIDS requires, among other things, providing anti- retroviral (ARV) drug therapy. Cambodia was already finding this hard: until recently, humanitarian agencies and NGOs were providing drugs to only 700 patients (Macan-Marker 2003). But accession to the WTO makes things even more difficult. During the negotiations Cambodia was forced, as a \u2018WTO- plus\u2019 requirement, to agree to protect undisclosed test or other data for pharmaceutical products for five years. This will be devastating for Cambodia\u2019s efforts to tackle HIV/AIDS, for during the period of the patent, Cambodia will not even be able to use test data to assess bio-equivalent generics to be prepared for when the patent expires. Instead, the generic producing or importing company would have to repeat the trials \u2013 a costly and slow process \u2013 or wait for five years (Charveriat and Kirkbride 2003). ARV medicines will thus become even more scarce and expensive \u2013 and exacerbate an already serious public health crisis. Source: Adhikari 2004a. ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 134 Implementation Problems A number of LDCs have had problems imple- menting their WTO agreements. This is partly because, for the accession countries in particular, these agreements are often onerous and unre- asonable. But LDCs can also have a limited capacity to fulfil even the normal conditions. Some agreements are easy and cheap to imple- ment: tariffs, for example, can be reduced by the stroke of a minister\u2019s or a legislator\u2019s pen. But others require a huge investment \u2013 in the pur- chase and installation of equipment and proce- dures and the training of staff \u2013 as with customs valuation, and intellectual property rights and standards.19 In addition, LDCs may not have the administrative capacity or the funds to create the requisite institutions. Human Development Implications of Trade Integration Assessing the impact of trade integration on human development for LDCs is a challenging task. It is difficult enough to determine whether integration even increases trade, let alone what are its precise effects on different segments of society.20 At the most general level, however, it is clear that trade integration does create winners and losers. The winners are usually those who can best organize themselves in the private sector, or occasionally in trade unions \u2013 who can press for their interests during trade discussions, and if they think they will be disadvantaged, bargain for compensation payments. The losers are less organized, and usually more numerous \u2013 small farming households, for example, or work- ers in import-competing industries who will lose the protection of high tariffs \u2013 not to mention taxpayers who have to fill the gaps left in gover- nment budgets by cuts in customs revenues. Institutions and Governance Governments need to support those who suffer from trade liberalization. One priority should be to build social safety nets \u2013 offering unemploy- ment allowances and facilities for retraining, while helping businesses make any necessary social adjustments.

Mongolia too, after accession to the WTO, and with the help of a loan from the Asian Development Bank, strengthened its social security programme so that, among other things, it could help the unemployed and underemp- loyed to find jobs. Public Health Trade liberalization can affect public health in a number of ways. One is by accepting intellectual property regimes that influence the availability and pricing of drugs. Previously, developing countries that did not operate patents systems could produce generic drugs similar to, but far cheaper than, the original branded versions. India, for example, built up a sophisticated and efficient pharmaceutical industry to produce generic drugs for both local consumption and export. Neighbouring Pakistan, on the other hand, which also had a sizable pharmaceutical industry, but which did respect patents, had prices from 3 to 14 times higher.22 Governments need to support those who suffer from trade liberalization CHAPTER 6: TRADING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES 135 All this changed from 1994 with the WTO\u2019s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellec- tual Property Rights (TRIPS). All WTO mem- bers now have to comply with strict intellectual property provisions covering such issues as copy- right and patents. This has serious implications. First, there are the economic costs: TRIPS is expensive to implement \u2013 revising laws, training officers, and testing and enforcing patents, and the economic benefits are unclear.23 But there can also be catastrophic social costs. By restrict- ing the opportunities to produce affordable, generic versions of drugs, TRIPS is set to create a public health crisis in Asia and the Pacific. One of the most severe impacts will be on HIV/AIDS. More than 7 million people in the region suffer from HIV/AIDS, and almost half a million die from the disease each year.24 Cambodia, for example, which has recently acceded to the WTO, will now find it even more difficult to provide anti-retroviral therapy (Box 6.3). The full effects have yet to be felt because many of the TRIPS provisions included a ten- year exemption period that only expired on 31 December 2004. The LDCs also have the advan- tage of a longer stay of execution. In November 2001, the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health granted LDCs an extension of the transition period for pharmaceutical products until 2016. And in June 2002, the TRIPS Council exempted all LDC members from applying certain parts of the TRIPS agreement in relation to pharmaceuticals until 2016. The General Council has also made it somewhat easier for LDCs to import generics. Previously, companies producing under compul- sory licences had to manufacture predominantly for their domestic markets. In August 2003, however, these companies were given a waiver from this requirement for exports to countries that had an insufficient manufacturing capacity \u2013 though there are some procedural constraints on this provision. Finally, in November 2005, the Least Deve- loped Country members as a group were granted an extension of the transitional period for TRIPS as a whole for 7.5 years \u2013 that is, until July 2013, or until such a date on which they cease to be a LDC. But the decision freezes the status quo since it stipulates any changes in laws, regula- tions and practice made during the additional transitional period should not result in a lesser degree of consistency with the provisions of the TRIPS agreement. Environmental Protection Developed countries have argued that lax environmental standards offer some developing countries an unfair competitive advantage \u2013 in particular, that many of their enterprises can produce goods much more cheaply, largely because they do not have to worry about, or pay for, the pollution they cause. This, they say, will inevitably lead to a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 in what have been called \u2018pollution havens\u2019. Empirical evidence does not support this hypothesis. One survey of five polluting indus- tries in 119 countries found that, except for iron and steel products, there was no clear evidence that national governments were deliberately setting low environmental standards, and it concluded that the case for including such standards in the WTO framework was weak. The same applies to environmental standards in regional trade agreements like NAFTA and the US-Singapore bilateral agreement.25 The developing countries, for their part, agree that it is important to improve environ- mental protection, but this should not be a part of trade negotiations since it offers the developed countries even more opportunities to raise arbitrary and discretionary trade barriers.

But most such endeavours, although genuine, have failed to achieve their objectives. Special and Differential Treatment One approach has been to allow developing countries some leeway under the umbrella of \u2018special and differential treatment\u2019 (SDT). Developing countries, as a group, have insisted on SDT, saying that applying the same rules to unequal trading countries could be disastrous. Instead, they would prefer modulated commit- ments \u2013 based on their trade, development and financial needs: well-designed, effective, enforce- able and timebound SDT that can help develop- ing countries and LDCs integrate into the multi- lateral trading system.26 Just as important, SDT offers ways of modifying the trade regime to take better account of human development objectives.27 Within Asia, many of the middle- to higher- income countries have limited imports from LDCs in the region because their import needs are different from what these LDCs can supply (Box 6.4). In response, the various WTO agreements contain 124 separate articles or paragraphs containing around 160 provisions for SDT.28 They can be broadly divided into \u2018binding\u2019 and \u2018non-binding\u2019, that is, enforceable and non- enforceable (Box 6.2). These are presently being reviewed by the WTO\u2019s Committee on Trade and Development \u2013 with a view to strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and operational, though so far there have been few signs of progress.29 Some analysts oppose SDT on principle, arguing that developing countries should not demand such treatment because it further marginalizes them.30 But others take the view that SDT is necessary if the poorest countries are to integrate successfully, but emphasize that it is by no means sufficient.31 protection. The Doha Declaration, for example, mandates a liberalization of trade in envi- ronmental goods and environmentally sound technologies. Initiatives to Address LDC Vulnerability The developed countries recognize that when integrating into international trade the LDCs are likely to be vulnerable and have, therefore, made BOX 6.4 TRADE BETWEEN ASIA-PACIFIC LDCS AND CHINA China\u2019s trade with Asia-Pacific countries has grown rapidly and now accounts for 53 per cent of its global trade. But much of this trade, almost 78 per cent, is with high-income countries of the region, such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong (China) and Taiwan (China). Within middle-income countries, the major trading partners are Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. Imports by China from Asia-Pacific LDCs are extremely limited \u2013 about $300 million. All LDCs have trade deficits with respect to China. A striking example is Bangladesh, which exports goods valued at only $57 million and imports goods worth $1,906 million from China. Given China\u2019s import requirements, primarily of high-tech equipment, machinery and parts, fuel and raw materials, it is not surprising that most of the trade is with high-income countries. LDCs have limited scope for benefiting from the booming Chinese market \u2013 which is growing at over 15 per cent per annum. On the other hand, LDCs imports from China are large and account for over 20 per cent of all their imports, which implies big and growing trade imbalances with respect to China and the possibility that Chinese imports are displacing some domestic industries. Clearly, there is a strong case for China, along with other middle- and high-income countries of Asia-Pacific, to provide special and differential treatment to LDCs through a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) involving concessional tariffs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eabe6b50-fc43-4f41-8452-55bf0e90a23c": {"__data__": {"id_": "eabe6b50-fc43-4f41-8452-55bf0e90a23c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2546669bb1a083b77064fcfc6946a8f23e364949caffa29cb07064f2cae6c19c"}, "2": {"node_id": "fdf87338-c7f8-4491-8254-828dae1ba81b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e68114128292a955e91a280ced570008a424123b3db380c69e2d0d3dfb308cd2"}}, "hash": "14c7b3ec70de32638216a494a887e7c2574b3944bd674a6a234b333dccd68845", "text": "Trade balance of Asia-Pacific countries with China, 2004 ($ millions) Exports Imports Trade to China from China Balance LDCs of which: 314 3,560 \u20133,246 Bangladesh 57 1,906 \u20131,849 Cambodia 30 452 \u2013422 Lao PDR 12 101 \u201389 Myanmar 207 938 \u2013731 Nepal 8 163 \u2013155 Low-income countries 11,460 12,945 \u20131,485 Middle-income countries 46,017 25,140 20,877 High-income countries 247,109 228,419 18,690 Total Asia-Pacific 304,900 270,064 34,836 Source: ITC Trade map.

Then in the 1970s several advanced economies introduced the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), volun- tarily offering unilateral preferential tariff rates to imports from developing countries. From 1979, this was instituted as a permanent feature of the multilateral trading system. Subsequently, in the 1980s many other developed countries introduced bilateral schemes. In 1979 the EU provided a second preferen- tial market access scheme under the Lom\u00e9 Convention \u2013 now the Contonou Agreement \u2013 offering their former colonies, including the Pacific countries, far deeper preferences than those in the GSP schemes. Then in 2001 the EU presented a new agreement with special terms for LDCs \u2013 the \u2018Everything But Arms\u2019 (EBA) initiative \u2013 which provides duty- and quota-free access to the EU market for all products other than arms and munitions, although three pro- ducts were to be phased in later: bananas in 2006, and rice and sugar in 2009. Similarly, 27 other countries have either offered some form of preferential market access to the LDCs or are in the process of doing so.32 These include: Canada. In January 2003, Canada introduced a new GSP scheme. This is very liberal, though it excludes dairy products, eggs and poultry. It also has an innovative approach for rules of origin, using a cumulative system that allows access to products that include inputs from any of the beneficiary countries. Japan. Japan has extended its GSP scheme until 2014, and in 2003 further improved it by allowing LDCs duty-free entry not only for industrial goods but also for a few agricultural products, such as prawn and frozen fish fillets. United States. In addition to the concessions it offers through its regular GSP scheme, the US provides deeper preferences to selected African countries through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and to Caribbean countries through the Caribbean Basin Initiative. However, the US GSP scheme offers less favourable treatment to countries in Asia and the Pacific. Nevertheless, the take-up of these prefere- nces has been disappointing. The developed countries still take a very small proportion of their imports from LDCs: 0.6 per cent for the EU; 0.2 per cent for Canada; 0.4 per cent for Japan; and 0.8 per cent for the US.33 These figures have remained unchanged since 1992; indeed, for Japan the figure has declined. There have been a number of explanations for this. One is that exporting countries do not want to invest in building new markets in these countries, since the preferences are unilateral and optional and could be eliminated at any time. They also point out that the schemes exclude certain \u2018sensitive\u2019 sectors and often apply excessively stringent rules of origin, making it difficult for industrial products that incorporate materials from several other countries. Moreover, many enterprises do not really understand these rules or are generally unaware of the preferences available.34 Another problem is that the developed countries are increasingly protecting their markets using non-tariff barriers. The EU and the US, for example, have been using the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures to keep out some exports of agriculture, livestock, horticulture and floriculture. These measures are often inappropriate for the circumstances of producers The take-up of preferences has been disappointing ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 138 and represent disproportionately onerous burdens for small exporters.35 \u2018Preference sceptics\u2019 say that these schemes are inherently discriminatory: although they benefit some developing countries, they do so at the expense of others.36 But \u2018GSP reformers\u2019 take a more positive line arguing that these schemes have played a positive role.37 Others go further, claiming that GSPs have approximately doubled trade between developing and developed coun- tries38 and that they contributed to the \u2018Asian success story\u2019, allowing a number of countries to penetrate markets and sustain themselves there to build the necessary competitiveness.39 A new school of thought is emerging on this issue. It suggests that developed countries should not offer preferences but instead liberalize across the board on a \u2018most favoured nation\u2019 basis \u2013 while also offering LDCs support for their adjustment programmes, and for strengthening their supply capacity and competitiveness through \u2018aid for trade\u2019.

The second type of assistance focuses more narrowly on improving the capacity of public officials to deal with trade issues and to operate more effectively at the WTO and other trade negotiations. It also conducts studies on related issues. Thus far, most multilateral and bilateral donors and institutions, including the WTO, have focused more on this second type of assistance. To try to ensure a more comprehensive and effective approach, in 1997 six multilateral institutions \u2013 the IMF, UNDP, the World Bank, the International Trade Centre, UNCTAD and the WTO \u2013 launched the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries, also known as the \u2018Integrated Framework\u2019 (IF). The IF has two objectives: first, to integrate trade into the LDCs\u2019 BOX 6.5 AID-FOR-TRADE: THE WAY FORWARD If the least developed and low-income countries are to take full advantage of a more liberalized global economy, they will need more support from the richer countries through \u2018aid for trade\u2019.

Aid for trade, in the form of grants or concessional loans, should also help countries cope with fiscal losses and deteriorating terms of trade; other short-, medium- and long-term preference erosion; and the costs of implementing trade agreements. Some developing countries have reservations about this initiative. They fear that aid for trade may serve as the basis of a new form of conditionality based on a country\u2019s trade negotiating position in the Doha Round. They also wonder whether this is new and additional aid money. If not, they would like to know if trade is considered more important than health or education. They also wonder whether it will be multilateral or bilateral, and whether it will come in the form of budget support or project support. Nevertheless, there does seem to be political backing for the concept. The British Government, for example, championed it in its Commission for Africa Report, and both the Millennium Project Report and the UN Secretary- General\u2019s Report for the 2005 World Summit identified scaled up aid for trade as a priority. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have also endorsed a proposal for \u201can enhanced Integrated Framework . . . including expanding its resources and scope and making it more effective.\u201d The 2005 Ministerial Meeting of the WTO produced a strong consensus for an enhanced Integrated Framework. A new Aid for Trade Task Force will provide recommendations to the WTO General Council by July 2006. The EU also announced that it would raise aid-for-trade spending, excluding infrastructure, to approximately \u00a42 billion a year by 2010. Japan has committed $10 billion, and the US announced that it would double its aid for trade to $2.7 billion annually by 2010. However, even an ambitious aid for trade package cannot and should not be viewed as a substitute for the development dimensions of the Doha Round. Rather, it should be thought of as complementary.

Since then, however, there has been little effort to convert this political commitment into practical action. In 2004, following the failure of the Cancun Ministerial Conference of the WTO, a group of influential developing and developed countries, with limited participation of LDCs, hammered out the \u2018July Framework\u2019. But even this failed to address most of the concerns relating to LDC integration into the multilateral trading system. The language is weak on a number of issues. For example, rather than obliging the developed countries to give SDT to the poorer developing countries, it only says that \u2018disciplines on export support will be developed with consideration of the impacts on least-developed and net food-importing developing countries\u2019. The language is similarly non-committal when it comes to ways of achieving fuller integration of small, vulnerable economies into the multilateral trading system. The Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting in December 2005 made more progress. Members agreed that developed-country members shall, and developing-country members declaring themselves in a position to do so should, provide duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis, for all products originating from all LDCs by 2008, or no later than the start of the implementation period of the Doha Round in a manner that ensures stability, security and predictability. However, members who find this difficult would be allowed to permit duty-free and quota-free market access for only 97 per cent of products originating from LDCs. And developing-country members would be allowed to phase in their commitments and enjoy appropriate flexibility in coverage. Following the Hong Kong Ministerial, the LDCs were also allowed to maintain, on a temporary basis, existing measures that deviate from their obligations under the TRIMs agreement.42 They would also be able to take new measures, if they obtained approval from the WTO\u2019s Council, for Trade in Goods. These can last for five years and are renewable, but have to be phased out by 2020. Finally, it was reaffirmed that LDC members will only be required to undertake commitments and concessions to an extent consistent with their individual development, financial or trade needs, or their administrative and institutional capacities.

Of special interest are opportunities in markets for nature- based \u2018green\u2019 products such as organic fruits or vegetables; and woollen floor coverings or shawls that use only natural fibres and vegetable dyes. These mainly cater to the tastes of an ever-growing segment of \u2018green consumers\u2019 in the developed countries. Niche products could also cash in on the unique cultural heritage of these countries.

For this purpose, the various committees in the WTO should be required to submit regular reports. \u2022 Offering aid for trade. The potential losses of trade integration for LDCs suggest a new role for aid \u2013 compensating for losses and offering help for restructuring. Aid should also be provided to develop the capacity of country negotiators and build stronger institutions. In addition, it should address supply-side constraints that inhibit export responsiveness. \u2022 Focusing on human development. Trade is not an end in itself; it is a means to an end. All trade initiatives and negotiations should, therefore, be based on a human development perspective. The focus should be not merely on market access, but on achieving improved human development outcomes \u2013 through trade rules that allow for diversity in national institutions and standards. CHAPTER 7: TRADE FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: AN EIGHT-POINT AGENDA 145 The rest of the world sees the Asia-Pacific region as a key player when it comes to globalization. But these other countries, and particularly the richest, have a fairly single-minded view: that in a more liberalized trading environment the other global regions face a threat from Asia and the Pacific, which is emerging as the factory of the world and is capable of under-cutting the deve- loped countries in the production of everything from clothing to footwear to electronic goods. The picture looks different within the region. In one sense it mirrors the global one, though in this case it is the poorest countries of the region who look towards China with some trepidation \u2013 perceiving their giant neighbour as a strong competitor capable not just of capturing some of their export markets for textiles and garments, for example, but also of displacing even some of their humbler domestic industries. Nor do they see many offsetting opportunities for exporting to China \u2013 which mainly requires raw materials, machinery and high-tech equipment. Within the region the trade flows also look much more complex, and in many respects even more crucial, because the new patterns of trade are not just directing flows of goods and money, they are also reshaping national development. Workers across the Asia-Pacific region, from Nepal to Nauru, are rapidly learning that the The Asia Pacific region has often performed spectacularly well on trade and made good progress in human development. But more recent trends are disturbing, with serious implications for the Least Developed Countries and even for the poorest people in the larger and more dynamic economies, where trade is accompanied by inadequate job creation and rising inequality.

Chapter Trade for Human Development: An Eight-Point Agenda 7 acronym WTO means something, for better or for worse, in their everyday lives. For the poorest people in the poorest countries, these are matters not just of strategy but of survival. A call-centre worker in the United Kingdom or the United States, say, whose job migrates to Delhi or Manila can be rapidly redeployed elsewhere or can use the cushion of the social security system to search for a suitable alternative job. But a Bangladeshi woman mak- ing shirts on piece rates for a garment manu- facturer may have little or nothing to fall back on when told she is suddenly surplus to require- ments. That is why this Report has embedded human development concerns within the heart of international trade. First, pointing out the multiple ways in which trade shapes people\u2019s lives \u2013 affecting how they live, what they do and what they can be. Second, showing how human development and international trade have multiple links; in some senses a two-way street, in others a multi-lane intersection. Some people wish to avoid this complexity by shying away from the subject altogether. At one extreme, there are those who would prefer to erect higher trade barriers and aim for national self-reliance; why depend on imports when you can make something similar yourself? At the other extreme are the proponents of free Workers across the Asia-Pacific region are rapidly learning that the acronym WTO means something, for better or for worse, in their everyday lives ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 146 trade who would opt for no barriers at all; why try to manipulate trade flows when a free flow of goods or people would allow global produc- tion to reach its natural levels \u2013 letting the market dictate the most economically suitable location? Neither extreme makes much sense. Total national self-reliance \u2013 autarchy \u2013 has an emo- tional appeal but soon runs into practical difficulties. Does this mean that every small country should have its own pharmaceutical industry or try to survive without vaccines for measles, or treatment for HIV/AIDS? People in the twenty-first century have social and econo- mic rights that can only be met through inter- national trade. More seductive and plausible is the free- trade option. But this too is fallacious \u2013 for it involves trade between unequal partners. Perhaps it appeals because it has appropriated the trigger-word \u2018free\u2019. Look more closely, however, and it is clear that this is freedom for goods and for money, not freedom for people. No small farmer in Indonesia who has been told that she will get 30 per cent less for the crop this year because free trade has let in unlimited quantities of subsidized rice from the US will feel any sense of liberation. Maybe \u2018unleashed trade\u2019 would be a more realistic description of a tariff- free world \u2013 indicating that for safety\u2019s sake at certain times the leash should be carefully in place. That is why this Report has argued for policies more grounded in reality. It recognizes the value of the private sector as the main engine for economic growth but says that some of this energy needs to be harnessed or guided if it is to serve human development. This should come as no surprise in a region which in the latter part of the twenteeth century set the template for modern trade-led economic growth. Anyone tracing the footsteps of the \u2018Asian Tigers\u2019 will recognize that they took a very strategic position \u2013 choosing which infant industries to nurse and when to liberalize \u2013 before taking the world by storm with their flow of goods. And no need to select only Asian examples: look further back to the nineteenth century at the \u2018mercantilist\u2019 policies of the now-developed countries for a record of restrictions on trade, including on textile imports from Asia, which gave these countries the breathing space before their infant industries were mature enough to sell their goods across the world. Trade has never been a matter for private industry alone. It has always been subject to active intervention from the State. This central role for the state may not seem an encouraging prospect. Can it be trusted? Trade regulation, after all, offers both politicians and public officials considerable authority and discretion. At the very least, this risks overloading people who have limited capacity or time to deal with complex commercial matters that are typically laden with impenetrable acronyms and jargon. At worst, it opens wider the doors to venality and corruption.

Civil society groups and the media at both international and national levels are now shedding greater light on trade negotiations that only a few years ago would have taken place behind closed doors. They rightly demand far greater transparency, consistency and fairness. There is still secrecy, and many of the doors remain closed, but at least nowadays trade officials who emerge blinking into the dawn from all-night negotiations know that they will frequently have to cope with the glare of tele- vision cameras. Many people are now asking hard questions about the direction and momentum of interna- tional trade. If the developed countries are so keen on free trade why, for example, do the EU and the US persist with huge market-distorting subsidies on agriculture? Why are they enthu- siastic about free flows of capital into poor countries but suddenly switch gears when Trade has always been subject to active intervention from the state CHAPTER 7: TRADE FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: AN EIGHT-POINT AGENDA 147 discussing the opportunities for the flows of labour into their own? And why are they now becoming more reluctant to allow Asian coun- tries to demonstrate the remarkable potential of the Internet to allow people all over the world to work together by outsourcing software produc- tion or call centres or back-office adminis- tration? Meanwhile the new global trade regime is limiting the freedom of developing countries to manage their own economies. A decade or so ago, under the previous regime, the GATT, countries were more free to choose tariff levels and import quotas and apply foreign exchange controls. Now IMF conditions and the rules of the WTO have narrowed the options \u2013 especially for the newcomers to the WTO club, the LDCs, who remarkably have to sign up to an even more intrusive list of rules than the existing members. This makes life much more difficult for the many countries that are now simultaneously trying to pursue export-led growth. Indeed, it raises the question of whether we may now be reaching the limits of a model that has served many Asian countries so well. How should the countries of Asia and the Pacific respond in this demanding new environ- ment? Clearly, there can be no standard blue- print \u2013 especially for such a huge and diverse region. Each country has its own priorities and will pursue its own agenda; in international negotiations countries may, therefore, have not just different priorities but even opposing interests. The food-exporting countries, for example, will see things differently from the food importers; Indonesia will take a different position from that of Thailand or Viet Nam. The more highly developed countries will feel more at ease with global competition than the poorer ones. Nevertheless, there is a way of encom- passing this diversity \u2013 by viewing trade issues through a human development lens. This helps focus attention on the issues that matter for the poorest people, and especially those in the Least Developed Countries. In earlier chapters, this Report has followed this philosophy as it has identified some of the detailed issues in agriculture, manufacturing and services. Some of these will appear common sense, and many will already be part of the human development consensus. Others may be less obvious, and apparently more technical, but could still make a huge difference to the lives of poor people. Rather than be driven by commercial lobbies, the centrality of human development should inform national priorities.1 Eight that have some of the most general application are as follows. 1. Invest for Competitiveness In a globalizing world, public investment needs to take into account both national and international considerations. Generally the type of investment will remain much the same, but it may need adjusting with an eye to boosting international competitiveness. Thus, when looking at basic infrastructure, governments will need to ensure that they have the roads, rail- ways, ports and telecommunications systems that align with national needs and also with the requirement of getting goods and services quickly and cheaply to international markets. The physical infrastructure is just as impor- tant as human capital. The most successful trading countries have invested heavily in human development \u2013 generating a healthy and well- educated workforce that has the stamina, the skill and the flexibility to cope with a changing trading environment. China, for example, long before it started opening up to the world at the end of the 1970s, already had good basic human development indicators.

Few smaller countries will be able to match this, but at the least, all should be aiming at least at a balance of skills. People with good primary or secondary education can only make use of their potential for international trade if they have the support of others with higher levels of education, in engineering, for example, telecommunications, or accountancy. Men and women alike should have equal opportunities to realize their full potential. At the same time, many countries will need to invest more in R&D that specifically addresses the needs of poor people. The Republic of Korea, for example, has reaped the benefits of a huge investment in technological infrastruc- ture and by 2004 had the world\u2019s highest university enrolment rates. At the broadest level, R&D can include \u2018foresight studies\u2019, as have taken place in Thailand, for example, to anti- cipate future demands and link science and technology to economic and social needs. But competitive countries also need to continually explore the most appropriate current tech- nologies that will capitalize on national strengths. Some of this can be carried out through public-private partnerships, perhaps combining venture-capital funds and govern- ment equity, though most of the R&D into opportunities specifically for the poor is likely to take place in the public sector. 2. Adopt Strategic Trade Policies In a world of giant global players and fierce competition, no developing country now has the luxury of entering global markets and hoping for the best. Instead, just as the OECD states and those of the Asian tigers did before them, states have to identify a few sectors and industries that have long-term potential in international mar- kets and guide enterprises towards them. Asia\u2019s miracle economies \u2013 as well as those of China or India, which are now being lauded as success stories \u2013 only liberalized after they had estab- lished the basis for diversified export industries. The chosen industries will vary from country to country. But they could include, for example, those such as basic engineering goods that have the greatest potential linkages with other industries and will train more people in essential skills and thus have important spillover benefits for the rest of the economy. Picking \u2018winners\u2019 is not, of course, a simple task and will demand much stronger capacity within a government. And it will be important not to foster collusion between public officials and company bosses \u2013 reproducing more of the \u2018crony capitalism\u2019 whose shallow foundations collapsed during the Asian financial crisis. Instead, the aim should be to achieve a trans- parent policy compact between government and the private sector, by using a carrot-and-stick approach. The carrot will include the opportunity to operate behind tariff walls until companies are strong enough to compete internationally. China, for example, until it started to open up to the outside world had an average tariff rate of around 40 per cent. Tariffs should be low on essential imports such as raw materials and high- tech capital goods, higher on goods that compete with the selected strategic industries. The stick is that such industries will be closely scrutinized to see that they are living up to their side of the bargain and developing steadily more competitive products and services for export. They will also be subject to a domestic competition policy designed to prevent them abusing a monopoly position. The essential requirement for engagement in international trade, however, is that the process should be strategically planned and carefully sequenced. Thus, higher tariffs should be rigidly time-bound. In order to avoid creating cosy monopolies that never mature into vigorous export enterprises, tariffs should automatically be scaled down after a predetermined period. The essential requirement for engagement in international trade is that the process should be strategically planned and carefully sequenced CHAPTER 7: TRADE FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: AN EIGHT-POINT AGENDA 149 3. Restore a Focus on Agriculture Many countries with ambitions to boost their presence in international markets have concen- trated most of their energies on industry in urban areas \u2013 leaving the rural areas to cope as best they can. A trade strategy based on human deve- lopment, however, must have agriculture at its core. This is not because agriculture offers export opportunities, but because in many coun- tries farming is still the primary source of income for the poor; so no trade strategy that under- mines rural livelihoods can claim to be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4f26d87-ada3-49b7-ba01-d918822a5342": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4f26d87-ada3-49b7-ba01-d918822a5342", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76dbbdd611ad92823c6f68a7c5b00d036d25f68d7fbcb110ee0e7a6ebd6ccc77"}}, "hash": "76dbbdd611ad92823c6f68a7c5b00d036d25f68d7fbcb110ee0e7a6ebd6ccc77", "text": "promoting human development. For food-importing countries in particular, it will often make sense to maintain tariffs on food imports so as to protect poor producers. In WTO negotiations, therefore, developing countries should insist on the right to protect \u2018special products\u2019, including safeguard mecha- nisms that will be triggered when food imports reach certain prices or volumes. This also has the strategic advantage of preserving national food security in a world that in just a few years down the line could be moving towards food shortages \u2013 precisely because larger developing countries like China have let agriculture stagnate and have become net importers. Tariff protection, or if necessary price support, should, however, be designed specifi- cally to protect farmers rather than simply offer higher profits for traders or for the food industry. And if this results in higher prices that cause hardship for the poorest consumers, govern- ments will need to prepare appropriate social safety nets. As well as protection, farmers also need progress. In many countries investment in rural development has been on a steep downward curve. This has to be reversed, particularly through investment: for example, in irrigation, in village electrification and in farm-to-market roads. 4. Combat Jobless Growth Most countries that embark on industrialization typically do so with labour-intensive production in industries like garments, textiles and footwear that take advantage of ample supplies of low- cost labour. But as industrialization proceeds, competitive pressures, greater ambitions and changing market conditions start to push them higher up the value chain. In addition, enterprises often prefer to mechanize if they find machines easier to cope with than people. As a result, the most successful trading countries, primarily in East Asia, are now creating jobs far more slowly \u2013 the phenomenon of \u2018jobless growth\u2019. To some extent, this process is understand- able. Less comprehensible, however, is why governments should exacerbate this trend by maintaining low real interest rates \u2013 effectively giving capital preference over labour. That may seem like the best strategy for rapid growth, but it is storing up problems for the future. By all means allow enterprises to choose the lowest- cost option for production, but this choice should not be biased away from labour: interest rates should, therefore, reflect the real price of capital, not the rate that industrialists would prefer. In a similar vein, states should phase out fiscal incentives to enterprises; these may attract investment, but not necessarily in businesses that maximise human development potential because such tax breaks artificially raise the return on capital and again encourage capital-intensive investments. Another reason why enterprises may be reluctant to take on new workers is that labour contracts can be too rigid. In rapidly changing markets, companies that find it difficult to predict future demands may prefer to invest in machinery rather than commit themselves to a larger permanent workforce. This creates a persistent duality \u2013 a small and protected group ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 150 of \u2018insiders\u2019 with secure employment influenced by national regulations, and a large casual, and often exploited, workforce working on piece rates. Instead, more workers should steadily be absorbed into formal employment but on contracts sufficiently flexible that they can readily be deployed to other sectors or compa- nies as trading conditions change. Governments can assist in this process by providing some support to workers through health insurance and social security and by active labour market policies to encourage retraining and redeployment. 5. Prepare a New Tax Regime Liberalization is a common prescription for eco- nomic success, but it has a debilitating side effect \u2013 it means foregoing a predictable and easy-to- collect source of government revenue. Many of the poorest countries have relied on customs duties for a high proportion of public income, in some cases up to 70 per cent. If they suddenly drop tariff rates, they will lose vital revenue. It might be argued that economic growth itself would take care of this problem, as corpo- rate and income taxes would automatically rise to fill the fiscal gap. But this is unlikely, and certainly not in the short term, when both local and foreign enterprises may have been given generous tax breaks as an incentive to invest. Instead, governments need to have an alternative tax regime in place before embarking on libera- lization. Care will need to be taken, however, to ensure that these new taxes are progressive and do not hurt the poor. Customs duties, for example, are often quite progressive since they are typically highest on the luxury items that are of greater interest to the rich. Corporate taxes too can be levied progressively, though many", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c70b4b61-ee4c-4b8f-8787-47f0b9703aa1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c70b4b61-ee4c-4b8f-8787-47f0b9703aa1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e2afece24705cb91838ef2571f546f7e46eb6527bba59b26dee844fed78a37a"}}, "hash": "1e2afece24705cb91838ef2571f546f7e46eb6527bba59b26dee844fed78a37a", "text": "people escape the net since the lawyers of the largest corporations are skilled at techniques of tax planning, while most enterprises in the informal sector simply evade tax collectors altogether. Much the same is true for income tax, which tends to be paid more by middle-income workers in government or the formal sector. Garnering more income from corporate or income tax will mean overhauling the tax codes to close loopholes and considering other options such as \u2018withholding taxes\u2019 at points where informal entrepreneurs have no choice but to provide documentation, as when commercially importing inputs. Governments can also consider taxes on real estate or on capital gains. They can also adopt the value added tax (VAT), for example, which can generate quite high and predictable revenues but assumes a well-documented economy and needs to be developed with care; in any case, it should exempt food and other necessities of the poor. The key point is that these new sources of revenue should be up and running prior to liberalization, or falling revenues could lead to severe cuts in public services that will harm human development. 6. Maintain Stable Exchange Rates One thing that hampers international trade and discourages investment is a volatile exchange rate that makes it difficult for states or enterprises to plan ahead. It is important that the rate is realistic: too high, and it will jeopardize employment by penalizing exporters as well as farmers and other local producers who will face more competition from imports; too low, and there is a risk of a rise in the domestic price level, with adverse impact on the cost of living of the poor. Exchange rates are likely to fluctuate, especially in small and open economies that are powerless against the rise or fall in international commodity prices. With floating exchange rates, these economies are also susceptible to the \u2018Dutch disease\u2019, in which inflows of capital Governments need to have an alternative tax regime in place before embarking on liberalization CHAPTER 7: TRADE FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: AN EIGHT-POINT AGENDA 151 without sufficient investment opportunities to absorb them can push the exchange rate to unrealistic levels. This can happen as a result of rising commodity prices, as with the oil price for Timor-Leste. But it can also be a consequence inflows of aid, for example, or as a result of the arrival of funds for disaster relief as with the tsunami. Currency devaluations, while seeming to offer a short-term boost, have generally been ineffective. Most of the successful Asian trading countries, compared with those in Latin America, for example, have benefited from long periods of relative exchange rate stability based on active currency management. Initially, rather than having a freely floating exchange rate, countries that are becoming more involved with international trade can consider a \u2018managed float\u2019 that permits their currency to depreciate slowly. Many countries have combined trade liberalization with a gradual depreciation of the currency that prevented an unsustainable buildup of trade deficits. The overall priority, however, is to ensure that the rate remains relatively stable and realistic. 7. Persist with Multilateralism The slow pace of progress in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations has discouraged many developing countries. They can see this \u2018development round\u2019 running into some familiar impediments, especially the resistance from the developed countries over agricultural subsidies. This is leading at best to pessimism, and at worst to a crisis of falling expectations that could cause the developing countries to abandon multila- teralism altogether. Despairing of the WTO negotiations, many countries are also seeking bilateral trade agreements with the developed countries. Some would argue that in terms of trade these are better because they give preferential access. But in terms of human development, they may impose high costs. Bilateral agreements typically involve much deeper tariff concessions from the developing countries and make demands on issues like intellectual property rights that go far beyond what WTO members require of each other \u2013 and can threaten the health and live- lihoods of the poor. Many countries of the region would do better to resist the immediate temptations of a bilateral embrace and build up slower, but ultimately more productive, multilateral relationships that can lead to more durable human development outcomes. 8. Cooperate with Neighbours Rather than seeking bilateral agreements, governments would do better to seek trade and other agreements with other countries in their region or subregion. These could include regio- nal pacts such as the South Asian Free Trade Agreement, the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement, or the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement.

In addition, they dovetail well with the region\u2019s many integrated cross-national production systems and lead to trade creation.

Many countries in the region have accumulated vast foreign exchange reserves \u2013 $1.9 trillion in total, half of which is in China \u2013 partly to protect themselves against another Asian financial crisis. These funds could be put to better use if they were pooled so that countries facing sudden balance of payments crises caused, say, by a spike in oil prices could draw on this shared Asian resource.

Reaching a Different Frontier With or without new multilateral agreements, globalization will continue to power ahead. And millions more workers in the Asia Pacific region will find themselves producing goods for people on the other side of the globe \u2013 as well as buying at lower prices goods their parents could scarcely have dreamed of. The main hazard, however, is that millions of others will fall by the wayside \u2013 abandoned in rural areas where agricultural economies have drifted into decline, or scratching a living on the fringes of Asia\u2019s mega-cities as a permanent underclass. Even those currently in work may find themselves later discarded from ever more sophisticated production systems. This not only denies people their basic rights to decent work and a reasonable standard of living; it also heightens the risk of future unrest. Globalization does not just distribute products but also disseminates new ideas and information that change people\u2019s expectations. The countries of the Asia-Pacific region are renowned for the speed at which they have developed economically. Now they find themselves at a different frontier \u2013 trying to combine accelerated trade-driven economic growth with equally rapid poverty reduction and, more broadly, human development. In many ways, this is a more complex and difficult task, and just as before, they will need to work out their own solutions. Some of these have already been highlighted in this Report; others will only emerge in the light of experience. One thing is certain \u2013 that Asia and the Pacific will remain at the forefront of global development and will offer fresh lessons to the rest of the world.

The grouping of countries into regions follows the classification of the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators. The data are presented for three points of time \u2013 1982, 1992 and 2002 \u2013 a period during which trade liberalization deepened in the countries of Asia-Pacific. Using these three data points helps to capture trends in social and economic indicators over a relatively long period. The latest year for which most of the countries of the Asia-Pacific have data on most indicators is 2002, although for some countries later data are available for 2003. Where data for some indicators are not available for the exact time points, the nearest reference points are reported and footnoted in the tables. Developing countries covered and regional classifications are as below: East Asia & Pacific 1 Cambodia 2 China 3 Fiji 4 Indonesia 5 Malaysia 6 Mongolia 7 Papua New Guinea 8 Philippines 9 Thailand 10 Viet Nam South Asia 11 Bangladesh 12 Bhutan 13 India 14 Maldives 15 Nepal 16 Pakistan 17 Sri Lanka Regions 1 East Asia & Pacific 2 Europe & Central Asia 3 Latin America & Caribbean 4 Middle East & North Africa 5 South Asia 6 Sub-Saharan Africa 7 Least Developed Countries (UN classification) 8 World Note: Countries of the Asia-Pacific region that are not covered in the Annexures because of unavailability of data on most indicators include Afghanistan, Brunei, Cook Islands, Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Islamic Republic of Iran, Kiribati, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "799bb0dc-7d5c-4846-96f6-b666d5023f5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "799bb0dc-7d5c-4846-96f6-b666d5023f5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8e931444fbe8d8cfbed88ec82eec19931594267d3a8bb5f8492aacced856183"}, "2": {"node_id": "673a2b7f-20ab-40c3-b087-727a5487fa6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe9d9ef85dc7743ec88a83e1eacc358158f28dab662053220b8b473e502b8aa0"}}, "hash": "1016b3bef0b1af8c89104c734468b0b2817f66a200602340974f41bde6e3f86b", "text": "ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 174 Table 1: Basic Indicators Subregions/Countries/Regions Total population Rural population GDP per capita (millions) (% of total) (constant 2000 US $) 1982 1992 2002 1982 1992 2002 1982 1992 2002 East Asia and Pacific 1.

Bilateral Agreement Website http://www.bilaterals.org DEFINITIONS OF TECHNICAL TERMS 213 Ad valorem duties (tariffs) Is calculated as a percentage of the value of the dutiable items. Contrasts with a specific tariff. Anti-dumping duties May be imposed if export dumping causes injury to producers of competing goods in an importing country. The duties should be equal to the difference between the export price and the normal value of the dumped goods. Balance of trade Refers to the difference between the value of exports and imports. It is calculated as the value of exports of goods and services minus the value of imports of goods and services. Balance of payments Records all flows of money in and out of a given country. These flows might result from the sale of exports (an inflow or credit) or from the country\u2019s purchase of imports from overseas (an outflow or debit). They might also arise from other countries investing in the country (inward investment \u2013 a credit), or from country\u2019s companies investing abroad (a debit). All flows of money are added together and grouped according to their type. The overall account is then called the balance of payments \u2013 principally because the total of outflows must be equivalent to the total of inflows. The balance of payments therefore balances. Blue Box Comprises measures regarded as exceptions to the general rule that all subsidies linked to production must be reduced or kept within defined minimal levels. Covers payments directly linked to land size or livestock as long as the activity being supported limits production. Common external tariff Refers to a tariff rate applied by a regional grouping of countries as a unit. Definitions of Technical Terms Dumping Occurs when goods are exported at a price less than their normal value, generally meaning that they are exported for less than they are sold in the domestic market or third- country markets, or at less than cost of production. Employment elasticity Is the percentage change in employment resulting from a one per cent change in economic growth. EU Common Agricultural Policy Refers to the system of European Union agricultural subsidies that guarantees a minimum price to producers and pays a subsidy for crops planted. An export processing zone (EPZ) Eases tax and labour restrictions. Its primary purpose is to generate export revenues in poor developing countries. It is largely identical to a free trade zone. Extreme poverty Is the most severe state of poverty, where people have minimal or very limited access to basic necessities, such as food, clothing, shelter, education and health care. The World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on $1 or less per day, and estimates that 1.1 billion people currently live under these conditions. Eradication of extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 is a Millennium Development Goal. Financial liberalization Refers to a series of regulatory changes that allow foreign investors to buy domestic assets and allows domestic citizens to invest in foreign assets which make the domestic securities market an integral part of the world market. The process is mainly defined as a series of regulatory changes that open up the capital markets to foreign investors with the introduction of depository receipts, country funds or equity capital flows to the emerging economy. ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 214 GATS framework Is the General Agreement of Trade in Services. It covers four \u2018modes of supply\u201d for the delivery of services in cross- border trade: \u2022 Mode 1, cross border trade \u2013 which is defined as delivery of a service from the territory of one country into the territory of the other country; \u2022 Mode 2, consumption abroad \u2013 which covers supply of a service of one country to the service consumer of any other country; \u2022 Mode 3, commercial presence \u2013 which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country in the territory of any other country; and \u2022 Mode 4, presence of natural persons \u2013 which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country through the presence of natural persons in the territory of any other country. A \u2018Natural Person\u2019 is a human being, as distinct from a legal person such as a company or organization. Countries can freely decide where to liberalize on a sector-by-sector basis, including which specific mode of supply they want to cover for a given sector. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Is gross value added, at purchasers\u2019 prices, by all resident producers in the economy plus any taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.

Value added is the net output of an industry after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. Gender Is a social construct regarding culture- bound conventions, roles and behaviours for, as well as relationships between and among, women and men and boys and girls. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Aims to encourage developing countries\u2019 exports by allowing their products preferential access to the markets of developed countries. Although donor countries are under no obligation in inter- national law to give preferences, almost all developed countries operate GSP schemes; how- ever, the schemes they offer vary significantly. Green Box Contains income support and subsidies that are expected to cause little or no trade distortion. Subsidies have to be funded by governments but must not involve price support. Environmental protection subsidies are included. No limits or reductions are required for such income support or subsidies. Gini coefficient (index) Measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or consumption) among individuals or households within a country deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A value of \u2018zero\u2019 represents perfect equality, while a value of \u2018one\u2019 represents perfect inequality. Globalization For the purposes of this report, refers to the generalized expansion of international economic activity, which includes increased international trade, growth of international investment (foreign investment) and international migration, and increased proliferation of technology among countries. Globalization is thus the increasing worldwide integration of markets for goods, services, labour, and capital. Headcount ratio Is also known as the poverty incidence or headcount index. It measures the share of the total population in a given area whose consumption is below the poverty line. In other words, it is the proportion of the population who cannot afford to purchase the basic basket of goods and services. Infant mortality rate Is the probability of dying between birth and exactly one year of age, expressed in terms of per 1,000 live births. Intellectual property rights Is a generic phrase encompassing intangible property rights, including, among others, patents, trade and service marks, copyrights, industrial designs, rights in semiconductor chip layout designs, and rights in trade secrets. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) Are countries which, according to the United DEFINITIONS OF TECHNICAL TERMS 215 Nations, exhibit the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development. A country is classified as a Least Developed Country if it meets three criteria based on: \u2022 Low-income (GNI per capita of less than $750) \u2022 Human resource weakness (based on indicators of nutrition, health, education and adult literacy) \u2022 Economic vulnerability (based on instability of agricultural production, instability of exports of goods and services, economic importance of non-traditional activities, merchandise export concentration, and handicap of economic smallness, and the percentage of population displaced by natural disasters). Life expectancy at birth Is the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of age-specific mortality rates at the time of birth were to stay the same throughout the child\u2019s life. Low- and middle-income developing countries Are defined on the basis of per capita gross national income (GNI), based on the approach used by the World Bank. Based on GNI per capita for 2004, the groups are: low-income, $825 or less; lower middle-income, $826\u2013 $3,255; upper middle-income, $3,256\u2013$10,065; and high income, $10,066 or more. Maternal mortality ratio Is the annual number of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 live births. Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) Also known as Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC), governed the world trade in textiles and garments from 1974 through 2004, imposing quotas on the amount developing countries could export to developed countries. It expired on 1 January 2005. Most-favoured-nation (MFN) Is a commit- ment that a country will extend to another country the lowest tariff rates it applies to any other country. All WTO contracting parties undertake to apply such treatment to one another under A`rticle I of the GATT. When a country agrees to cut tariffs on a particular product imported from one country, the tariff reduction automatically applies to imports of that product from any other country eligible for most-favoured-nation treatment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9995234-7110-4758-a793-e1d7468d0080": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9995234-7110-4758-a793-e1d7468d0080", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ad40a0b9db8c6e7dccf30cdd3fd956a298a6fb0382e6bb4db595cdd346c3979"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b65e6d8-f71b-49ba-8b74-3e403c06cfa9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63046102ffd6961128873eef476fea86c56eff9e1cb42d9b14bffedf79d84184"}}, "hash": "0bcacba517e35f04d80d8c3220eeaae19ed6596e413a0144fe7746127a626989", "text": "Newly industrializing economies (NIEs) A term originated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), describes economies of the Third World that have enjoyed rapid economic growth and can be described as \u2018middle-income\u2019 economies.

In these contracts the provider is responsible for performing and managing the outsourced function or process on behalf of the customer. Business process outsourcing contracts generally involve the provider taking overall responsibility for the business process and not just supplying IT applications or services to facilitate the process. Through business process outsourcing, vendors provide and manage a company\u2019s critical and/or non- critical enterprise applications. The most common examples of such arrangements are call-centres, human resources, accounting and payroll outsourcing. Business process outsourcing may involve the use of off-shore resources. Plant variety protection (PVP) Is a synonym for plant breeders\u2019 rights (PBR). It is the legal protection of a new plant variety granted to the breeder or his successor in title. The effect of PBR is that prior authorization is required before the material can be used for commercial purposes. Poverty gap Provides information on how far the consumption of poor people is from the poverty line \u2013 i.e. the depth of poverty. More technically, the measure captures the average ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 216 expenditure shortfall, or gap. It is obtained by adding up all the shortfalls of the poor (ignoring the non-poor) and dividing this total by the number of poor. The poverty gap thus measures the consumption deficit of the population, or the resources that would be needed to lift all the poor out of poverty through perfectly targeted cash transfers. Preferential treatment Refers to trade preferences that have long been an instrument of foreign and commercial policy, employed to establish closer relations, both economic and political, between the countries concerned. Preferential treatment by developed countries of imports from developing countries has, in addition, become a firm element of development-oriented policies. The various existing regimes of trade preferences for developing countries can be classified into three major categories: (i) the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP); (ii) special preferential regimes for groups of developing countries; and (iii) regional free-trade arrangements between individual developed countries and given groups of developing countries. Regional integration Refers to the formation of closer economic linkages among countries that are geographically near each other, especi- ally by forming preferential trade agreements. Small-island developing states (SIDS) Include low-lying coastal countries that share similar sustainable-development challenges, including small populations, lack of resources, remote- ness, susceptibility to natural disasters, excessive dependence on international trade and vulner- ability to global developments. In addition, they suffer from lack of economies of scale, high transportation and communication costs, and costly public administration and infrastructure. Special and differential treatment Is the principle in the WTO that developing countries be accorded special privileges, either exempting them from some WTO rules or granting them preferential treatment in the application of WTO rules. Tax-to-GDP ratio Refers to taxes and social security contributions as a percentage of GDP. This indicator is widely used to measure the overall tax burden. Total factor productivity (TFP) Often referred to as the \u2018Solow residual\u2019, addresses any effects in total output not caused by inputs or productivity. In terms of a standard Cobb- Douglas production function \u2013 Y = AK\u03b1L1 \u2013 \u03b1 where Y represents total output as a function of total-factor productivity (A), capital input (K), labour input (L), and the two inputs\u2019 respective shares of output. Technology growth and efficiency are regarded as two of the biggest factors affecting TFP, the former possessing \u2018special\u2019 inherent features such as positive externalities and non-rivalness which enhance its position as a driver of economic growth. TFP is seen as the real driver of growth within an economy, and studies reveal that whilst labour and investment are important contri- butors, TFP accounts for up to as much as 60 per cent of growth within economies. Trade diversion Occurs when a trade reform measure discriminates between different trading partners and a less efficient (higher cost) source displaces a more efficient (lower cost) one. Can arise whenever some preferred suppliers are freed from barriers but others are not. Tradable goods Are goods that have export or import potential. The possibility of their being traded abroad sets up a continuous comparison between their price and that of their overseas competitors. Trade liberalization Is the removal of barriers to free trade, such as tariffs, quotas, nominal and effective rates of protection and exchange controls.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb798245-9537-4061-a774-df1da2ac127a": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb798245-9537-4061-a774-df1da2ac127a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ce6e8c05be48eb7ac8d59c03490f0978648f33be4d9566f421d3dcdac29aa4e"}, "2": {"node_id": "378168a2-53de-43ef-8b23-8663c5e7b427", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6730d0a47d756630c423b77256720f591d9f27b56d23345761e76d65d3459d67"}}, "hash": "b9875aee1c55a1f32e9775e2c38ee7ddd7efebd7ecc4051dd73cbf57d833b3b4", "text": "Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) Is one of Agreements covered under Annex IA to the Marrakech Agreement, signed at the end of the Uruguay Round negotiations.

Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Is an international treaty under the World Trade Organization (WTO), which sets down minimum standards of intellectual property for all products and services, covering copyrights, trademarks, geographical indications, industrial designs, integrated circuits, patents and trade secrets. Trade-to-GDP ratio Is the sum of imports and exports as a proportion of GDP. Value added tax Is similar to a sales tax in that it is levied at the time of the sale of goods and services. In some countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Singapore, this tax is known as \u2018goods and services tax\u2019 or GST; and in Japan it is known as \u2018consumption tax\u2019. VAT is an indirect tax, in that the tax is collected from someone other than the person who actually bears the cost of the tax (namely the seller rather than the consumer). Venture Capital Fund Is a pooled investment vehicle (often a partnership) that primarily invests the financial capital of third-party investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans.

This slow progress has contributed to slow pro- gress at the international level. In 2002, there were 815 million hungry people in the world, according to the United Nations (2005). FAO estimates show that since the World Food Summit benchmark period of 1990-92, the number of hungry in the world has declined by only 9 million. \u2018More alarm- ing still, the number has actually increased over the most recent five years for which numbers are available. In three of the four developing regions, more people were undernourished in 2000\u20132002 Notes than had been the case in 1995\u201397. Only Latin America and the Caribbean registered a modest reduction in the number of hungry people\u2019 (FAO 2004a). 11. FAO 2004a; 2004b. 12. Over the 1990\u201392 to 2000\u201302 period as a whole, the proportion of people living with insufficient food declined from 25 to 22 per cent in South Asia, from 18 to 13 per cent in South-East Asia and from 16 to 11 per cent in East Asia. As a result, in East and South-East Asia the number of hungry people declined by 47 and 12 million respectively, while in South Asia it rose by 15 million. (United Nations 2005). 13.

Following trade negotiations crafted by the General Council of the WTO in July 2004, the \u2018basic concepts, principles and effectiveness\u2019 of the Green Box remain untouched, subject to a review to ensure that its trade-distorting effects are \u2018minimal\u2019. Further, not only were members allowed to take recourse to existing forms of Blue Box support, but new measures were to be negotiated subject to the condition that such payments will be less trade-distorting than aggregate measure of support measures. 29. This primarily came in the form of an agreement to substantially reduce, based on negotiations, the sum total of Final Bound levels of the Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS), de minimis (or minimal acceptable) support and Blue Box measures. Such reduction was to occur through a tiered formula involving larger reductions by those currently providing higher levels of support, leading to some \u2018harmonization\u2019 of support levels. In particular, the framework required that there would be a minimal reduction in such support to 80 per cent of preexisting levels in the first year and throughout the period of implementation. Finally, while a major compromise in the form of the continuation of the Blue Box had been made, a promise to cap Blue Box support at 5 per cent of the value of production had been included. 30. This definition draws on two established concepts, Indication of Source (IS) and Appellation of Origin (AO), which trace their formal origins to the 1893 Paris Convention and the 1958 Lisbon Convention on Appellations of Origin and their Registration respectively. IS refers generally to any expression or sign used to indicate that a product originates in a country, or a specific place (e.g., Made in Mongolia), while AO refers to the geographical name of a country or locality (e.g., Champagne), which serves to designate a product originating therein whose characteristics are exclusively or essentially due to that geographical environment. While all Appellations of Origin are clearly Indications of Source, the converse is not necessarily true. 31. UNDP 1999. 32. Consumers International 2005. 33. This imbalance in the TRIPS agreement was a result of deals done between major players at the 1990 Brussels Ministerial Conference. At that point, few developing countries showed much interest in GIs. A coalition of developing and developed countries is now, therefore, seeking to redress this imbalance by extending additional protection to products other than wines and spirits. They clearly have equity and logic on their side, though they are struggling to prove that weaker protection has actually caused economic losses (Rangnekar 2003). 34. WTO 2002a. 35. FAO 2005. 36.

Of course, there are other types of services, such as environmental services (water and sanitation, telecom, energy services, health services, education and financial services, etc.), many of which also have positive and negative human development implications. Due to limitations of space and time, a collective decision was taken to limit the scope of this chapter. The human development implications of these other services could be a useful area for research. 3. Huy et al. 2003. 4. Chanda 2003a; Ghosh 2004. 5. DOLE 2001; Buchan and Sochalski 2003. 6.

The Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Report (APHDR) is an important resource and instrument to explore critical development concerns. The Report thus informs policies from a human development perspective, putting people at the centre of development debates. As a regional public good, the APHDR focuses on issues that are of common concern to several countries in the region, have sensitivities that are better addressed at a regional level, or have clear cross-border dimensions. The APHDR is an independent intellectual exercise developed through a regional participatory process that draws from the contributions of many. The theme for each Report is also selected through consultations that include participants within and outside UNDP. The more nuanced focus of the Report is guided by substantive and diverse inputs that bring together Asia-Pacific stakeholders from governments, civil society, academia, research institutions, the media, the private sector and others. Technical background papers are prepared by eminent experts drawn largely from the Region. An established peer review process contributes to quality and impartiality. The work is enriched by a moderated discussion on the Asia-Pacific Human Development Network, which comprises members from the Region and beyond. Drawing from this rich material, the Report is prepared by the Human Development Report Unit team. The APHDR is disseminated widely, helping to promote dialogue and bring together the people of Asia Pacific to accelerate human development.

The FFFFFor or or or orew ew ew ew eword ord ord ord ord misleadingly termed \u2018petty corruption\u2019, which takes its toll on vast numbers of people, is just as weighty as \u2018grand corruption\u2019, which gets the lion\u2019s share of publicity. Cross-border issues, increasingly important for this rapidly globalizing region, are also explored. Corruption undermines democratic institutions, retards economic development and contributes to government instability. It attacks the foundation of democratic institutions by distorting electoral processes, perverting the rule of law and creating bureaucratic quagmires whose only reason for existence is the soliciting of bribes. Economic development is stunted because outside direct investment is discouraged and small busi- nesses within the country often find it impossible to overcome the \u2018start-up costs\u2019 required, because of corruption. As Kofi Annan, the former UN Secretary-General remarked, \u2018Corruption hurts the poor dis- proportionately by diverting funds intended for development, undermining a government\u2019s ability to provide basic services, feeding inequa- lity and injustice, and discouraging foreign investment and aid.\u2019 In a diverse region like the Asia-Pacific, which is attempting the twin task of development and democratic consolidation, the problem of corruption goes to its very core. It diminishes not only the outcomes we seek to achieve, but also corrodes the instruments and mechanisms we have at our disposal to do so. Many democratic regimes have been overthrown because elected governments failed not only to deliver results; they abused their offices for securing private gains. But non-democratic regimes that replaced them, also have not been able to resolve the problem of corruption. While non-democratic regimes may initially appear to curb visible corruption through strong action, they are neither accountable nor responsive to the people they govern, in the way democratic institutions can be. The solutions lie, therefore, in more and better quality of democracy; in terms of reinvigorated democratic institutions and vibrant democratic practice. Governments, civil society and companies around the world are showing that it is possible to stymie high levels of corruption. Those in the Asia-Pacific region have won some battles against it. Home-grown success stories brought to the fore in this Report could help dissipate defeatist attitudes, which consider corruption as an incurable ailment. The solutions in these pages seek to deepen the burgeoning momentum for change and help countries identify and strengthen their own strategies. This Regional Human Development Report is, ultimately, by and for the people of the region. Stakeholders from Asia-Pacific countries not only identified corruption as one of the most pressing concerns for the region, they also contributed to lively and often intensive discussions with views, suggestions for focus areas and solutions. Those actors included government officials, media, private sector, academia and civil society organizations. Contributions from experts drawn largely from the region then helped shape arguments and messages. The entire process has been truly collaborative. Solutions form the heart of this Report. Options are presented of relevance not just to nations, but also to the region and the globe. Tackling corruption in Asia-Pacific is an international responsibility that goes beyond governments, after all. It needs to be shared by transnational companies, international banks, multilateral agencies, aid agencies, civil society organizations, media and indivi- duals alike. Today, combating corruption makes more political sense than ever before. This is especially so in sectors like water and electricity, and health and education, which can greatly promote citizen satisfaction. The Report is action-oriented, and proposes a seven-point agenda for change, building upon ongoing anti-corruption efforts. These parallel and reinforce efforts for achieving the MDGs by improving develop- mental results and building the tools to deliver. The Report therefore provides a coherent, comprehensive vision for tackling the problem of corruption in the Asia-Pacific region, and proposes interventions that add to a concerted, robust response. This vision is not fantasy; it is about the reality within reach. 31.12.2007 Hafiz A.

The Report aims to demystify certain misconceptions surrounding a complex phenomenon \u2013 aspects of corruption that are less well known and hence tend to be ignored. Sometimes behind closed doors, sometimes openly on the floors of parliaments, laws are passed, which allow corruption to be legal. Meanwhile, misleadingly termed \u2018petty corruption\u2019 can be just as, if not more, crushing as grand corruption, hitting hard especially at the poor. Tackling corruption in the Asia-Pacific is a responsibility to be shared by governments, the private sector, international organizations, civil society and the media. Individuals must also assert themselves as citizens and Pr Pr Pr Pr Preface eface eface eface eface consumers. As corruption is not confined to country borders, it is necessary for solutions to be a global responsibility to be shared by multi-national companies, international banks and aid agencies alike. This Asia Pacific HDR proposes combining political will from the top with people\u2019s voices from below, each strengthening the other. How best can social policy be shielded from the power of narrow special interests? How can the poorest segments of society have a stronger voice? Particular solutions will depend on every country\u2019s specific circum- stances. Reducing corruption is ultimately in the long-term interest of all layers of society, promoting justice and legitimacy of institu- tions, with the disadvantaged benefiting the most. We hope that this Report will contri- bute to constructive debate. The Asia Pacific region, well known for its dynamism, can seize the momentum for change to mobilise support within and across borders to build more just societies. There is much to be gained. The publication of this Report is espe- cially opportune. The year 2008 started with the Second Session of the Conference of State Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) held in Nusa Dua, Indonesia, in January. The UNCAC is the first legally binding international anti- corruption instrument, providing a unique opportunity for a global response to a global problem that pervades institutions within countries and crosses national borders. The Report benefited enormously from the ongoing guidance and support of Hafiz Pasha. He worked with the Team more like a vii vii vii vii vii member than a Bureau Director and saw the Human Development Report Unit through the many twists and turns in the course of this work. On behalf of the Regional Centre in Colombo, we would like say a very special thank you to him. viii viii viii viii viii Omar Noman Anuradha K.

economic inefficiency and unchecked environmental exploitation. And it hits hardest at the poor \u2013 who often depend heavily on public services and the natural environment and are least able to pay bribes for essential services that should be theirs by right. Politicians in the region are starting to respond. Nowadays most want to be asso- ciated with fighting corruption. Indeed the need to combat corruption has been used as a justification for overthrowing elected govern- ments, sometimes even with an element of public support. Civil society groups too are making greater efforts to hold public- and private-sector organizations to account, and the media are also focusing on this issue and finding new ways to expose and publicize it. There is also greater commitment at the international level. By the end of 2007, 140 state parties had signed the first global anti- corruption instrument, the 2005 United Nations Convention Against Corruption. It People across the Asia-Pacific region are becoming increasingly concerned about corruption, and governments are starting to react. Hauling the rich and powerful before the courts may grab the headlines, but the poor will benefit more from efforts to eliminate the corruption that plagues their everyday lives. Corruption has to be tackled from the top down and from the bottom up, with vigorous support from the media and organizations of civil society.

Across the region, corruption comes in many forms, but the commonest overall distinction is between \u2018grand\u2019 and \u2018petty\u2019. Grand corruption typically involves relatively large bribes from contractors or other corporations, generally associated with high- level politicians or officials. Petty corruption involves smaller amounts but more frequent transactions \u2013 lower-level public officials demanding \u2018speed money\u2019 to issue licenses, for example, or to allow full access to schools, hospitals or public utilities. It tends to affect the daily lives of a very large number of people, and more so the poor, and hence calling it \u2018petty\u2019 is really a misnomer. Though corruption is widespread it is largely clandestine, and thus difficult to measure. Most attempts have been indirect \u2013 gauging people\u2019s perceptions rather than actual transactions of corruption. One of the most widely cited is the \u2018Corruption Percep- tions Index\u2019 (CPI) produced by the NGO Transparency International. Another is the \u2018Control of Corruption Index\u2019 (CCI) produced by the World Bank. They do offer some relevant information and have spurred countries into responding. They can also be useful for cross-regional comparisons \u2013 for which this Report uses the CCI. However, since these measures are opinion-based they are necessarily imprecise. The measurements are generally oriented towards businesses and make less of an attempt to express the impact on the poor. Political and Economic Impact Political and Economic Impact Political and Economic Impact Political and Economic Impact Political and Economic Impact All forms of government are vulnerable to corruption, but some are more vulnerable than others. On the whole, corruption seems lower in democracies than authoritarian regimes, and lower within parliamentary than presidential systems. Although in democracies there is always the danger that elected politicians will become beholden to wealthy donors, citizens can always \u2018vote the rascals out\u2019. Within all forms of government, some institutions are generally worse than others. In the Asia-Pacific region the least trusted are the police, followed by the judiciary and tax offices. Education and medical services come next, while the least corrupt sectors are utilities and registry or permit services \u2013 although even in these, levels of corruption are still very high. Corruption inevitably has an impact on the economy and the society. It is sometimes argued that by \u2018greasing the wheels\u2019 corrup- tion speeds things up. But there is little evi- dence for this from the aggregate standpoint; indeed it seems more likely if businesses readily pay bribes they will simply encourage bureaucrats to unreel yet more red tape. On the other hand, there are many ways in which corruption is likely to hamper growth especially over the long term \u2013 for example, if talented people are tempted to make an easy living as corrupt bureaucrats rather than as entrepreneurs. Even those who do run businesses, may prefer to remain in the informal sector rather than expand and be faced with greater demands from corrupt officialdom. Corruption is also likely to weaken infrastructure; not only does it drain away funds, it also reduces the quality of investment, producing inadequate transport, power, or communications systems. Corruption distorts both the national economy and public investment through the tax system. When governments apply high tax rates, with complex rules that are inter- preted by underpaid officials they can expect to lose a lot of tax income \u2013 particularly if there is little risk of being caught or punished.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ce21709-68e1-4f61-9d13-eee7adbde7c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ce21709-68e1-4f61-9d13-eee7adbde7c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81bdb23bb5b4c75c5d705f5cc8ac8858a85108a600e3e3e8a66443f40b0c6d04"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3ab9703-cab1-4d1d-8a7c-da5f1eaf28c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b85e4a3fac58077b441cbb2b9d7ab1c2f043b7aa013a58cd64d7984a72d61b9"}}, "hash": "091ce9e3b569d1471e6980060f70874967316a6946523d34029b2aae753e459c", "text": "TACKLING CORRUPTION, TRANSFORMING LIVES: OVERVIEW TACKLING CORRUPTION, TRANSFORMING LIVES: OVERVIEW TACKLING CORRUPTION, TRANSFORMING LIVES: OVERVIEW TACKLING CORRUPTION, TRANSFORMING LIVES: OVERVIEW TACKLING CORRUPTION, TRANSFORMING LIVES: OVERVIEW 33333 This, in turn, could reduce the capacity of government to provide quality public services. A number of studies have indeed suggested that extensive corruption is associated with lower levels of growth \u2013 though the correlation is weaker in Asia than elsewhere. Generally it does less damage in larger countries, perhaps because investors may be willing to tolerate a more difficult working environment if they can recoup their losses in large consumer markets.

Corruption and Human Development Corruption and Human Development Corruption and Human Development Corruption and Human Development Corruption and Human Development Corruption undermines human development. This can happen through various channels. It is likely, for example, to corrode ideals of public service, so that corrupt administra- tions will tend to be less interested in investing in health and education. Even if they wish to, they will find that their activities have hampered economic growth and weakened tax collection, leaving them less to spend on public service programmes. Corruption also affects the quality and composition of public investment. Corrupt officials are less attracted to small-scale projects that involve a large number of actors, preferring large infrastructure projects that offer greater opportunities for collecting rents. This distorts the pattern of public expenditure \u2013 away from key public goods such as public health, education and environmental protection, and towards new roads or airports or military hardware. Corruption is also likely to undermine efforts at poverty reduction \u2013 by diverting goods and services targeted for the poor to well-off and well-connected households who can afford to bribe officials. The poor also lose out when they have to pay bribes, since they can only afford small amounts, which represent a high proportion of their income. In turn, better human development condi- tions \u2013 wider-spread education, an informed citizenry with voice to influence decision makers in government and businesses \u2013 can help combat corruption. Justice for Sale Justice for Sale Justice for Sale Justice for Sale Justice for Sale In the Asia-Pacific region, corruption is often at its worst in law enforcement, seriously undermining justice. Many police officers are honest and conscientious, but others have a different agenda; rather than serving as guarantors of rights and protection they are sources of harassment and fear. In the rural areas, they may, for example, be in the pockets of rich landowners who use them to control their workforces or their tenants. In the cities, the police can be in the pay of corrupt politicians and business interests, and may be used, for example, to force poor people off their land to make way for new developments. Or police officers may simply be working for themselves, extracting as much income as they can from their position of power. Poor salaries and working condi- tions among the lower constabulary are contributory factors. Police corruption is especially pernicious since it is often accompanied by violence. Police may, after apprehending suspects, choose not to arrest them but instead beat them up or rape them, and force them to pay for their freedom. Police can also seize people they know to be innocent, threatening them with arrest and demanding payment for release. A survey in the Asia-Pacific ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 44444 region found that over the previous year, 18 per cent of respondents had paid a police bribe. The poor are the most exposed because they lack the funds or influence needed to defend themselves. In cities, among those likely to be harassed are street vendors, who have to pay up or see their goods confiscated or destroyed. On the other hand, poor people are less likely to receive any attention if they want to register a complaint. For tackling police corruption, one of the most important steps is to ensure that com- plaints against the police are dealt with, by a truly independent body. Other solutions involve changing police structures and opera- tions to make them more efficient and responsive \u2013 applying rigid recruitment criteria, reallocating individuals across tasks, modifying transfer patterns, and carrying out ethical evaluations of those who are up for promotion. The overall intention should be to create more professional forces that enable individual officers to take greater pride in their work. People tend to have fewer interactions with the court system. But here too they may find that justice has its price. A number of studies across Asia have found that two- thirds or more of the population consider the routine court system to be corrupt, and admit that they themselves, guilty or innocent, will consider it wise to pay bribes. The poor will suffer from a corrupt legal system that offers them little protection \u2013 exposing them to arbitrary judgements that may cause them to lose their land, homes, or livelihoods.

In many countries, judges are appointed or promoted by politically motivated bodies and even judges who want to uphold ethical principles may find themselves subject to heavy political pressure in high-profile cases. Low salaries make it tempting for weak judges to buckle to other pressures too. Some may, for example, consider it more important to support a relative or associate than to uphold the rule of law. They may also fear retribution. Much of the responsibility for reducing judicial corruption lies with the judges and lawyers \u2013 acting individually and through associations or professional bodies. But governments can also minimize judicial corruption. They can, for example, ensure that judges are appointed by independent bodies, serve fixed terms, have salaries that match their experience and qualifications, and are offered all necessary protection. The judicial system should also require judges to give written reasons for their judgements \u2013 making greater use of information technology to offer easier access to court documents. Keeping Public Services Honest Keeping Public Services Honest Keeping Public Services Honest Keeping Public Services Honest Keeping Public Services Honest Corruption is also widespread in social services such as health and education, as well as in public utilities that provide electricity and water. As a result, poor people find themselves excluded from schools or hospitals that they cannot afford, or asked to pay extra simply to gain access to services to which they already have a right. Health Services Health Services Health Services Health Services Health Services Corruption can occur within health services at all levels \u2013 from grand corruption, as funds are siphoned off during the construction of new hospitals or health centres, to petty corruption as health workers or administra- tors demand bribes just to perform their routine duties. Corruption can also take various forms within health service staffing. This may involve, for example, buying positions at the time of hiring, or excessive absenteeism: across the region reported TACKLING CORRUPTION, TRANSFORMING LIVES: OVERVIEW TACKLING CORRUPTION, TRANSFORMING LIVES: OVERVIEW TACKLING CORRUPTION, TRANSFORMING LIVES: OVERVIEW TACKLING CORRUPTION, TRANSFORMING LIVES: OVERVIEW TACKLING CORRUPTION, TRANSFORMING LIVES: OVERVIEW 55555 absenteeism rates cluster around 35 per cent to 40 per cent. Corruption also creeps in via the pharmaceuticals business \u2013 at all stages of drug development and supply. For the drug companies, one of the main priorities is to ensure that their products are prescribed, so they are profligate with generous \u2018perks\u2019 for doctors. One might expect corruption to result in poorer standards of health. Some cross- national studies have indeed suggested that in countries where levels of corruption are higher immunization rates are lower and levels of child mortality are higher. Reducing corruption in health and other government services will require action from below and above. From below, users can work together to resist demands for bribes. In India, teams of semi-literate rural people working as amateur reporters have exposed doctors illegally charging for delivering babies at a community health centre. From above, governments will need to ensure more trans- parent and better managed services. In the Mekong sub-region, for example, the regula- tory authorities have been improving commu- nications and cooperation across borders, so they have been able to notify each other of the circulation of fake drugs and remove them more quickly. Education Education Education Education Education Corruption is also widespread in education systems. This can start in the procurement of material and labour for school construction, as corrupt officials siphon off funds for school buildings \u2013 which can increase costs between two and eight times. There can also be corruption in the purchase of textbooks, desks, blackboards, and other supplies, as well as in contracts for cleaning services and meals. In many countries, there are irregularities in the hiring of teachers, which in the most extreme form, results in the recruitment of \u2018ghost teachers\u2019 or even in the creation of entire \u2018ghost institutions\u2019 \u2013 with the allocated salaries and other expenses channelled into the pockets of officials. Just as families may need to pay bribes to get into hospitals, they may also have to pay extra to get their children into schools. If governments do not address these problems, schools will continue to transmit a culture of corruption to succeeding genera- tions. The main priority should be closer supervision, especially by allowing commu- nities more control over schools through parent-teacher associations and other local organizations. In the Philippines, for example, a range of civil society groups, from NGOs to churches to Girl and Boy Scout groups, have come together to monitor the delivery of school books.

Public Utilities Public Utilities Public Utilities Public Utilities Public Utilities For electricity and water supplies, across the region the standard kickback for infrastruc- ture projects is often quoted as 10 per cent of the value of the contract. Corrupt officials regularly demand bribes to accept bids or to approve the completion of the work. But construction companies themselves often take the initiative \u2013 colluding with officials or other bidders. Once the systems are in place, corruption continues in day-to-day operations. Since water supplies and sanitation and electricity supplies are generally delivered by monopoly providers, officials can take advantage of the fact that consumers have nowhere else to turn. Staff might, for example, supplement their salaries by colluding with clients to provide services \u2018informally\u2019 \u2013 by carrying out ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 66666 repairs for side-payments, falsifying meter readings, or making illegal connections. The ensuing losses can be huge: it has been estimated that, if corruption in water supplies were eliminated, 20 per cent to 70 per cent of resources could be saved. But the most damaging effect is on the lives of poor people through high prices. As one consumer said to a researcher for this Report: \u2018It is really tough for a day labourer to pay a high price for electricity and water. You know it is not possible to get electricity and water connections without bribes or extra money. So our budget is strained and we cannot afford to meet our needs. We cannot save anything for our future either.\u2019 Others said that they had been deprived of basic foodstuffs and medical facilities, incurred business losses, and interrupted their children\u2019s education because they had to spend money on bribes. Many of the strategies for uprooting corruption involve greater investment in services, to minimize the shortages that encourage people to pay bribes. Public corpo- rations will also need to improve standards of management and operate in a more trans- parent fashion. But consumers too can take direct action to get better services. In Bangladesh, for example, the board of rural electric cooperatives is selected by consumers who then negotiate an agreement that includes targets for system losses, collection efficiency, and the cost of supply per kilo- metre of line. They also hire meter readers on fixed contracts \u2013 after that they have to seek different careers. Another example comes from the Local Government and Rural Deve- lopment Department in Azad Jammu and Kashmir which has largely eliminated the use of private contractors. Instead, its technical staff work with community members who themselves provide labour and organize the purchase of supplies \u2013 limiting the opportu- nities for \u2018cream skimming\u2019 and collusion.

Nevertheless, there are also people who take advantage of opportunities to enrich them- selves at a time when large amounts of cash and goods have to be transferred rapidly with few administrative controls. To some extent, corruption can even lead to emergencies. Corruption tends to break the trust between the governing and the governed, as well as sow dissension among communities that can degenerate into destructive or violent conflict. Corruption can even exacerbate the impact of natural disasters, such as earth- quakes, if it leads to uncontrolled develop- ment and compromises building inspection practices. The links between corruption and disasters are even clearer with landslides that result from illegal logging. When responding to emergencies, aid agencies are under pressure to spend fast, and move quickly with flagship projects in an unfamiliar environment and have to relax or set aside normal procedures \u2013 which may cause damage in terms of community practice and expectation. Many of the same issues arise with longer- term processes in the aftermath of conflict.

When responding to natural disasters they can also establish long-term contracts with prime international contractors \u2013 who should be required to engage and build the capacity of local businesses. In addition, governments and aid agencies also need to work closely with local NGOs and establish effective systems for dealing with complaints. Social Safety Net Programmes Social Safety Net Programmes Social Safety Net Programmes Social Safety Net Programmes Social Safety Net Programmes Social safety net programmes are an impor- tant part of anti-poverty programmes but they are also vulnerable to corruption. Those organizing the schemes may, for example, demand payments to register the names of recipients, or they can also enrol non-existent workers or falsify the number of hours worked or underpay workers or give them less food or materials than they are entitled to. Contractors who are supposed to be selling subsidized grains for the poor, sometimes sell much of this on the open market at inflated prices. Government have tried to reduce these leakages with more targeted programmes, but even these are susceptible to corruption during the selection of beneficiaries. An alternative form of targeting is to encourage \u2018self-selection\u2019; for example, by offering work or wages that only the very poor will accept. Similarly, for food distribution, rather than distributing expensive grains, such as highly processed rice and wheat, safety net programmes can distribute cheaper but nutritious staples such as sorghum. A number of countries have also improved the efficiency of such schemes by ensuring greater community control and social audits. To be sustainable, however, community-driven approaches have to be backed by a strong legal framework and bureaucratic support. Cleaning Up Natural Resources Cleaning Up Natural Resources Cleaning Up Natural Resources Cleaning Up Natural Resources Cleaning Up Natural Resources Many developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region are rich in natural resources, but, thanks to corruption, much of this national wealth is being drained away. Companies may bribe public officials to get permits for cutting timber, for example, or they may pay to get away with logging in protected areas. Public officials themselves can also join in by running their own \u2018off-the- book\u2019 businesses. Similar problems arise with mineral extrac- tion or unregulated fishing, and with systems of land registration and administration, or the capturing of protected species. Given the size of potential profits, corruption can be on a grand scale, indeed frequently amounting to \u2018state capture\u2019, as private companies pay public officials to shape laws, policies, and regulations to their advantage. State capture can, however, also be achieved through legal routes \u2013 by intense political lobbying, for example, or by making donations to political parties. Corruption in the management of natural resources is particularly damaging for the poorest communities. Many farmers have been driven into poverty as a result of illegal land expropriations or have been denied access to irrigation water. Whole communi- ties, particularly indigenous people, suffer from the exhaustion of many natural re- sources, notably primary forests and inshore fishing grounds. Experience across the region suggests a number of ways of addressing these problems. One is to ensure that new projects are subjected to environmental and social ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 88888 impact assessments, followed by open public hearings.

But there are also some specific options for agencies concerned with natural resources, such as separating functions for managing production from those for monitor- ing and conservation. The most extreme solution for limiting the effect of public corruption is privatiza- tion. However, this may only shift the power from one corruptor to another. The aim instead should be to establish a clear and transparent regulatory framework for rights to natural resources, whether held publicly or privately. This has to be a combination of national and international action. Most of the corrupt activity would be much less profitable without ready markets in richer countries for oil or metals or agricultural products. More effective monitoring and control by government and local communities will therefore need to be matched by international campaigns that reject goods produced by corrupt and exploitative individuals and companies.

One of the most basic anti-corruption measures is to ensure that corrupt activities are outlawed \u2013 either as part of general legisla- tion or laws against specific forms of corrup- tion. Legislation can also cover such issues as money-laundering; a public procurement code of ethics should also be in place. It is also important to provide legal protection for \u2018whistle-blowers\u2019. Anti-Corruption Ag Anti-Corruption Ag Anti-Corruption Ag Anti-Corruption Ag Anti-Corruption Agencies encies encies encies encies Governments may divide anti-corruption res- ponsibilities between various prevention and law enforcement institutions. Most countries in the region have established formal anti- corruption agencies (ACAs) of one form or another. Unfortunately, these agencies are often quite weak. Almost all these ACAs depend on government funding and several face severe budget constraints. Another important factor is where the ACA is located in government: if it reports to the office of the prime minister, for example, it can be used as a weapon against political opponents. In the Asia-Pacific region, the experience has been mixed. Some administrations, such as those in Singapore and Hong Kong (SAR), China have resisted the temptation to meddle; others have not.

Whether a country has one or many agencies, success in the fight against corrup- tion depends to a great extent on cooperation from other parts of government. Unfortu- nately, this is rarely forthcoming and agencies are regularly frustrated by their inability to secure information and prosecutions. In the hands of a clean government, an ACA can be an asset. But since it can also be deployed as a political weapon, such an agency should not be created until there is a sufficient political consensus on an anti-corruption strategy. Civil Service Reform Civil Service Reform Civil Service Reform Civil Service Reform Civil Service Reform Attempts to reduce corruption within government will require civil service reform \u2013 reducing the incentives and opportunities for corrupt behaviour among public servants, while increasing their anxieties about being caught and punished. For this purpose, one of the first priorities should be to base personnel policies entirely on merit. Some countries in Asia had merit-based policies in the past but have not maintained this tradition and make many appointments on the basis of favouri- tism. Another option is to raise salaries, reducing the gap between those in the public and private sectors. Although this is unlikely to reduce grand corruption, which is caused less by need than by greed, it can reduce need- based and more retail corruption. Governments will, however, need to supplement salary increases and merit-based promotions with tighter systems of monitor- ing and control that can detect corruption swiftly and punish it severely.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90298e8b-12b7-40bf-a04d-8ae97379de04": {"__data__": {"id_": "90298e8b-12b7-40bf-a04d-8ae97379de04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76f8d0aa8e842c9ed5fddc4f4b5ff12dbaab90266bb2fc10abd3129566ff2ef6"}, "2": {"node_id": "8017feb1-3ecc-49e1-8de3-5515007a2261", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcc6d1ef1d10bbe87acf662ab39688fe836ed4abb87bf57d9db00bd6bdb5d2c0"}}, "hash": "a1b899f77cb5921bd7c71bfb71ff35ec91cddd9e34ef6dc00d88fed05111677f", "text": "This should alter the mindsets of civil servants so that they see bribery and corruption not as \u2018low- risk, high-reward\u2019 activities but as \u2018high-risk, low reward\u2019 ones.

Most tax-related corruption, for example, flourishes within excessive red tape which requires frequent interactions between taxpayers and tax officials. This can be tackled by keeping rates moderate so as not to discourage potential taxpayers while creating an integrated, simple and rational system. This would allow tax departments to make the best use of information technology which limits the discretionary powers of tax officials while also cutting transaction costs, helping to increase transparency and build trust. Finally, the acid test of an anti-corruption strategy is the determination to catch the \u2018big fish\u2019. Prosecuting and punishing the rich and famous, enhance the credibility of the strategy and has the added advantage of deterring others, especially junior civil servants. Privatization Privatization Privatization Privatization Privatization In addition to reforming public services, governments can also consider privatizing or outsourcing some of them. This does not necessarily solve the problem since corruption is also rife in the private sector, so govern- ments need to be concerned not just with whether services should be privatized but how. If policy is weak before privatization, it will also be weak after privatization. An alternative is to create public-private partner- ships. So far these have had mixed results; they seem to have worked better on a smaller scale.

This defines key categories of information that all public bodies are required to publish, and establishes citizens\u2019 rights to receive specific information on request. Legislation is, however, only the first step. The highest levels of government also have to sustain their support of RTI and public officials have to engage positively and meet their obligations fulsomely, so it is important that officials are engaged from the outset, and understand not only their obligations, but also the benefits they can derive. One development that should permit transparency and the right to information is the introduction of information and communications technology (ICT) and the extension of e-governance. Governments and service providers can use new technology to become more accountable and responsive. In India, for example, the Central Vigilance Commission uses its website to publish the names of officers against whom corruption investigations have been ordered or on whom penalties have been imposed. But there are dangers. Governments may also use new technology to exercise greater control over their citizens. Corrupt officials too may also be able to exploit such systems to their own advantage. Many governments have placed the development of national e-governance plans in the hands of IT staff. Since they may not be very familiar with corruption issues, they need therefore to work with legal and anti-corruption experts. Cross-Border Cooperation Cross-Border Cooperation Cross-Border Cooperation Cross-Border Cooperation Cross-Border Cooperation In an increasingly integrated global economy, corruption has become a cross-border issue. Countering corruption will need,therefore, cooperation between governments, inter- national agencies and international corpora- tions. The most important step in this has been the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). Thus far, while 19 Asia-Pacific countries have signed the treaty, only 10 have ratified or acceded to it. One of the aims of cross-border coopera- tion is to control transnational corporations (TNCs) \u2013 which generally operate more responsibly in developed countries where they are under closer scrutiny. While many TNCs have developed their own codes of conduct, a number of international agencies and civil society organizations have also established guidelines. For developing countries, one of the main problems is that the proceeds of corruption are laundered through offshore banks and tax havens, outside of Asia Pacific and within. As a response to this, and to help developing nations recover assets stolen by corrupt leaders, UNDOC and the World Bank in 2007 launched the Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) initiative.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60af6460-e79d-4466-b0a8-212a929cafd0": {"__data__": {"id_": "60af6460-e79d-4466-b0a8-212a929cafd0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d5ec035c7d8be475992163699ea413e25afeef4878b20edebb3cc33f2005675"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6f27664-1373-42cd-a178-274e34ce9300", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5266ad5195682391ac24cc7c955edea72bb1ed2b4493a19c6d6ea625674fbedc"}}, "hash": "f6086e9faf7ff0092ffd9e6be9d1f6f9db8723d54e01c24bfcb5a0c73f1437f2", "text": "Citizens on W Citizens on W Citizens on W Citizens on W Citizens on Watch atch atch atch atch Tackling corruption is not a job for govern- ments alone.

When the conventional media are too timid, those with vital informa- tion on corruption can now use the internet.

Publicity can be particularly effective against extortion, which victims may be willing to report to the press. Another type of corruption that the press can expose is collusion; neither bureaucrats nor their clients have any inceptive to expose the malfeasance, but journalists do \u2013 motivated either by their professional ethos or the prospect of a good story. As well as exposing individual cases, investigative journalism can lead to more profound reforms \u2013 uncovering serious systemic flaws and catalysing public discussion and debate. The press and other media will, however, only be able to report on corruption if they are free to do so. They face two main types of constraint: the first comes from government censorship; the second comes from proprietors since the private media often serve the interests of wealthy individuals or corporations who also may be corrupt. In addition, there can be constraints of capacity since journalists often lack the skills for textured and in-depth reporting. The media can promote good governance if news organizations enjoy editorial indepen- dence, abide by high ethical and professional standards and know that their rights will be guaranteed. Clearly, however, a free press is not enough. Corruption is rife even in coun- tries with long traditions of press freedom. These countries also need clean and efficient systems of justice that will follow up on widely-reported allegations. There have been many examples across the region, of action by national and community-based media. In Nepal, for example, the Civil Society Anti-corruption Project uses local radio listener clubs and other civil society organizations to encourage anti-corruption activities. In Papua New Guinea, Transparency International, the Ombudsman Commission and the Media Council run a hotline, through which members of the public can report suspected cases directly to the media. Even when the media are not launching investigations, they can still play a vital role through their normal functions. By reporting regularly on the activities of public anti- corruption bodies, the media reinforce their position. By persistently snapping at the heels of public officials, a lively press helps sustain a democratic system and discourages people tempted to engage in corrupt practices. Civil Society Organizations Civil Society Organizations Civil Society Organizations Civil Society Organizations Civil Society Organizations While the media can prepare the ground, accountable government has to be sustained by citizens themselves, partly through the ballot box but also through civil society organizations (CSOs). What sort of relation- ship should CSOs have with local regimes: contentious or cooperative? To some extent, the answer depends upon the available political options, and upon the state of civil liberties and rule of law. CSOs must be forth- right about opposing corruption, but where possible they should seek cooperative relation- ships with the regime, giving government officials incentives to oppose corruption, and helping them develop the means to do so. However, they should avoid becoming investi- gative bodies, whistle-blowers, or forces of anti-corruption vigilantes \u2013 which is unlikely to be welcomed by political leaders. Nor should they offer ethical \u2018seals of approval\u2019 to leaders, parties, agencies or private interests.

It may be better therefore to focus initially on a few specific areas. The Report has identified three areas to consider \u2013 the police, social services, and natural resources. Naturally specific priori- ties will depend very much on national circumstances. From a human development perspective, however one priority is clear: governments should be seeking ways of reducing the forms of corruption that hit the poor the hardest \u2013 in health and education services, for example. Another priority should be to root out corruption within police forces and the justice system since this can pave the way for dealing with corruption elsewhere. With the growing international recognition on degradation of the environ- ment and climate change, there is little time to lose in preserving our natural resources. These need prioritized attention before it is too late, especially where this is the backbone of livelihood for the poor. An Ag An Ag An Ag An Ag An Agenda for Action enda for Action enda for Action enda for Action enda for Action Although the appropriate measures for tackling corruption will depend on national circumstances, there are a number of common options: successes, as in the Philippines and India, for example, have often been in monitoring public works. In a number of countries, such as Cambodia, NGOs have mobilized public support for anti-corruption efforts. Both media and civil society organizations can thus keep up the pressure on politicians and public services and hold them to account. If they have the benefit of a supportive political environment, they can amplify and reinforce a government\u2019s own commitment. Seizing the Moment Seizing the Moment Seizing the Moment Seizing the Moment Seizing the Moment Governments and civil society are thus finding new ways to drive out corruption, working both from the bottom up and the top down. National political imperatives are being reinforced by international economic pres- sures. Asia\u2019s largest corporations are now global players and thus have to meet global standards, not just in the quality of their goods and services but in the way they produce them. That includes the influence of corruption, particularly in the extraction of natural resources. Consumers want environ- mentally \u2018clean\u2019 products \u2013 not those pro- duced by logging or mineral extraction companies working hand in hand with corrupt administrations. This combination of national and inter- national pressures is creating fresh opportu- nities across Asia and the Pacific. How can the countries of the region best seize the moment? There is no one route or single answer. Action has to come from many directions \u2013 from governments, civil society organizations, the media and private business working together. Much of this involves the pursuit of justice and retribution. However, anti- corruption campaigns can also be viewed in a more positive light. There are also huge political and economic dividends on offer.

Nor should they. Just as most countries are designing targeted policies and programmes to eliminate poverty and meet the other Millennium Development Goals, so they can devise programmes specifically to tackle corruption.

In this light, anti-corruption measures are not just about prevention or punishment. They are also about establishing fairer societies. The history of corruption does not have to be the region\u2019s destiny. One cannot conceal problems forever.

They can see the damaging effects of it in the form of weak- ened national institutions, inequitable social services, and blatant injustice in the courts, along with widespread economic inefficiency and unchecked environmental exploitation. It is also evident that corruption hits the poor hardest, who often depend heavily upon public services and the natural environment and are least able to pay bribes for services that should be theirs by right. There are signs of growing support for anti-corruption action today. Responding to public concern, governments want to be seen to fight corruption, not enable it. Civil society too is working to make the public and private sectors more accountable. Media are more aggressively exposing corruption. Popular anger against corruption, real or perceived, has also been utilized to destabilize elected governments, with unfortunate consequences for democratic governance. There is also greater international com- mitment. This is evident in the 2005 United Nations Convention Against Corruption, which is the first global legally binding anti- corruption instrument and requires members to implement its far-reaching reforms. Towards the end of 2007, 140 governments had signed the Convention and 104 had Corruption is by no means a new phenomenon in the Asia-Pacific region but nowadays it is coming under much closer scrutiny. While corruption may be difficult to pin down and measure, there is little doubt that it is pervasive, ranging from petty corruption to grand corruption to \u2018state capture\u2019 \u2013 all of which errode trust in government and business and discriminate harshly against the poor. ratified or acceded it. Recognizing the com- plexity of the issue, the Convention stresses a cross-border approach based on cooperation involving governments, civil society and the private sector to fight corruption. It promotes a five-pronged anti-corruption strategy \u2013 prevention, criminalization, international cooperation, asset recovery and mechanisms for implementation. Till now attention on corruption has con- centrated more on its effects on economic growth and the business climate and less on the impact on human development \u2013 on the ways in which bribery and graft siphon off scarce national resources and weaken govern- ments\u2019 abilities to deliver public services and protect the interests of the poor. There has also been less attention to the ways in which corruption affects the livelihoods of poor households and frustrates many of their own efforts to improve their lives. The result, as Amartya Sen repeatedly points out, is a reduction in the capabilities of large segments of the population.1 One might think that corruption is a problem that will eventually go away \u2013 per- haps owing to rapid development and im- provements in living standards along with more efficient and effective government.

Social norms are difficult to ignore in identifying corruption. And norms tend to have local variants, their plurality leaving space open for interpretation. The differences are not limited to cross-coun- try variations; there are, equally, differences within a country as well.4 A further complication arises when norms are not universally held even in local contexts.5 Under such circum- stances, whose norms should receive primacy remains an open question. Corruption often constitutes a divergence between a stated position and actual intent. Sources: Gampat 2007a; Rajivan 2007b. Corruption can take on many forms ranging from the gross to the subtle, some of which are not widely understood dangers of corruption. The countries of the Asia-Pacific region need therefore, not just to uproot corruption now, but also build institu- tions and processes that could help keep a lid on it on a continual basis for the future as well. What is Corruption? What is Corruption? What is Corruption? What is Corruption? What is Corruption? Corruption is commonly defined as the \u2018mis- use of entrusted power for private gain\u2019 (Box 1.1). Note that this does not restrict the potential for corruption to only the govern- ment. Individuals in private companies in privileged positions may take bribes to pro- vide goods or services that are in short supply. The definition is, however, limited since it portrays corruption as a one-way process driven by the greed of corrupt offi- cials. In fact, almost all corrupt transactions have two players \u2013 the person who is receiv- ing the bribe and the corporation or individual who is offering it. Moreover, the balance of power is not necessarily on the side of the corrupt person with \u2018entrusted power\u2019, since outside influences can serve to overwhelm weak and ineffective administrations.2 Some acts of corruption involve coercion \u2013 a demand for a bribe, for example, or extor- tion. This tends to happen in secret but may also become public if the victim protests. Oth- ers involve collusion between the corrupt offi- cial and the corruptors \u2013 a premeditated meeting of minds that is harder to detect as both parties have an interest in concealment. Corruption can take on many forms ranging from the gross to the subtle, some of which are not widely understood. The phenomenon is thus difficult to capture in a single defini- tion or measure.

The principals want to ensure that a particular service or activity is delivered to clients, but since they are not in a position to do everything themselves, they will employ agents to work on their behalf. In govern- ment, the principals can be elected officials who represent the state and its citizens and employ a wide range of public servants \u2013 from tax officials, to labour inspectors, to teachers BOX 1.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF CORRUPTION Corruption is such a complex phenomenon that attempting a universal definition of it is fraught with difficulties.

This is the most common form of corruption. It can be initiated by a person who seeks or solic- its bribes or by a person who offers and then pays bribes. The \u2018benefit\u2019 in bribery can be virtually any inducement: money and valuables, company shares, inside information, sexual or other favours, entertainment, employment or, indeed, the mere promise of incentives. The conduct for which the bribe is paid can be active \u2013 the exertion of administrative or political influence \u2013 or it can be passive \u2013 the overlooking of some offence or obligation. Bribes can be paid individually on a case-by-case basis or as part of a continuing basis. Embezzlement, theft and fraud. In the context of corruption, these all involve the taking or conversion of money, property or valuables by an individual who is not entitled to them but, by virtue of his or her position or employment, has access to them. In the case of embezzlement and theft, the property is taken by someone to whom it was entrusted. Fraud, however, consists of the use of false or misleading information to induce the owner of the property to relinquish it voluntarily. For example, an official who takes and sells part of a relief donation or a shipment of food or medical supplies would be committing theft or embezzlement; an official who induces an aid agency to oversupply aid by misrepresenting the number of people in need of it, is committing fraud. An ordinary bystander, on the other hand, who steals aid packages from a truck is committing theft but not corruption. That is why the term \u2018embezzlement\u2019 essentially means the theft of property by someone to whom it was entrusted. Extortion. This relies on coercion, such as the use or threat of violence or the exposure of damaging information, to induce cooperation. Officials in a position to initiate or conduct crimi- nal prosecution or punishment often use the threat of pros- ecution or punishment as a basis for extortion. While extor- tion can be committed by government officials or insiders, such officials can also be victims of it. For example, an official can extort corrupt payments in exchange for a favour or a person seeking a favour can extort it from the official by making threats. In some cases, extortion may differ from brib- ery only in the degree of coercion involved. A doctor may solicit a bribe for seeing a patient quickly but if an appoint- ment is a matter of medical necessity, the \u2018bribe\u2019 can be more properly characterized as \u2018extortion\u2019. Abuse of discretion. For example, an official responsible for government contracting may exercise the discretion to pur- chase goods or services from a company in which he or she holds a personal interest or propose real estate developments that will increase the value of personal property. Such abuse is often associated with bureaucracies where there is broad individual discretion and few oversight or accountability struc- tures, or where decision-making rules are so complex that they neutralize the effectiveness of any accountability struc- tures that do exist. Favouritism, nepotism and clientelism. This generally involves abuse of discretion. Such abuses, however, are governed not by the self-interest of an official but the interests of someone linked to him or her through membership of a family, political party, tribe, religious or other group. If an individual bribes an official to hire him or her, the official acts in self-interest. If a corrupt official hires a relative, he or she acts in ex- change for the less tangible benefit of advancing the interests of family or the specific relative involved (nepotism). Conduct creating or exploiting conflicting interests. Most forms of corruption involve the creation or exploitation of some con- flict between the professional responsibilities of a corrupt in- dividual and his or her private interests. The acceptance of a bribe creates such a conflict of interest. Most cases of em- bezzlement, theft or fraud involve an individual yielding to temptation and taking undue advantage of a conflict of inter- est that already exists. Improper political contributions.

Without holding posts with potential bribery income, how can women become \u2018receivers\u2019? In Bangladesh, for example, only 20 per cent of Civil Service cadre officers are female. Similarly, without access to substantial assets and to incomes, how can women equally be \u2018givers\u2019? As workplaces become more feminized and women take leadership jobs it cannot be assumed that women will be less corrupt. On the other hand, gender may influence the impact of corruption. Women are, for example, at risk of extortion for sexual favours instead of cash much more frequently than men. And when positions, grades, and diplomas can be bought, girls are less likely to benefit. Women, with less cash at their disposal are more likely to lose out. Finally, the funds allocated for women\u2019s development may be more easily stolen if women are less aware of their rights and less willing to demand accountability.

Citizens who need services may have no option but to pay \u2013 what is referred to as \u2018needs-based\u2019 corruption or \u2018survival\u2019 corruption clients. Typically, they know far more about the administration or the business than either the principal or the client \u2013 a situation of \u2018asym- metric information\u2019 \u2013 and can exploit their position as go-betweens to act more in their own interest, commonly through bribery, extortion, fraud, nepotism or embezzlement. Grand and Petty Corruption Grand and Petty Corruption Grand and Petty Corruption Grand and Petty Corruption Grand and Petty Corruption Within government, corruption can take many forms, at many levels (Box 1.2). The commonest distinction is between \u2018grand corruption\u2019 and \u2018petty corruption\u2019. In grand corruption sums are large and agents are typi- cally high-level politicians or officials who collude with corporations by, for example, accepting bribes from contractors. This is especially prevalent in periods of rapid eco- nomic growth when there are many new opportunities for investment in infrastruc- ture, for example, or in the extraction of natural resources. In these circumstances, decisions are often taken secretly and quickly and with little effective oversight. But even in normal circumstances many areas of govern- ment activity such as arms supplies are shrouded in secrecy and are vulnerable to grand corruption. Petty corruption, on the other hand, also referred to as \u2018street\u2019 or \u2018retail\u2019 corruption, involves transactions that are smaller but usually more frequent. It generally involves agents or sub-agents demanding or accepting \u2018speed money\u2019 to issue licenses, for example, or to provide access to schools, hospitals or water supplies. Unlike grand corruption, petty corruption often thrives during periods of weak economic growth at times when goods and services are in short supply \u2013 though the agents can also deliberately create shortages by raising additional bureaucratic hurdles. Petty corruption also has a more direct im- pact on the poor. Citizens who need services may have no option but to pay \u2013 what is referred to as \u2018needs-based\u2019 corruption or \u2018survival\u2019 corrup- tion. Some may take the initiative in offering bribes in order to gain privileged access or to jump queues. The poor, however, with the BOX 1.3 VIRTUOUS WOMEN, CORRUPT MEN?

Areas of Ambiguity Areas of Ambiguity Areas of Ambiguity Areas of Ambiguity Areas of Ambiguity Although many acts of corruption, whether grand or petty, are clear enough, there can also be areas of uncertainty between accept- able and unacceptable behaviour. These include: Legality and illegality. Acts that many people would regard as corrupt need not necessarily be illegal. Until a few years ago it was quite legal for companies based in OECD countries to bribe officials in other countries. Only recently has this become a crime in the company\u2019s home country. On the other hand, there are many illegal acts which do not involve corruption. A government official who steals a car in the street is guilty of theft, but if he or she acquires it by abusing their privi- leged position in the administration, then this constitutes corruption. Ethics of survival. In many Asia-Pacific coun- tries people engage in what might be called \u2018survival corruption\u2019 in order to meet basic needs. Faced with poverty and shortages they will do whatever is needed to support them- selves and their families. Members of poor or marginalized groups might, for example, steal water or electricity in collusion with a local lines-man, or bribe a petty official to falsify an address to make them eligible for a ration card. Private and public. In many countries across Asia and in smaller states in the Pacific, where there are strong notions of hierarchy, it is con- sidered right to make payments to those in authority as a way of showing respect. In these cases the public-private interface is ill- defined. Power is seen to reside not in offices or institutions but in the persons of high offi- cials, and lines of authority are drawn not from one function to another but from one person to another. These lines are further blurred when public officials have ties with certain groups of citizens based on ethnicity, religion, or language and may tend to favour them, even if they do not have any direct fi- nancial gain. Gift giving. When is a gift a bribe? In many societies across Asia and the Pacific, daily transactions and social networking commonly involve gifts, typically consumable items such as food. Indeed in many Pacific countries not giving a gift can be seen as corruption. In re- cent times, however, traditional systems of governance have been combined with \u2018intro- duced\u2019 systems and as the two interplay, gift- giving has been extended to non-consumable items such as land. This manipulation of the practice of gift giving has often led to the jus- tification of corrupt acts. However it can be argued that in most cases both the \u2018givers\u2019 and the \u2018takers\u2019 know when the lines are being crossed and a supposed gift is actually a bribe for a specific favour. Lobbying. Many developed countries, frown upon bribery yet allow high-powered lobby- ists to bombard public officials with one-sided information and arguments. The lobbyists do not provide cash but offer free \u2018services\u2019 such as research and information with the inten- tion of biasing lawmaking or awarding of contracts in their favour. Lavishly funded lob- bying can be considered as a form of corrup- tion. State capture. This refers to a situation where private interest has effectively taken over cer- tain state functions, a type of corruption gen- erally less understood by the public or by the media. One example is when an international mining company is largely determining the contours of a country\u2019s mining policy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68f3a94a-cb90-430b-9668-52baabf3a5ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "68f3a94a-cb90-430b-9668-52baabf3a5ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08a5bbe1a1936ded32662b4e1e76bf53921879ee02cb9ac0908bc9bdbe3dc745"}, "2": {"node_id": "02713b9a-315f-4ee4-909a-a16f90d6d9a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c817f738f39fd96c4173cd2834330325c44f36b322c1cf31989170860a2a28a2"}}, "hash": "b416815675488caa6039155e3701386e4578c2f69caf65b68ede617f04c926f7", "text": "Cor- ruptors who have achieved state capture do Traditional systems of governance have been combined with \u2018introduced\u2019 systems ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 22 22 22 22 22 nance of certain sports has given sports official\u2019s diplomatic statuses and other absolute privileges making them less accountable and more susceptible to corruption.

Many of the exposures of corruption in sport have been the result of tireless work by investigative journalists and organizations dedicated to ensuring fairness in sport. Interna- tional sports organizations have also been making determined efforts. FIFA, for example, has recently introduced an ethics commissions and created a commercial firm called \u2018Early Warning System\u2019 and the ICC now has an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit \u2013 approaches that could be emulated by other sporting bodies. Sources: BBC, 2007; FIFA.com 2007; ICC n.d.; Poroznuk and Pfeifer 2006; Transparency International 2006b. Corruption is intrinsically bound up with social norms and practices not simply take the institutions as given but also seek to shape them: they are thus \u2018makers\u2019 rather than \u2018takers\u2019. Companies often achieve this through corrupt and illegal practices \u2013 for example, by bribing law- makers to adjust legislation in their favour, so that their subsequent activity may now be legal but is actually corrupt. This can be termed \u2018legal corruption\u2019.6 Corruption is thus intrinsically bound up with social norms and practices.7 Indeed, some people argue that it is not something to which countries in the region should respond \u2013 that efforts to combat corruption involve imposing Western or developed country biases on very different societies. In this context, however, it is important to distinguish between cultural pluralism and cultural rela- tivism. Cultural pluralism acknowledges that traditional practices are different and that these differences will affect the forms of corruption, but it is nevertheless consistent with an underlying set of universal principles that would condemn corruption. Cultural relativism, on the other hand, would say that it is impossible to apply values across traditional practice systems; each country has to work out its own prin- ciples of right and wrong \u2013 including those on corruption. A related issue is cultural deter- minism which asserts that certain traditional practices are innately more prone to corrup- tion. Some studies have indeed found evidence for the fact that traditional practices do matter but they do not show that some are destined for corruption or are likely to be more tolerant of it.8 A Scour A Scour A Scour A Scour A Scourggggge thr e thr e thr e thr e through the Ag ough the Ag ough the Ag ough the Ag ough the Ages es es es es Corruption is certainly not a new phenom- enon.

But at the professional level, many sports such as cricket, rugby and football are extremely lucrative multi-billion dollar enterprises and sports bodies such as the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the International Cricket Council (ICC) are accorded statuses similar to those of governments. However, this boom has come at a price and Transparency International argues that commercialization of sport has promoted opportunism for \u2018dirty business\u2019 to thrive. FIFA and the ICC have taken some action to monitor irregularities, although there is a lot more to do. In the Asia-Pacific region one of the most popular sports is cricket, which in the last decade has been marred by match- fixing and bribery scandals that have caused major players to leave the game in shame. At the administrative level senior officials have been sacked for using their authority for per- sonal gain and entire boards have been dissolved.

The statesman and philosopher Kautilya, for example, wrote in the fourth century BC about the King\u2019s servants who were skimming off a part of his revenue. \u2018Just as it is impossible not to taste honey or poison that one may find at the tip of one\u2019s tongue, so it is impossible for one deal- ing with government funds not to taste, at least a little bit, of the King\u2019s wealth.\u20199 Kautilya went on to suggest that it is difficult, though not impossible, to stop government officials from hiding their corrupt take. There are different versions of the same saying all over the ancient empires of the world. And many of the solutions advocated today, such as raising the salary of officials or improving records of property rights and tax liabilities have also been advocated since time immemorial. Among all the ancient empires, China came closest to organizing a centralized and effectively managed bureaucracy \u2013 with all the requirements for bringing corruption to heel: political commitment from the Emperor; a system of pay and benefits for the scholar gentry; a moral-ethical code provided by Confucian doctrine that emphasized order and hierarchy; a system of audits and inspec- tion; and, by no means least, harsh punish- ments for disobedience. Nevertheless, corruption remained a per- sistent problem. The Emperor Yongzheng (1723\u201335), for example, concluded that the tax system was full of abuses and that local financial clerks had been accepting payoffs to exempt wealthy families from nearly all their tax obligations. He responded with a series of reforms, including improving financial records of provincial authorities, carrying out special inspections and increasing the salaries of local officials through a bonus called yang-lien \u2018money to nourish honesty\u2019. Similar problems were evident in most other countries in Asia and beyond. Until the nineteenth and early twentieth century, many of the now developed countries were riddled with corruption. In some, for example, much of the public funding for basic services such as street cleaning and construction was diverted through kickbacks. Since then, matters have improved considerably; never- theless it took some of these countries almost a century to reform. One way of following this slow process, for example, is to track the steady decline in mentions of \u2018corruption\u2019 or \u2018fraud\u2019 in dailies (Figure 1.1). The figure shows that corruption declined over a period (long) as captured by reporting, controlling for space given for political reporting. National reporting (The New York Times) is corroborated by small town and city report- ing (Ancestry.com).10 ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 24 24 24 24 24 Asia, on the other hand, provides several cases of countries that have managed to reduce corruption much more swiftly.

Then in June 1960 the People\u2019s Action Party introduced the Prevention of Corruption Act, which enhanced the powers of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.

A Challeng A Challeng A Challeng A Challeng A Challenge for International Or e for International Or e for International Or e for International Or e for International Orggggganizations anizations anizations anizations anizations The past 60 years or so have seen a consider- able increase in the number and scope of international organizations. Nor surprisingly, these too have proved vulnerable to corrup- tion and have had to re-examine their methods of operation so as to achieve greater transparency and accountability, confronting malfeasance head-on and improving manage- ment. This is vital if they are to fulfil the goals of partners, staff and donors, and above all the beneficiaries. This has involved, for example, tighten- ing up many policies and practices, strength- ening ombudsman offices, requiring senior staff to disclose their assets and liabilities, increasing legal protection for whistleblowers, and introducing independent audit offices. Agencies are also publishing more informa- tion through websites and other media. They have added to this impetus for reform through the formation of staff associations and institutions such as \u2018town hall meetings\u2019 in which they can air their grievances to the management.13 Measuring the Problem Measuring the Problem Measuring the Problem Measuring the Problem Measuring the Problem Just as it is difficult to define corruption across different cultures and political envi- ronments, it is also very difficult to measure its extent. One might consider, for example, the amount of money being lost, but this misses out the number of people involved. And both the money value and the number of people miss out on the social loss in under- mining institutions. And in either case, since corruption is generally illegal and clandestine, it is hard to track it directly. Instead, the most common measures work indirectly, based not on registering specific corrupt acts but people\u2019s perceptions of the extent of corruption. One of the most widely cited examples is the \u2018Corruption Perception Index\u2019 (CPI) produced by Trans- parency International (TI).14 Since 1995 TI has been collecting the ratings of business people and country analysts and averaging them into a single index. By 2007 the CPI covered 180 countries and appeared as a widely publicized league table which regularly Singapore and Hong Kong had the advantages of being city territories but probably the most important reason for their success was strong political will CHAPTER 1: THE SCOURGE OF CORRUPTION THE SCOURGE OF CORRUPTION THE SCOURGE OF CORRUPTION THE SCOURGE OF CORRUPTION THE SCOURGE OF CORRUPTION 25 25 25 25 25 listed several Asian countries as among the world\u2019s most corrupt. Since 2003, TI has supplemented the CPI with the Global Corruption Barometer which is based on a Gallup International Poll that explores the is- sues in greater detail, considering not just per- ception, but also direct experience, and by 2006 covered 62 countries. Another widely used source, produced since 1996 by the World Bank, is the Control of Corruption Index (CCI). Although its title suggests that it is measuring the effectiveness of measures to control corruption it is, in fact, another perception index. It does however differ in a number of respects from the CPI. It gathers data from a wider range of sources than the CPI and also covers petty and grand corruption as well as situations of state cap- ture. In addition, the CCI uses different statis- tical techniques that make it better suited for comparisons across countries and over time. While interpreting the CCI, it should be noted that it combines perceptions and observed data. Other sources of corruption rankings include those from private consultancies designed to offer businesses and investors an indication of the investment climate in each country. The International Country Risk Guide, for example, includes subjective assess- ments conducted by staff on the \u2018likeliness to demand illegal payments in high and low levels of government\u2019. These indices do indeed provide some in- formation of relevance and spur countries into responding. But they may not give a very accurate reflection of the actual situation and make little attempt to gauge the pressures and the effects on the poor. Mostly they are ori- ented towards businesses though they may also be used by donors to make decisions on the distribution of foreign aid. They can also be useful at the regional level for comparative purposes \u2013 for which this report will use the CCI index. Another approach would be to compare each country\u2019s vulnerability to cor- ruption by considering factors such as the size of the public sector, or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4bb7575-fc0a-47ca-9ec1-5330f597482a": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4bb7575-fc0a-47ca-9ec1-5330f597482a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cfbcae78eb3b1b601753ea4667fb699725348c7cf255cc71498d8d8bef37908"}, "3": {"node_id": "71495c45-052b-408b-a870-b34e66bde13f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55226625a85056bc0a4f1d40b0a32e03121ed4abf6456a15d304cf2a1814d9c9"}}, "hash": "b3ddde0ddb27b4bc15483982405a137504be36fa3fdc4d82516f6569ed65aa30", "text": "marginal tax rates (Box 1.5). But ultimately, no single metric would work in uniquely measuring the phe- nomenon. Forms of Government Forms of Government Forms of Government Forms of Government Forms of Government History has demonstrated that all forms of government are vulnerable to corruption but some may be more vulnerable than others. It might be argued, for example, that, authori- tarian leaders, such as Chinese emperors, would have found it easier to deal with corrup- tion because they can act against corrupt offi- cials quickly and ruthlessly without the need for prolonged and uncertain judicial processes. On the other hand, authoritarian leaders may also deliberately foster a more corrupt envi- ronment as a result of what has been called the \u2018dictator\u2019s dilemma\u2019: the more power a dictator has the more insecure he feels, so he distributes opportunities for \u2018rent gathering\u2019 and other favours as ways of building sup- port and trust. Similar considerations can apply in demo- cratic systems. Democracies are better designed to control corruption since citizens can take advantage of regular elections to vote out corrupt politicians, but the quality of democracy determines if this mechanism is actually exercised. Democracies can also be susceptible to corruption if politicians become beholden to wealthy donors on whom they rely for electoral funds and who will expect favours in return. This popular disillusion- ment has recently led to the overthrow of many democratically elected regimes on the explicit grounds of corruption, such as in Bangladesh, Fiji and Thailand. One way of checking which system is cleaner in practice is to compare the indices of corruption with those of democracy. This History has demonstrated that all forms of government are vulnerable to corruption; democracies are better designed to control corruption since citizens can take advantage of regular elections to vote out corrupt politicians ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 26 26 26 26 26 BOX 1.5 COUNTRY VULNERABILITY TO CORRUPTION Most popular measures of corruption are based, at least in part, on perception. Another approach might be to chart the \u2018climate\u2019 for corruption by identifying factors that may make a country vulnerable to corruption. This Report makes a mod- depending upon the country context. A more detailed discus- sion of these indicators is given in Technical note 2. is illustrated in Figure 1.2 which plots the Control of Corruption Index against an index produced by the Economist Intelligence Unit which rates countries along a scale from 0 (authoritarian regimes) to 10 (full democ- racy). On this basis, countries at the highest ranking on the democracy scale tend also to be high on control of corruption, though there are some outliers, such as Bhutan, Hong Kong (SAR), China and Singapore, which appear to have done exceptionally well in controlling corruption. The pattern is similar within the sample of developing countries and also within developed countries. This is, of course, only a correlation. It does not indicate whether democracy itself est start in this direction by trying to identify likely factors and seeking out appropriate, observable indicators on which data are available.

On the other hand, the region appears to enjoy some of the world\u2019s least corrupt monarchies. This perspective is confirmed by many cross-country and multivariate analyses which show that that corruption is The more experience a country has with democracy, the better it can address corruption helps reduce corruption. However there have been efforts to explore causality. Treisman (2000), for example, using data from 64 countries, suggest that there is a connection, but he ascribes this not just to the current degree of democracy but to the length of time a democratic system has been in place: the more experience a country has with democ- racy, the better it can address corruption. This implies that in the short term compared with more authoritarian states, young democ- racies such as Cambodia, Indonesia, or the Philippines may have little advantage. But in the long term, when these countries have ac- cumulated more experience with democratic institutions and improve the quality of their democratic practice, they would be able to address corruption more effectively. Parliamentary and Presidential Systems Parliamentary and Presidential Systems Parliamentary and Presidential Systems Parliamentary and Presidential Systems Parliamentary and Presidential Systems There are, of course, many different shades and types of democracy. One of the clearest distinctions is between parliamentary and presidential systems. The Asia-Pacific region is distinct from the rest of the world in that it has a lower proportion of presidential or semi- presidential systems. In the rest of the world 55 per cent of states have these systems. In the Asia-Pacific region, on the other hand, only 27 per cent of countries do so; 58 per cent have parliamentary systems, the rest being monarchies or one-party states (Figure 1.3). How do the different systems rate on the CCI? This is illustrated in Figure 1.4, which shows that the region\u2019s democracies tend to do better, achieving a simple average score of 0.1 compared with presidential and semi- presidential systems which get scores of \u20130.7 and \u20130.4 respectively. Somewhat surpris- ingly, the presidential and semi-presidential systems in Asia and the Pacific do not per- form significantly better than one-party sys- tems, which have a score of \u20131.1.

One way to assess this would be to compare control of corruption with the extent of decentralization as indicated by the share of national expenditure administered at sub-national levels. As Figure 1.5 shows, this does not indicate any correlation. Indeed a number of studies that have attempted to assess the effects of decentralization on corruption have come up with mixed results.18 So although many governments are keen on decentralization as a means of achiev- ing more effective governance, the benefits for the control of corruption remain unproven.

This is compiled from opinion surveys that ask people to rate the level of corruption in seven important aspects of their everyday lives, on a scale from 1 (not at all corrupt) to 5 (extremely corrupt). The results for the Asia-Pacific region are shown in Figure 1.6. Overall, people clearly have least confi- dence in the honesty of the police, followed by the judiciary and tax offices \u2013 though higher or supreme courts are considered relatively clean. Education and medical services rank in the middle of the scale, while the least corrupt sectors are utilities and registry or permit services \u2013 although even here levels of corruption are still very high. But as Figure 1.6 also shows, in each of the seven sectors it seems that ordinary people are best served by parliamentary sys- tems. Of the other systems, the presidential ones perform better than semi-presidential ones, though in both cases the perceived rates of corruption are not only higher but vary considerably across sectors. Hampering Economic Performance Hampering Economic Performance Hampering Economic Performance Hampering Economic Performance Hampering Economic Performance Another matter of great concern is whether corruption affects economic performance. This will be difficult to prove one way or the other since economic growth is clearly the outcome of many different factors \u2013 up to 40 factors have in different studies been identi- fied as having an effect on economic growth.19 Generally they appear to be detrimental to economic growth, but there can be exceptions. For instance, it may not appear to harm growth in countries which are in the process of modernization.20 Furthermore, the effects may only surface in the long term. For example, corruption may discourage innova- tion, or divert funds from productivity- enhancing investments towards those that offer more opportunities for rent-seeking. Can Corruption Boost Growth? Can Corruption Boost Growth? Can Corruption Boost Growth? Can Corruption Boost Growth? Can Corruption Boost Growth? One way in which corruption might be thought to help economic performance is by \u2018greasing the wheels\u2019, i.e. allowing businesses to get quicker decisions, cutting through red tape and thus operate more efficiently.

They could therefore simply award the contract to whoever offers the biggest bribe \u2013 effectively holding an auction in which the contract goes to the company that places the highest valuation. This might be one way of achieving \u2018allocative efficiency\u2019, but this assumes that the person offering the biggest bribe also is the most talented entrepreneur with the best project, which is often not the case. Bribery might also be seen as a way to increase efficiency by allowing queuing and rationing systems to work more effectively, on the assumption that the person or company prepared to pay most is also the one that can make the best use of the services. Indeed overall queuing times could be reduced if payments induce bureaucrats to work more rapidly.22 Even if this were the case, however, capacity to pay seldom coincides with real need, so there will be a strong element of injustice. A more fundamental objection to the \u2018grease\u2019 hypothesis is that it assumes a static environment in which businesses are faced with a bad and unchanging bureaucratic environment. It is more probable, however that businesses are sustaining this situation by their willingness and capacity to offer bribes \u2013 encouraging bureaucrats to increase their rigidity and unreel yet more red tape. Indeed in circumstances of rampant corrup- tion, even honest officials will tend to become more bureaucratic \u2013 not because they want to extract bribes but because they do not want to be held individually responsible for any decision where they could be accused of taking bribes. Moreover, for every case where corrup- tion is suggested as a way of increasing effi- ciency there are always cleaner courses of action that perform at least as well or better. The fear that eliminating corruption will lead to a loss in efficiency is clearly unfounded. How Corruption could Hamper Growth? How Corruption could Hamper Growth? How Corruption could Hamper Growth? How Corruption could Hamper Growth? How Corruption could Hamper Growth? On the other hand, it is also possible to iden- tify many more mechanisms through which corruption could hamper growth: Allocation of talent. Economic activity will cer- tainly be hampered if people can earn more by working as corrupt bureaucrats than as entrepreneurs. Corruption thus distorts the allocation of talent by steering people to less productive or unproductive sectors. In the end, this leads to a downward spiral that even affects the income of corrupt officials. If the productive sector shrinks and returns are low, payoffs too will tend to fall, leading to high corruption with no growth.23 Talent is also allocated to maximize family benefit through diversification, such as when one family member joins politics, another the bureaucracy and a third the private sector. This is often done to \u2018hedge\u2019 any risk involved in changing political circumstances, for example, when an opposing political party comes to power. Size of the formal sector. A corrupt system may also prevent entrepreneurs from moving from the informal to the formal sector. Entrepre- neurs who want to register their business may have to pay a high level of bribes to get the necessary documentation. If the informal sec- tor is less productive or the cost of doing busi- ness in the informal sector is very high, then long-run growth will be lower. However, if the cost of operation in the informal sector is low, bureaucratic corruption may not have any ef- fect on growth.24 Availability of public goods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c559d01-cf8c-4e4c-b72e-ecea77554700": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c559d01-cf8c-4e4c-b72e-ecea77554700", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44de3cd939b0fe99ba3021ca354c4164d86a64f4d5a27cb061c9d13a4f523f09"}, "2": {"node_id": "76411a25-8502-4fd2-966d-f97c8265efc2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2770329ab26b16d67e8b261847ed6b7c73c4ea29ee6bf90764fcb482581df5e8"}}, "hash": "5168e49ef1608569eb5fbcfba0ccd3a15d95b81c29d1af7731988ddf2fb9bff6", "text": "Economic growth rates also depend on the level of government- provided public goods.25 Corruption can af- fect these in several ways.

Corruption is likely to hamper innovation.26 This is because innovators when starting from scratch tend to have greater need for government-produced goods and services and also have riskier projects that are vulnerable to bureaucratic delays. So even if corruption does not slow down invest- ment or production in the short term, by deterring innovation it can have serious implications for long-term growth. Empirical Results Empirical Results Empirical Results Empirical Results Empirical Results In principle therefore corruption is likely to slow economic growth, and a number of empirical studies have indeed suggested that higher levels of corruption are associated with lower levels of growth \u2013 though the correlation is weaker in Asia than else- where.27 One, for example, concludes that a 10 per cent increase in corruption perception, would lead to a 2.8 per cent reduction in growth rate in Africa, and 2.6 per cent in Latin America but only 1.7 per cent in Asia.28 This reduction in growth results to some extent from reducing investment29 but mainly from undermining political stability which in one study accounted for around two- thirds of the effect of corruption on growth.30 This suggests that corruption will have less effect on growth in countries with strong governments. The link between corruption and growth can also depend on the size of the country.31 Corruption may seem less damaging to growth in larger countries. In East Asia a number of large countries with high perceived levels of corruption have also sustained high levels of economic growth. This may be linked to market size since investors may be willing to accept the risks posed by corrup- tion if they are offset by the potential of a large consumer market. Growth rates seem to have been slower in smaller countries \u2013 with the exception of city states where anti- corruption efforts have been successful. Another factor is the way in which corruption is organized.32 Many people have argued that corruption is less harmful to growth when it is predictable \u2013 when, for example, a strong but corrupt ruler demands for himself and his entourage a standard percentage on all major activities. This might explain why many Asian countries have sus- tained rapid growth despite high levels of corruption \u2013 compared with other regions like Africa, where corruption is thought to be more disorganized. One study using a World Bank dataset confirmed that investment boosts productivity even at high levels of corruption. However, it also found that as the level of corruption rose it also becomes less predictable, so it would be wrong to believe that corruption can always be safely managed.33 Corruption will also have a less corrosive effect on the economy if corrupt politicians and officials work with a long-time horizon and deliver genuine benefits to the payers of bribes. During the 1980s and 1990s in a number of East Asian states, politicians established long-term relationships with capitalists; in exchange for bribes and kick- backs they provided valuable promotional privileges. In other countries where officials extracted bribes in a less predictable fashion and offered fewer real benefits growth tended to be slower.34 In addition to comparing the experience of different countries it might also be possible to look at groups of countries in Asia Pacific region and see if changes over time in the ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 32 32 32 32 32 Figure 1.7: Control of Corruption Index and GDP Growth Figure 1.7: Control of Corruption Index and GDP Growth Figure 1.7: Control of Corruption Index and GDP Growth Figure 1.7: Control of Corruption Index and GDP Growth Figure 1.7: Control of Corruption Index and GDP Growth Note: GDP growth in the figure is the annual per cent change of GDP at constant 2000 prices.

For some of the most dynamic economies of the region this provides only eight observations, some of which were during the Asian finan- cial crisis, when the economic and political environment was in rapid flux. Certainly there does not seem to be any correlation for individual countries. Take the example of Bangladesh which according to the CCI ranking is one of the world\u2019s worst countries in terms of corruption control. Yet it has achieved steady growth which does not correlate with the level of the CCI; indeed, corruption has become worse according to this index (Figure 1.7). This experience may, however, be temporary in a country making the transition to a more free market economy.35 Yet, despite what high level of corruption might suggest, Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in certain social indicators such as in health (immunization rates and infant mortality) and gender equality in education. The vibrant NGO sector in the country, along with government, has been instrumental in these positive human development outcomes even though corruption is shown by the CCI to be extremely pervasive in Bangladesh. Even India, which has a middle ranking in the CCI, has seen significant fluctuations in economic growth at a time when percep- tions of corruption have been relatively stable. Similarly, for Malaysia, which is consistently ranked among the cleaner Asia-Pacific coun- tries, the growth and corruption outcomes seem unrelated: growth fluctuated between 1997 and 2002, though the perception of corruption scarcely changed. One can also put the growth-corruption link into some perspective by considering the rise first of China and now of India as star global economic performers. Could they have grown any faster in the absence of corruption? Indian economic growth was over 9 per cent in 2006 and that of China has been over 10 per cent over a prolonged period. Corruption may have hampered growth, but probably not much. It seems more likely that growth is constrained by other factors \u2013 such as world market demand, the rate of technological adaptation and the actions of global competi- tors. It can, however, be argued that even in these countries growth will eventually lead to systemic shocks \u2013 economic or political \u2013 which are less easy to manage in countries hampered by high levels of corruption. The Asian Financial Crisis The Asian Financial Crisis The Asian Financial Crisis The Asian Financial Crisis The Asian Financial Crisis The most dramatic case of corruption contributing to an economic implosion was the 1997 Asian financial crisis. By now the proximate causes of the crisis are well known \u2013 related to the premature liberalization of banks and capital markets in the absence of an adequate regulatory framework.

For long-term foreign investors this was too good an opportunity to miss. Faced with rising labour costs at home they were happy to take advantage of new technological possi- bilities by relocating and outsourcing to Asia. They were also reassured by the fact that their governments had anti-communist and defence alliances that reduced the likelihood of sudden changes of regime and nationaliza- tion of foreign assets, even in countries where the state remained a key player in economic decision-making. The resulting flood of foreign capital, much of it short term, combined with the ability of local firms to borrow cheaply off- shore in international capital markets created a dangerous but predictable bubble. As bubbles are prone to do, this one duly burst \u2013 and in spectacular style, starting with the nosedive of the Thai baht on 2 July 1997, and going on to rock the world capital markets, with tremors being felt as far away as Russia and Brazil. This was a crisis exacerbated by \u2018crony capitalism\u2019 which distorted the worth of companies. The value of many companies had less to do with economic fundamentals and more to do with their political connections. Those that had managed to build strong relationships with political leaders were able to procure special privileges and licences and protection against competitors. They also found it easier to get credit.

With prosperity based on firms that were well connected but inefficient, productivity inevitably declined. This created an unstable situation since political connections can suddenly snap. In Malaysia, for example, in the initial stages of the financial crisis, the politically connected firms were among the hardest hit \u2013 though when capital controls were instituted follow- ing the crisis, the position of these firms recovered, corresponding to an increase in the expected value of their political capital.36 Across the region, as the crisis continued, corruption also weakened governments\u2019 capacity to respond and to protect the poor. This was partly because money for social benefit programmes was stolen from public funds but also because social safety net programmes provided opportunities for corruption among local governments and officials and also allowed them to curry favour with local interest groups who were given priority over more deserving house- holds. Local politicians were also able to sell relief goods at rates above the subsidized prices, and keep the remaining funds. Corruption can therefore not only make coun- tries more vulnerable to crises but also reduce their capacity to handle such crises.

Empirical evidence shows that countries in the Asia-Pacific region perceived to have high levels of corruption also tend to have high marginal tax rates, both individual and corporate. And the situation is worse if they also have multiple, burdensome procedures. One effect of this is that raising tax rates can lead to a fall in net revenue, partly because of corruption or because high rates drive busi- nesses into the underground economy.41 The result is that enforcement costs also go up and net tax revenue goes down.

Countries in the region with higher levels of human development also demonstrate low perceived levels of corruption Corruption and Human Development Corruption and Human Development Corruption and Human Development Corruption and Human Development Corruption and Human Development While there has been fairly intensive study of the impact of corruption on economic growth, there has been less systematic research on its impact on human development. There are various channels through which corruption could cause damage. It is likely, for example, to corrode ideals of public service, so admin- istrations mired in corruption will also be those less interested in investing in health and education. But even if corrupt governments want to increase investment in social services, they will find that corruption has lowered economic growth and weakened tax collection, leaving them with less to spend on welfare programmes. Corruption is also likely to determine the character of public investment. Corrupt offi- cials are generally less attracted to small-scale projects which involve a large number of actors, and instead prefer to invest in large infrastructure projects that offer greater opportunities for collecting rents. This leads to imbalances in the pattern of public expen- diture \u2013 away from key public goods such as health, education and environmental protec- tion, and towards new roads or airports or military hardware.42 For example, they will prefer large infrastructure projects that are difficult to monitor and the purchase of mili- tary and high technology goods rather than ongoing expenditure on health and education. To get a better insight into the impact of corruption on the allocation of public expen- diture, one study conducted a cross-country regression for around 100 developing coun- tries for the period 1996\u20132001.43 This con- firmed that corruption reduced expenditure especially on education, health and social protection and affected the quality of services. Other studies attempted to demonstrate a more direct link with human development. One, using the transparency international corruption perception index and the human development index, concluded that corrup- tion does indeed lower human develop- ment.44 Others have looked at components of human development such as health care and education and demonstrated that corruption both raises the costs and reduces the quality of service and thus raises infant mortality and school drop-out rates.45 Further studies have similarly concluded that corruption reduces life expectancy and literacy.46 The overall picture is illustrated in Figure 1.9 which shows, as might be expected, that the countries in the region with higher levels of human development also demon- strate low perceived levels of corruption, as measured by the control of corruption index. A closer look also shows that both scores tend to move in the same direction over time, as illustrated in Figure 1.10 which plots the changes in human development over the period 1980 and 2004 against the changes in the CCI over the period 1996 to 2006, show- ing that an improvement in human develop- ment is associated with a significant boost in the control of corruption.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75e05213-c21d-419b-aeec-6321208b31e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "75e05213-c21d-419b-aeec-6321208b31e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb7506d998ed967068f98a0cfc6749cfbad2f76e0cf9c31fac151c83d847cacc"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7fc59b5-5a22-407c-b740-dd2771773d0f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "994beaee68923034feb28a96023ee097ac60ea19ce887ea438ed356a8b4ab029"}}, "hash": "f6c6812254d005e8d22f97ccfdaf0dbf1be4f5d1f88c30fcb8687eecdd48d93e", "text": "ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 36 36 36 36 36 Figure 1.10: Change in Human Development Index and the Control of Corruption Figure 1.10: Change in Human Development Index and the Control of Corruption Figure 1.10: Change in Human Development Index and the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8dbaa03c-1bee-40b0-bc19-645443226ee9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8dbaa03c-1bee-40b0-bc19-645443226ee9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d55b01e19eef1251e43a177fb4612a456bdff58032fab51e5aab7261b9a6a78"}, "3": {"node_id": "d40194e1-b856-4b8a-9db7-37b1b6038cb1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0945a3bed803c16c060b2da109d2f541b0bf85afab8261e575f85d5bac761e1"}}, "hash": "ff8148ee3a6090408f542ea0d1385875721fd6b02c70a8d87c05cc07924f1d0c", "text": "Control of Corruption Figure 1.10: Change in Human Development Index and the Control of Corruption Figure 1.10: Change in Human Development Index and the Control of Corruption Index Among the Low- and Medium-HDI Countries Index Among the Low- and Medium-HDI Countries Index Among the Low- and Medium-HDI Countries Index Among the Low- and Medium-HDI Countries Index Among the Low- and Medium-HDI Countries Sources: UNDP 2006; World Bank 2007b.

Present in both public and private sectors of the economy, corruption also has cross- border dimensions, which has become an issue with accelerating globalization. However, various international and regional conventions and agreements could mitigate the impact of cross-border factors that drive corruption. All three forms of corruption can be found in the public sector \u2013 petty, grand, and state capture. Petty corruption is widespread in poor countries where a large fraction of public services is delivered by the government \u2013 shortages, real or contrived, numerous gatekeepers and complex procedures create an incentive for corruption. The private sector, on the other hand, provides the space for grand and petty corruption. Depending upon the circumstance, cross-border dimensions of corruption can be linked to both sectors but the effect is the same: corruption becomes more entrenched. The most telling and direct effect is on growth via investment. While there might be some short-term benefit from grease-the-wheel corruption, the long-term effect on growth is negative. Growth, in turn, affects employment, inequality and government revenue. Constrained government revenue presents serious problems for the delivery of public services (health, education, water, electricity). Employment, inequality and delivery of public services are then linked to human development, which can also have an independent and direct effect on corruption. Source: Gampat 2007a. Again, however, this does not indicate causality. It could just as well be that higher levels of human development help combat corruption. The potential feedback links are illustrated in Figure 1.11. The most obvious channel through which higher levels of human development would reduce corruption is through better standards of education. Education empowers people to demand their rights and access to the services to which they are entitled, and also strength- ens their capacity to detect corrupt practices and speak out against them. The correlation between perceived corruption and secondary education is illustrated in Figure 1.12.

This has been confirmed, for example, in a global study which shows that corruption tends to slow the income growth for the bottom 20 per cent of the population.47 As with human development, corruption slows down poverty reduction by lowering growth rates and reducing the effec- tiveness of social programmes. There is not much systematic evidence but it is well known that many of the goods and services targeted for the poor do not actually reach them \u2013 instead finishing up in the hands of well-off and connected households who can afford to bribe the officials. The poor also lose out since they have less bargaining power when there is a general shortage of services, public or private. The rich and the powerful can get the best deals out of the existing stock either through bribery, good connections or access to the open-market. Thus while the poor are already excluded from various opportunities such as credit and insurance because of market imperfections, corruption erects a further barrier. In addition the poor also lose out when they pay bribes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d40194e1-b856-4b8a-9db7-37b1b6038cb1": {"__data__": {"id_": "d40194e1-b856-4b8a-9db7-37b1b6038cb1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d55b01e19eef1251e43a177fb4612a456bdff58032fab51e5aab7261b9a6a78"}, "2": {"node_id": "8dbaa03c-1bee-40b0-bc19-645443226ee9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff8148ee3a6090408f542ea0d1385875721fd6b02c70a8d87c05cc07924f1d0c"}}, "hash": "c0945a3bed803c16c060b2da109d2f541b0bf85afab8261e575f85d5bac761e1", "text": "In addition the poor also lose out when they pay bribes.

This chapter considers how this can undermine the position of the poor, both by harassing them and by denying them any means of redress. It also indicates ways in which the judicial system can be made more responsive and accountable. Chapter Three. Poor people encounter corrup- tion in a wide range of services. This chapter looks at health, education, water supply and electricity, showing how both grand and petty corruption reduce the funds available for investment in human development. Chapter Four. When money, food, or other materials change hands there is always the danger of \u2018leakage\u2019. This chapter looks at the potential for tighter control during \u2018special development situations\u2019 and when providing social safety nets for the poor. Chapter Five. Some of the largest bribes concern the exploitation of precious natural resources \u2013 from oil to minerals to forestry. In this case the influence of the corruptors can even amount to \u2018state capture\u2019.

Never- theless the police in all countries have the same core task: to protect citizens and provide them with security of life and per- sonal property against potential threats from others. The police also serve as guarantors of state power, defending the state against potential, large-scale violent action or challenges \u2013 as is evident in their presence at political demonstrations. Many of the officers carrying out these and other tasks are honest and conscientious \u2013 trying to enforce the law fairly and to protect citizens.

In the cities, the police can be in the pay of large corporations, colluding with politicians and business inter- ests, and may be used, for example, to force poor people off their land to make way for new developments. And the poorly paid lower constabulary, often living in slum-like condi- tions, with inadequate resources to carry out main responsibilities or satisfy demands of supervisions, may feel pressured to seek \u2018extra curricular\u2019 income. In some instances police officers may simply be working for themselves, extracting as much income as they can from their posi- tion of power. While corruption in the police forces in many respects is similar to that in other public services, in this case it is often accompanied by violence. The police can legitimately use physical force in the pursuit of their normal duties and even direct the same force against the innocent. Members of the public on the other hand have no such rights; they are not permitted to resist even an unjustified arrest using physical force. The most common forms of police corruption are: Extortion. Police may, for example, apprehend suspects whom they believe to be guilty of a crime, but rather than executing a formal arrest they may instead beat them up and force them to pay for their freedom. Police can also seize people they know to be inno- cent, and threaten them with arrest and demand payment for release \u2013 which for women can often mean submitting to sexual exploitation. This type of extortion is most common when the police have great freedom to arrest suspects and temporarily jail them, independently of the courts. The police may also act as local gangsters, threatening to in- flict harm against establishments or individu- als who are unwilling to pay for \u2018protection\u2019. Mixed fraud and extortion. If the courts have to be involved, as they normally are in larger cases, police extortion is often combined with fraud \u2013 as in the classic case when the police plant drugs in the pocket of the suspect. As the case proceeds through the judicial process the price of freedom to be paid to the police or the judicial system steadily rises. Corrupt transactions.

Whenever police corruption is extensive, however, it tends to be linked with other corruption networks. Some of these are within the police service itself which may have developed a hierarchical system for distributing the proceeds of extortion up- wards through higher ranks of the force. On the other hand, much of the corruption actu- ally starts at the top when senior officers de- mand bribes for appointments or promotions or for the most profitable postings. Senior of- ficers also tend to be part of wider networks of corruption within the justice system, with connections with politicians, judges, lawyers, and prison guards, as well as with criminal gangs.

But it is also possible to get more direct indications from surveys of people\u2019s actual experience. The Global Corruption Barometer also asks respondents about their interactions with the police. In the Asia- Pacific region this survey found that 18 per cent of the respondents claimed to have paid a bribe to the police over the previous year, though this was a smaller proportion than found in Latin America or Africa (Figure 2.1). Another more indirect indication comes from crime reporting and from crime victim surveys. In most countries, victims tend to report only a fraction of crimes. In Oceania, the proportion is relatively high, at 52 per cent, close to that in North America, but in Asia it drops to 26 per cent.1 The victim\u2019s decision on whether or not to report a crime will depend on a number of factors \u2013 an assessment of the likelihood of catching the perpetrator, for example, or the options offered by local systems of justice, or the requirements of insurance companies. But one key factor will be the victim\u2019s views on the efficiency and honesty of the police. When victims in various countries in the Asia- Pacific region were asked why they did not report a crime, between one-third and three- quarters cited lack of trust in the police.2 Among different branches of the police some of the most frequent corrupt interac- tions are with the traffic police. In Cambodia, for example, one survey found that 89 per cent of encounters with the traffic police resulted in a bribe. Typically the payments tended to be smaller amounts than those to other branches of the police. The average bribe from a household was around $9. Bribes from businesses were about fifteen times greater.3 Similarly, in Sri Lanka, a survey conducted in 2007 by the Centre for Policy Alternatives, found that 45 per cent of people who had interacted with the police due to traffic violations had to rely on \u2018alternative processes\u2019 (paying more than what was prescribed, paying someone for assistance, or using influence). Of those who gave more money, three-quarters did so in response to a demand, while the remainder did so voluntarily.4 One typical case occurred in 2004. The police stopped a citizen for driving a vehicle with tinted windows, revoked his licence and ordered him to go to the police station to pay a fine. Here a grama-rakshaka (home guard of the village security personnel) told him his driver\u2019s licence would be returned if he paid a bribe of around $10. When the driver reported this to the Traffic Section, instead of disciplining the grama-rakshaka, the sergeant said that his licence would be returned only if he paid his grocery bill of $54.5 Police also often demand bribes from long-distance truck drivers. One study, in Indonesia, involved accompanying truckers in long inter-provincial journeys that encoun- tered multiple police checkpoints. Bribe expenses at these checkpoints constituted around 13 per cent of the transportation cost which, though less than the fuel cost, is a Figure 2.1: Respondents Who have Paid a Bribe to the Police, by Global Region Figure 2.1: Respondents Who have Paid a Bribe to the Police, by Global Region Figure 2.1: Respondents Who have Paid a Bribe to the Police, by Global Region", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22f097d5-ff71-4468-ac95-b3c1d0960747": {"__data__": {"id_": "22f097d5-ff71-4468-ac95-b3c1d0960747", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c81a40c8fb1740443519665dff55c2cb6a34708649305d725fd67eb0ee55e2c5"}}, "hash": "c81a40c8fb1740443519665dff55c2cb6a34708649305d725fd67eb0ee55e2c5", "text": "Figure 2.1: Respondents Who have Paid a Bribe to the Police, by Global Region Figure 2.1: Respondents Who have Paid a Bribe to the Police, by Global Region Source: Transparency International 2006a.

Although the sums extorted by the police are relatively small they constitute a significant proportion of the income of poor people \u2013 as well as creating an atmosphere of fear and apprehension. Most analyses of corruption do not, however, include the impact on the poor. This may be because it involves relatively small amounts, and is difficult to measure, and also because the victims have little power to complain. One example in Cambodia, for example, involved a rural family who owned a small boat but not the land where their house was located. The wife reported that sometimes the police came when her husband was out fish- ing and although they did explain why they were visiting her, she at times felt forced to give them money, out of fear of losing the boat.8 The police will generally monitor the rural space for which they are responsible and use this information to identifying the most vulnerable families they can extort. Among those greatly exposed to harass- ment by the police are street vendors. Many people working on the streets do so without official recognition and even when they have protection from appropriate legislation this is not always implemented. As a result, across the region street vendors are frequently harassed by the police. If they do not pay up, they are likely to see their goods confiscated or destroyed.9 One well publicized case occurred in 1996 in Delhi, India. A fruit vendor belonging to a minority community was beaten to death by two policemen mainly because he had failed to pay the hafta \u2013 a weekly collection made by the police to permit petty vendors to carry on their activi- ties. The incident attracted a lot of attention and action was taken by the department to prosecute the guilty police officers after pressure from the public. The National Human Rights Commission asked the govern- ment to pay a compensation of INR Rs 2.5 lakh10 to the next of kin and to take mea- sures to curb the menace so that \u2018this vulnerable section of society can live in peace\u2019. The Commission subsequently received a report from the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi indicat- ing compliance with the directions of the Commission.11 Police can also harass whole neighbour- hoods. In a riverside slum settlement in Northern India poor families described to reporters how police were fleecing them: \u2018They have made our lives miserable. We do not know when we will be thrown out of our homes. They land up any time and demand money. They threaten us that if we do not pay, they would throw us out of our homes. . . . Last week my clothes were torn apart after my husband could not pay the money demanded. We were allowed to go free only after we sold our rickshaw and paid the money\u2019.12 On the other hand, poor people are less likely to receive any attention if they want to register a complaint. For poor and disadvan- taged people in many countries in the Asia- Pacific region, non-registration of their complaints is one of the most common and widespread grievances. While this may simply be due to indifference to the needs of the complainants it can also be the outcome of corruption if those accused can pay the police to ignore their crimes.

A major factor behind police corrup- tion in India is the falling level of integrity, especially at the level of elite officers drawn from bright university graduates. While a module in ethics is now part of the curriculum at the National Police Academy in Hyderabad, this seems not to have yet brought about the desired improvement in values. Deterrence in the form of criminal action under the Prevention of Corrup- tion Act 1988 is one response that has been tried, with modest success. In a recent case, a former Commissioner of Police was arrested and prosecuted on charges of involvement in a nationwide fraud scheme. This officer has since been acquitted but the fact he was suspected of malfeasance at all is one index of the perception of declining levels of integrity in the Indian police. The frequent transfer of criminal cases from the state police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India\u2019s highest investigating organiza- tion, on complaints of lack of police integrity offers another index of the challenges facing police credibility in the states. CBI has limited resources and cannot handle too many cases, but this method of judicial intervention can ensure straightforward criminal investi- gation in sensitive cases. Likewise, the Supreme Court has ordered the creation of a Police Complaints Authority. Although this is intended primarily to oversee cases involving alleged police brutality, this body also could look into charges of corruption and must be imple- mented in more states. At the same time, it is widely believed by the public \u2013 and has been admitted by a few Chief Justices them- selves \u2013 that the judiciary is not free from corruption. Fortunately, this malaise is almost wholly confined to the lower judiciary, which hears the less grave cases of crime. There is, however, India has won global praise for its robust economy and its wider media coverage of the ways in which public servants function. \u2018Sting\u2019 operations to expose corruption are the order of the day. But amid these very positive deve- lopments, not only are visible signs of increased ethical standards few, but an attitude of resignation to entrenched graft also prevails. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Indian criminal justice system, where the police and judiciary are crucial points of public contact. The police, as the first point, constitute the cutting edge in offering needed relief to a person in distress. Yet it is here that there have been the most vociferous complaints of corruption for decades. Without the offer of a bribe, few victims of crime get their cases regis- tered as a \u2018First Information Report\u2019, the starting point of investigation under the law. Misdeeds may even be suppressed by corrupt officials, often with a view of circulating the false impression that crime is under control, when it is not. There are, however, successful ways to deal with this. Increasing manpower at police stations, the fundamental unit of policing, will help, but it is not enough. Simultaneously, police staff should also be relieved of responsibility for public order maintenance, specifically for the protection of dignitaries, popu- larly known as \u2018VIP security\u2019. Several reform bodies, including the National Police Commission itself, have long re- commended that such work be assigned to specialized units, an arrangement under which a police station will then become purely a service centre for the average citizen. The separation of law and order police and crime investigation units was ordered by a Supreme Court judgement in September 2006, however, this has been only partially implemented in many Indian states and must be further strengthened. Suppression of crime through the manipulation of figures also decrease if a qualitative evaluation replaces a a growing feeling that the canker is spreading upward to the higher courts of the states. The major factor that promotes judicial corruption is the mind-boggling volume of work, which results in the pending of cases for years, sometimes for more than a decade. Judi- cial discretion to prolong trials is wide, through adjournments sought by defen- dants for the flimsiest of reasons, which is conducive to corruption. The appoint- ment of unqualified judicial officials, purely on political and non-legal consid- erations, to prosecute cases on behalf of the State marks another negative feature of the scene. A provision in the Constitution seeks to ensure judicial integrity, but enforce- ment has been at times futile, reinforc- ing a sense of public resignation. In one case, a Chief Justice was tried for impeachment in the national Parliament on charges of grave impropriety.

Creation of a National Judicial Council to look into complaints against judges, in addi- tion to other matters like appointments, is another non-starter because of diffe- rences of opinion between the central Government and the judiciary. To counter all this, in some instances High Court Chief Justices and judges have been transferred from one state to another in a device tried by the Supreme Court to neutralize partisan judges against whom complaints of corruption have been levelled. Still, this remains a stopgap measure. Ultimately, it is only the appointment of people of unimpeach- able integrity that will at least partially ensure judicial and police uprightness. R.K.

According to a 2007 survey in Sri Lanka 78 per cent of the female respondents said that if they had to go to the police station for any reason they would like someone to accompany them, while only 32 per cent male respondents said that they would ask a friend to accompany them.13 Typical cases in South Asia involve victims of rape. Such cases do not often get reported. One case that made it to the press in Pakistan, for example, involved a rape victim whose father tried to file a case at the nearby police station, to no avail. Almost ten weeks had passed, but no action had been taken. She alleged: \u2018Some influential people are threat- ening us with severe consequences\u2019.14 TTTTTackling P ackling P ackling P ackling P ackling Police Corruption olice Corruption olice Corruption olice Corruption olice Corruption Police corruption is difficult to address since the police can easily discover that they are under investigation and may be in a position to in- timidate witnesses and destroy documents. They can also usually rely on the support of powerful political patrons. One of the most important steps therefore is to ensure that complaints against the police are dealt with by a truly independent and accountable body. Independence is a necessary condition but it is not sufficient. In fact, in Hong Kong (SAR), China the Commission\u2019s headquar- ters was in its early days surrounded and stormed by outraged police, forcing the Com- mission to reach a compromise on prosecu- tions of many officers, and in 1977 its investigations provoked a mass police walk- out. In different circumstances, such incidents might have killed off the fledgling agency. However, the critical element was public determination: the people of Hong Kong (SAR), China were not prepared to go back to the old days. They would no longer accept that policing had to be corrupt and contrary to their interests. With overwhelm- ing support, constant media attention and intense pressure from all quarters, reforms ultimately proved a success; today Hong Kong (SAR), China has one of the most efficient and law-abiding police forces in Asia. Similar efforts have been made in other countries. In Malaysia, for instance, the Royal Commission to Enhance the Operation and Management of the Royal Malaysia Police submitted its report to the Prime Minister in April 2004. One of its key recommendations was to establish an Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission, though by the first half of 2007 this had yet to be established.15 Other solutions involve changing the structure of police forces to make them more efficient and responsive \u2013 applying rigid recruitment criteria, reallocating individuals across tasks, modifying transfer patterns, carrying out an ethical evaluation of those who are up for promotion, and attempting changes in policing styles. The overall inten- tion should be to create more professional and effective police forces that allow individual officers to take greater pride in their work \u2013 so that they think primarily about fulfilling their responsibilities.

It should also be possible to reduce the impact of police corruption by strengthening the rights of suspects. This would include the right to call relatives about arrests or police confinement, which is becoming more practi- cal with the increasing number of mobile phones. People should also be better informed generally of their rights and responsibilities. In 2005, Pact Cambodia, an international NGO in cooperation with local NGOs, tried to raise awareness among citizens on how to reduce corruption in the traffic system. They emphasized that fighting corruption was the responsibility of every citizen and explained what citizens could do to reduce corruption. They listed, for example, the documents that people had to carry while driving \u2013 which differ for family cars, trucks and buses and motorcycles \u2013 and detailed the fines that people driving each type of vehicles were offi- cially required to pay for any traffic violation. In addition to responding more appro- priately to gender-related crimes, it is impor- tant that women should be able to count on special protection. In the Philippines, for example, police stations now have a \u2018women and children concerns desks\u2019 which have helped provide services and protection to the victims of abuse and violence while also help- ing to improve police-community relations.17 Judicial Corruption Judicial Corruption Judicial Corruption Judicial Corruption Judicial Corruption Most people have fewer contacts with the courts than with the police, but these can prove just as difficult and even more expen- sive. Ideally, courts should be the place where all kinds of disputes can be settled fairly and dispassionately, where judges operate free from any political or commercial pressures, settling cases only on the basis of evidence. Indeed there are many examples where, against considerable odds, courageous and principled judges particularly the higher judi- ciary do uphold the laws and constitutions of their countries, delivering judgements that correspond with national legislation and the provisions of the constitution. This is not always so. Even judges who want to uphold ethical principles may find themselves subject to heavy pressure. Often this comes from the top, as judicial proceed- ings are distorted by political intervention. Judges can be leaned on by powerful politi- cians to rule in their favour, requiring the courts to provide legal cover for various types of illegal activity \u2013 from land grabbing, to nepotism to a range of other dubious commer- cial transactions such as privatization programmes designed to benefit political or business cronies. Judges typically come under the heaviest pressure when handling cases that are politi- cally sensitive: for example, the prosecution of former political leaders for corruption or other crimes, or of other high-profile figures who have a wide popular following, when they will be expected to make a politically acceptable ruling. Most people, however, encounter corrup- tion in the judicial system at lower levels. A number of studies across Asia have found that two-thirds or more of the population consider the routine court system to be corrupt, and admit that they themselves will pay bribes, regardless of whether they are guilty or innocent. A household survey conducted by Transparency International Bangladesh in 2005 found that two-thirds of the respondents who had used the lower tiers Even judges who want to uphold ethical principles may find themselves subject to heavy pressure ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 48 48 48 48 48 of courts in the preceding year paid average bribes of around $108 per case.

Indeed, running parallel with the more formal judicial process there can be an ongoing negotiation between lawyers, judges and others on the size of the required payment \u2013 which tends to increase steadily as the case proceeds. Police discretion. Initially the decision to arrest will depend largely on the police who in many cases are open to bribery. The police may also decide on whether complaints that are brought to them should be investigated, often requiring payment just to register cases. Prosecution decisions. In some countries the decision whether or not to bring a case will rely on a public prosecutor. This post does not usually carry a very high salary, but is very powerful and much sought after. Trial dates and timing. Court officials may be bribed to get favourable dates for the hearing. Judges may be bribed to ensure that cases are heard promptly rather than subjected to endless adjournments. Evidence. The police may tamper with the evidence, court officials can be bribed to \u2018lose\u2019 files, and judges may admit or exclude evidence according to which party has paid the most. Verdicts. Once a judge has been \u2018bought\u2019 there is little hope of a fair trial. A bribed judge will often simply distort the testimony of witnesses in their summaries and give the corresponding judgement. Even if the verdict is inevitable the subsequent sentencing may bear little relation to the severity of the crime. What Makes a System Corrupt What Makes a System Corrupt What Makes a System Corrupt What Makes a System Corrupt What Makes a System Corrupt Judicial corruption in many respects is just another aspect of a weakly functioning state. In many countries politically motivated bodies appoint or promote judges according to their own requirements, so that the judi- cial system becomes just another arm of the executive. Such judges are more inclined to bend to the wishes of their political masters than to guarantee justice or protect the rights of citizens. Weak judges may also yield to other pres- sures. Some may, for example, consider it more important to support a relative or asso- ciate than to uphold the rule of law. They may also fear retribution \u2013 sometimes in the form of violence. In addition to lack of economic security, judges may in countries such as Afghanistan, suffer from a lack of physical security.20 But they may also be concerned about reactions from other branches of gov- ernment, which can bring bogus charges or force \u2018awkward\u2019 judges into early retirement.

Explain- ing why Singapore\u2019s judges are paid high sala- ries, the former President, Lee Kuan Yu said: \u2018you pay peanuts, you get monkeys\u2019.21 Although there are many courageous and honest judges on low salaries, low pay may contribute to corrupt behaviour. In many countries salaries of judges, particularly those who work in rural areas, are so low that they frequently earn much less than the people they are giving judgment on, and often less than practicing lawyers. While on duty, judges may get housing and transport giving them a higher standard of living than that affordable on retirement \u2013 tempting them to acquire some funds for the future. Unquestioned power of the judiciary can also be a source of potential corruption, even as it protects its independence. In most coun- tries where judicial independence is institu- tionalized contempt of court laws not only insulate the judiciary from the legislature and the executive, they also keep it from media scrutiny.22 Such laws prevent anyone \u2013 elected representatives, officials, media, citizens \u2013 from doing or saying anything that is seen to lower court authority.

Few would risk undergoing a criminal trial, includ- ing the possibility of a prison sentence, for commenting on a judicial decision. This ends up gagging the media. In India, for example, where contempt of court is taken seriously, until last year even truth was not considered a valid defense. A few instances of alleged high level judicial corruption have resulted in a debate on the matter. Impact on the Poor Impact on the Poor Impact on the Poor Impact on the Poor Impact on the Poor The poor will suffer from a corrupt legal system primarily because they cannot rely on it for protection. A 2003 UNDP study of rural justice in Pakistan, for example, found that people in poor villages were reluctant to engage with the formal legal system because they viewed the police and courts as luxuries for the rich. Rather than getting involved with the formal legal system they would prefer to use more informal systems of dispute resolu- tion. Though quicker and cheaper such systems may not necessarily be fairer.23 Second, the poor suffer because without being able to afford to defend themselves they are subject to arbitrary judgements that can cause them to lose their land, homes, or livelihoods. A study in Bangladesh of 3,000 house- holds shows that 97 per cent of households that bought land had to pay bribes for land registration, 88 per cent of the households who mutated their land ownership had to pay bribes for it, 85 per cent households who collected land related documents had to pay bribes, 83 per cent households had to pay bribes for land survey, and 40 per cent house- holds who received land had to pay bribes.24 Corruption tends to compound the other factors that prevent the poor from getting access to justice. Often the poorest people live in rural areas far from the courts and have little knowledge of how they work. In addi- tion they are unlikely to have the funds to pay for an experienced lawyer. In Bangladesh, one woman narrated to Transparency Inter- national her experience about a murder conviction of her seven-year old boy. While playing he threw a ball which hit the chest of another boy who subsequently died. The court sentenced him to several years in prison. His mother lacked the funds to bribe court offi- cials or to engage good lawyers, and relations of the dead boy evicted her from her home. Although poor families should be able to rely on the support of bar councils and govern- ment funds, she was unable to enlist any such help. Fortunately at a later date she received the backing of a human rights group.25 ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 50 50 50 50 50 in countries where no political will exists to fight corruption. There will be no political will where charges are likely made against people who are powerful and part of, or supporters of, the Government. Third, is cultural practices. Fiji has societies that are traditional, authorita- rian and patriarchal. Some of the accused were traditional leaders as well as Government officeholders. Charges challenged the traditional practice of gift giving, and of traditional favours expected and received. This was seen as challenging a whole community\u2019s cultural identity. Prosecutors were accused of cultural insensitivity, but this obscured the real issue: whether the accused had acted corruptly. Fourth, is delay. Delay is destructive to prosecution. Witnesses, in any event, reluctant to testify against those in power, renege or disappear. Often, they forget evidence. Delay leads to applica- tions made by the accused to travel abroad, to appeals from interim rulings and to applications for a permanent stay of the prosecution. This happened in a number of fraud and corruption trials in Fiji, including several of the National Bank cases. The result was a failure to air the substance of the charge of corruption.

Contd... SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION \u2013 PROSECUTING CORRUPTION: A PACIFIC PERSPECTIVE By Hon. Madam Justice Shameem regulations and legal rules broke down or were compromised. The National Bank was asked to process \u2018soft\u2019 loans to indigenous Fijians as a form of affir- mative action. For six years, millions of dollars were advanced with no or inadequate security. Law firms created shelf companies to siphon off funds and channel them abroad to unseen, unknown recipients. The National Bank\u2019s board said it did not know what was happening. The Reserve Bank did not know. The Cabinet did not know. The Minister of Finance did not know. Eventually, the media informed the public that the National Bank was owed $200 million, which it would probably never recover. Police investigations revealed that recipients were neither all indigenous nor financially disadvantaged, uncover- ing cronyism, dishonesty, fraud and corruption. Cabinet Ministers, lawyers, accountants, civil servants and business interests all benefited. We started to issue charges. The accused were all prominent members of the establishment. The effects were immediate: first, the hostility of the judiciary. When lawyers are challenged, members of the bench are not always able to consider their cases impartially. The principle of equality before the law, so intrinsic to the rule of law, is most severely tested when we try one of our own. Second, the inadequacy of our laws The abuse of entrusted power for private gain is a habit. It is found in all countries, rich and poor, developed and underdeveloped. It is found in all socie- ties and ethnic groups. All that differs is the degree and type of corruption. In a democratic society it is easier to spot, but corruption exists in democracies and dictatorships alike. Wherever there is power, there exists the potential for power to be abused. For 16 years before I became a judge, I was a prosecutor, and for five of those years I was Fiji\u2019s Director of Public Prosecutions. My experiences taught me that to deal with corruption effectively, you need good laws, a strong and inde- pendent judiciary, an independent and well-resourced prosecutors\u2019 office, as well as a determined police force. But that is not all. The prosecutor himself or herself needs to develop immense resolve, a thick skin, excellent research and advocacy skills, along with the ability to look dishonesty and corruption in the face and say, \u2018This is dishonesty and corruption\u2019. Corruption cases need prosecutors who will carry on even when they lose and lose again, and who will recognize that victory is in trying. A story I have often told is of the collapse of the National Bank of Fiji. Fiji had its first military coup in 1987, said to be conducted to protect indi- genous Fijian interests. In the after- math, Government procedures, bank The general principles that judges should follow have been codified in the \u2018Bangalore Principles\u2019.
