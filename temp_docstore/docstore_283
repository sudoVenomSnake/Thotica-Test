Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 29 plans, international trade agreements, market dynamics etc.81 The impact of trade agreements and debt burdens on indigenous peoples is often overlooked. For example, trade agreements and investment in natural resources may displace indigenous peoples from their traditional lands and territories. The specialized livelihoods of some indigenous peoples may be adversely affected by trade liberalization. Good governance, a key commitment under Goal 8, means respect for and participation of indigenous peoples.82 Box 17: Ogoni Land Case in Nigeria In Social and Economic Rights Action Center and Center for Economic and Social Rights v. Nigeria, members of the Ogoni community in Nigeria alleged that the military Government had violated their rights to health and a clean environment, as well as several other human rights, by facilitating the operations of oil companies in Ogoni Land. The applicants alleged that the operations of an oil consortium, comprising the Nigerian National Petroleum Company and Shell Petroleum Development Corporation, had contaminated the environment, leading to serious and widespread health problems among the Ogoni people. The African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights held that the Ogoni had suffered violations of a number of their human rights, including their rights to health and a clean environment, as a result of the Government\u2019s failure to prevent pollution and ecological degradation. It found that the Government had failed to adequately regulate and monitor the oil consortium. The Commission issued a number of orders, for example, environmental and social impact assessments should be prepared in the future and health and environmental information should be made available. (Source: Communication No. 155/96, 2001, African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights) Large infrastructure, extractive and even conservation projects have been harmful for indigenous peoples.83 Further, in addition to the direct negative impacts of large development projects, the debt burden is another major factor for the exacerbation of indigenous peoples\u2019 poverty. To generate foreign exchange for payment of the foreign debt, governments often extract natural resources for export, resulting in unsustainable exploitation of indigenous peoples\u2019 territories and resources. It is crucial to ensure that, indigenous peoples are protected from adverse effects of aid programmes. Development partners, through their aid programmes and through dialogue with governments, could play an important role in protecting rights and interests of indigenous peoples. The development co-operation should aim towards strengthening the right and capacity of indigenous peoples to \u201cself-development\u201d. This implies integrating the concern for indigenous peoples as a cross-cutting aspect at all levels of development co-operation.84 81 Diana Vinding, Perspectives from Communities in Bolivia, Cambodia, Cameroon, Guatemala and Nepal, ILO, 2006. 82 MRG, Minority and Indigenous Peoples Rights in the Millennium Development Goals, 2003. 83 Joji Carino, \u201cIndigenous Peoples, Human Rights and Poverty\u201d, Indigenous Perspectives, vol 7 No.1. 84 ILO, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples\u2019 Rights in Practice, 2009, p. 119.

Mutual Benefits While the MDGs represent high-level political commitments, rights of indigenous peoples as recognised under the UNDRIPs are entitlements with corresponding obligations upon States.

Box 18: Multi-Agency Development Initiative in China In China, eight UN agencies are implementing a multi-agency MDG project on culture-based development for ethnic minorities under the UN-China Culture and Development Partnership Framework (CDPF) funded by the Spanish MDG Achievement Fund that acknowledges the importance of culture as a cross-cutting theme and utilizes culture as a driving force in the field of development.

An approach based on the rights of indigenous peoples focuses on the realisation of the rights for all including the indigenous peoples. Holistic approach: Achieving MDG targets is not possible without addressing root causes of poverty such as discrimination and powerlessness. Programming based on the rights of indigenous peoples takes a holistic approach by considering the social, political and legal framework that underpins the rights and duty holders.87 85 2002 UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, p. 3. 86 UNMC, The Millennium Development Goals and Human Rights, 2008, p. 9-10. 87 UNOHCHR, Frequently Asked Questions on a Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Cooperation, 2006, p. 16. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 31 Participation: While the MDGs focus on results, an approach based on the rights of indigenous peoples reminds policy makers that processes are equally important. In particular a human rights-based approach seeks both to assist in the participatory formulation of the needed policy and legislative framework, and to ensure that participatory and democratic processes are institutionalized locally and nationally.88 Accountability: Accountability mechanisms for the MDGs are weak. A human rights-based approach sensitive to rights of indigenous peoples supports the monitoring of State commitments, through independent and public assessment of State performance, and holds those who have a duty to act accountable, ensuring effective remedies where rights are violated.89 The adoption of the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR which provides for individual and collective complaints procedure further strengthens accountability with respect to rights of indigenous peoples. Box 19: The Case of Awas Tingni v. Nicaragua: A New Step in the International Law of Indigenous Peoples (S. James Anaya & Claudio Grossman) The people of Awas Tingni did not set about to forge an international legal precedent with implications for indigenous peoples throughout the world, yet that is what they have done. Awas Tingni is one of numerous Mayagna, or Sumo, indigenous communities in the isolated Atlantic Coast region of Nicaragua. The Community has sought simply, but doggedly, to be secure in the peaceful possession of traditional lands. It has achieved a major step toward that end, and more. The Community\u2019s identity in the minds of outsiders is now merged with that of a landmark case, The Case of the Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni Community v. Nicaragua, decided by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on August 31, 2001. In this case the Court held that the international human right to enjoy the benefits of property, particularly as affirmed in the American Convention on Human Rights, includes the right of indigenous peoples to the protection of their customary land and resource tenure. The Court held that the State of Nicaragua violated the property rights of the Awas Tingni Community by granting to a foreign company a concession to log within the Community\u2019s traditional lands and by failing to otherwise provide adequate recognition and protection of the Community\u2019s customary tenure. It was not enough that the Nicaraguan constitution and laws recognise in general terms the rights of indigenous peoples to the lands they traditionally use and occupy. The Court admonished that Nicaragua must secure the effective enjoyment of those rights, which it had not done for Awas Tingni nor for the vast majority of indigenous communities of the Atlantic Coast region of Nicaragua... The Court ordered Nicaragua to demarcate and title Awas Tingni\u2019s traditional lands in accordance with its customary land and resource tenure patterns, to refrain from any action that might undermine the Community\u2019s interests in those lands, and to establish an adequate mechanism to secure the land rights of all indigenous communities of the country. This is the first legally binding decision by an international tribunal to uphold the collective land and resource rights of indigenous peoples in the face of a state\u2019s failure to do so.

Implementation of the MDGs and Rights of Indigenous Peoples For implementation of the MDGs whereby indigenous peoples\u2019 own vision, perspectives and strategies of self-determining development within a framework of human rights, State parties should: 6.1. Recognise Indigenous Peoples and Their Rights 6.1.1. Recognise Indigenous Peoples UNDRIPs Article 25 Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used lands, territories, waters and coastal seas and other resources\u2026 Article 26 1. Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired. 2. Indigenous peoples have the right to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership or other traditional occupation or use, as well as those which they have otherwise acquired. 3. States shall give legal recognition and protection to these lands, territories and resources. Such recognition shall be conducted with due respect to the customs, traditions and land tenure systems of the indigenous peoples concerned. Indigenous peoples are invisible in the MDGs.90 The recognition of indigenous peoples as distinct peoples and the respect for their individual and collective human rights, rights to lands and territories and sustainable use of natural resources are crucial for reducing widespread poverty amongst them.91 Over the last few years several countries have introduced constitutional reforms and adopted legislations recognising distinct indigenous identities. However, in most cases, those reforms have not been able to eliminate discrimination against indigenous peoples. In some cases the very existence of indigenous peoples is not recognised in constitutions and laws and they are even denied citizenship.92 Non-recognition of indigenous peoples and their customary land rights resulted in loss of control over land and natural resources for indigenous peoples. Ambiguities in the legal situation of 90 MDGs Reports and Indigenous Peoples: A Desk Review, 2006-2008, available at http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/ publications.html 91 Report on the fourth session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc. E/C.19/2005/9, 2005, para 14. 92 UNDG, United Nations Development Group Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 33 indigenous peoples and communities are of concern to indigenous peoples around the world.93 In Africa, for instance, the Amazigh people, who inhabit several countries of North Africa, demand legal recognition and the respect of their cultural and social rights as an indigenous people. Within the framework of constitutional review, the Ogiek, a hunter-gatherer people of Kenya, are claiming recognition as a distinct indigenous minority. The Maasai pastoralists are considered to be an indigenous minority in several East African countries, and their legal recognition varies in the different States. The Special Rapporteur on situation of indigenous peoples emphasised that women and children are particularly affected by the lack of citizenship documents, because they become more vulnerable to exploitation. Indigenous women suffer terribly from the violence that occurs in many indigenous lands.94 The challenge, therefore, is to bring about development with a strong social and cultural dimension, which promotes respect for the basic human rights of indigenous peoples and which integrates their views on development visions. Recognition of indigenous peoples\u2019 identity is considered as the first step in that regard. 6.1.2. Explicitly Recognise and Integrate Rights of Indigenous Peoples in Policies and Programmes for Implementation of the MDGs Indigenous peoples are entitled to the full range of rights established under international law, such as non-discrimination, participation in public life, and right to maintain their distinctive identities, cultures, languages and ways of life. The right of indigenous peoples to self-determination is increasingly expressed through self-governing or autonomous arrangements. Both ILO\u2019s Convention No. 169 and the UNDRIPs recognise indigenous peoples\u2019 right to own and control their lands and, to differing degrees, recognise their rights to own, use and manage the natural resources on those lands.

E/ CN.4/2002/97, 2002, p. 30-31. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 34 The right to development is understood in this context to imply the right of indigenous peoples to decide the kind of development that takes place on their lands and territories in accordance with their own priorities and cultures.95 The UNDRIPs calls upon States to consult with indigenous peoples to obtain their free, prior and informed consent prior to approval of any project affecting their lands and resources.96 ILO Convention No. 169 underlines the right of indigenous peoples to be consulted in relation to developments that may affect them.97 6.1.3. Disaggregated Data Disaggregated data on the conditions of indigenous peoples is limited and it is therefore difficult to develop and implement policies to address discrimination. The UNPFIIs and several UN agencies have recommended that data be disaggregated specifically for indigenous peoples. Data provide a key tool for the planning and execution of programmes and projects and the monitoring and evaluation of the achievement of the MDGs. However, there are several inconsistencies that inhibit data with respect to indigenous peoples. There is no standard or agreed upon definition of \u201cwho are indigenous peoples\u201d and \u201cwho are not considered as indigenous peoples\u201d. Data and information are often not sufficiently disaggregated. Furthermore, development indicators do not always reflect indigenous peoples\u2019 experiences and perspectives, but are based on systems created by mainstream societies, which are not always relevant for assessing indigenous peoples particular context and experiences. Indigenous peoples are often not consulted in the decision- making process related to the collection and disaggregation of data that directly concerns them.98 Box 21: Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, Philippines (1997) In the Philippines free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples is required by law for the following activities: y exploration, development and use of natural resources; y research and bio prospecting; y displacement and relocation; y archaeological explorations; y policies affecting indigenous peoples like Executive Order 263 (Community-based Forest Management); and y entry of military. The definition of prior informed consent in the Indigenous People\u2019s Rights Act of the Philippines provides that: y All members of the community affected consent to the decision; y Consent is determined in accordance with customary laws and practices; y Freedom from external manipulation, interference or coercion; y Full disclosure of the intent and scope of the activity; y Decision is made in language understandable to the community; and y Decision is made in process understandable to the community. 95 UNDRIPs Article 23. 96 UNDRIPs Article 32. 97 UNDG, United Nations Development Group Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008. 98 Edilberto Loazia, \u201cData and Indicators for Indigenous Issues\u201d, World Bank Conference on Poverty and Indigenous Peoples, 2006, p. 10. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 35 There is therefore a need to adapt and disaggregate MDG targets to ensure the rights of indigenous peoples are given sufficient attention in practice. There is also a need to add complementary indicators to measure existing targets, where needed to ensure rights of indigenous peoples are adequately highlighted. 6.2. Promote Greater Equality According to international human rights standards, indigenous peoples, as all human beings, are entitled to enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms including both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights. They have the right to equal treatment and to benefit, as any other citizen of the State in which they live, from economic development and other progress. These rights apply to all indigenous peoples, i.e. men and women, children and adults alike. In practice, however, indigenous peoples have often not been treated equally and face social exclusion.99 Dominant sections of the society consider them inferior, and often deny them equal opportunities with respect to livelihood and education. Further, indigenous women continue to suffer from multiple forms of discrimination, both as women and as indigenous individuals.

This violence is exacerbated when indigenous communities find themselves in the midst of conflict and women become the target of violence with political motives, when going about their daily work, fetching wood or water for the family. The situation of the indigenous girl child is even more acute in such situations. Furthermore, there are increasing reports of young indigenous girls coerced into the sex industry, and subjected to situations that amount to slavery. Indigenous women often suffer discrimination from both in and outside of their communities. There are also cultural practices that are discriminatory related to inheritance rights and status, although there are some indigenous communities that are matriarchal and thus it is the women who inherit e.g. the Khasis in Northeast India and Bangladesh. It is important that indigenous peoples\u2019 culture and traditions are protected and strengthened, while at the same time providing the enabling space for these communities to explore and define new ways to protect the rights of indigenous women. Any innovations and changes have to come from within the community in order to be sustainable and appropriate, as externally driven interventions are seldom long lasting. 6.2.1. Respect for Individual and Collective Rights of Indigenous Peoples Various international treaties protect individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples. These rights are indispensable for their existence, well-being and holistic development as peoples. Policies and programmes designed for implementation of the MDGs could result in violation of rights of indigenous peoples. There is therefore a need to respect the rights of indigenous peoples while designing development programmes and policies. The collective rights of indigenous peoples include recognition of their distinctive histories, languages, identities and cultures and the collective right to lands, territories and natural resources 99 Vital Bambazne, \u201cDimensions of Poverty and Well-Being among Indigenous Peoples in Africa\u201d, World Bank Conference on Poverty and Indigenous Peoples, 2006, p. 9. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 36 they have traditionally occupied and used, as well as the right to their collectively held traditional knowledge. In establishing and fulfilling collective rights for indigenous peoples, the international community has affirmed that such rights should not conflict with existing international human rights norms but complement them, i.e., the implementation of collective human rights should not adversely affect the implementation of individual rights. ILO Convention 169 Article 7 1. The peoples concerned shall have the right to decide their own priorities for the process of development as it affects their lives, beliefs, institutions and spiritual well- being and the lands they occupy or otherwise use, and to exercise control, to the extent possible, over their own economic, social and cultural development. In addition, they shall participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly. \u2026 3. Governments shall ensure that, whenever appropriate, studies are carried out, in cooperation with the peoples concerned, to assess the social, spiritual, cultural and environmental impact on them of planned development activities. The results of these studies shall be considered as fundamental criteria for the implementation of these activities. 4. Governments shall take measures, in cooperation with the peoples concerned, to protect and preserve the environment of the territories they inhabit. 6.2.2. Allocate Adequate Resources Mobilisation of resources for achieving the MDGs should not result in sacrificing the funds available for indigenous peoples. There is a need for an equitable distribution of resources aimed at safeguarding the rights and interests of indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples are subjected to discrimination and inequality with respect to allocation of resources and they remain economically and socially depressed. According to Human Development Report 2004, public spending in basic social services systematically discriminates against indigenous peoples and minorities.100 Indigenous peoples have the same rights to development, resources and services as all other peoples and their effective access to these rights must be ensured. There is therefore a need for adopting targeted policies, programmes, projects and budgets for the development of indigenous peoples, including concrete benchmarks, and particular emphasis on indigenous women, children and youth.101 It should be recognised that indigenous peoples\u2019 aspirations for development, resources and services may be fundamentally different among indigenous groups 100 UNDP, Human Development Report 2004, 2004. 101 Second International Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous Peoples, 2004, main objectives available at http://www.un.org/esa/ socdev/unpfii/en/second.html Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 37 themselves as well as different from those of other peoples, even within the same country.102 Development strategies must therefore be designed to overcome the marginalisation of indigenous peoples and, at the same", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac2cabc0-e7bf-4d6b-8b0a-2172939b064a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac2cabc0-e7bf-4d6b-8b0a-2172939b064a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-and-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG and Indigenous Peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-and-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f544453760c1d661bdbae3a2306c662664c4943f15809bb615c2dc005dd2bdce"}}, "hash": "f544453760c1d661bdbae3a2306c662664c4943f15809bb615c2dc005dd2bdce", "text": "time, protect and promote their rights. Moreover, national development goals should not be achieved at the expense of indigenous peoples, such as the accelerated loss of their land and natural resources and assimilation. New tools and techniques such as budget analysis can be used to understand and advocate for better resource allocation for indigenous peoples. Such analysis can also help in assessing needs and establishing benchmarks in sectoral areas of concern for indigenous peoples, as well as directly linking these to the MDGs. The efforts and experiences of the UN system and other development actors in mainstreaming gender budgets can serve as a useful tool for indigenous related budgeting. Best practices in participatory budgeting can be used to enhance indigenous peoples\u2019 participation.103 6.3. Participation and Representation UNDRIPs Article 18 Indigenous peoples have the right to participate in decision-making in matters which would affect their rights, through representatives chosen by themselves in accordance with their own procedures, as well as to maintain and develop their own indigenous decision-making institutions. Article 19 States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them. Indigenous peoples are often not able to participate fully in public life and are rarely present in decision-making bodies of the State. In order to address this situation and promote social inclusion and political participation, Governments are increasingly revising laws and introducing special measures to combat prevailing discrimination and improve opportunities for indigenous peoples. These measures include targeted programming, special grants for education, consultative mechanisms and reserved seats in decision-making bodies, including national parliaments. The Second International Decade of World\u2019s Indigenous People called for promoting full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in decisions which directly or indirectly affect their lifestyles, traditional lands and territories, their cultural integrity as indigenous peoples with collective rights or any other aspect of their lives, considering the principle of free, prior and informed consent.104 The rights to participation and to free, prior and informed consent are an integral part of a human rights-based approach. The principle of free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples to development projects and plans affecting them, is emerging as a 102 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Resource Kit on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008, p. 33-34. 103 Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, \u201cA Framework for Advocacy in Support of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Visions, Perspectives and Strategies for Self- Determining Development\u201d, in UNDP, Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to development: Engaging in Dialogue, 2007, p. 106. 104 The Second International Decade of World\u2019s Indigenous People, 2004, main objective, available at http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/ unpfii/en/second.html Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 38 standard to be applied for promoting and protecting their rights in the development process.105 This principle should be respected and used as a methodology whenever designing programmes and projects that directly or indirectly affect indigenous peoples, as defined in the context of a human rights-based approach. According to UNPFII, free, prior and informed consent should be sought sufficiently in advance of commencement or authorization of activities, taking into account indigenous peoples\u2019 own decision-making processes in all phases of a project. Information should be accurate and in a form that is accessible and understandable, including in a language that the indigenous peoples will fully understand. The format in which information is distributed should take into account the oral traditions of indigenous peoples and their languages. Consent to any agreement should be interpreted as implying that indigenous peoples have reasonably understood it.106 For indigenous peoples, being part of the decision-making process is fundamental to meeting development challenges\u2014in particular, the achievement of the MDGs. Participation and free, prior and informed consent are therefore key to the realisation of the rights of indigenous peoples and the MDGs.107Articles 18 and 19 of the UNDRIPs emphasize the principles of participation and free, prior and informed consent. Article 6 of ILO Convention No. 169 speaks of \u201cconsultation with the peoples concerned\u201d to be \u201ccarried out in good faith and in a form appropriate to the circumstances \u2026 with the objective of achieving agreement and consent to the proposed measures\u201d. Para 1 of OP 4.10 of the World Bank provides that for the Bank-financing that impacts indigenous peoples, the borrower must engage in FPIC with indigenous peoples.

Indigenous peoples\u2019 representatives should be involved, for instance, with other sectors of civil society and in meetings with government officials. Specific and culturally appropriate consultation mechanisms can also be established through the creation of consultative groups of indigenous leaders to advise governments at all stages of the programming process, or through consultations at local level.109 The idea as explained by the Inter-Agency Support Group should be to develop mechanisms at the country level to give indigenous peoples a greater sense of ownership of intergovernmental organisations and their activities, and to enable their full participation in activities affecting them.110 105 Ibid., p .98. 106 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Resource Kit on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008, p. 17. 107 Ibid. 108 UNPFIIs, Analysis prepared by the secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues: indigenous women, E/C.19/2009/8, 2009. 109 UNDG, United Nations Development Group Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008. 110 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Resource Kit on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008, p. 17.

The population is estimated at 70,000-100,000. The S\u00e1mediggi of Norway is elected through general elections by and among the S\u00e1mis in the country. It is an independent political organ and is the highest representative body of the S\u00e1mis in Norway. The legal basis for establishing the S\u00e1mediggi is found in section 12 of the S\u00e1mi Act, which states that the S\u00e1mis shall have their own national S\u00e1mi Parliament elected by and amongst the S\u00e1mis in Norway. The establishment of the S\u00e1mediggi is a central element in the fulfilment of Section 110a of the Norwegian Constitution, which was adopted by the Storting (the National Parliament of Norway) on 21 April 1988. Section 110a of the Constitution states that it is the obligation of the State authorities to create the conditions necessary for the S\u00e1mis to protect and develop their language, their culture and their society.\u201d The political mandate of the S\u00e1mediggi includes all issues that the Parliament considers affect S\u00e1mi interests. The S\u00e1mediggi has 43 representatives (increased in 2005 from 39) elected by and amongst S\u00e1mis on the basis of a S\u00e1mi census. The country is divided into 13 constituencies. Elections to the S\u00e1mediggi are held every fourth year simultaneously with the elections to the Storting. The plenary of the S\u00e1mediggi is the Parliament\u2019s highest body and it is sovereign in the execution of its duties within the framework of the S\u00e1mi Act. The plenary sessions are held four times a year. In the interim, between the plenary sessions, the S\u00e1mediggi\u2019s Executive Council, under the leadership of the President of the S\u00e1mediggi, is responsible for executing the roles and responsibilities of the S\u00e1mediggi. The members of the Executive Council, including the President, are elected by and amongst the S\u00e1mediggi\u2019s representatives.

The parties should establish a dialogue allowing them to find appropriate solutions in an atmosphere of mutual respect in good faith, and full and equitable participation. Consultation requires time and an effective system for communicating among interest holders. Indigenous peoples should be able to participate through their own freely chosen representatives and customary or other institutions. The inclusion of a gender perspective and the participation of indigenous women are essential, as well as participation of children and youth, as appropriate.

Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 41 6.4. International Development Cooperation and Indigenous Peoples Ensuring that indigenous peoples have equal opportunities requires States to take special or positive measures to compensate for historic injustices and disadvantages. The purpose of special positive measures is to bring the living conditions of indigenous peoples to the same level as those of others in society. The objective should be to aim for development which reflects indigenous peoples\u2019 own vision, perspectives and strategies of self-determining development within the framework of respect or their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.111 While principal responsibility for the realisation of the right to development and human rights rests with each State, rich countries have some responsibilities towards the realisation of human rights in poor countries within the context of international cooperation. These responsibilities arise, inter alia, from the provisions relating to international assistance and cooperation in international human rights law. Importantly, international assistance and cooperation should not be understood as only financial and technical assistance: it also includes the responsibility of rich States to work actively towards an international order that is conducive to the elimination of poverty and the realisation of human rights. The parameters of international assistance and cooperation are not yet clearly defined. However, in principle, international assistance and cooperation require that all those in a position to assist should, first, refrain from acts that make it more difficult for the indigenous peoples to realize their human rights and, second, take measures to remove obstacles that impede the indigenous peoples\u2019 realisation of their human rights. Both governments and international development agencies have responsibilities for including indigenous peoples in development processes. Numerous policies have been adopted over the years by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and a number of bilateral donors for the inclusion of rights and interests of indigenous peoples in development programmes. These policies and strategies reflect positive steps which have helped placing indigenous peoples on the international development agenda.112 Nevertheless, there are challenges with regard to the implementation of these strategies, including lack of mechanisms for securing the participation of indigenous peoples, paucity of specific statistics or data available on the situation of indigenous peoples and the lack of knowledge of indigenous issues among staff of development institutions and governments. For indigenous organisations, it remains a challenge to push for further participation in development processes, particularly as this becomes more centralized at the national level through the Aid Effectiveness Agenda.113 111 Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, \u201cA Framework for Advocacy in Support of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Visions, Perspectives and Strategies for Self- Determining Development\u201d, in UNDP, Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to development: Engaging in Dialogue, 2007, p. 96. 112 ILO, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples\u2019 Rights in Practice, 2009, p. 119. 113 Ibid. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 42 Box 24: Indigenous Peoples Rights in the Aid Effectiveness Framework Research carried out by the ILO indicates that the approach and principles adopted under the Paris Declaration carries some inherent risks which might result in further exclusion of indigenous peoples if specific safeguards are not developed.114 The following summarizes such implications on indigenous peoples. Ownership y Indigenous peoples, particularly in Africa and Asia, have lack of participation in government structures and national decision-making process and therefore risk not being taken into account in policies and plans. y Donors may hesitate to engage in policy dialogue on indigenous peoples\u2019 issues. y Most development agencies face difficulties in ensuring the capacity to address indigenous peoples\u2019 issues in their decentralised structures.

Harmonization y The lack of an overall strategy on support to indigenous peoples (in the context of the commitments stipulated by the Rome and Paris Declarations) may eventually undermine the value of individual donor policies on support to indigenous peoples. Managing of results y Most indigenous peoples do not have the institutional capacity or political leverage to ensure that their needs and priorities are reflected in MTEFs or budgets. y In most countries, adequate data on indigenous peoples are not available and national statistical bureau do not have the capacity to provide disaggregated data. Mutual accountability y The agenda set by the Rome and Paris Declarations focuses on the effectiveness rather than the quality and relevance of aid. Consequently, none of the 12 monitoring indicators is related to governance, human rights, participation, quality or inclusiveness of development. In other words, the reformed aid architecture in itself provides no safeguards to ensure that \u201ceffectiveness\u201d does not jeopardise the rights-based approach. y In many countries, marginalisation with regards to access to education and information excludes indigenous peoples from participating in monitoring and holding governments accountable. 114 Ibid., p. 119-120 Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 43 6.5. Effective Accountability International human rights empower individuals and communities by granting them entitlements and placing legal obligations on others. Critically, rights and obligations demand accountability: unless supported by a system of accountability they can become no more than window-dressing. Accordingly, a human rights approach emphasizes obligations and requires that all duty-holders be held to account for their conduct. States and other duty-bearers are answerable for the observance of human rights and they have to comply with the legal norms and standards enshrined in human rights instruments. When they fail to do so, aggrieved rights-holders are entitled to institute proceedings for appropriate redress before a competent court or other adjudicators in accordance with the rules and procedures provided by law.115 Accountability mechanisms related to the MDGs are weak. One possible vehicle for accountability is the country-level Millennium Development Goals progress report. Several such reports have been published over the years.116 These Reports are emerging as one of the most important instruments for tracking and monitoring progress at the national level. They are, however, primarily intended for \u201cawareness advocacy\u201d, rather than policy formulation or accountability. These reports can be used to hold governments to account with respect to their MDG commitments with respect to indigenous peoples. Human rights, including the rights of indigenous peoples, can strengthen the weak accountability mechanisms presently associated with all MDGs. Provided they are adequately briefed and resourced, existing human rights accountability mechanisms can consider the adequacy of what States are doing to realise the MDGs in context of indigenous peoples. For example, the examination by a human rights treaty body of a State\u2019s periodic report could consider those goals falling within the treaty body\u2019s mandate. On country missions, special rapporteurs could explore those which fall within their mandates. At the country level, a national human rights institution could establish a MDGs and Indigenous Peoples monitoring and accountability unit.117 It is the responsibility of the international community and other actors to identify appropriate, effective, transparent and accessible accountability mechanisms with respect to indigenous peoples and the MDGs. If it does not, the chances of achieving them will be seriously diminished. 115 Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, \u201cA Framework for Advocacy in Support of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Visions, Perspectives and Strategies for Self- Determining Development\u201d, in UNDP, Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to development: Engaging in Dialogue, 2007, p. 99. 116 MDG Reports and Indigenous Peoples: A Desk Review, 2006-2008, available at http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/ publications.html 117 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, UN Doc.

The UDHR is universally recognised globally and is the cornerstone of human rights to this day. ILO Conventions concerning Indigenous Peoples ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Populations, 1957 (No. 107) Convention No. 107 addresses the right of indigenous peoples to pursue material well-being and spiritual development. It was the first international instrument specific to indigenous peoples, and emerged as a result of the ILO\u2019s pioneering efforts with indigenous workers. Convention No. 107 contains specific provisions on land rights, health, education etc. It remains binding for 18 countries that have ratified it, and have not yet ratified the more recent Convention No. 169. ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, 1989 (No. 169) Convention No. 169 was adopted in 1989 and revises the earlier Convention No. 107. This was to address certain weaknesses in Convention No. 107, \u2018particularly its underlying assumption that the only possible future for indigenous peoples was integration into the larger society, and that others should make decisions on their development.\u2019119 Convention No. 169 states their right to enjoy the full measure of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and calls for the adoption of special measures to safeguard the persons, institutions, lands and territories, customs, labour, cultures and environment of these peoples.120 It also outlines the responsibilities of governments to respect the specific right of indigenous peoples to remain distinct, and is underpinned by the recognition of consultation and participation as essential prerequisites for activities on indigenous lands and territories and resources. It provides the legal context for self-identification as a right, also recognised in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples. \u2018The Convention has inspired governments and indigenous peoples far beyond the ratifying countries, in their work to promote and protect indigenous peoples\u2019 rights.\u2019121 119 ILO 2009: Indigenous and Tribal Peoples\u2019 Rights in Practice: A Guide to ILO Convention No. 169, Programme to Promote ILO Convention No. 169 (PRO 169), International Labour Standards Department at p. 173. 120 For further details on the ILO\u2019s work with indigenous peoples, see www.ilo.org/indigenous; www.pro169.org. 121 ILO 2009: Indigenous and Tribal Peoples\u2019 Rights in Practice: A Guide to ILO Convention No. 169 at p. 5. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 49 UN Conventions and Declarations concerning Indigenous Peoples International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) The Human Rights Committee, responsible for monitoring the implementation of ICCPR, has applied provisions of the Covenant to the specific context of indigenous peoples, including the right to self-determination (article 1), and in the context of article 27 which applies to the rights of national, ethnic, and linguistic minorities. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) Several provisions of the ICESCR are applicable in the specific context of indigenous peoples, including the right to adequate housing; the right to food; the right to education; the right to health, the right to water, and intellectual property and other cultural rights. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1966) \u201cRacial discrimination\u201d is defined as \u201cany distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.\u201d (Article 1). The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), responsible for the supervision of the Convention, has increasingly given attention to the rights of indigenous peoples in its consideration of state reports. General Recommendation No. 23 on Indigenous Peoples (18/08/97) The Committee especially calls upon States parties to recognise and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and use their communal lands, territories and resources and, where they have been deprived of their lands and territories traditionally owned or otherwise inhabited or used without their free and informed consent, to take steps to return those lands and territories. Only when this is for factual reasons not possible, the right to restitution should be substituted by the right to just, fair and prompt compensation. Such compensation should as far as possible take the form of lands and territories.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3e724a0-e8da-4678-b01c-f4dae37eec2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3e724a0-e8da-4678-b01c-f4dae37eec2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-and-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG and Indigenous Peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-and-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e669803d58f94a582bbc0b29f3223292845b3ef0f775d1c3e1c9b46de33149a"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc13c704-9731-4392-8ee1-47010ccd174d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-and-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0af92717e70a535b3a298f065afdeae5dd3a83772c922171e5c69b6fe1b80093"}}, "hash": "b5d2ea088ab174117f50c01d30b34e25c476eb8f0fa675de65bb033e1c99e68b", "text": "Such compensation should as far as possible take the form of lands and territories.

Article 30 is of specific relevance, and states that children of minorities or indigenous origin shall not be denied the right to their own culture, religion or language. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 50 Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comment No. 11 on Indigenous Children and their Rights under the Convention (2009) 34. The Committee notes with concern that disproportionately high numbers of indigenous children live in extreme poverty, a condition which has a negative impact on their survival and development. The Committee is furthermore concerned over the high infant and child mortality rates as well as malnutrition and diseases among indigenous children. Article 4 obliges States parties to address economic, social and cultural rights to the maximum extent of their available resources and where needed with international cooperation. Articles 6 and 27 provide the right of children to survival and development as well as an adequate standard of living. States should assist parents and others responsible for the indigenous child to implement this right by providing culturally appropriate material assistance and support programmes, particularly with regard to nutrition, clothing and housing. The Committee stresses the need for States parties to take special measures to ensure that indigenous children enjoy the right to an adequate standard of living and that these, together with progress indicators, be developed in partnership with indigenous peoples, including children. 35. The Committee reiterates its understanding of development of the child as set out in its general comment No. 5, as a \u201cholistic concept embracing the child\u2019s physical, mental, spiritual, moral, psychological and social development\u201d. 15 The Preamble of the Convention stresses the importance of the traditions and cultural values of each person, particularly with reference to the protection and harmonious development of the child. In the case of indigenous children whose communities retain a traditional lifestyle, the use of traditional land is of significant importance to their development and enjoyment of culture. 16 States parties should closely consider the cultural significance of traditional land and the quality of the natural environment while ensuring the children\u2019s right to life, survival and development to the maximum extent possible. 36. The Committee reaffirms the importance of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and calls on States to engage with indigenous peoples, including children, to ensure the full realisation of the MDGs with respect to indigenous children. In its General Observation (2009), the CRC Committee reiterates the close linkage between article 30 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: \u2018Both articles specifically provide for the right, in community with other members of his or her group, to enjoy his or her own culture, to profess and practise his or her own religion or to use his or her own language. The right established is conceived as being both individual and collective and is an important recognition of the collective traditions and values in indigenous cultures. The Committee notes that the right to exercise cultural rights among indigenous peoples may be closely associated with the use of traditional territory and the use of its resources.\u2019 Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) Article 8(j) of the Convention affirms the rights of \u201cindigenous and local communities\u201d over their \u201cknowledge, innovations and practices\u2026embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity\u201d and to be involved in their wider application and to participate in the equitable sharing arising from them.

States should ensure the full and free participation of indigenous people in all aspects of society, in particular in matters of concern to them. Considering the importance of the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous people, and the contribution of such promotion and protection to the political and social stability of the States in which such people live, States should, in accordance with international law, take concerted positive steps to ensure respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, on the basis of equality and non-discrimination, and recognise the value and diversity of their distinct identities, cultures and social organisation. Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2008) On 10 December 2008, on the 60th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR bringing the possibility of international justice one step closer for millions of excluded people, groups, communities, and peoples worldwide. The Optional Protocol will provide victims of ESC rights violations who are not able to get an effective remedy in their domestic legal system with an avenue to seek remedies at the international level. The Protocol provides options for individual and collective complaints, important for safeguarding the rights of indigenous peoples. UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity (2001) Adopted on 2 November 2001 the Declaration affirms the respect for the diversity of cultures, tolerance, dialogue and cooperation, in a climate of mutual trust and understanding are among the best guarantees of international peace and security. The Declaration proclaims that the defence of cultural diversity is an ethical imperative, inseparable from respect for human dignity. It implies a commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the rights of persons belonging to minorities and those of indigenous peoples. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 52 International Financial Institutions and Indigenous Peoples Asian Development Bank policy on IPs (2009) The Safeguard Policy Statement/SPS of June 2009 updates and consolidates into one policy statement three policies: the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), the Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and the Environment Policy (2002). ADB Safeguard Policy (2009) High population densities and rising demand for land for urban development and infrastructure have increased the risks associated with involuntary resettlement of people and the adverse impacts on such vulnerable groups as the poor and indigenous peoples. Of the 250 million indigenous peoples in the world, some 70 per cent are in Asia and the Pacific. Some 120 languages have become either endangered or extinct, demonstrating the threats to the culture and integrity of indigenous peoples. The challenge of preventing further impoverishment resulting from environmental degradation and involuntary resettlement, acknowledging the special needs and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups, and improving the policies and building the capacity of DMCs [developing member countries] to manage these impacts is acute. ...Experience with policy implementation has been mixed and key challenges remain, including the following: (i) recognition of indigenous peoples\u2019 cultural identity and rights to their ancestral lands and resources, (ii) fair sharing of development benefits among affected indigenous peoples communities and the rest of society, and (iii) meaningful and culturally appropriate consultation with indigenous peoples communities in planning and implementing projects that are likely to affect their lives. The SPS requires ADB to design and implement projects in a way that fosters full respect for indigenous peoples\u2019 identity, dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, and cultural uniqueness as defined by the indigenous peoples themselves so that they (i) receive culturally appropriate social and economic benefits, (ii) do not suffer adverse impacts as a result of projects, and (iii) can participate actively in projects that affect them.122 World Bank OP/BP 4.10 (2005) The revised policy on indigenous peoples was approved by the Executive Board in 2005. The updated policy OP/BP4.10 replaces the earlier policy (OD 4.20). The revised policy has retained the policy requirements of OD 4.20 that Bank-financed projects are designed not only to avoid adverse impacts but equally importantly to provide culturally appropriate benefits. For all projects that are proposed for Bank financing and affect indigenous peoples, the Bank requires the borrower to engage in a process of free, prior, and informed consultation.123 The 2005 Policy further requires that Bank-financed projects should include measures to (a) avoid potentially adverse effects on the indigenous peoples\u2019 communities; or (b) when avoidance is not feasible, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for such effects. Bank-financed projects are also designed to ensure that the indigenous peoples receive social and economic benefits that are culturally appropriate and gender and inter-generationally inclusive.124 122", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3097602-36ad-4ee6-abf1-1f9353a25f57": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3097602-36ad-4ee6-abf1-1f9353a25f57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-and-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG and Indigenous Peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-and-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4fea7cfd1472ccc87590e87176aa2a46012b541e9f9e56112f91fe2669e1dbde"}}, "hash": "4fea7cfd1472ccc87590e87176aa2a46012b541e9f9e56112f91fe2669e1dbde", "text": "For more details, see http://www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Safeguards/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-June2009.pdf 123 World Bank, Operational Policy 4.10: Indigenous Peoples, 2005, para 10. 124 Ibid., para 1. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 53 IADB Operational Policy on Indigenous Peoples (OP-765) and Strategy for Indigenous Development (2006) In 2006 the IADB adopted the OP with the objective of (a) Support the development with identity of indigenous peoples, including strengthening their capacities for governance. (b) Safeguard indigenous peoples and their rights against adverse impacts and exclusion in Bank funded development projects. The policy applies to the Inter-American Development Bank and the Multilateral Investment Fund. EBRD Environment and Social Policy (2008) The Environmental and Social Policy 2008 requires European Bank for Reconstruction and development/EBRD clients to meet key social provisions such as specific labor standards, and also include social and cultural impacts in their due diligence procedures. The new policy extends performance requirements to financial intermediaries, and it strengthens consultation procedures as well as project disclosure procedures. The policy also requires ensuring free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) of indigenous peoples any time an EBRD project affects their interests. The policy recognises the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and includes special measures to safeguard the rights of these communities. IFAD Engagement with Indigenous Peoples Policy (2009) The Policy on Engagement with Indigenous Peoples aims to enhance IFAD\u2019s development effectiveness in its engagement with indigenous peoples in rural areas. It sets out the principles of engagement IFAD will adhere to in its work with indigenous peoples, and the instruments, procedures and resources IFAD will deploy to implement them. The MDGs do not focus on certain issues of particular importance to indigenous peoples, such as land tenure or cultural rights, nor do the specific goals refer to indigenous peoples. There is an increasing concern that in the pursuit of aggregated country targets for poverty reduction and other MDGs, indigenous peoples are being left behind or, worse, impacted negatively.

Context Since the 1860s, when the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region was annexed to the British province of Bengal, policy makers approaches to the region have been marked by a desire to make the natural resources of the region profitable to successive administrations. Bangladesh, with an area of a little more than 130,000 square kilometers, is a small country roughly the size of England, but with a staggering population of 130 million. The southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts region covers about a tenth of the country but the region\u2019s population accounts for barely 1% of the national population.

The major policy imperatives of the British when they administered the region were twofold: (i) to increase revenue earnings; and (ii) to bring forth a stable administrative system. The first was achieved by the Imperial Forest Department appropriating the forest commons of the hill peoples and encouraging plough cultivation, which gave higher yields and consequently higher revenue than jum cultivation. The second objective was achieved partly by formalizing the rule of the most influential rajas or chiefs through a uniform system of local administration. After the birth of Pakistan (1947), the policies of the past were largely followed, but forest conservation proved to be even more difficult. Natural resource constraints and falling harvests from swidden (jum) land led to imaginative innovations in horticulture in the 1950s, led by the Bawm and Pangkhua and followed by the Chakma. The construction of the Kaptai Dam in 1960 affected both plough farmers and jum cultivators. The Jumias remains uncompensated. In response to the significant loss of farming land many farmers migrated to India or took up jum cultivation, an occupation that had been forsaken by their ancestors some generations before. The negative impacts of the Dam encompassing social, political, economic cultural and environmental dimensions were so deep that discontent with its effects fuelled antigovernment feelings and eventually led to the autonomy movement that began in early 1970s. (Roy, 2002b:1) Further, the government\u2019s policy to bring thousands of Bengali settlers in to the region, with the help of military and other security forces, created (and continues to create) more pressure on the use of natural resources. In 1979, as part of the anti-insurgency measures, the Government of Bangladesh (1979-1985) re-settled between 200,000 and 450,000 Bengali-speaking migrants from various parts of Bangladesh into all three hill districts of the CHT1.Reportedly there are still instances of further resettlement through covert government encouragement; however this phenomena requires further investigation. This is reflected in the issuing of commercial leases over CHT lands to outsiders in the 1980s and 90s. One of the effects of these policies was to heighten the political unrest that had started in the early 1970s. The CHT Accord of 1997 which brought to an end in insurgency has attempted to address many of the vital issues of the region including the issues of land dispute, devolution of land administration authority to the hill district councils, land grants to landless hill people and cancellation of non-resident leases\u2019. However there has been little or no implementation of the terms of the CHT Accord in the ten years since it 1 For explanation of the differing estimates see Adnan (2004:49). 3 was signed. Communications infrastructure in the CHT is rudimentary, and it does not have any industries that can have provided alternative employment to agriculture. Therefore, a very large part of the population of the region is dependent upon its natural resources for their sustenance or secondary and tertiary sources of livelihood. Despite the significant negative impacts of past and present policy approaches and decisions, there are positive developments also. Civil society, including local NGO leaders in the CHT, has become increasingly conscious about land rights, resource conflict, and existing standards for the protection of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. Vocal representatives of civil society and development practitioners have, in various local, national and international fora, demanded larger roles in the development process for indigenous and rural communities and further democratization of the CHT polity to allow more equitable representation for the less numerous indigenous peoples and for women. It is against this context that the researchers aim to examine the interface between indigenous systems of natural resource management and the formal government laws and policies applicable in the CHT. 1.2 Process Documentation The research location is the Chittagong Hill Tracts region in southeastern Bangladesh, encompassing the three hill districts of Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari. The case study attempts to understand existing patterns of natural resource management (NRM). The researchers observe that, in the case of NRM, the major causes of natural resource depletion are policy decisions historically originated from outside the Hill Tracts. Among these are the British colonial policies in the 19th century, and the forest and land policies of the post-colonial nation states of Pakistan and subsequently Bangladesh.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa601438-4375-4ac4-9694-d12bb11846f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa601438-4375-4ac4-9694-d12bb11846f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42416ecfd3416e88e9c2484e33105a3a329a42076db4f742e21bc7924916d3db"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8ab7bda-07d3-4905-957c-05a02c72b79c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5036fde1a89b06860608da217d0f4b635489de1031fb1c2be1d27134e14c4d17"}}, "hash": "582d147e9030bb20575c83895b84cbe3783c463cc163b6ca6a50e61b6105bd3c", "text": "The term \u2018natural resources\u2019, according to the indigenous respondents of this research, refers to all types of resources that originate in nature, including soils, hills, forests, rivers and other water bodies - both discovered and latent.

In order to secure a livelihood, the indigenous peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts have been using and preserving many of these natural resources for hundreds of years. The limited nature of available natural resources was already approaching crisis proportions by the 1950s, prior to the construction of the Kaptai Dam in 1960. (Sopher, 1963) A direct consequence of the construction of the Kaptai Dam and the Karnaphuli reservoir it created was the (so far) permanent inundation of two-fifths of the entire plough lands of the Hill Tracts and a large part of the Rangamati Reserve and other small reserved forests, further limiting the available resources in the Hill Tracts. The majority of indigenous peoples in Bangladesh reside in the frontier regions in the northwest, north, northeast, south and southeast of the country. The hilly portion of southeastern Bangladesh, known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts region, has the largest concentration of indigenous peoples in the country. The largest indigenous groups in the CHT are the Chakma, Marma, Tripura, Mru and Tanchangya, and together they 4 make up about 90% of the indigenous population of the region. The other indigenous peoples of the CHT are the Bawm, Chak, Khumi, Khyang, Lushai and Pankhua. The total indigenous population of the CHT, according to the 1991 Census, was 501,144. The Census done in 2001 is not ethnically disaggregated thus fails to project the total number of indigenous population in CHT. This study acknowledges that both internal socio-economic changes within the CHT and a variety of government-sponsored programmes have led to the erosion of customary resource rights. These include growing number of application for, and issue of, private titles among indigenous people; land occupation by Bengali settlers with the complicity of the security forces, and the subsequent conversion of common forest, swidden and grazing lands into private landholdings. The Bangladesh state has instituted a variety of policies to address the situation of the CHT, including deployment of the military, population transfer from lowland areas, development policies (forestry development in particular), on-going political negotiations, and limited devolution of authority to semi-autonomous units. These are briefly analyzed in the context of NRM. Further, the social and political dynamics of the different indigenous and settler groups on the basis of ethnicity, class and gender have been analyzed. Finally the study identifies the major gaps and challenges in protecting natural resources and in incorporating indigenous knowledge and systems in state recognized NRM practices to avoid further depletion of natural resources. This research is based on both primary and secondary data (published books, journals, reports, etc). Primary sources of data collection are based on field visits in three hill districts, observation, interaction through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and informal interviews with local leaders, Headman, karbari, development workers, and women participants. Unstructured discussions were held in many places, such as in bazaars or market centers, and within researve forest areas to discuss how previously natural resources were protected in different parts of Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari districts. Personal observation and the research experience of the core researcher and the advisor is also another important tool of data analysis to fulfill the objectives of the research. A local consultation meeting was held in 19 February in one hill district where 60 indigenous participants came from three hill districts, including indigenous participants from Monipuri and Khasi community located in greater Sylhet. Specific Objectives of the Research \u2022 To review and analyze current laws & policies regarding NRM, land tenure and resource access \u2022 To assess the current situation of access & control over natural resources \u2022 To identify operational guidelines regarding indigenous people\u2019 access to NR (Forest, Land, etc). \u2022 To explore the roles of Local and National Institutions \u2022 To identify the gaps and challenges 2. Major Natural Resources in the CHT The most important categories of lands in the CHT include government managed forests, community managed forests, swidden (jum), grazing and grassland commons, 5 water bodies and privately owned lands. Apart from forest produce and these land types, important natural resources include minerals and gas. 2.1 Government Managed Forests The reserved forests (\u201cRFs\u201d) constitute the most important category of government- owned forests areas in the CHT, covering about a quarter of the region.

The smaller RFs together cover only 15,018 acres (24 square miles), while the four largest ones \u2013 namely Reingkhyong RF, Kassalong RF, Sangu RF and Matamuhri RFs.(Webb & Roberts, 1976: 2). Remaining stands of natural forest in the CHT are confined to the northern Kassalong RF and the Sangu RF. Large sections of the middle and southern Kassalong RF and the other RFs \u2013 apart from the Sangu RF - were converted into planted woodlands, particularly for teak, beginning in the British period, and followed in the Pakistani (1947-1971) period and after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, up to the present day. Due to the high price of teak, the teak plantations have been badly affected by theft, including through the connivance of corrupt government officials. In some parts, the Department of Forest (DOF) has planted pulpwood and other \u201csoftwood\u201d species to provide raw material for paper and pulp industries, particularly around the industrial centres of Kaptai and Chandraghona within Rangamati district. In the creation of both of the above types of plantations, there has been a net loss of biological diversity, and denial of access of indigenous communities. From a regional CHT perspective, one can see differing situations in different parts of the forest areas. Very large parts of the RFs \u2013 particularly the central Reingkgyong RF \u2013 have been denuded of large tree cover, most significantly since the 1970s (Webb & Roberts). The situation in the northern Kassalong RF and Sangu RF has worsened too, both on account of logging of the remaining natural forests by the BFIDC, accelerated by connecting the road depot at Baghaihat Bazar in Kassalong RF and Alikwadang (\u201cAlikadam\u201d), near Sangu RF, to the national highway network, and the increase of settlements of conflict-affected internally displaced people (Roy & Gain, 1999:22, Roy, 2002: 27). The DOF manages these forests, although the DOF does not appear to have any direct control over the more remote areas. Regional institutions and district and sub-district administrations have little or no role in the affairs of these areas. By default the communities residing in the remoter parts of these areas left to manage their own affairs. Most depend upon swidden or jum cultivation for their major source of livelihood, supplemented with limited cash income from the sale of spices, dried chilly peppers, and cattle (including the semi-wild bison or Bos Frontalis). 2.2 Community Managed Forests The most important category of community-managed forests is the mauza forest commons or village common forests (\u201cVCFs\u201d). These are mostly small (average: 50- 300 acres), consisting of naturally grown or regenerated vegetation, and are 6 traditionally managed, protected and utilized by village communities under the leadership of the mauza Headmen and village karbaries (traditional elders). The existence of these forests is acknowledged in the CHT Regulation of 1900 (at Rule 41A), the main legal instrument for the administration of the region. A number of ancillary executive orders of the district administrations were passed during the British period (circa 1930s) and in the Pakistan period (circa 1960s), but have otherwise suffered from policy neglect since then (Roy & Halim, 2001b; Roy, 2004 b). Although the law does recognize the existence of VCFs, it does not recognize the full ownership rights of the community concerned or provide express safeguards against alienation and privatization. This responsibility would appear to rest upon the mauza headman without whose advise land grants are generally not made in the CHT, although some notable exceptions exist.2 2.3 Swidden Grazing & Other Commons Apart from the DOF-administered RFs, traditional commons used for swidden cultivation, grazing, gathering of thatch and other grasses, as cremation grounds and graveyards are situated within the mauza boundaries, and most are not registered as a separate category of lands in the land registers. The indigenous communities and their headmen and karbaries, possess knowledge about them as handed down through the generations. Communities regard these commons as their \u201cproperty\u201d to manage or use as the community collectively decides, or in some cases, as the influential headmen and karbaries suggest.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcbdd8b1-3710-4dfc-97be-3fb510067b72": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcbdd8b1-3710-4dfc-97be-3fb510067b72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6913c403f13516b02da6b302ed0f5d05b396f5d919ec79a4f119719630975aa"}, "2": {"node_id": "74d77431-374c-44e2-827d-9cdbd03958d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bda7c8774b10302325c86c0e283414c6215607d29cfb98850641e3192edf70d"}}, "hash": "7d1325cfaa4cf7d44d9b5ffdbd54028acc8c73adaeec87df8603d3ccae5b139b", "text": "In the eyes of most plains officials of the district and sub- district administrations, these are \u201ckhas\u201d lands belonging to the state.

No legal or documentary formalities are involved. However, the biggest disadvantage is that, as in the case of the mauza forests mentioned above, there are no formal written records that recognize these lands as a separate category of forest, utilized community forests for swidden, or grazing or other activities. Therefore, the risk of these lands being taken, especially where the mauza headmen are bypassed, or if the headman himself is party to such land transfer. Therefore legal and administrative reforms are required to both maintain such flexibility, and yet bring about entrenched safeguards, including through the vesting of major resource management responsibilities upon an elected local body. In other words, the land management responsibilities of the headmen need to be strengthened while at the same time providing checks and balances upon the headmen\u2019s authority by subjecting it to the scrutiny and consultative prerogatives of the general public of the mauzas. 2.4 Water Bodies 2 The most well known exceptions were the land grants to Bengali settlers during the population transfer programme of the 1980s, and commercial land leases to non-resident entrepreneurs and industrialists in the 1980s and 90s. 7 As in the case of forest and other commons mentioned in sections 2.2. and 2.3 above, customary law treats all water bodies as common property, although this is not reflected in the land registry documents, as government officials prefer to regard such resources state property. Some parts of the Karnafuli reservoir have been leased out for fisheries, but so far, privatization of water bodies is not a major issue of contention in the CHT, while this can of course change. Due to massive deforestation of the government-managed reserved forests \u2013 including several headwater reserves (isuch as the Maini, Thega, Subalong and others), - river-bank erosion and siltation of the river and reservoir beds is a major problem in the CHT. Ultimately, one cannot but hold the colonialist pattern of RF management responsible for this. The stark contrast in the case of the mauza reserves illustrates the point; streams and other aquifers situated within the community-managed mauza reserve forests are generally well protected from bank erosion and siltation. Had indigenous communities been involved in RF management and ownership, the overall situation of the RFs in the CHT today might have been quite different. Thus, the examples of the RFs suggest that the right of the indigenous communities over these water bodies \u2013 as owners and managers \u2013 needs to be recognized. 2.5 Privately Owned Tree Plantations There are two major categories of privately owned tree plantations in the CHT. There are those that belong to non-resident lessees based in major cities outside the CHT, and there are the smaller tree plantations of indigenous farmers and town-dwellers. Although the exact area of these lands is not known, the extent of indigenous people\u2019s plantations is much larger than that of the absentee lessees. Teak and gmelina \u2013 a valuable timber species \u2013 are the favourite species for plantations, with kori and other local species predominating. The system of plantation generally involves the taungya method, an innovated form of agro-forestry based upon the swidden or jum method whereby a swidden farm includes tree planting along with the usual crops. Thus, after the first, or subsequent harvest of upland rice and other crops, the canopy of the planted teak and other trees \u2013 along with that of the naturally regenerated Kori and other trees \u2013 spreads and converts the land into a plantation in a few years. This technology has also been used for the government reserves, but official sources seldom acknowledge the indigenous roots of this innovated technology in contravention of the Convention on Biological Diversity (Roy, 2004). The biggest problem surrouding privately owned tree plantations is the cumbersome and corrupt permit process. According to one estimate, about 50% of the harvest sales value is spent in obtaining permission to bring this same harvest to market (ADB: 38), as a timber extraction and export permit is mandatory. Despite this problem, tree plantations are on the rise, since the timber is a good source of wealth for otherwise impoverished farmers. Simplification of the permit process and government assistance through land grants and credit facilities would greatly enhance tree and bamboo production. Indigenous farmers\u2019 plantations are generally far better maintained and protected than the government-owned ones, and this is again another area where the indigenous communities have demonstrated their superior knowledge and management skills, largely unnoticed by policymakers in Dhaka and elsewhere. 2.6 Other Privately Owned Lands", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3df4e1e-fe5c-4eb7-a16e-9ce56995a6de": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3df4e1e-fe5c-4eb7-a16e-9ce56995a6de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b42e809f017241c44075831c10ae983adb479834d79aadb86998857f6e4f151"}}, "hash": "3b42e809f017241c44075831c10ae983adb479834d79aadb86998857f6e4f151", "text": "8 Other relevant types of privately owned lands, excluding market and urban centres, are the orchards and fruit gardens. The most favoured species in the CHT is pineapple, but due to the fickle price and the perishability of the commodity, and the short harvest season, expanded production is not possible. Soil erosion is a serious problem facing orchard farmers. According to soil scientists the soils of the CHT are suitable mainly for forestry and fruit gardens. The sloping lands do not permit irrigation-oriented plough or hoe agriculture. Here too local innovation has produced some positive results, such as in the case of developing banana plantations through an innovated swidden. 2.7 Mineral & Other Resources In partnership with foreign companies, the government has been exploring the potential for exploiting the gas resources of the Sylhet region. In recent years the Government of Bangladesh has conducted seismic surveys in the CHT in partnership with international gas and oil companies. This has been cause of concern to some people in the CHT because mining may pose a threat to the local environment, and threaten the rights of the jum cultivators. The demand of the indigenous leaders is that is that if mining is to be conducted in the CHT, it should only be done with the prior and informed consent of the peoples of the region. Further, if such consent is provided, mining should be done in such a way so as to avoid any dislocation, and to ensure that the hill district council get their share of royalties, as provided for in the CHT Accord of 1997 and the Hill District Council Acts of 1989 (Roy, 2004:2). Examples of mineral extraction in other parts of Bangladesh do no bode well for further development of this industry in the CHT. In greater Dinajpur in four upazilla where approximately 50,000 thousand indigenous people are living (in nine unions and sixty-seven villages) the Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pvt LtD under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) was planning to establish Phulbari coalmine project. To stop the proposed open-pit extraction of coal, civil society, the National Adivasi Parishad (greater North Bengal), the National Committee for the Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Energy and Port, Citizens Committee for the Protection of Gas, Oil and Coal, under the auspicious of the Economic Association had organized several protest meetings, rallies and seminars. IIndigenous activists are arguing that the proposed coal mine is violation of ILO 107. On 26 August 2006 at least seven people were killed and 300 injured as BDR (Bangladesh Rifles) opened fire on a demonstration while it was advancing towards the office of Asia Energy in Dinajpur. Thousands of demonstrators, mainly farmers and indigenous people including women armed with bows and arrows and sticks, joined the protest against the massive eviction and loss of farmland that was expected as a result of the Phulbari coalmine project (Star, August 27, 2006). This has become the serious concern of indigenous peoples because coal extraction is going to displace them from the ancestral land like their fellow indigenous peoples in CHT when Kaptai dam was built in 1960. Most of the indigenous people living in the flood zone of the Kaptai dam had recorded documents for the land; however the government is disregarding it and has now offered compensation. The government, after negotiating with the protesters, announced that it had agreed to say \u201cno\u201d to Asia Energy and instructed them to wrap up from Bangladesh and no open-pit mineral will be allowed in the country (Star, August 31, 2006). However, Asia Energy in a statement said it has not received any communication from the government that it is 9 canceling agreements with the company (Star, September 1, 2006). The agreement to withdraw is yet to be implemented by the government. The people from Phulbari are saying that government has betrayed them. The risk of permanent eviction from drilling sites cannot be ruled out. If these matters are not negotiated in an equitable manner it will adversely affect the indigenous people and other Bangladeshi people living within the project area potentially leading to dislocation and further unrest. 3 3. Law and Policy 3.1 National Forest Policy The Government of Bangladesh has several policy documents on forestry. These include the National Forestry Policy (1979 amended in 1994) and the Forestry Master Plan (1994-2013). In addition, the government\u2019s policy can also is observed from its various programmes and projects. The First National Forest Policy for Bangladesh of July 8, 1979 was not significantly different from comparable policies of the pre- independence period.

No attention was given to \u201cpeople\u2019s participation\u201d in the management of forest resources in the country (Halim, 1999: 86). The current forest policy was adopted in 1994 and officially announced on 31 May, 1995 (Bangladesh Gazette, July 6, 1995, pp 241-244). The policy initiated a 20-year Forestry Master Plan (FMP). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) took leading roles in preparing the FMP. The plan aims to optimize the forestry sector\u2019s ability to stabilize environmental conditions and assist economic and social development. Three imperatives were identified: sustainability, efficiency and people\u2019s participation. These agendas are in tune with the Forest Principles, which were adopted along with Agenda 21 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio, in Brazil in 1992 (Mustafa, 2002: 118). In addition to these framework policies, the most important forestry related law of Bangladesh is the Forest Act of 1927 (amended in 2000), from the British period, and which continues to apply \u2013 in amended form - in India as well. Statistics on the extent of forests in Bangladesh tend to vary considerably from one source to another. The Forestry Sector Master Plan (FSMP) is considered as the key reference source; and its statistics are cited widely. According to the FSMP, forested land accounts for 2.56 million hectares or 17.8% of the total land area of Bangladesh. This includes classified forestland (1.49 m ha), unclassified forestland (0.73 m ha), state forestland (2.22 m ha), village forestlands or home gardens (0.27 m ha), and tea estates and rubber gardens (0.07 m ha) (GoB 1993). The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS1999) estimates that the total forestland in the country is about 2.25 million hectares, i.e., about 14% of the total land area of Bangladesh. The World Bank (1997) reported that Bangladesh had forest cover of about 1.47 million hectares or 11% of the total land area and that 6% of the forestlands had a tree cover of at least 3 This finding is based on the interviews and FGDs with Anil Marand, Rabindra Shoren, (President & Secretary Jatiyo Adivasi Parishad & others) by the team leader, research associate and the adviser in Phulbari, August 2006. 10 20%. However, the striking reality is that much of the country\u2019s designated \u2018forestland\u2019 is devoid of trees (Khan et.al. 2004: 17). (See Appendix I for stock of Forest). The forest laws and policies of the British period rejected recognition of community management of forests in favour of management through a government agency, namely, the Forestry Department. This department had two key functions, policing (or enforcement) and administration. It has been observed that the evolution of public forest policy and practice in post-colonial nation states in South Asia (including Bangladesh) manifest two interrelated trends: (i) state-sponsored commercialization of forestry; and (ii) the progressive alienation of forest based communities from forest use and management (Khan, 2001). The depletion of forest resources begun under colonial administrations continued unabated. The government of Bangladesh has responded to the problem of deforestation in many ways, including by undertaking \u201csocial forestry\u201d projects in degraded forest areas, imposing stricter penalties for theft of forest produce, declaration of moratoria on the extraction and sale of certain forest produce and so forth. In 2000, the GoB passed the Forest (Amendment) Act, 2000 (hereafter \u201cthe 2000 Act\u201d), which amended certain provisions of Forest Act of 1927 and formally introduced the concept of social forestry. This law has however been severely criticized as being \u201canti- environment\u201d and \u201canti-people\u201d (Roy & Halim 2001; Halim and Roy; 2006:5; RIPP). The Social Forestry Rules of 2004 were passed in accordance with the newly introduced sections 28 (4) and 28 (5) of the 1927 Act. These rules contain detailed provisions for social forestry projects, and ethnic minorities (includes those groups legally classified as indigenous, tribal or aboriginal) are among those that are to be given priority in selection as beneficiaries of the project along with landless people and destitute women (Roy, 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b44ec84-8094-419e-a2d8-eaa83a582de2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b44ec84-8094-419e-a2d8-eaa83a582de2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b6caf6b69863cb50274f77df8f31c78e56dbd2b75bae846470a697eb611fbc7"}, "2": {"node_id": "14fc9c1a-9c75-4178-a237-a468219cef27", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99a457b1320b84b91fd35676085323670a055c1c8e8cab5bc92f0af4738da29f"}}, "hash": "e36acb1fe4bb1f72505e69f2453a99cb996ac73e18a9c18e27bfe4e2446b4418", "text": "The 1927 Act provided limited scope for recognition of common user rights of the forest dwelling communities.

Some of these measures were provided for in major policy documents such as the successive National Forestry Policies of 1979 and 1994 and the National Forestry Master Plan of 1994. Despite improved provisions for people\u2019s participation however, the emphasis on raising revenue and meeting industrial needs was not to change. Although forestry programmes of a more participatory nature were also implemented, the Forestry Department has consistently failed in its obligations and commitments to provide extension services to village communities or homestead foresters. At the international level, the government continues to participate in various fora on forestry and biodiversity. Yet, on the ground, the situation continued to spiral in a negative direction, apart for some very limited exceptions, including the strip plantation project that involved the raising of trees on roads, embankment and dam 11 strips. It is in the strip plantation programme direct participation of people mostly women were ensured and regarded as more participatory. (Halim, 1999). 3.1.1 Management of Forestry Forests in Bangladesh can broadly be classified into the following categories: \u2022 Hill forests \u2022 Un-classified state forests \u2022 Plain land state forests \u2022 Mangrove forests \u2022 Coastal forests, and \u2022 Home gardens Classified government forestlands including reserved, acquired and vested forests are managed by the Forestry Department (FD). Privately owned plantations, tea estates, home gardens, etc are under private ownership. Between these two categories are what the Forestry Department refers to as \u2018un-classed state forests\u2019 (USF), which are under the control of the Ministry of Land. The land administration authorities generally regard these areas as khas (state-owned) lands while at the same time these lands are regarded by resident indigenous peoples as their traditional commons. These differing perspectives on the ownership and management of these lands, coupled with lack of interagency coordination, especially between the Forest and Land Revenue departments, makes the management of these lands complex. There has been a decline of 17% in the resource base of these forested lands in Bangladesh over the last 25 years (Bhuiyan, 1994; cited in Khan, et al, 2004:20). In comparison, home gardens have been far better managed. In addition, in the CHT there are the community- managed mauza reserves or village common forests and small plantations of farmers discussed above. 3.2 National Land Policy After independence Bangladesh reformed the land laws of the country in the Land Reform Policy of 1972. The major characteristics of this policy are: \u2022 The ceiling of maximum land ownership, which was fixed earlier at 125 acres or 375 bighas, was reduced to 33.33 acres or 100 bighas. \u2022 The surplus land acquired by the government was decided to distribute among the peasants. \u2022 The new diluvial as well as accelerated land would be acquired by the government and regarded as khas land \u2022 Land owners having holding less than 25 bighas or 4.33 acres were exempted from paying land revenue \u2022 A law relating to usufructory mortgage was adopted for a period of 7 years. Further changes were introduced in 1984 with an amended Land Reform Policy which brought about the following changes: \u2022 Reduction of the maximum land ceiling from 100 bighas to 62 bighas. 12 \u2022 Introduction of an ordinance prohibiting benami transactions i.e. purchase or transfer of land in the name of another person to conceal the actual possession of land holding. \u2022 Prohibition of eviction of people from a paternal homestead \u2022 Introduction of an ordinance recognizing the rights of bargdari or share croppers whereby the landowner would get one third of the produce and the share cropper one third for his labour and remaining one third would be distributed according to the proportion of the cost of cultivation borne by each In 1997, the government has additionally created a policy for distribution of khas land, identifying the following applicable groups for land distribution. \ufffd Landless families without a homestead and dependent on agriculture \ufffd Landless families with homesteads and dependent on agriculture It can been seen from these policies and laws that the government has introduced a number of efforts aimed a alleviating poverty and addressing issues of landlessness and mis-management. However the majority of the above described laws remain largely unimplemented. The reasons for such intractable non-implementation of policies over decades are deep seated. Barkat points to issues of inept and corrupt governance, alliances between wealthy and influential people to side-step national law, the innate power structures and class system in Bangladesh, widespread corruption and powerful market forces \u2013 among others.

The Act applies all over the country, but its application to the semi-autonomous CHT region is subject to the extent of its consistency with the CHT Regulation of 1900 and the rules framed there under (Roy, 2002). According to the CHT Regional Council Act of 1998, the government is obliged to consult the CHT Regional Council prior to the passage of any new laws on the hill region, although such consultation did not occur for the 2000 Forest Law amendment. Another recently passed set of rules, the Social Forestry Rules of 2004 which were developed through consultation over some years beforehand, has also been heavily criticized by indigenous people and environmentalists for being contrary to human rights (Roy & Halim, 2001a:6). The SF Rule provide for social forestry programmes involving the Forest Department, NGOs and landless rural residents (Ibid). Foresters today recognize four kinds of forestland in the CHT. These are as follows: \ufffd Reserved forest or RF which covers about a quarter of the CHT; administered by the FD; \ufffd Protected forests (PF) which covered about 1% of the CHT but most of which have recently been re-categorized as RF; administered by the District Collectorate and forest resources are controlled and managed by the FD; \ufffd Private forests, most of which are owned by small-scale indigenous farmers, except for a few plantations owned by non-resident individuals and companies based in 13 cities outside the CHT (their extent is unknown); and \ufffd Unclassed state forest or USF which covers the rest of the CHT; USFs are a residual category of partly forested land under the control of the District Collectorate and District Councils, in conjunction with mauza headmen, which the indigenous peoples consider as their own forest and swidden commons. (Source: Roy, 2002a: 16-17). The indigenous peoples of the CHT began to lose control over and access to many of their forests under the British colonial government, which took over the direct administration of the region. The trend of extending state control continued during the Pakistan-administered period (1947-1971) and has reinforced by the successive Bangladeshi governments from 1971 to this day, barring a few exceptions that brought in somewhat more participatory approaches to forest management. Section 28 (1) of the 1927 Forest Act empowers the government to assign to any community the right to own and/or manage any land that has been declared a reserved forest. Since significant numbers of indigenous people live within reserved forest areas, in the CHT and in other parts of Bangladesh (such as northeastern Sylhet division, in the north-central greater Mymensingh, and within Chittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazar districts of Chittagong division), this provision has important implications for their rights. Section 5.1 of this report will discuss the situation of reserved forest communities of indigenous peoples in the CHT and elsewhere. In practice, however, this law has been invoked in a limited manner only in Sylhet division. This means that indigenous communities living in the reserved forests in the CHT, Cox\u2019s Bazar and elsewhere continue to have no formally recognized right over the lands in which they live (Roy & Halim 2001a:21 & Roy, 2006: 9) Apart from the provisions for social forestry, the major part of the 2000 Act deals with activities that are prohibited within reserved forest (RFs) and protected Forests (PFs) under sanction of imprisonment. Many RF and PF residents cultivate wet-rice and upland rice in RFs and PFs in the CHT (Roy &Halim, 2001a:13). Thus these types of sanctions have major implications for their rights and livelihoods. With a narrow interpretation of the 1927 Forest Act, the ownership rights over reserved forests are vested in the state alone, all other minor rights, if any, of RF residents, are regarded at best as \u2018concessions\u2019 (Roy & Halim 2001a:9). The British Indian Forest Department used to consider the categorization of forestlands into \"reserved forests\" as the most efficient way to manage and protect forests, yet much of these lands were cleared of their natural stands and converted into industry-oriented plantations. This policy is essentially being followed until today by both the successor Pakistani and Bangladeshi Departments of Forest.

From the 1990s up to the first few years of the new millennium, the government has continued to expand its area of reserved forests within the CHT, a process that has been vehemently resisted by indigenous farmers who rallied round a mass organization known as the Movement for the Protection of Forest and Land Rights in the CHT (Roy, C.K., 2000:178-180). The last major forests of heterogeneous stands are confined to small parts of the Kassalong and Sangu reserves. The USF lands are regarded as being owned by the state, but they also contain the common lands of hill peoples, including those that are used for their homesteads, swidden cultivation, grazing lands, village common forests, and other needs (Adnan, 2004:120). The USFs have been subjected to heavy illicit commercial exploitation. In addition to this, private forests have been built up a by a number of hill peoples, involving \u2018tree farming\u2019 on lands under their possession. The largest section of the \u201cUSFs\u201d that still contain large trees, bamboo brakes or other dense vegetation and wildlife include the mauza reserves or village forest commons that are managed by indigenous village communities. By law, the mauza headmen are formally charged with the management and administration of these forests, but there seems to be clear policy neglect concerning the protection of these forests on the part of the government (Halim & Roy, 2006; Roy & Halim, 2001b). 3.4 Land Laws of CHT Unlike in the case of the forest-related laws, policies on the ownership and use of non- forest CHT lands underwent significant shifts, starting from the British period through the Pakistani period and post-independence Bangladesh. Private leases for plough lands started to be recognized in the first quarter of the 19th century. Private ownership of hillside lands, however, was recognized only since the 1950s (Roy, 2002a; Roy 2002b). However a more drastic change, at least in the eyes of the indigenous people, was to come with the opening up of land ownership within the CHT to non-resident individual and corporate bodies. An amendment to Rule 34 of the CHT Regulation of 1900 in 1971, and then again in 1979 (the 1979 law is almost a verbatim copy of the 1971 law) reducing the area of unclaimed public land that could be settled or leased out to local farmers from 25 acres to 5-10 acres (Roy, 2002:19-20; Roy & Halim, 2003). At the same time, the new law allowed non-residents to acquire land rights within the CHT for homesteads, commercial plantations and industrial plants. In the case of the latter, leases for hundreds of acres could now be obtained (by non-residents) without the knowledge and consent of the Chiefs and headmen, which was hitherto nearly impossible. This was contrary to the letter and spirit of the CHT Regulation, which regarded the CHT primarily as a homeland for its indigenous peoples, and whose primacy with regard to land and resource rights was guaranteed as against outsiders. The main land laws for the CHT are contained in the CHT Regulation of 1900 (Act I of 1900) and in the Hill District Council Acts of 1989. With a narrow interpretation of the forest and land laws of the CHT, as is usually given by land administration and Forest and Fisheries Department officials, it is the 15 state which is the absolute owner of these resources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67311bfa-5f8f-4193-94ea-280ce8f0e746": {"__data__": {"id_": "67311bfa-5f8f-4193-94ea-280ce8f0e746", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b6d50334350ebb620a20a8bcc34f3126f3ff46e9bb70c2c7c1e222bbf33da88"}, "2": {"node_id": "c27803b3-1482-4635-a806-049393ad2739", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5fc5439f6cabfe891219a51b75abcd7e563bfe6a9684328d143cc3d77f793538"}}, "hash": "afa6db6deda5be1fea371b3cfbfeff9a0937ba6624d23a2cd272a2ac0e072ed7", "text": "However, when we try to interpret the land and forest laws from a more pluralistic perspective, it is apparent that the state cannot totally exclude the local inhabitants\u2019 rights over their common resources, as the people are the owners of all state property according to the national constitution (Roy, 2002: 20, 21).

The table below mentions the most important customary resources rights of CHT. The CHT laws mentioned above contain the most substantial provisions with regard to land administration in the CHT, but these are not the only sources of land law. Other important sources include customary law and the executive orders of the deputy commissioners (who are vested with powers of the collectorate at the district level). Some of the customary rights of the hill people have been directly acknowledged by formal legislation. These include the right to \"occupy\" homestead land (Rule 50, CHT Regulation) and the right to use timber, bamboo and other \u201cminor forest resources\u201d for domestic purposes (Rule 41A, CHT Regulation, CHT Forest Transit Rules, 1973) (See Appendix II). Some customary rights are indirectly acknowledged by the CHT Regulation, such as the right to engage in jum cultivation (Rule 41), and to use forest resources for domestic purposes (Rule 41A) without actually defining such land use as a \u201cright\u201d. Rule 41 A of the CHT Regulation is directly protecting forest produce gathering rights. Yet other rights such as regarding hunting and the use of water resources, remain without any formal recognition at all (Roy, 2002b:25). The table below identifies some of these customary rights, including both those that are formally recognized and those that are not.

Both of the aforesaid laws were passed in accordance with the provisions of the CHT Accord of 1997. 3.6 The CHT Accord of 1997 Despite its various shortcomings, the CHT Accord of 1997 provides a reasonable basis upon which some of the aforesaid issues can be reasonably addressed, if not redressed in whole. Apart from recognizing the legislative prerogative of the CHT councils, the Accord and subsequent legislation provide two important safeguards for indigenous peoples and other residents of the CHT, although they are yet to be acted upon. One of these is the devolution of land administration to the hill district councils, without whose consent no lands are to be settled, leased out, mortgaged, transferred or compulsorily acquired (section 64, Hill District Council Acts, 1989). The other is the resolution of land related disputes by a Commission on Land that is required to adjudicate in accordance with the \"laws, practices and usages of the CHT\" (CHT Land Commission Act, 2000) (Roy and Halim, 2003).

Institutional Framework: Land & Forest Management in the CHT 4.1 Land Administration Systems in CHT There are two major types of land administration systems currently working in the CHT, one for the reserved forest areas and another for the rest of the region. The latter are administered by the Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD), while the former are administered by several authorities, including traditional headmen at the local levels, by Upazila Nirbahi Officers (UNOs) at the upazilla or sub-district levels, sometimes aided by Assistant Commissioners (AC) (Land), and the Deputy Commissioners (DCs) at the district level. The DCs are aided by the ADC (Revenue). The DC is responsible to Divisional Commissioner, who is in turn responsible to the Board of Land Administration and the Ministry of Land. In addition, the hill district councils exercise supervisory jurisdiction. 4.2 Categories of Land Grants in CHT The different categories of land grants and the identity of the authorities concerned are provided in the table below. Table II Categories of Land Grants in CHT Use of land Identity of Leases Nature of Grant Granting authority Amount (Acres) Homestead (rural) Hill people Freehold Headman 0.30 acres (0.13 ha) Homestead (rural) Any person Leasehold DC Unspecified Homestead (urban) Any Person Leasehold DC Up to 0.30 acres (0.13 ha) Plough cultivation CHT residents Freehold DC Up to 5 acres (2.25 ha) Orchard\\Plantation CHT residents Freehold DC Up to 10 acres (4.5 ha) Commercial plantation Any Person Leasehold DC Up to 25 acres (11.25 ha) Commercial plantation Any Person Leasehold Commissioner Up to 50 acres (22.5 ha) Commercial plantation Any Person Leasehold Government Above 100 acres (40.5 ha) Industries Any Person Leasehold DC 5-10 acres (2.25-4.5 ha) Source: Roy (2000a) 4.3 Department of Forest in the CHT 18 In the CHT, the reserved forests are under the charge of two Conservators of Forest who are responsible to the Chief Conservator of Forests who reports to the Ministry of Environment and Forest. Other than for the administration of civil and criminal justice, the CHT self-government system has no role in the administration of these areas. 4.4 The Hill District Councils The administration of the CHT is pluralistic in that it includes traditional, bureaucratic and elective regional authorities with specific and sometimes concurrent responsibilities (Roy, 2000). The district councils - called hill district councils (HDCs) - administer various \u201ctransferred\u201d subjects at the district level, like primary education, health and public health engineering, fisheries and livestock, small and cottage industries, etc. In accordance with the Hill District Council Acts of 1989 (as amended in 1998), the HDCs are to exercise the most important land administration powers in the CHT, including on settlements and leases, transfers and compulsory acquisitions. No such parallels exist in the plains. However, in reality, administration of land, forests other than reserved forests, law and order, secondary education, etc. are yet to be formally and fully transferred to the HDCs. The CHT Regional Council (RC) supervises the work of the HDCs, general administration and local government institutions. The vast majority of these offices are held by indigenous people, who are predominantly male. 4.5 The District & Sub-District Administrations This administrative set-up includes the institutions of the deputy commissioners (DCs), in charge of the administrative districts, and their subordinate staff, including the Upazilla Nirbahi Officers (UNOs).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "046f4c69-9cdd-44e0-9871-53410fc5baa8": {"__data__": {"id_": "046f4c69-9cdd-44e0-9871-53410fc5baa8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe383b886fbbbc2c3e6707d93e317d9e45d1d852e64f542564f0be2712828d6d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e048e09a-dd21-4d21-b46e-3386c3fe7929", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b17962580e51fbcf244944ecd6d45137d3a95ef9bf57aba8210a8ce9e738c0ac"}}, "hash": "f2b1b81a225e63ccfea582f66cae874377214a18fd13573ed86e89a44de7ecdf", "text": "4.6 The Traditional Administration The areas outside the reserved forests are generally known, administratively, as the \u201cmauza-circle\u201d lands, as they are sub-divided into geographical units known as \u201ccircles\u201d under circle chiefs or rajas, and below them, \u201cmauzas\u201d, under the mauza headmen (mauza chiefs or heads).8 The headmen are responsible for resource management, land and revenue administration, maintenance of law and order, and administration of traditional justice.

In the CHT, however, it is also a unit for civil and judicial administration under the mauza headmen (predominantly male and largely from among the hillpeople), who number about 350. 19 In some state reserve forests, despite numerous instances of oppressive state action including arrest, prosecution, communities have been able to retain their possession, and at least partial control, of their homesteads and farmlands and avoid expulsion from their lands. To illustrate, in the Southern Reinghkhyong reserve near the Farua village the livelihoods of the inhabitants\u2019 are based on subsistence-based agriculture. Some farmers have opted for red chillies, tobacco production and jum cultivation. Although the state has the absolute de jure control over these forests the forest based indigenous communities have become the de facto managers of this reserve. In a similar manner in Northern Kassalong most of the inhabitants are internally displaced people exercising de facto management and practicing mixed agriculture. This amount of autonomy over the management of RFs by the forest-based communities is only possible because most of these communities\u2019 settlements are in remote locations. It has been observed by the researchers that those forest areas which are physically in remote locations the FD for whatever reason has limited interference and the formal management is extremely weak. These forest-based communities are socially and economically extremely disadvantaged communities and have no choice other than to be dependent on these RFs. Since these inhabitants have no ownership over the trees; these RFs are getting denuded quickly. The researchers further observed that the tendency to grow trees (re-vegetate) is low. The FD has appointed Forest Headmen (not to be confused with the more influential mauza headman in the mauza circle areas) to hold the influential leadership positions in the reserve forest areas, apart from the elected chairpersons and the members of the small union council areas (where the union council system has extended). Neither the elected representatives nor the Forest Headmen can exert effective power to take some measures for the communities. This is largely because these Forest Headman have to depend upon the FD to retain their offices, and moreover even they cannot call their homesteads their own land. For instance petitions were sent to the government to de-reserve a small area to enable the community get state subsidies for their school; however such subsidies could not be applied for in accordance with the Education Department rules which required school land to be formally registered as the property of the school managing committee, illegal in a reserved forest area (Roy, 2004; Mexico). The reserved forest communities are technically quatters on their own lands, and cannot take any strong initiatives to lobby for their land rights and other facilities. They constantly live under the shadow of quit notices and prosecution as illegal squatters on state land, despite having lived in the areas for decades, or centuries. Theoretically, their situation is, in some respects, worse than that of the indigenous inhabitants of the mauza circle areas. In the words of a Taunchangya leader that for the purpose of easy patrolling of the military in Reinghkhyong Reserve many trees have been felled. In this regard forest department could not play any role to stop such felling in terms of the question of providing security in the aforesaid area. Moreover, he pointed out that in Reinghkhyong area approximately 600 acres of forestland is under plough cultivation. The forest-based communities demands for freeing the cultivable forest land and villages from the RF administration and declared them as mauza forest or provide leases against the families living within the RF. Tejendrolal Taunchangya, Former UP Chairman, Farua U.P.

The election of an indigenous union council member in remote Reinkhyngkine Lake area in 2003 for the first time shows that these communities are eager to engage governmental and development agencies regarding their rights and welfare. It is particularly important because number of inhabitants of the reserved forest has actually increased, rather than decreased, since 19th century, accelerated after the displacement caused by the Kaptai Dam in 1960, and the resettlement of Bengali settlers in the 1980s, coupled with anti-insurgency military operations in the 1980s (IWGIA, 2004:295; cited in Roy, 2004). 5.2 Resource Management by the Chakma Village Common Forests A number of traditional institutions, and very recently, some local voluntary organizations, have been among the few who have sought to help protect village common forests", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "827d3af1-ecd3-4923-8fd1-b30a6f873c19": {"__data__": {"id_": "827d3af1-ecd3-4923-8fd1-b30a6f873c19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f94427c3d91256c9a874376db7ed0cc04b665aa961e992118f85ddbaab7e3565"}, "3": {"node_id": "534c84c5-f054-4211-8f4d-5c7e1aa4a965", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d39974bf93e15451882421a921a373c0a4d80eed5e6a28a21daa9d13c03bcaa"}}, "hash": "621701aec149d89e60b4fe847ad8c0f8c2c08feeb7065f4aa5c670654aa277f6", "text": "through support of the villages responsible. Foremost among these is the CHT-based social organization called Taungya, which focuses on the protection of these forests, the \u201cvillage common forests\u201d or \u201cVCFs\u201d. The project is supported by the Danish development agency, Danida. Taungya\u2019s major activities in the current project are geared towards the achievement of three specific targets; firstly, to raise awareness among the concerned communities regarding their basic rights; secondly, to strengthen the organizational unity and efficiency of these communities, including through the promotion of gender and socio-economic equity; and thirdly, to prevent the privatization of these commons, including by strengthening the security of tenure or communal title of the communities over these lands (Taungya, 2003). The last report on the current project \u2013 which has central Rangamati district as its primary area of focus - states that Taungya has been encouraged by indigenous communities within and near its project area to entering a post-pilot phase in a larger area and with an expanded scope of activities.i A striking feature of Taungya\u2019s intervention impacts is the introduction of women into the somewhat more formalized forest management committees for the first time. However, to what extent this is leading to a strengthened role of women in actual decision- making processes of the forest communities concerned, it is perhaps still too early to tell. Moreover, a number of important questions remain with regard to the long-term future of these forests and the impact of Taungya\u2019s interventions upon them, and upon the communities who depend upon and manage these commons. 5.3 Resource Management by the Bawm A Case Study on NRM from Bawm Community Traditionally Bawm communities used to manage their natural resources. In the words of ex\u2013 Upazilla Chairman Daowlian Bawm (70 Years old) when the population size was small and land was abundant then they would have boundaries determining their community lands. Within the community land they would have jum fields, homesteads and land to be used for other purposes. According to Dawlian this arrangement of use of natural resources was managed in consultation with the families living within that community For example fishing was allowed accoridng to set rules and if any one found to be killing fish through natural poison would have been fined. He also mentioned that now the government has laws to punish those who still indulge in this activity, although these laws are not implemented. Currently most of the BAWM communities preserve some 20-25 acres of land surrounding their villages. This they usually term as \u2018community forest\u2019. No forest produce collected from the community forest is sold. Only the villagers have access to forest resources for their own consumption. Usually the karbari, and sometimes the village Headman if necessary, will consult with the villagers for all matters relating to NRM. 21 Usually 7-8 persons in a group will get involved to work in the jum fields. Old couples, women without partners, and children were exempted from this work. There was a system of \u2018exchange labour,\u2019 locally known in Bawn community as \u2018bala\u2019 (which is still being practiced in other communities under different names) through which families who did not have able bodied labour could exchange other goods, usually food, for the labour of other people in the community. Also, Dawlian mentioned about another practice relating to jum cultivation - that while a jum field is being cleared a firing line is prepared collectively and in one day the villagers would set and complete the firing of that field. He pointed out that besides jum they produce vegetables, chilles, and paddy, and their main purchased items were salt, matches, scissors and kerosene from the local market. The usual commodities that the communities would sell were mustard seeds and karpas cloth. Women in the communities wove their own cloths for use and for sale.

Locals believe this will negatively affect the existence of what they believe is the lake god, and consequently, on the people. Lake Matai Pukhiri has been regarded as one of the most valuable natural resources of this area. The local belief is that a god resides in the lake and that improper use of this lake for bathing and other purposes can incur the wrath of the god. Due to belief in the gods residing in the area, and the god of the lake, the locals have been preserving the natural resources surrounding Matai Pukhiri Hill. The locals also believe that the waterfall at the base of the hill around Matai Pukhiri has a sacred value because it comes down from the pond of the god. They think this is a pure source of drinking water. They worship the god of Matai Pukhiri lake by performing rituals known as Puja. They try to keep the water clean and they avoid using the lake water for daily necessities. Women of the locality usually contribute to household work by collecting vegetables, fuel wood and water from Matai Pukhiri\u2019s waterfall and surrounding woods. Male villagers collect wood, bamboo and straw and sell them in the market. The latter also participate in the collection and sale of stone to traders. In this way the joint work of both male and female members of this locality help to provide a livelihood for these people. The locals pointed out that there has been little governmental restriction on the consumption of natural resources on a commercial scale, and further, that the area is very likely to be declared a Reserved Forest. This would mean that the area\u2019s management would be given over to the Department of Forest. This may have severe consequences for the livelihood security of the locals and may even lead to their relocation or undue restriction of their sustainable use of these resources. This would also sever their spiritual connection with Lake Matai and their local god. 6. Ethnicity, gender, class and natural resource management 22 In order to obtain an in-depth understanding of the role of indigenous peoples in natural resource management in the CHT, it is important to analyze its ethnic, class and gender dimensions. 6.1 Ethnicity & Indigenous Resource Management Article 28 of the Constitution of Bangladesh outlaws discrimination based on \u2018religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth\u2019 and further requires the state to make \u2018special provisions\u2019 to protect \u201cbackward sections of citizens\u201d. However, such a policy of equality and non-discrimination is not reflected in the government\u2019s land and forest management policies. Such policies actually tend to be both \u2018gender blind\u2019 and \u2018ethnicity blind\u2019 (in a negative sense). On the contrary, the implementation of such a non-discrimination clause leads to refusal to recognize customary resource rights of indigenous peoples, both in the plains regions, such as in the Madhupur \u2018eco\u2019 park, the Maulvibazar \u2018national park\u2019, and in the CHT, including through the denial of rights in the existing and new reserved forests areas. In the special administrative system of the CHT (including the karbaries, headmen, chiefs, district and regional councils), indigenous people have a substantive level of participation in resource management in mauza circles or \u201cUSF\u201d areas, but indigenous representation in the aforesaid institutions is not uniform. Many of the smaller ethnic groups have complained of non-representation or inadequate representation in the CHT governance system although their actual and positive role in natural resource management is quite substantive. Given the structure of the CHT institutions, and the structure of the interim district councils (some ethnic groups excluded), such under- representation cannot be denied. Given the rich store of knowledge, innovations and practices that the smaller indigenous groups are custodians of, it is unjust, and unwise to exclude the small groups\u2019 from their due participation in policy decision-making processes. This goes for both the state system and the special regional institutions 6.2 Indigenous Resource Management & Class Dimensions As in the case of smaller ethnic groups, the poorer sections of the CHT population are generally excluded from policy-making processes. However it is the poor, and particularly the rural poor, who not only suffer disproportionately from environmental degradation, but are also the major custodians of the country\u2019s natural forests and water bodies. They need to be adequately represented in decision-making processes both on account of their direct experiences and knowledge, and also on account of the fact that poverty and deforestation and resource depletion are causally connected.

Addressing the livelihood security of forest-adjacent communities, including by offering them a direct share of the income from the RFs and other common pool resources, may reduce tension between indigenous communities and the Forest Department and lead to better management and protection of the resources of the RFs. 6.3 Gender & Indigenous Resource Management Natural resource management generally involves women more than men because women\u2019s primary responsibilities, such as cooking, fetching water and gathering 23 firewood, are directly related to the use of natural resources. Women suffer numerous hardships when ecological degradation occurs in forests and other common pool resources. Researchers have pointed out that in developing countries it is women who are the most dependent upon forests for their sustenance (Shiva,1989; Agarwal,1989; Halim, 1999). Promoting and strengthening equitable practices on gender and class (in the sense of socio-economic backgrounds) was regarded as a cross-cutting strategy issue as well as a specific goal of the NRM by the workshop participants and other respondents. Increased participation of women in the affairs of the NRM remains a continuing challenge for the indigenous communities. The most glaringly negative feature that was perceived in the NRM workshop is the gender-blindness of the people who are concerned with forming committees having NRM functions. The other troubling feature that was revealed in the workshops was the reluctance of forest-based and other communities to open up the group to new members. In this context, the role of local NGOs like Taungya is perhaps even bigger than thought, and related challenges in the long term include how to bring changes in the perceptions of men to help them realize that women have as much capacity as men to make rational and intelligent decisions related to development, resource management and their family concerns. Members of Taungya staff working in remote areas have pointed out that management committees running local community forests (\u201cVCFs\u201d) have become more gender-sensitive than before. The number of general members of VCF committees has been increased, and women have become full members for the very first time. These instances of positive impact of the project interventions might go beyond forest management to actually encouraging greater gender equity practices in CHT rural society in a general way. This would of course depend upon the extent that VCF community practices are emulated by CHT communities outside of the small project area of Taungya (Halim and Roy, 2006). In this context, the impact of the gender equity components in ongoing development projects \u2013 including those funded by the Asian Development Bank and the Hill Tracts Facility managed by the UNDP \u2013 need to studied. 6.3.1 Customary Land Rights: Gender Based Discrimination The traditional division of labour in developing societies has allocated hazardous tasks as well as those requiring physical strength to men, and work that requires sustained effort and endurance to women. The division is strengthened by taboos and beliefs. Like Bengali women in the plains, the indigenous women of Bangladesh are also traditionally regarded as occupying a lower social standing than the men. Indigenous women\u2019s status is low in terms of the right to inheritance, legal and political rights, decision-making powers and other spheres. One of the most acute problems faced by indigenous women is the denial of their access to customary owned land. Land scarcity among indigenous communities generally affects women more adversely than indigenous men. The inheritance laws of most indigenous peoples, including the most numerous groups such as the Chakma and the Santal, tend to be discriminatory against women. The notable exceptions are in the case of the Khasi in greater Sylhet and the Mandi or Garo in the plains, and to a lesser extent, the Marma in the southern Chittagong Hill Tracts. Apart from the above exceptions, the common trend of the indigenous communities is that only sons inherit landed property. 24 Some Garo9 women respondents pointed to a new trend in their communities whereby sons are allowed a share of the landed property. According to these women, this is largely on account of poverty and unemployment among their male youths. Another possible cause, which however was not discussed formally, was the fear of land passing on to outsider Bengalis through the marriage of Bengali men with Garo women (the same also applied to Khasi women). Thus this too shows an instance of discrimination due to gender, albeit in an indirect manner. A combination of patriarchal tendencies among both Mandi/Khasi and Bengali males marrying Mandi/Khasi women may", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "998e751d-3733-470a-a32b-c783212cd3e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "998e751d-3733-470a-a32b-c783212cd3e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f0d3bd2c7aa7a003614a3f244bd9e5b7732e5c89993894eaf09f2e8dc02138b"}, "3": {"node_id": "9fcd4c72-1c79-4ecf-8c0d-00eed1966ca6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aebf1a4ea62f9794c020a95164cad1cc290818474f4b80c6e695b476aab78d31"}}, "hash": "03866c7ab43102d0ae900096e408bd0d7b9858d5e91b34dece5ee6dbbbbe7dbc", "text": "have contributed to such phenomena and perceptions. Although the Government of Bangladesh has ratified the ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Populations (Convention No. 107, 1957), which recognizes the customary land rights of indigenous/tribal population groups, it has done little or nothing to protect the land rights of the Mandi/Garo and other indigenous peoples. Although the Constitution of Bangladesh formally recognizes equality irrespective of sex, race, caste or place of birth, in practice such provisions do not seem to have led to equal opportunity and safety for women in formal and informal sectors of work. Mandi women working in beauty parlours are not even entitled to similar rights as day labourers (since such parlours are considered as \u201cinformal\u201d sectors) and are thereby deprived of their legal rights (Gulrukh, 2004). It has been reported by indigenous Garo women from other research areas such as the greater Mymensingh that they play a primary role in production, especially in subsistence-oriented agricultural communities. Despite their contribution to production, these women are not in a position to utilize loans - where they can access some - to buy land. These women reported that sometimes they use their loans to recover mortgaged land, which in most cases is in the names of their male family members. These women also pointed out that if given the chance to buy land, they would do so, and have the same recorded jointly with their husbands. Further, some women respondents stated that they utilize part of the credit to start court cases to recover their alienated lands from Bengali grabbers. Some even managed to obtain decrees in their favour. However, most were still unable to recover possession of dispossessed lands on account of financial and procedural difficulties. Another important area of concern is personal law dealing with family matters. Family laws deal with five areas of family life, including issues relating to (i)marriage, (ii)dissolution of marriage, (iii)custody of children (iv) guardianship of children and the (v)restitution of conjugal life, which are also considered part of citizens \u2018religious personal\u2019 lives. In all other areas such as inheritance or adoption, religious laws are applied, although indigenous and tribal peoples are excluded from such laws (both in the CHT and in other parts of the country). Only since 1995 have Family Courts been made available to non-Muslim citizens, applying non-Islamic laws, as a forum for adjudication. (Halim, 2003 a). However Family courts are not operating in CHT. . In most cases the Headman and karbari of the village in CHT resolve dispute caused by a severed marriage, desertion by the husband, and other conjugal disturbances. If the Headman or karbari\u2019s decision is disputed by one of the parities, the cases usually come to the respective circle chief. Indigenous women in CHT if required seeks justice from their traditional courts 9 This section is derived from the evaluation report of CARITAS where the team leader participated as a Gender Researcher and herself interviewed Garo women in greater Mymensingh, April 2006. 25 administered by three circle chiefs in three respective districts. It is observed that despite indigenous women\u2019s marginal presence in the power structures, these customary structures may actually be more sympathetic towards disadvantaged women than comparable shalish10 in the plains. For instance, in the rural areas of the plains , Bengali women have no voice in the local shalish, except NGO modified shalish and in most cases the verdict go against them in traditional shalish. On the contrary, in CHT, the traditional courts administered by Headman and \u2018Circle chiefs,\u2019 it seems that the judicial persons or bodies do make strong efforts to ensure that indigenous women\u2019s rights are treated with respect. This is quite rare in the plains. (Halim et.al. 2005 b: 16- 20; Halim, 2006).

Women from the most underprivileged sections of society are most affected by the depletion of natural resources since they have little or no access to private lands and are therefore highly dependent upon forests for their livelihoods. However, rural women from the middle and higher income classes are also dependent to a large extent upon forest resources where the economy is at least partially subsistence-oriented and where wage labour is scarce both for economic, social and cultural reasons (hill people are traditionally averse to doing domestic labour for others). Thus the problems faced by rural women, both poor and higher income, and including indigenous women, are closely related to environmental problems. The state-sponsored development programmes in the CHT region remain largely welfare-oriented, and sometimes implemented at the costs of basic rights. They seem to have done little to bring about any favourable changes in indigenous women\u2019s lives. These welfare programmes have generally ignored indigenous women\u2019s productive role in the economy. Indigenous women, through their traditional role as de facto managers of the rural household, have the most intricate knowledge about 10 Shalish is an informal system of justice which has no legal form. It usually involves gathering of village elders, Union Parishad Chair and members and concerned parties, exclusively male for resolving disputes over marriage, dowry money, child custody & sexual assaults. For detail see Halim, S. . (2006). Access to Justice: Situation of Rural Women and Urban \u2013Rural Migrant Workers in Bangladesh, in legal empowerment-a way out of poverty, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, December 2006-issue2. 26 forest food items, their nutritional value and herbal medicinal plants. The degradation of natural forests results not only in the extinction of many plants, but also in loss of indigenous women\u2019s knowledge of their natural resources, along with the increased burden of having to fetch water and gather food items from places that are farther and farther removed from their homes. Thus the impact of deforestation on indigenous women is not only upon their knowledge systems, economic well-being and health, but on their status in society (Halim, 2002). Unfortunately, women\u2019s issues and natural resource issues are viewed separate problems. From the environmental perspective sustainable development emphasizes the prevention of pollution and environment degradation with a concern to contain economic and environmental costs. From the gender point of view, making people and their well being the objective requires that women be both agents and beneficiaries of the development process and social change (Roy and Halim, 2001a:29). Observation in the CHT reveals that women have crucial role in natural resource management However it is rare for women to be considered full participants in natural resource regeneration and protection programmes, with some local NGOs such as Taungya providing the only exceptions to this. The other important matter of concern is that the social and cultural contexts of the various indigenous communities are very different and that many of the laws and policies on resource management and other related spheres are not adequate to prevent discrimination against indigenous women. It is usually non-indigenous women\u2019s organizations and other development organizations that take up development issues like health issues related to reproductive health, violence against women, educational programmes, natural resource management programmes and land rights. Non-indigenous organizations and policy makers incorporate all these issues without a specific approach to the issues confronting indigenous women, who often face triple discrimination as women, as indigenous and often as the poor as well. For instance, CEDAW (the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women) is a powerful tool, but fails to mention the right of self-determination for indigenous women. While CEDAW identifies unequal access to education, discriminatory wages, health, violence, human rights violations among the key threats to women, it does not reflect the fact that national policies drawing upon the provisions of CEDAW (for instance SF prgrammes where women are only taken as beneficiaries) may on occasions perpetuate the discrimination against indigenous peoples. These policies are employed not only as means of erasing their existence as indigenous peoples but also to dispose them of their rich ancestral land- the basis of their culture and survival. 6.3.3 Denial of Political voice The denial of indigenous women\u2019s substantive participation in the political spheres further reinforces their low status in society.

Various roles played by indigenous women during the conflict in the CHT were neither nationally awarded or recognized, nor received any formal recognition from their own communities. The struggle of indigenous women for autonomy and peace thus remained invisible next to the stuggle of men, as in so many other spheres of women\u2019s lives and roles (Halim, 27 2003:97; Halim et.al. 2005b). Blind spots such as these have led some to refer to the CHT Accord of 1997 as a \u2018gendered\u2019 agreement (Mohsin, 2003:53). The Accord makes no reference to the human rights violations committed against women in the CHT. There are no provisions for providing compensation to the women affected by violence, and nor is there any mention of rehabilitation, compensation or counseling for victims of sexual violence. This contravenes Bangladesh\u2019s responsibilities as a signatory to the International Criminal Court (ICC) convention that considers rape as a crime against humanity. Women from indigenous communities are facing many different types of human rights violations. The various forms of abuse by Bengali settlers are in the increase. This may be because the settlers, who were mostly confined in military-protected \u201ccluster villages\u201d before, are now far more mobile because of the end of the guerilla war. Militarization, which still continues in the CHT in the name of keeping peace in the region, is resulting in much misery for innocent people, both men and women. Although the 1997 Accord provides for the dismantling of military camps (except for some specified large garrisons), this provision is still to be implemented in substance by the Government of Bangladesh (Halim, 2005 a; Halim et al. 2005 b). In both the indigenous and in the state\u2019s political structures, indigenous women are often excluded from roles of political leadership. In the CHT, under the largely hereditary traditional system of governance, it is almost always men who hold key positions, such as mauza headmen, and even more so in the case of village karbaries. Apart from two notable exceptions of acting or de facto chieftainesses - in the case of in the Chakma Circle in the 19th century, and in the Mong Circle in the 1980s - the position of chiefs also is generally restricted to male heirs, to eldest sons of former chiefs in the case of the Chakma and Mong Circles, and to the fittest and eldest males of the royal family in the case of the Bohmong Circle. This patriarchal tendency is further reflected in the structure of interim regional and district councils in the CHT. In the case of the regional council, only 3 out of 22 members are women, and their voice in decision-making is yet to be heard or otherwise felt. In the case of the interim hill district councils, the situation is even worse, as none of the 6 members from each district council is a woman, excepting the chairperson of the Bandarban Council (Halim, 2002: 137-138). The aforesaid shortcomings with regard to women\u2019s representation in the political and administrative institutions need to be addressed. The national forest, land and environment policies also need to be revised from a de-gendered perspective. Efforts of NGOs such as Taungya to enhance women\u2019s representation at village-level forest management need to be supported by governmental and developmental institutions, and mirrored at higher levels of natural resource management practices in particular, and in leadership structures in general. 7. The interface between indigenous and state processes of NRM 7.1 Indigenous People and Policy-Making It is generally seen that the state\u2019s natural resources policies, like its development policies, are yet to directly and substantively acknowledge indigenous people as 28 legitimate rights-holders and stakeholders.11 Historically, indigenous people have been systematically denied access to lands that were required by the empires, kingdoms or colonizers. The legacies of these past policies have continued in different forms up to the present day, particularly with regard to lands categorized as \u2018forests\u2019 or required for state forestry.

This project continued until 1967 or so. The Deputy Commissioner was supposed to provide land settlement titles to these farmers but that happened only in a very limited number of cases. These same people are now threatened with eviction by the Forest Department as their lands were under process since the 1990s to be part of new reserved forests. 12 While the fruit plantation project of the 1960s was solely funded and managed by government agencies (the Forest Department in particular), as was the trend of those days, policy formulation and project interventions on natural resource management in Bangladesh has in recent years been substantively influenced by priorities and perspectives of external donor and lending agencies. Sometimes the interests of these agencies are seen to enter into unhappy alliances with lobbies of vested interest groups within the country. One of the best examples of this dichotomy is the Forest (Amendment) Act of 2000. On the one hand, this Act formally introduces the concept of \u201csocial forestry\u201d, while on the other hand, it strengthens policing powers and strengthens the immunity of Forest Department officials from prosecution. It has been said that there is little of \u2018social\u2019 or \u2018forestry\u2019 dimensions in the model prescribed under this Act, as the major decision-making powers are retained by the Forest Department, and the proposed programmes are oriented towards plantation programmes, rather than forestry (which would include natural regeneration and protection) (Halim, 1999; Roy & Halim, 2001a; Roy, 2002). There are a further two points that are noteworthy with regard to ownership and use rights over lands to be taken up for the SF (Social Forestry) Programs. Firstly, the definition of SF program as provided in the new section 28 A of 2000 Forest Act stipulates that SF programme will be carried out on only two categories of lands, the first of which includes land, which is \u2018assigned\u2019 to the government. Secondly, the 2000 Act authorizes the government to assign rights to others over land involved in the SF programmes, but the assigned rights are limited to user rights only. It seems that the possibility of assigning ownership rights over SF lands has not been considered. The \u201csocial\u201d element of the proposed forestry programmes were weakened by providing some responsibility to the proposed participants of social forestry programmes, while keeping the major decision-making powers in the hands of the Forest Department officials (Roy & Halim, 2001). The National Poverty Strategy Paper (PRSP) published in October 2005 refers to inadequate representation of adivasis / ethnic minorities at various levels of 11 This section is mostly based on the comments provided by the representatives of various ethnic communities in a workshop which was held as partial activity of this report in Rangamati, CHT, 19-02- 06.. 12 Based on the interviews done by Sudatta Bikash Tanchangya & Raja Devasish Roy with inhabitants of Barudgola, Ballalchara, Kutubdia, Kashkhali and Betbunia mauzas of Rangamati district several times between (2005-2006). 29 government and policy process, limiting their opportunities to influence policy decisions that affect their lives. Among actions recommended by the PRSP are the full implementation of the CHT Accord, activation of the CHT Land Commission and the Task Force on Refugees, resolution of land and forest related problems in the plains (particularly the Eco park) (Roy, 2006). 7.2 Ownership versus User Regimes As mentioned in 3.5 above, some of the customary resource rights of indigenous people of the CHT have been partially recognized in the CHT Regulation of 1900. The Forest Act of 1927, which applies both in the CHT and in the plains, contains provisions (in section 28) that allow assignment of the government\u2019s rights over reserved forests. However, the ambit of the scope of assignment of the government\u2019s rights under section new 28A, as introduced by the 2000 Act, in comparison, is decidedly narrower. Section 28 of the 1927 Act allows the government to \u201cassign to any village community the rights of Government to or over any land which has been constituted into reserved forest\u2026\u201d Therefore it is clear from the definition of SF as provided in the 2000 Act that government-led SF programmes will henceforth be confined to lands that are either under the ownership of the government or over which the government has been assigned rights by others. The question that arises here is why does ownership over SF lands needs to be vested upon the government when existing trends of resource management worldwide are leaning towards such programmes inclusive and participatory rather than centralized in the hands of government agencies?

Most farmers do not own their own farmlands, leading to under-investment on these lands in terms of capital, labour and other inputs to add value to the farm produce. The proposed state-centric SF programmes are not only contrary to the rights and needs of forest communities, particularly those of indigenous peoples, but are likely to fail due to continued denial of tenure security. As mentioned earlier in the section 3.5 the ADB has been a crucial actor in designing and supporting SF programmes all over Bangladesh, including in the so-called \u2018USFs\u2019 or mauza commons. Human rights activists in the CHT, with support from the civil society groups from the plains, have resisted the proposal of the FD because they pointed out that the model is unsuitable for the CHT as it would provide them less rights than they can now exercise under existing CHT laws, customs and usages. The CHT Regional Council is also known to have disagreed with the proposed programme in the \u2018USFs\u2019 (Roy, 2002 ICIMOD). Similarly, findings from the plains show that where SF has been implemented, the programmes do not account for local people\u2019s rights of titles and ownership, including in the Attia Forest area13 within greater Tangail District (Halim, 1999). 13 The area which is within Attia is 5 km from Tangail district where the team leader did her field work for the PhD dissertation in two villages .The study area was under Attia Zamindary rule. The Government of Bangladesh in 1982 announced the Attia Forest Ordinance for the sal forest area. This law was intended to bring Attia forests under FD management as reserve forest. (Halim, 1999) 30 There is also a conceptual problem with the notion of \u2018USFs\u2019 in CHT. What the Forest Department calls \u2018USF\u2019 is regarded as common property of the indigenous communities (Arnes, 1997), and a large part thereof is concurrently regarded as government \u201ckhas\u201d land by the district land administration authorities under the Deputy Commissioner. Thus these three differing perspectives bring in three differing law and practice regimes \u2013 whatever their formal legal status may be \u2013 quite often conflicting with each other, especially that between the indigenous communities on the one hand and the government positions on the other. Another government programme that has brought the indigenous people of the CHT into conflict with the Government is the expansion of the area of RFs by including privately titled and customarily owned lands of indigenous communities and some long-term Bengali residents of the CHT. This has drawn widespread protests from CHT communities, who have rallied around the previously mentionied mass movement, the Forest and Land Rights Movement in the CHT (Roy, 2002b; Roy, 2004).

This tension is particularly high where it concerns rights of \u201cownership\u201d over common resources.

How these customs, practices, etc. will be treated in practice by the commission, especially when it comes into conflict with codified law, is, however, a matter that remains to be seen. Another recent law that recognizes customary resource rights is the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regulation (Amendment) Act of 2003 (Act No. 38 of 2003), which, while declaring the extent of jurisdiction to be exercised 14 Within Rangamati District in Rajsatali , 329 Kaptai mauza FD is implementing SF on USFs which is mostly used for jum by Khyang, Tripuras and Tanchangya communities. 15 See, e.g., the \u201cStanding Order\u201d of DC, CHT, dated 30.04.1954 as reproduced in Appendix 6, (Roy, 2002 b) which prohibits even the DC himself from issuing timber and related permits without the approval of the chief and headman concerned. See also CHT Forest Transit Rules, 1973. 31 by the soon-to-be appointed civil judges in the CHT, refers to the \u201c ... existing laws, customs and usages of the district concerned\u201d.16 In the plains region, the overall situation of customary resource rights of indigenous people is far worse. Thus indigenous peoples\u2019 rights over the Madhupur forest, the Attiya forest, and over the Barind tract in the northwest, have been denied through declarations of the former commons as reserved forests, vested forests, acquired forests or private forests. Lands of Santal, Oraon and other Adivasi communities in the Barind tract within the Rajshahi administrative division have been taken over both in the name of government forests (reserved or vested forests) and private forests, and even for \u201csocial forestry\u201d in recent times. Likewise, both Bengali and Adivasi communities have suffered due to the unilateral declarations and legislation vesting all rights over the Attia forest upon the government alone, overriding all rights and claims of others (see further, section 7.2). The Madhupur forest - traditionally the home of Garo, Koch, Hajong and other indigenous groups \u2013 has seen a long conflict between the Forest Department and local residents, involving court cases, a controversial Asian Development Bank-funded project of the 1980s (Earth Touch, 2004) and the killing of an activist named Piren Snal in January 2004. A similar situation prevails in the Chittagong and Sylhet administrative divisions too, particularly in reserved forests. A singular exception where customary rights were acknowledged to an extent has been in the case of Khasi communities, who have entered into agreements with the Forest Department over parts of RFs inhabited by them, on the basis of section 28 of the Forest Act. However, this is the exception rather than the rule. The only other area whether customary resource rights have been indirectly acknowledged is in the controversial Social Forestry Rules of 2004, in which \u201cethnic minorities\u201d have been included among the disadvantaged groups that will become \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d of the social forestry projects of the government.17 As the above discussion has shown, it is only some of the customary resource rights of the indigenous people that have been directly acknowledged by legislation. Moreover, the exact status of many of these laws has never been explored in detail, either through judicial pronouncements or legal commentaries or otherwise. Thus it is unclear how the matter would be decided either administratively, or judicially \u2013 in cases of conflict between the aforesaid laws and other statutes. In comparison, the status of the personal and family laws of the indigenous peoples \u2013 also based upon customs and usages \u2013 would seem to be somewhat higher, and less contested, particularly in the CHT. Thus in the CHT, practices of marriage, divorce, maintenance, child custody, inheritance, etc. are generally regulated by the customary law of the people or community concerned, and this is acknowledged both by legislation and judicial pronouncements, although these rights are not defined by formal laws. In addition, the judicial and other authority of traditional institutions, including the headmen and chiefs, is formally recognized by statute law. In the plains, the indigenous peoples\u2019 personal and family laws are not expressly recognized by statutes, although the same continue to be practiced. However, the judicial institutions of the plains adivasis are not formally recognized, and this makes the position of adivasi customary law far more precarious.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b647a84-0f05-440c-af50-54fbf14fd6ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b647a84-0f05-440c-af50-54fbf14fd6ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9059835ea178d2fdf81cd3a077a70f951a4ffd297e7e61957c7ba6776e280b9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "98e73867-5893-4c02-abb0-221e2cf10439", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90f712a825ffe144d57a26e6d0368e879dcaeb82822d2cf90bbb8b59dafd1e98"}}, "hash": "352dec7464479117ea2cfae1618a4e8f6062cacf41b2009bfa4966762594d22b", "text": "16 This law has not been put into effect as yet through a formal gazette notification as is required by law. 17 Analysis from greater Sylhet is based on the interviews with Pidison Pradhan Suchiang, Chairperson Greater Sylhet, Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Forum, March 2006. 32 Quite apart from the fact that custom is a recognized source of law", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2874c1d-c4c3-4dd4-9e84-a242888bdd23": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2874c1d-c4c3-4dd4-9e84-a242888bdd23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62aae8d8e9c7fabe6928195ae23314e331ad68f6fb8a97e7954ccd35f7ff526e"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d952041-5d2e-41bf-b9b7-793338a8d3f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6222ff20df64185aab6eee075e646bc55c824c8cae998a8f3d048a569ee8b149"}}, "hash": "4dc7333f4e35d8ee0a20a09420a9bf50516682d43579a2dd0d1ef10c8a6c7766", "text": "under the Bangladeshi legal system, the status of customary laws in the CHT is unique because of three important factors. Firstly, so many aspects of the CHT legal and administrative system - including in the CHT Regulation of 1900 itself - have been and still are regulated by customs, usages and longstanding practices, that to deny the legal validity of such customs would leave a huge juridical vacuum in administrative law. Secondly, the CHT Regulation and many other enactments did and still do recognize the presence of many customary practices regarding the use of land and other natural resources. Thirdly, even where enactments do not specifically acknowledge the existence of customary resource rights, these laws do not necessarily negate the validity of such customs because according to the CHT Regulation (at section 4), all laws apply to the region only \u201cso far as they are not inconsistent with [the Regulation] or the Rules for the time being in force\u201d. Therefore, it could be argued quite forcefully that the enactments applicable to the CHT are void to the extent of their inconsistency with these customary laws.18 Of course, even if the above contention is legally valid, it would still leave the question of the relative status of customary law and other laws unanswered, something that will have to be dealt with by the future CHT Commission on Land when it hears disputes presented before it. The absence of an unambiguous clarification of the status of these competing laws in the CHT Regulation has been thus explained: \"[The CHT Regulation] was not intended to be a declaratory instrument that sought to identify, define and declare various customary rights and privileges but a regulatory law that sought to regulate already-existing rights \u2026 In the case of the special land rights of the indigenous peoples of the CHT, these rights are not theirs because the CHT Regulation] says so, but because [the indigenous people] have been exercising these rights uninterruptedly for so long. The [Regulation] merely contains the provisions relating to the control and regulation of already existing rights.\" 19 There is, therefore, a strong case for arguing that the indigenous peoples\u2019 customary practices over land have full legal validity as rights, notwithstanding that the government purports to qualify the manner of the exercise of such practices. In one of the rare instances when a dispute over a customary law matter from the CHT reached the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, the court upheld the concerned customary law and censored the government for acting contrary to the concerned custom.20 This, 18 Raja Devasish Roy, Customary Land Rights in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, paper presented at a seminar on \u201cLand Laws, Land Management and the Land Commission in the Chittagong Hill Tracts\u201d organized by the Committee for the Protection of Forest and Land Rights in the CHT in Rangamati, Chittagong Hill Tracts on 7 June, 2002, p. 6. 19 Land Rights of the Indigenous Peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Shamsul Huda (ed.), \"Land: A Journal of the Practitioners, Development and Research Activists\", Vol. 1, No. 1, pp. 11-25, Dhaka, February, 1994 at p. 56. 20 See, for example, Aung Shwe Prue Chowdhury vs. Kyaw Sain Prue Chowdhury & Others, 18 BLD (AD), 33. In this case on the succession to the Bohmong Chiefship, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (vide judgment dated 11 December, 1997) held that \u201c Both the Government and the Court have to recognize [the Bohmong Circle\u2019s] custom and usage and not to introduce any other criterion or factor which will add to the customary requirements of that office\u201d. 33 however, was a case concerning succession to the chiefship of the Bohmong Circle in the CHT, and therefore, a matter of customary personal law rather than custom-based resource rights. Therefore, the more crucial question is whether the Bangladeshi juridical system, or for that matter, the country\u2019s political system, will provide as much space in the context of customary resource rights it has in the case of indigenous customary law (Roy, 2003).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d952041-5d2e-41bf-b9b7-793338a8d3f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d952041-5d2e-41bf-b9b7-793338a8d3f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62aae8d8e9c7fabe6928195ae23314e331ad68f6fb8a97e7954ccd35f7ff526e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2874c1d-c4c3-4dd4-9e84-a242888bdd23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4dc7333f4e35d8ee0a20a09420a9bf50516682d43579a2dd0d1ef10c8a6c7766"}}, "hash": "6222ff20df64185aab6eee075e646bc55c824c8cae998a8f3d048a569ee8b149", "text": "7.4 Settlement Policy of Landless Bengalis in CHT Bengali Re-Settlement & Its Impact on Natural Resource Management An important development that affected resource management practices in the CHT and led to the violation of the indigenous peoples\u2019 rights was the population transfer programme of the 1980s that brought in hundreds of thousands of Bengali people into the CHT under direct government sponsorship.

However, the underlying motive is believed to have been to outnumber the indigenous people and to \u201cpacify\u201d their resistance movement and demands for autonomy, as stated by several CHT researchers (Roy, 1997b; Arens, 1997; Adnan, 2004; Mohsin, 2002; Halim & Roy, 2005). Respondents at the various workshop meetings and in focus group discussions held in the presence of the researchers claimed that the re-settlement of Bengalis had led to illegal encroachment on indigenous peoples\u2019 land, sometimes through the use of false or fraudulent land documents. The then government had decided to allot a combination of hillside lands, plain and paddy lands, and gently slopping or \u201cbumpy lands\u201d to the migrants. However, the Bengali migrants were not interested in hillside lands because they were not acquainted with hillside farming techniques, which are radically different from irrigated-oriented plough farming in the plains. However, CHT did not have much plain and bumpy land available; what little there is was already under the ownership and occupation of CHT residents, both indigenous and Bengali (Roy, 1997: 172). Thus what happened was that the settlers came to gradually re-settle themselves on plainlands and gently sloping lands that were already occupied by local hillpeople, and owned by them on the basis of formal private titles or customary law. In many instances, land-grabbing involved violence, in which state security forces have been directly implicated. Tens of thousands of indigenous people were forced to seek shelter in the remoter hill and forest areas, themselves causing pressure on existing inhabitants of those areas and depleting the available resources (Roy, 2002; Roy; 2004b). The settlers were given 2.5 acres to 5 acres of land and support in the forms of rations (Hume, 2003) which is still being continued till today; while the internally displaced are provided with no such assistance. The settlers were also priority over land with some forest areas in Rangamati being de-reserved for them. Mostly land belonging to indigenous people under customary law was taken and given to Bengali settlers (Hume: 2003). The overall impact of the trans-migration programme upon the ecology and natural resources of the region was hugely destructive, leading to deforestation, over-cultivation, inadequate use of fertilizers, 21 For detail see \u2018Occupations and Economy in Transition: A Case Study of the Chiitagong Hill Tracts,\u2019 by Raja Devasish Roy in Traditional Occupations of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples: Emerging Trends, ILO, 2000 b. 34 hill-cutting, landslides and soil erosion, and the contamination of rivers, lakes and other aquifers (Chakma & Hill, 1995). 7.5 Re-Empowering Customary Management Systems The researchers will argue that strengthening customary management systems is the best way to reduce tension between state and customary systems, create synergy, and facilitate sustainable management. The huge depletion of natural resources in Bangladesh, especially in the reserved forests and other state-managed forests and other natural resources, has gone hand in hand with centralized decision-making and a visibly weakened role of indigenous peoples in resource management. Among the clearest manifestations of this is the 2000 amendment to the Forest Act of 1927 (Halim, 1999; Roy, 2002b & Roy, 2004). This is not a mere coincidence and the main reason is not difficult to find. Where the rights and interests of the local communities are denied, and where their livelihood security is precarious, they can hardly be blamed if they fail to take steps to take measures to protect something that no longer \u201cbelongs\u201d to them. Even where some of their members are party to unsustainable use, or \u201csale\u201d of produce of such forests, it is a response to the situation in which they have been placed. The aforesaid difficulties and defects in centralized state forest and natural resource management are not unknown to central policy-making institutions in Bangladesh and elsewhere. In fact, a number of policy shifts have taken place at international and national levels to de-centralize natural resource management practices, particularly in forestry and related fields.

The latter remained as state-centric as before, and despite some minor concessions to participatory modes of forest management that were acknowledged in policy documents \u2013 such as in the National Forest policies of 1979 and 1994 and in the Forestry Master Plan \u2013 they have largely failed to include indigenous people. In many situations where indigenous communities were left in charge of managing their natural resources, including small forests, water bodies, grazing lands, etc. \u2013 largely on account of the locations\u2019 remoteness or because the lands were not state- owned \u2013 the resources were seen to be far better managed than in the case of the state- managed lands and forests. Such successful examples include mauza forest commons or VCFs and small streams among Chakma villagers in Rangamati district (Halim & Roy, 2006) bison grazing grounds among the Bawm, Khumi, Mro and Tripura in the 35 highlands of the Bandarban-Rangamati border (Roy, 2004 & 2006). Such successful utilization of indigenous knowledge systems prove that the acknowledgement of the \u201ctraditional scientific knowledge\u201d of indigenous communities in Agenda 21 (at Chapter 26) and in the Convention on Biological Diversity (particularly article 8j) has a continuing utility. 8. Conclusions and Recommendations The regeneration of degraded forests and sustainable management of these and other forests, and other fragile ecological resources, is unlikely to be successful without the active involvement and cooperation of the indigenous peoples and other local communities. This will call for efforts to render existing NRM policies more inclusive, by providing adequate space to indigenous knowledge and practice systems, and by clearly acknowledging the rights of indigenous peoples and their communities, including the key right of secure tenure to customary lands. Possible ways and means to bring about such synergized state-indigenous management are discussed in more detail in subsection 8.1 below. 8.1 Acknowledgement of Customary Resource Rights Indigenous peoples\u2019 resource rights need to be unequivocally acknowledged. In the CHT, one of the best ways to do this would be to provide stronger recognition to the customary resource rights of the indigenous people following the examples already contained in the CHT Regulation of 1900 and within the broad ambit of such recognition as provided in the CHT Land Disputes Resolution Commission Act of 2001 and in the CHT Regulation (Amendment) Act of 2003. Moreover, section 28 of the Forest Act of 1927 may be invoked to assign rights of government to RF- inhabiting communities, both in the CHT, and in some of the adivasi-inhabited parts of the plains regions (such as in the northwestern, north-central and northeastern Bangladesh). This provision is far more equitable towards indigenous communities, and far more likely to result in be successful in promoting state-indigenous forestry, than the over-centralized and bureaucratized system currently practiced by the Forest Department. Such acknowledgement of existing rights and active inclusion of indigenous peoples must be attuned to their development needs. These priorities may vary from people to people and may also depend upon such factors as education, location (rural/urban), economic situation (class) and sex, among others. Some of the most important issues would include those that were mentioned in the Rangamati Declaration of 199822 that came out of the first people's conference on development in the CHT after the signing of the CHT Accord in 1997 (see Appendix II). Among these, the following are regarded as extremely crucial: \u2022 Just resolution to land dispossession by non-indigenous settlers; \u2022 Autonomy & self-government;iv \u2022 Protection of land & resource rights; \u2022 Health; \u2022 Human development (education for all, capacity-raising of NGOs); \u2022 Protection of language and culture. 22 For detail recommendations see Appendix III. 36 8.2 Advocacy In order to resolve land rights disputes in the CHT, it is important to develop effective strategies and tools for advocacy both at the national and international levels.

These should in particular refer to customary laws and practices, including the CHT Regulation of 1900, and crucial provisions of the CHT Accord and post-Accord laws, and international treaties ratified by Bangladesh, all of which are an agreed part of the Bangladeshi political and legal system. Strengthening of existing networks, and creation of further networks would further enhance progress in this regard. Given the situation of extreme political, social and economic disadvantage suffered by most indigenous peoples, this needs to be an integral strategy perspective over the long term. 8.3 Policy Reform & Implementation of Policies There are differing perspectives on the need for policy reform and policy implementation. Indigenous peoples put a high emphasis on recogniti\u00ebn of customary laws and practices, especially upon those that remain wholly or partially unacknowledged. Land and forest officials, on the other hand, along with senior level political leaders and functionaries in Dhaka, have little or no understanding about natural resource management issues in areas outside those that are managed directly by Department of Forest. Thus, their views on policy and policy implementation are largely ad hoc, and remain as an obstacle in this regard. This will have to be remedied by efforts to sensitize the district and national-level land and forest administration departments, and political leaders. However, to what extent such support can be mobilized into action on policy reform will depend partly on the strength of the advocacy measures and partly upon the politics of the day. Further, the implementation of policies in several areas may need to be complemented by detailed administrative guidelines, particularly on account of the absence of knowledge on indigenous culture, and the presence of discriminotory attitudes of non- indigenous officials in government positions. The following, among other, steps could be taken to help remedy this situation. \u2022 Increasing indigenous representation in key decision-making bureaucratic positions; \u2022 Dissemination of information to indigenous peoples regarding their rights; 37 \u2022 Providing greater access to information on indigenous peoples, their languge, culture, economic systems and cutivation patterns, etc. to educational institutions, training academics of government functionaries and NGOs; \u2022 Supplementing existing policies with indigenous-focused administrative guidelines and express references to customary laws and practices; \u2022 Accepting the plurality of indigenous peoples\u2019 situations. It is vital for the interest of the indigenous peoples themselves that these differences are understood prior to major development interventions being designed and implemented; \u2022 The principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) must be applied prior to, and during, any major decision-making involving the rights and welfare of the indigenous peoples; \u2022 Acknowledgement of indigenous technology and innovations as rational and scientific (such as practiced in agriculture, forestry,watershed management, etc), in line with Agenda 21 (Chapter 26) and the Convention on Biologial Diversity and related processes that include indigenous peoples\u2019 representatives; \u2022 Policies to redistribute state-appropriated common forest lands to indigenous communities conditional upon their sustainable use as forests; \u2022 To involve indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent communities in the joint management of state\u2013managed forests and to share the reources of such forests in an equitable and parctiable manner (Roy & Halim, 2003:46-47). \ufffd \u2022 Effective measures taken for the practice of autonomy or self-government by indigenous peoples, especially in relation to development issues, policies and programmes. 8.4 Removing Discriminatory Attitudes Provision and understanding of correct information would go a long way towards adjusting the discriminatory attitudes that pervade much of the Bangladeshi state with regards to indigenous peoples. There must be acknowledgement of indigenous people\u2019s contributions towards the country\u2019s political, social, economic and cultural integrity and its development process, in the official versions of the national histories and in other national discourses and public information systems. Government functionaris with major responsibilities on poicy areas impacting on indigenous peoples should be provided with exposure to the reality of indigenous culture, history, life style etc. State media should provide accurate information on indigenous peoples\u2019 social and economic contribution to the state, and information on indigenous knowledge in NRM. Private media should be encouraged to provide similar levels of accuracy. 38 8.5 Enhancing the Role of Indigenous Peoples The role of indigenous peoples in the formal development process has been peripheral at best. This needs to be addressed through institutional reforms and capacity-raising initiatives. First, is the representation of indigenous peoples (both men and women), in decision-making, policy reforms and in programme implementation. This could be encouraged and ensured through legal and institutional reforms. Second, is an adaptive approach in participation that would account for the positive aspects of indigenous", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24b0830a-52d6-41b4-8151-b0255887f885": {"__data__": {"id_": "24b0830a-52d6-41b4-8151-b0255887f885", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ba43a7f5f8e3b998061c1748302c878d80c1481b82cc9b8676e01acaa75ad58"}}, "hash": "4ba43a7f5f8e3b998061c1748302c878d80c1481b82cc9b8676e01acaa75ad58", "text": "knowledge systems related to NRM. 8.5.1 Role of Traditional Leaders The other major challenge is, at least in some cases, the pre-eminence of the traditional leaders (the mauza headman or the village karbari, as the case might be), which in some instances caused or contributed to conflicts of social class or interests. The last-named matter also had contrary examples where the community voluntarily sought to involve the headman or the karbari because of kinship unity or his close links with or influence over the community and district and sub-district senior administrative bodies. Thus, the role of the traditional leaders was seen to have both positive and negative features. The major challenge, which may be said to be an amalgam of all the above problematiques, is the decision-making process that appeared far less participatory than is needed, especially since discussions at most committee meetings tend to be dominated by a few individuals, particularly men. However, to what extent the non- participation of some in the verbal deliberations of the NRM meetings actually can reflect their marginality or not, cannot be understood in depth without further enquiry. It is well to be aware that the authors\u2019 impression of dominant or marginal participation in NRM affairs is based upon their notions of what is participatory. It cannot be ruled out, therefore, that on account of the limited field studies they have done, the present researchers\u2019 understanding of decision-making methods is of a rudimentary level (Roy & Halim, 2005:39). A deeper understanding of the social, cultural and political contexts surrounding leadership and participation issues remains a daunting challenge for NRM actors and researchers on NRM in the CHT. 8.5.2 Role of Local NGOs The other important challenge lies with the role of NGOs. Pro-people NGO interventions are especially pertinent to the CHT because of the disadvantaged situation of the region\u2019s population with regard to access to social extension services of the government. Organizations working to facilitate the spread of formal education, functional literacy, and vocational skill improvements, accelerating women's access to education and training opportunities are still very limited in the CHT. Strong local- level organizations like Taungya and others are important. Pro-people and grassroots- based NGOs can play a strong role in NRM as long as they maintain the requisite balance between inaction and overly active interventions that weaken local self- dependent efforts. Such efforts could act as a strong corollary to the communities\u2019 own efforts to bringing further strengthening and \u2018equitization\u2019 of the indigenous committees (Halim and Roy, 2004). 8.5.3 Role of National NGOs 39 The role of national NGOs in the CHT is quite complex and generally had little or nothing to do with NRM. The orientation of several national NGOs, and micro-credit institutions (like IDF), around the disbursement and collection of micro-credit showed visible concentration in urban and peri-urban settlements (particular in Bengali settlements) \u2013 with little relation to NRM activities \u2013 and absence or marginal presence in rural and remote areas. Given the lack of knowledge and experience of national NGOs regarding CHT culture and topography, perhaps this is a mixed blessing. As in the case of government agencies, national NGOs too need to sensitized prior to starting operations in indigenous-inhabited areas. The NGO Bureau Guidelines of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office offer a basis for such guidance and direction. 8.6 Promoting Gender and Class Equity in NRM Bringing about gender equity in NRM in the short term will be difficult without committed support from other actors, including political, social and community leaders, local NGOs and national NGOs due to longstanding gender-insensitive practices based on customary beliefs, religious and social conservatism, or otherwise, but it is a matter that requires consistent and urgent attention. \ufffd \ufffd Many policies on indigenous women are aimed at the atypical cases of discrimination faced by ethnic Bengali women in the plains regions. Since the social, cultural and economic contexts in the hill areas and other regions inhabited by indigenous peoples is so different, many of these laws and policies are not appropriate for preventing discrimination against indigenous women. The inadequacies of these policies are however seldom recognised in the national discourses on women's rights, which are dominated by concerns for Bengali speaking and Muslim women, without accounting for the problems faced by minority and indigenous women (Halim, 2002). \ufffd Other important interventions should be made to address the human rights issues of adivasi women who are under-represented in political bodies and local and regional councils; and the lack of funds, necessary for mobilization drives. \ufffd Raise awareness about the negatively discriminatory inheritance laws towards women belonging to the most of the ethnic", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d7934cd-300a-4300-94ad-2fc0a90ab4fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d7934cd-300a-4300-94ad-2fc0a90ab4fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "835f25887e7cf88787e8e5f19f53c87745f8ebdae933fc7ce7ba56a8a801e167"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b8519db-da60-4478-9cf7-efa1eabae786", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7681b0fc417ba76da2306bbc97a9b9df2536c33f925a7469684890ea6386a92a"}}, "hash": "863b6e6d9be95dad666f2833a48b95e30689765852a5b39c231cb9ab3e9e3b6d", "text": "groups in the CHT. It could be finally noted that many actors \u2013 including human right workers, development planners, and social scientists \u2013 believe that it would be useful to have comprehensive policy regarding the lands and other natural resources of the region to ensure equitable and environmentally sound resource use and practice. It calls for element of participatory justice, (Alston, 2001) as it has become clear that without the involvement indigenous peoples proper implementation of strategies would be useless. Therefore, any new policies that are framed will need to carry out with the indigenous people, including farmers, women, community leaders, and government officials. In any such reforms, the importance of traditional natural resource management process need to be acknowledged as far they are appropriate to the socio-economic and cultural needs of CHT today. Policy reforms also need to be cautious to incorporate representation on the basis of ethnicity, class and gender. 40 References Adnan. S.

Indigenous Peoples of Cambodia There is no special provision in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia for indigenous peoples1. However indigenous peoples argue that they should not be discriminated as all citizens have equal rights according to Article 31.2 of the Constitution, which states that: \"Khmer citizens shall be equal before the laws and shall enjoy the same rights, freedom and duties, regardless of their race, color, sex, language, beliefs, religions, political tendencies, birth origin, social status, resources and any position\". There is no official definition of \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d in Cambodia. However this does not indicate the absence of the concept. There are laws and policies which uses different terms such as \u201cindigenous communities\u201d, \u201cindigenous ethnic minorities\u201d, \u201chighland peoples\u201d etc whose intent clearly refers to indigenous peoples. For instance, Article 23 of the Land Law 2001 refers to \u201cindigenous community\u201d as \u201ca group of people that resides in the territory of the Kingdom of Cambodia whose members manifest ethnic, social, cultural and economic unity and who practice a traditional lifestyle, and who cultivate the lands in their possession according to customary rules of collective use.\u201d2 Other laws such as the Forestry Law of 2002 refer to \u201clocal communities\u201d3. The Sub-decree on the Community Forestry Management (2003) under the Forestry Law defines \u201cLocal Community\u201d as \u201cminority ethnic community or a group of local residents with original settlement in one or more villages\u2026\u201d4. Further, the draft Protected Area Law in its lexicon defines \u201cindigenous ethnic minorities\u201d as \u201cpeople living in mountainous areas, most of whom make their living by practicing shifting agriculture and other additional livelihoods, such as hunting, fishing, and collection of forest products/by-products\u201d. From these, it is very clear as the Asian Development Bank Study on Indigenous Peoples, Ethnic Minorities and Poverty Reduction (2001) states: \u201cCambodia has a reasonably clear definition of the vulnerable groups considered to be indigenous for practical development purposes\u201d5. The 1998 Population Census6 estimated that about 0.9 percent or 101,284 people of Cambodia\u2019s total population of 11.4 million people belong to indigenous groups7, constituting almost 64 percent of people living in Ratanakiri Province (ADB, 2002).8 1 In this report, government (particularly the Department of Ethnic Minorities Development), NGO and indigenous peoples representatives agreed to the use of the term \"indigenous peoples\".", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32f04701-3026-4ea2-8ee7-71ecba015971": {"__data__": {"id_": "32f04701-3026-4ea2-8ee7-71ecba015971", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2128eef864e28920224744381df8ade3e563bc6b91b0554f01993ed2188893c"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c317da8-5cf2-42ef-bf98-c89f5c81d690", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c96c3961f67c2d124c1d8edaa2649384452885b18368094cff09935550fbae1"}}, "hash": "56fe02a2bdd5bc822c6765d6d37bff0501741591eb8fd9894e9564a874c93b45", "text": "Some documents still use the term \"ethnic minorities\" and are left as it is when the document is quoted but this term is not used as it is often confusing when used in the context of Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri where they represent the majority in these provinces (67% and 71%). 2 Article 23, Land Law of 2001, Cambodia. 3 Article 11, para (ii) and Article 37, para (i) 4 Article 5, Sub-decree on the Community Forestry Management (2003). 5 Quoted from Suzie Brown et al. 6 Institute of Statistics, Cambodia, 1998 7 The definition of \u201cindigenous\u201d does not include Chinese, Vietnamese or Cham people. 8 This figure is likely to underestimate the numbers of indigenous minorities in Cambodia, as the data were only inferred from a question about the mother tongue of the respondent.

Article 24 of the Land Law 2001 also allows for self-identification when it stated \"an individual who meets the ethnic, cultural and social criteria of an indigenous community, is recognized as a group member by the majority of such group, and who accepts the unity and subordination leading to acceptance into the community shall be considered to be a member of the indigenous community\". At a National Indigenous Forum in Kompong Speu is September 2004, the participants defined self- identification to include the following: \u2022 having a lineage of indigenous blood (parents and grandparents were indigenous), \u2022 living permanently within the community, \u2022 managing and using lands and forests communally, \u2022 practicing rotational agriculture, \u2022 having ceremonies related to agricultural practices, \u2022 having burial forests, \u2022 respecting spirits (neak ta) and holding ceremonies for the village neak ta every year, \u2022 calling/praying for help and having thanksgiving ceremonies when spirits help, \u2022 having own languages \u2022 individual self-identification as indigenous The Forum also recommended that the \"process to verify eligibility of an indigenous community should be simple and streamlined while preventing potential manipulation by a non-indigenous person or group attempting to gain rights to traditional lands. The State should defer authority to communities, following their own traditional customs, to allow them to claim their indigenous ethnic identity\". 4 2. Indigenous Natural Resource Management System 2.1 Concepts and Principles of Indigenous Natural Resource Management Indigenous peoples of Cambodia have their own traditional concepts and principles of natural resource management systems, which are still being practiced today. Some communities have adapted the system with the changes that has been brought about by statutory laws and policies, as well as the growing change within indigenous societies. Indigenous communities still maintain clear territorial boundaries between community lands and community members do not allow strangers to use community land, although any individual may hunt on the territory of other villages. For example, people from highland villages in Ratanakiri do not allow rotational agricultural farms of other villages to be established within their territory. Indigenous peoples in Mondolkiri Province or other provinces however do allow other villagers to use their land for rotational agriculture and to collect products from their community forest but anyone using neighboring land in this manner would need to get prior permission from the traditional village leader. In most cases however, families have enough resources from their own land or around their own village. If inter-marriage occurs, and the couple has no land, they can approach the village elders or their relatives to request for their own plot. The couple are normally allowed to collect non-timber resources for their own use without getting the permission from the village elder. Indigenous Resource Management Traditionally, the land is owned by the community but each family has access to resources and to their own plot of land. This arrangement is governed by a group of elders. Each community has clear boundaries associated with a stream, mountain, rock or big tree. Farm lands are divided and demarcated and encroachment on other peoples' farms is not allowed. Traditionally, people from different villages are not allowed to draw water from a given pool if one village has been granted rights over that pool. Communities also used to relocate their settlement and farming when they were confronted with diseases or disasters or when the population became too big. Pat Chan Seng, Tampoun from Patang commune, Lumpath District Communally-owned lands are further sub-divided into several individually managed plots. Each family within the community decides on the type of crops and varieties depending on the soil to ensure they adequately meet diverse food needs and to manage the farm work throughout the year. The family also uses their plots for different needs, for example plots for long-term crops are also used to graze livestock. Cultural, spiritual and social systems also integrated into natural resource management system, and as such festivals and ceremonies are tied into agricultural cycles. Social support among family members in terms of sharing of labour is also taken into consideration when opening up land and the planting and harvesting cycles. 5 2.2 Framework and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "413b261a-2cb8-4d16-8bfa-c0152e7e5c1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "413b261a-2cb8-4d16-8bfa-c0152e7e5c1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d28e7a0a817ae17b1b09fbe0cfa50c38c7267d472c025f664aafa62c90b5199f"}}, "hash": "d28e7a0a817ae17b1b09fbe0cfa50c38c7267d472c025f664aafa62c90b5199f", "text": "Institution of Indigenous Natural Resource Management A number of studies on indigenous resource management systems show a highly organized system that is closely linked to culture and adapted to the local environment. Institutional structures and mechanisms exist, such as traditional land laws, to govern such as a system. An example below shows how land use is governed by traditional customs and institutions of the Brao, Kavet, Kreung and Lun peoples, a concept that is similar to other indigenous peoples in Cambodia. Concept and Institutional Land Management of Brao People Land use is governed by a Brao custom called \u2018tang gup\u2019. The concept of tang gup is an important spatial taboo for the Brao, Kavet, Kreung and Lun, and it is fundamental for understanding their land use patterns. It explains the cultural significance of and the way traditional boundaries are delineated. It also explains the reason why Brao villages tend to move in one direction up one side of a stream, and then move back down the other. It is important not only on a village-to-village basis, but also within communities. The concept of tang gup prevents someone from one village making a swidden in the territory of another village. The concept also governs how swidden agriculture plots are distributed within the village area, as a person cannot have one active swidden plot on one side of a recent fallow area, and another active plot on its other side. This would be considered tang gup and could lead to poor harvests, a cut foot or even being bitten by a poisonous snake when crossing the fallow. It is also considered to be tang gup if someone has to pass through another person\u2019s active swidden to reach the stream where they regularly bath, reach wood resin trees that they regularly tap, or even to dig wild potatoes in the forest. Tang gup also applies for a family to eat rice from the same pot to have one active swidden on one side of a stream, and another on the other side. A sophisticated body of traditional law, which governs all aspects of Brao society, backs up these traditional beliefs. For example, every village has at least one traditional judge, called \u2018Ya Weu\u2019. These individuals are elders who are considered by their communities to be fair-minded, good talkers, and with a good understanding of legal precedent. There are also senior judges that may be called in to deal with particularly difficult cases that standard Ya Weu cannot deal with, and may be called in to make decisions on cases in other villages when the judge for that particular village agrees. A brief description of how this traditional legal system operates illustrates how organized it is. The Brao recognized plaintiffs, called \u2018Me Drenij\u2019, and defendants, called \u2018Me bij kadee\u2019. When a Ya Weu makes a decision regarding a case, he is expected to base it on oral precedent, from the different eras of government, such as the Thai, French, Japanese, Sihanouk, Khmer Rouge, State of Cambodia and the present. This legal code is part of an oral tradition that is passed from generation to generation and from Ya Weu to Ya Weu. Therefore, Ya Weu will have a younger assistant who attends cases with the practicing Ya Weu so that he can learn from the senior judge, and eventually take over his job when the senior elder either dies or is too old to continue practicing. Ironside and Baird, 2003 Judicial matters on indigenous resource management are often the responsibility of traditional village leaders. Traditional village leaders often work with other elders in the community to ensure community members abide by customary laws on the collection of medicines, land use, hunting and respect traditional rules prohibiting wrong actions such as killing someone, couples living together before marriage and other wrong actions. Although such traditional structures still exist and are very much respected in most indigenous communities in Cambodia, there is often confusion when the government 6 appoints Commune Councils regarding the relationship between these two institutions that now exist at the same time in communities. In the eyes of the community, there is now a hierarchy between the traditional village leaders and commune councils. A number of traditional village leaders within the commune are under the administrative control of the commune council \u2013 but even though the commune councils are elected, they are perceived to be promoting the interests of the government. Customary laws on natural resource management may differ from community to community, with well- defined penalties for wrong-doers. There is a strong belief that social misbehavior affects resources through drying", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce077bb3-5c9c-4cce-8a0a-2fd81ff902d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce077bb3-5c9c-4cce-8a0a-2fd81ff902d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea8db3141af94cc686c992d643400aaef619a0a168e62c21c992fe5eb9f0b701"}}, "hash": "ea8db3141af94cc686c992d643400aaef619a0a168e62c21c992fe5eb9f0b701", "text": "of rivers and lakes, bad harvests or degradation of the environment, and therefore communities place great importance to inter-generational education to ensure everyone understands and adheres to customary practices and rules. Brao Traditional Penalties Penalties for particular offenses are well defined, based on the fines levied for transgression, often in the numbers of buffaloes. For example, a human life is considered to be worth 12 buffaloes, and if someone were to make a large wildlife trap in the forest nearby, without telling other villagers, and then a person got caught in the trap and was killed, the owner of the trap would be required to pay half the value of a person, or six buffaloes, to the family of the dead person. However, if the trap owner had informed the community about the trap in advance, he would have to pay one third of the value of a human life, or four buffaloes. Cold-blooded murder requires a penalty of three times the value of a human life, or the equivalent of 36 buffaloes. If an unmarried young woman becomes pregnant, the family of the man who impregnated her would have to supply a pig and a jar of rice wine for the spirits. If the man did not agree to marry her, he would have to pay six buffaloes or six sets of traditional musical gongs. If someone became guilty of tang gup, they would have to pay for the cost of sacrifices required in case somebody was injured or became ill as a result of the mistake. Ironside and Baird, 2003 2.3 Indigenous Practices in Natural Resource Management 2.3.1 Agricultural Land Management Indigenous community members recognize the need to minimize impact and allow sufficient time for forest regeneration by rotating farm plots and maintaining evenly dispersed populations rather than concentrating settlements in one area. Swidden plots are farmed for three to five years and then left fallow for 8 to 10 years, re-opening the original fields only after the forest and soil have sufficiently regenerated. Different crop varieties are planted in different plots depending on their age, soil type, etc. This allows for lengthening harvest times, shortening hunger gaps, more effective exploitation of plant variety, spreading risk of seasonal variations, etc. Longer term crops are also cultivated in the fallows and they are used as grazing areas. 7 Indigenous Agricultural Management Indigenous agricultural systems consist of short rotation of swidden agriculture along the edges of mountains, streams and rivers. Generally, people did not cut swiddens far from the stream, as doing so makes it difficult to access water. Depending on the area, people would spend 5-10 years moving up one side of a stream, and then they would change sides and start working their way back down, or they would change stream valleys and start working their way down the new valley. When the village centre became too far away from the swidden plots, it would be moved in front of current swidden areas. It took about 10- 20 years to return to the same location. Bamboo re-growth is preferred for swidden agriculture, because soil fertility is restored in 6 years or less and a large amount of ash is produced after burning. Local people therefore have benefited from the \u201chumanized ecosystems\u201d that they have created. Source: Ironside and Baird, 2003 2.3.2 Wildlife Management The diverse activities and land-use of indigenous peoples in Cambodia supports the mosaic of habitat types that is important for maintaining wildlife. The fallow fields are popular with deer, as they provide young shoots, and farmers purposely plant a variety of food crops that attract these animals. Forests are also not only maintained as a source for timber and other products, but also as a source of wildlife. Some communities also clearly demarcate hunting areas. Certain breeding areas are not disturbed and are in fact, strictly maintained by communities. Hunting is only done by the community during dry seasons and mostly carried out in groups, although individuals and family members may hunt in areas close to the village. Only limited number of animals are allowed to be hunt during group hunting, while only one animal is allowed during individuals or family hunting trips. The animal is divided among community members, thus discouraging over-hunting. It is considered a taboo to mix more than one animal species when cooking. Every family and even a whole village prohibit a certain animal to be killed or hunted, as these animals are considered their kanchang or \"helper\". Taboos and rituals are very important part of indigenous hunting traditions and can be seen as wildlife management.

Practices and Beliefs in Wildlife Management Many families and often whole Tampuon villages do not hunt bears. There is a story that bears fought tigers to protect our villages. It is also believed that in the old days, bears bring food to villagers and even taught them how to start a fire. Even now, according to my father, you can still coach a bear to get honey from very tall trees. Wanai Lieng, Tampuon 8 2.3.3 Biodiversity Management The use of medicinal plants is still practiced as part of indigenous health systems in Cambodia, and both young and old people believe that only the use of traditional herbs can cure certain ailments. Medicinal plants are mainly collected from forest areas that are conserved by communities for such purposes. Forest spirits are believed to be protectors of these areas and only old or knowledgeable herbalists, mostly women, are allowed to collect medicinal plants. Families who are in need of medicines from the protected forest area must first ask the elders who will then advise them on how much they may collect and how to collect these medicinal plants. Communities still believe that they should not sell these medicines, nor should they give them to outsiders - those found doing so can be punished. An intricate system of seed sharing and exchange still exists. For example, if a person desire to get some seeds from another person, a knife, a chicken or a pig must be given in exchange. However, if the owner of seeds can no longer maintain the seeds but considers them precious, the seed may be given to a person who has \"good hands\" i.e. a successful seed breeder without expecting anything in exchange. Most families consider the best way of ensuring a continued seed supply is by simply maintaining a small garden plot or patches. Many plants species are also protected through a similar belief system to that which governs actions impacting on wild animals. For example, there is a belief that bamboos protected communities during wars by magically encircling whole villages, thus hiding it from enemies. Some communities do not allow any cutting of bamboos, and if a person passes such a community with cut bamboo, he can be fined. Certain tree species are also prohibited from being used as building materials based on stories of natural disasters that once happened when such species were used. These stories and beliefs are significant with respect to management of biodiversity. 2.3.4 Water and Aquatic Life Management It is common among indigenous communities in Cambodia to protect forests immediately surrounding springs and water sources. For lakes and rivers, community members are only allowed to use fishing methods that do not deplete fish resources, such as hooks and lines. Outsiders are not allowed to fish in lakes or rivers that are within the boundaries of a community. To ensure a constant supply of fish, communities prohibit the cutting down of fruit trees that are known to be a good source of food for aquatic life. 2.4 Intergenerational Transfer of Knowledge Most of Cambodia\u2019s indigenous communities still live in a traditional setting, placing importance on elders and kinship systems. Natural resource management is part of the daily life of people, with transfer of knowledge on resource management system a daily occurrence. Each night, young people will gather in the house of elders or a knowledgeable person, bringing tobacco as gifts, in exchange for stories and anecdotes. Young people and even children are free to ask questions. Daily, children and youth \u201clearn by doing\u201d through the examples of the elders and family members. One way in which such learning takes place is through the numerous ceremonies and rituals (for example those observed prior to harvesting) that youth take part in, thus performing the physical work needed for the elders. 9 Learning by Doing Community leaders and families pass traditional knowledge to their kin during ceremonies and rituals. Use of certain plants, vegetables and animals that are restricted by taboo are taught to children from a young age. Weavers, blacksmiths and farmers also pass their skills and knowledge to anyone in the community who wishes to learn by joining in the work and through practice. Pieces of land along streams, water catchments areas and mountain areas with big rocks and big trees are considered to be governed by spirits and so opening of farming areas in such places is prohibited.

Pat Chan Seng, Tampuon from Patang village, Patang commune, Lumpath District The settling of disputes, such as land and resource conflicts, is usually conducted in community halls or in the houses of the elders in the community. Again young people are allowed to listen and to ask questions. Transfer of knowledge is not limited to the village chiefs and elders but also those who hold knowledge and are good at presenting messages and information to other members of the community. Parents and grandparents, as well as siblings, are also responsible for providing guidance and advice on natural resources management. 10 3. Legal and Policy Framework on Natural Resource Management 3.1 Natural Resource Management Laws and Policies in Cambodia The Constitution of Cambodia in Article 59 states that, \u201cThe State shall protect the environment and balance of abundant natural resources and establish a precise plan of management of land, water, air, wind, geology, ecological systems, mines, energy, petrol and gas, rocks and sand, gems, forests and forestrial (sic) products, wildlife, fish and aquatic resources.\u201d (Italics added). The framework of laws in Cambodia is hierarchical in structure, each deriving its authority from the law placed above it. The Constitution as the supreme law in Cambodia is the backbone of all other laws which needs to conform to it (Article 131). Then down the hierarchy come laws passed by the National Assembly and Senate called Chhbab. Next are the Royal Decrees or Reach-Kret followed by the Sub- Decrees or Anu-Kret. Under the Constitution, a Royal Decree is signed by the King (or Head of State as the case may be) for a list of very specific tasks after being proposed by the Council of Ministers. The Sub-Decrees are drafted by a single ministry or in collaboration with other ministries over competent subject matters, to implement and clarify the Chhbab further, and is signed by the Prime Minister and the Minister/s in charge of implementation, upon approval of the Sub-Decree by the Council of Ministers. Next down the line in the hierarchy are the Prakas, which also clarify and set out implementation guidelines for laws. Like the Sub-Decrees they are drafted by the Ministry/ies having competence over the subject matter but with a much more limited scope. However, in the case of the Prakas, they can be signed into effect by the Minister/s in charge of the ministry having competence over the subject matter without having to go to the Council of Ministers. In that sense, it is much easier to bring into effect than Sub-Decrees. The next in line is the Circular or Sarachor which are issued by the Prime Minister or relevant minister to instruct, clarify and further explain legal or regulatory provisions. Finally comes the Deika, which are orders given by the provincial governors or commune councils which are effective only within the geographical region under their authority. While there are many laws and policies governing natural resource management in Cambodia, most appear to be ambiguous, contradictory and sometimes difficult to access. They are certainly not the realization of the vision recorded in Article 59 of the Constitution envisages. It is also the case that some subjects have a number of laws and policies enacted and formulated (sometimes in contradiction with each other) while some do not have any. For instance, land as an area of policy and law-making seems to attract a lot of attention. Besides the Land Law of 2001, there are a few sub-decrees already issued under it, yet other important subject matters for natural resource management like wildlife conservation are discussed only in four articles in the Forest Law of 2002.9 The Land Law of 2001, the Forest Law of 2002, the law on Commune/Sangkat Administrative Management of 2001 are some laws that have significance for indigenous peoples and natural resource management, including also some Royal Decrees and Sub-Decrees. Above all of these is the constitution which is important to include in the analysis as the expression of the countries overall intentions for the management of the natural resources found in the country. 9 In Articles 48 to 51 of Chapter 10 of the Forest Law of 2002. 11 3.1.1 The Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia According to Article 44 of the Constitution \u201cAll persons, individually or collectively, shall have the right to ownership.

Although it is implied, it is not clear whether indigenous groups as a collective can claim this right. (See also Section 1: Indigenous Peoples of Cambodia). The Constitution goes further on state land than it does private (individual and collective) ownership. In a catch-all provision in Article 58 the Constitution provides that, \u201cState property notably comprises land, mineral resources, mountains, sea, underwater, continental shelf, coastline, airspace, islands, rivers, canals, streams, lakes, forests, natural resources, economic and cultural centers, bases for national defense and other facilities determined as State property. The control, use and management of State properties shall be determined by law\u201d10 (italics added). The italicized words, on a plain reading of the provision, indicate that the types of property listed are not exhaustive and if the State so wants, it has the power to include other natural resources within the definition of or to define the scope of state property. This they have done through legislation such as the Land Law of 2001. The next provision, Article 59, requires the state to protect the environment and natural resources by establishing a precise plan of action. 3.1.2 Law on Environmental Protection and Natural Resource Management The first Law on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Management was prepared by the Ministry of Environment (MoE) between 1993 and 1995 and was passed by the National Assembly on the 24th of December 1996. In the legal hierarchy, this law is the supreme legal instrument governing environmental protection and natural resources management.11 However, the law is very general and does not provide the specific guidance needed, setting out only a basic overall framework based on sustainable and natural resources management Amongst other things, the law provides for the formulation of a National and Regional Environmental Plan (Article 2) for environment protection and sustainable natural resource management (Article 3). The law requires Environmental Impact Assessments to be conducted for any projects, for which the procedures is determined by a sub-decree that was promulgated in 1999 (Article 6). Echoing Article 58 of the Constitution, the law defines natural resources of the Kingdom of Cambodia as including land, water, airspace, air, geology, ecological systems, mines, energy, petroleum and gas, rocks and sand, precious stones, forests and forest products, wildlife, fish, and aquatic resources, which it states \u201cshall be conserved, developed, and managed and used in a rational and sustainable manner\u201d12. Activities related to the conservation, development, management or use of natural resources must be sustainable (Article 10) and if it is found that such activities are not sustainable, then the MoE shall inform the concerned ministries undertaking the activities (Article 11). The law also has a provision regarding participation of the public in protecting and managing natural resources (Article 16). However, the wording of the provision is not strong enough to require 10 Article 58, Constitution of Cambodia. 11 Environment: ETAP Reference Guide Book, p. 491 12 Article 8, Constitution of Cambodia (italics added), 12 participation from the public, providing only recommendations that it should be done. Besides this, the law also contains a few penal provisions as well as the creation of an environment endowment fund for environmental protection and natural resource conservation. 3.1.3 Land Law 2001 and Land Policies Before the Land Law of 2001 came into being, the Land Law of 1992 was in force. This law, based on the culture and land-use practices of lowland Cambodians, did not reflect the concept of communal land ownership of indigenous peoples. In response to increasing concerns by indigenous peoples and donor pressure, a series of consultations and negotiations were held between 1995 and 1999. After an intensive period of study and public debate, a draft law was developed with funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This draft Land Law was approved by the National Assembly and the Senate and signed by the King on August 30, 2001.13 The Land Law of 2001 has 268 articles divided into 19 chapters. Of these, Articles 23 to 28 in Part II, Chapter 3, entitled \u201cCommunal Ownership or Communal Property\u201d, have direct significance for indigenous peoples and are very important as they set out the basis for land ownership by indigenous communities in Cambodia. The chapter starts by defining \u201cindigenous community\u201d in Article 23. 14 Article 24 seeks to further define membership in an indigenous community.15 Article 25, seeking to identify indigenous communities\u2019", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3cc0b3e-8cb5-41be-86c2-be8199de08c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3cc0b3e-8cb5-41be-86c2-be8199de08c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f480a668267e6229e3b2d212471cb4a7b74dedff27c7a27abd288b6267c7d4e"}}, "hash": "4f480a668267e6229e3b2d212471cb4a7b74dedff27c7a27abd288b6267c7d4e", "text": "lands, provides that they are \u201clands where the said communities have established their residences and where they carry out traditional agriculture\u201d and includes \u201cnot only lands actually cultivated but also includes reserves necessary for the shifting of cultivation\u201d as per their traditional agricultural practice. In many cases where land is owned by the community and where traditional shifting cultivation is practiced, land may be left fallow for a number of years. Because of the non-recognition of such land use patterns and the inclination towards a concept of individual property ownership and use superseding the collective concept, conflicts often arise. As such, this Article is particularly significant for its recognition of community lands to include lands for shifting cultivation in addition to residential and other agricultural lands. However the qualification in the provision that such lands should be those \u201crecognized by the administrative authorities\u201d weakens the provision immensely as it gives the administrative authorities the final say over demarcating land as belonging to a community or not. The third paragraph of the same Article gives indigenous communities the right to assert their own claim for land and register for collective title based on negotiations with neighboring villages and authorities \u201caccording to the factual situation as asserted by the communities\u201d. Communities can exercise their rights under this provision collectively or through their traditional authorities. Once boundaries are agreed upon the Cadastral Department16 shall coordinate with other authorities to verify a community\u2019s claim and determine what lands to register for title.17 13 ADB: Indigenous peoples/Ethnic Minorities and Poverty Reduction \u2013 Cambodia, p.13. 14 \u201cAn indigenous community is a group of people that resides in the territory of the Kingdom of Cambodia whose members manifest ethnic, social, cultural and economic unity and who practice a traditional lifestyle, and who cultivate the lands in their possession according to customary rules of collective use.\u201d 15 \u201cAn individual, who meets the ethnic, cultural and social criteria of an indigenous community, is recognized as a group member by the majority of such group, and who accepts the unity and subordination leading to acceptance into the community shall be considered to be a member of the indigenous community.\u201d 16 The Cadastral Department was brought to function under the direct control of the Council of Ministers in 1990 from the Ministry of Agriculture. 17 Suzie Brown et al. Legal Issues Related to Registration of Lands of Indigenous Communities in Cambodia. p 31. 13 Article 26 then goes on to provide for communal ownership to have \u201call the rights and protections of ownership as are enjoyed by private owners\u201d except the right to \u201cdispose off any communal ownership that is State public property to any person or group.\u201d Article 26 then goes on to emphasize and recognize the role of traditional authorities, mechanisms and customs in decision making and exercising the ownership rights of immovable properties of the community. In the event that an individual wants to leave the community, an adequate share has to be provided to her/him (Article 27). However a share that is allotted to such person cannot be from lands that fall under state public property.18 Read together with Article 26, communal title may be claimed even over state public property. Article 28 reiterates the absolute right of indigenous highland peoples to immovable property stating that \"No authority outside the community may acquire any rights to immovable properties belonging to an indigenous community\". Besides these provisions dealing specifically with lands belonging to indigenous communities, there are other general provisions in the Land Law of 2001 which are of importance. Article 2 classifies immovable property into three types \u2013 immovable property by nature, immovable property by purpose and immovable property by law. Of these, immovable property by nature refers to all natural grounds such as forest land, cleared land, land that is cultivated, fallow or uncultivated, land submerged by stagnant or running waters and constructions or improvements firmly affixed to a specific place created by man and not likely to be moved. Article 8 recognizes only natural persons or legal entities of Khmer nationality as having the right to the ownership of land. Such legal entities include public territorial collectives, Cambodian communities or associations. Article 11, concerning exceptions to the Land Law of 2001, provides that \u201cthe legal regime for ownership of immovable property varies in accordance with the requirements of the Cambodian society, such as agricultural land, forests, waterways, lakes, reservoirs or expanses of water, seashores, riverbanks, urban immovable property, and land for construction of industrial development zones\u201d. It further goes on to provide that \u201cspecific laws shall supplement the provisions of this law or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9220cdc1-7bc7-4bfd-8904-488a04c9ce3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9220cdc1-7bc7-4bfd-8904-488a04c9ce3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4340985fbf1b2078f5368d704ef2b5ef24548d912c33ecff690166daac9669cb"}}, "hash": "4340985fbf1b2078f5368d704ef2b5ef24548d912c33ecff690166daac9669cb", "text": "shall derogate this law in order to meet socio-economic, land management and urban planning exigencies.\u201d Article 14 envisages two types of property \u2013 public property of public legal entities or state public property, and private property of public legal entities or state private property. Article 15 of the law establishes seven categories of State public property.19 All other properties not classified as State public property is state private property.20 In effect, this means that State private land is all land that is (a) not State public land and (b) not privately owned. The basic distinction between the two is that while state 18 Article 27 reads as: \u201cFor the purposes of facilitating the cultural, economic and social evolution of members of indigenous communities and in order to allow such members to freely leave the group or to be relieved from its constraints, the right of individual ownership of an adequate share of land used by the community may be transferred to them. Immovable property that is subject to such private individual ownership cannot fall under the general definition of public properties of the State public property category.\u201d 19 (i) Any property that has a natural origin, such as forests, courses of navigable or floatable water, natural lakes, banks of navigable and floatable rivers and seashores; (ii) Any property that is specially developed for general use, such as quays of harbors, railways, railway stations and airports; (iii) Any property that is made available, either in its natural state or after development, for public use, such as roads, tracks, oxcart ways, pathways, gardens and public parks, and reserved land; (iv) Any property that is allocated to render a public service, such as public schools or educational institutions, administrative buildings and all public hospitals; (v) Any property that constitutes a natural reserve protected by the law; (vi) Archeological, cultural and historical patrimonies; (vii) Immovable properties being royal properties that are not the private properties of the royal family. The reigning King manages royal immovable properties. 20 See Article 14. 14 private property can be the subject of sale, exchange, distribution or transfer of rights, state public property is inalienable and ownership of those properties is not subject to prescription and also cannot be acquired by the special acquisition provisions of the Land Law of 2001.21 The distinction of land as state public and private property becomes significance because it affects the rights and duties of indigenous communities to their lands \u2013 before, during and after the titling process.22 As a result of this classification and the resulting difference in rights and limitations imposed, a number of questions arise; chief among them is whether state public property, because of its \u201cinalienability\u201d, can be part of the community title as envisaged in the land law. It appears from the overall intent of the law and the wordings used in Chapter 3; and reading other laws such as the forestry law with it, that state public property can indeed be part of indigenous community property. This position has been argued by experts on the land issue in Cambodia, but remains in dispute.23 Another significant feature of the Land Law of 2001 is its recognition of the impact of the \u201cperiod of crisis from 1975 \u2013 1979\u201d on reconstituting ownership over land and therefore providing for a right in rem over \u201cimmovable property which was recognized since 1989\u201d that \u201cmay lead to the acquisition of ownership by the holder of the property\u201d in accordance with the conditions set by the land law.24 The condition for transforming possession into ownership is set out in Article 38 which provides that \u201cin order to transform into ownership of immovable property, the possession shall be unambiguous, non- violent, and notorious to the public, continuous and in good faith\u201d. The law is unclear however whether land left fallow as part of the traditional cultivation system constitutes an obstacle to a claim of ownership. In the case of a dispute over immovable property, Article 47 also provides that \u201csuch dispute[s] shall be submitted for investigation and resolution\u2026 The results of the investigation shall be submitted to the Cadastral Commission \u2026 (who) shall make a decision on the dispute.\u201d If there is disagreement or dis- satisfaction with the decision made by the Cadastral Commission, the disputants can file complaint to the courts. The organization and functioning of the Cadastral Commission is determined by a relevant sub- decree that was promulgated in 2002. Article 69 provides that the transfer of ownership shall be considered valid only upon the registration of the contract of sale with the Cadastral Registry Unit.

In other words, land can be legally transferred through a contract between the buyer and the seller without the requirement of registration to complete the transaction. The Land Law of 2001 sets out important provisions on communal ownership of property, specifically land, by indigenous communities. The law suggests the recognition of prior rights and claims of indigenous peoples over land and its resources. Another positive thing about the law is its recognition of traditional indigenous authorities and their customary law as a valid legal process in the determination of land claims. Its inclusion of some form of conflict resolution mechanisms is also encouraging. However it \u201cdoes not specifically spell out any mechanisms for land use planning and management that would link to community based natural resource management activities.\u201d25 What it does is provide an opportunity for indigenous communities to claim title over land which could lead to stronger control over their resources. 21 See Articles 16 and 17. 22 Suzie Brown et al. 23 Katrin Seidel et al. 24 Article 29. 25 The development of CBNRM in Cambodia. p. 68. 15 It is also true though that the Land Law of 2001 is, at times, in conflict with other laws in Cambodia, such as the Forest Law (to be discussed below) and such conflicts have yet to be resolved. 3.1.4 The Forest Law 2002 Cambodia has the largest intact deciduous forests in the Southeast Asian region and retains a large proportion of its natural forest cover. There are varying estimates on the amount of forest cover remaining, ranging from 30% to over 60%. Extensive deforestation has taken place since 1992-3, reflecting the lack of effective forest management plans and ongoing security problems.26 Ever since the early 1990s when concerns were raised about forest cover, the forest sector has seen many changes and transformations. \u201cFor international donors, forestry became the emblem of the governance problems facing the Cambodian state\u2026 (With) sustained attempts over nearly a decade to reform the sector and put in place a policy and legal framework that clearly defines the parameters of the sector. However, the sector has been marked by acute polarization around the problematic issue of concession allocation; abuse of the resource has been serious with evidence of over-logging and corruption. Despite a series of critical reviews, the concession system was accepted by major donors as the most effective form of institutional arrangement for resource management in Cambodia. This acceptance has cast long shadows over the policy debate and management of the sector. In effect, it has meant that forest policy has become equivalent to the management of forest concessions rather than starting from a broad societal viewpoint of agreement around what forest resources there are, how they are to be managed and for whose benefit\u201d.27 However some progress has been seen over the last few years. The Forestry Law came into force in August, 2002 seeking to define \u201cthe framework for management, harvesting, use, development and reservation of the forests ... (and) to ensure the sustainable management of forests for their social, economic and environmental benefits, including conservation of biological diversity and cultural heritage.28 The Forestry Law came on the heels of the Statement of the Royal Government on National Forest Policy, an important policy document issued in 2002 which outlines the government\u2019s commitment to conservation and sustainable management goals. The Policy designated Cambodia\u2019s remaining forest resources as Permanent Forest Estates to be maintained in perpetuity.29 It has been stated that this Policy is \u201cone of the most important existing pieces of legislation that links to CBRNM issues. This law contains important provisions on traditional use and access rights to forest resources, though these do not include management rights. More important are the provisions that allow for the creation and management of community forests, whereby communities are granted an area of the Permanent Forest Reserve to manage and derive benefits from.\u201d30 Article 2 ensures traditional user rights of timber products and Non Timber Forest Products for local communities. Article 4 is remarkable in its recognition of \u201cfull public participation in all government decisions that have the potential to impact on concerned communities, livelihoods of local communities and forest resources\u201d.31 (Emphasis added). Forest management is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of 26 Country and Regional Perspective on Resource Management. 27 Independent Forest Sector Review, p. 42 28 Article 1,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d2b283e-4b03-4de6-ae12-819a0a5d0766": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d2b283e-4b03-4de6-ae12-819a0a5d0766", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b721aab495b1c41bbcb425b3e2103a1a1d70185d69aaec2e95f3598fe5709dcc"}}, "hash": "b721aab495b1c41bbcb425b3e2103a1a1d70185d69aaec2e95f3598fe5709dcc", "text": "Forest Law 29 Singapore Yearbook of International Law (SYBIL) [2004] Vol. VIII, pp. 177-192 Alan Khee-Jin Tan 30The development of CBNRM in Cambodia. P. 70. 31 Article 4 Forest Law. 16 Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) 32 under which the Forest Administration (FA) is the government institution for implementing the management of forest and forest resources.33 One of the duties of the FA is to \u201cassess boundaries, classify and demarcate forests in order to establish a land use map of the Permanent Forest Estate in coordination with MLMUPC, local authorities and communities\u201d34 (Emphasis added). This provision is significant for its mandating of coordination between the two governmental agencies as it should reduce competing interest between them, a problem which has plagued forest management in the past. Similar mandates can be found in other provisions in the same law, and in this it is an improvement over the Land Law where such cooperation is not specifically mentioned. The FA is also required under the law to \u201cprepare a National Forest Management Plan with broad public participation of all authorities and communities concerned\u201d.35 Under the law, Permanent Forest Estate is categorized into Permanent Forest Reserve and Private Forest. The first is again further sub-categorized into: 1. Production Forest;36 2. Protection Forest;37 and 3. Conversion Forest. 38 The Permanent Forest Estate to be managed according to the principle of sustainable forest management should be classified, registered and demarcated by the MAFF who coordinates with concerned local communities, authorities and the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC) to assist in registration of land property of indigenous community and preparation of the national land use map.39 It is important to look at at the whole land use system of indigenous communities to ensure there is a coherent approach taken to the support of their livelihoods i.e. community forestry and communal land titling should go together to ensure that the intrinsic links between swidden agriculture and forest use are maintained with integrity. 40 Article 15 & 16 also seem to support the contention that indigenous community title can be given over forest lands demarcated as state public property by providing that activities of a concessionaire should not interfere with the customary user rights taking place on the land of indigenous communities and the customary access and user rights practiced by communities residing within, or adjacent to, concessions. Another indication of continuing title can be found within Article 37 which provides that local communities that traditionally practice shifting cultivation may conduct such practices on the lands of indigenous communities registered with the State. At the same time Article 37 restricts recognition of swidden agriculture where it demands a sub-decree to delineate forest areas in which swidden agriculture can occur. An independent review of the forestry sector in Cambodia observed that \u201cthis appears to imply 32 Artcile 3. 33 Article 5. 34 Article 7 (3) 35 Article 8. 36 Production Forest to be maintained in a manner to allow for the sustainable production of Timber products and, NTFPs, and protection as a secondary priority may consist of the following: Forest Concession; Production forest not under concession; - Rehabilitation Forest; Forestland for reforestation or tree plantation; reserved forestland for regeneration; and Degraded forestland. Article. 10. 37 Protection Forest shall be maintained primarily for protection of the forest ecosystem and natural resources therein. However exceptions are made for local communities who have traditional user rights to collect timber products and NTFPs within the Protection Forest. It may consist of: Reserved forest for special ecosystems; Research forest; Forest for regulating water sources and Forest for watershed protection, Recreation forest; Botanical gardens; and Religious forest. Article 10. 38 Conversion forest is idle land, comprised mainly of secondary vegetation, not yet designated to any sector, that shall be temporarily classified as Permanent Forest Reserve until the RGC designates the land for a specific use and purpose. 39 Article 11 40 Mary Hobley - Forest 17 that the prior allocation of land under the Land Law under communal title is an important step prior to any demarcation of forest land under the Permanent Forest Reserve (PFR). If the PFR demarcation precedes the Land Law communal titling, it is likely that indigenous peoples will have their access to future lands for swidden agriculture confined by the PFR.\u201d41 3.1.5 Protected Areas In 1993, a Royal Decree established a national system comprising of 23 protected areas classified under four major categories: National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Protected Landscapes, and Multiple Use Areas.

Combined, all of these areas cover 32,289 km\u00b2.

Together, these areas represent an additional 14,860 square kilometres under intentional protection. The country\u2019s entire system of protected areas covers 47,845 km\u00b2, or about 26.3% of Cambodia\u2019s land territory.42 A 2003 review of protected areas found that more personnel are needed for managing the protected areas.43 The draft law seeking to define the framework for management, conservation and sustainable development of protected areas set out its objectives, amongst other things, as the management and conservation, and sustainable use of natural resources in protected areas; to determine standards and procedures for managing protected areas; to determine the responsibilities and participation of local communities, indigenous ethnic minorities, and the public; and to implement regional and international conventions, protocols and agreements on the protection of biodiversity and ecosystem of protected areas.44 This draft law would also govern the management of the State public properties in protected areas.45 The Ministry of Environment is responsible for implementing the law, and developing a National Strategic Plan for Protected Area Management. Under the new draft law there are 9 categories of PAs: 1. National Park; 2. Wildlife sanctuary; 3. Protected landscape; 4. Multiple use area; 5. Ramsar site; 6. Biosphere reserve; 7.

It provides that the MoE, in collaboration with other ministries, shall develop an inventory that indicates the sources, types, and quantities of pollutants and wastes, toxic and hazardous substances being imported, generated, transported, recycled, treated, stored, disposed, or released into the airspace, water, land, or on land; the sources, types, and extent of noise and vibration disturbances. 3.1.7 Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Cambodia\u2019s freshwater fisheries produce over 400,000 tonnes per year and is the fourth largest national fisheries catch in the world after China, India and Bangladesh. The estimate of 400,000 tonnes is additionally considered to be an under-estimate.63 Fisheries in Cambodia are interlinked with annual floods of the Tonle Sap (Great Lake) and the Mekong-Bassac Delta around and downstream of Phnom Penh. About 14,000 square kilometres are flooded annually and fish migrations, as part of their breeding cycles, coincide with these floods. It is reported that more than 100 species regularly occur in the Tonle Sap catches, although up to 200 species have been recorded in the Tonle Sap itself and over 500 in the freshwaters of Cambodia.64 About 90% of the total inland production is from capture fisheries and the rest from aquaculture.65 Concerns have been raised about over-fishing, particularly of larger and less fertile species. The Fisheries and Administration Law (Fiat-Law No. 33 Kro chor of 1987), which is the principal fisheries legislation, does not provide for co-management arrangements or mechanisms. It does allow for subsistence fishing year round. The law identifies a fishery resource as \u201clive animal and vegetable\u201d found in the \u201cfishery domain\u201d which could be either inland66 or marine67. The Department of Fisheries under the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for implementing the law. In June 2005, the Sub-Decree on Community Fisheries Management designed to promote co-management of fisheries resources was adopted. It provides the rules and procedures for establishing and managing community fisheries throughout Cambodia. Each community fishery is to be led by a Community Fisheries Committee (CFC). No community fishery is allowed to manage fisheries in a designated area unless it has entered into an agreement, referred to as a community fisheries area agreement, with the Government of Cambodia through the Department of Fisheries (DOF). This agreement defines the extent of the designated area (a plan must be attached), provides the list of community fisheries and CFC members, local fisheries regulations and a statement setting forth management objectives. Community fisheries areas remain state public property, but community use rights are granted for a renewable three-year period.68 3.1.8 Water Resources The Overseas Development Agency (ODA) in 1993 proposed the creation of a Cambodian Water Management Authority to coordinate all government agencies involved in water use and management.

However, present electricity generation is entirely by thermal power plants using imported fuel and per capita power generation is the lowest in the region at 0.007 kW (Mekong Secretariat April 1995, pg 55). Despite the numerous ministries charged with water management in the country, not a single authority has looked at watershed management. Such attention is critical as communities rely on water supply from gravity feed. Most communities have also been looking after community catchments areas and the destruction of such areas would not only affect the communities but wildlife within a particular habitat. 3.1.9 Commune Administration Law 2001 The Commune Administration Law (2001)69 provides for the establishment of Commune Councils to manage small groups of villages (communes) through local elections, government funding for their work, and a local development planning process. The Commune which governs the local affairs based on the Constitution70, with legislative and executive authority vested to the Commune. While the recognition of the Commune Council is important and would provide indigenous communities the opportunity to have a say in local affairs, in practice the system has been shown to be subject to abuse. Most land sales and registration apparently involve Commune Chiefs without the consent of the affected communities. As such, the tendency to address this is to limit the scope of Commune Councils to avoid abuse of power and ensure that any dealings with respect to indigenous lands should be consistent with the Sub-decree on Registration of Indigenous Land Rights. There is a growing awareness for the need to recognize that the traditional authority provided for in the Land Law 2001 need not be assumed to be the Commune Council. Thus the role of the Commune Council may be seen more for the physical development of communities such as infrastructure, education and participation in local government, while the traditional leaders can take the role of maintaining the cultural and territorial integrity of the community. 3.1.10 Management and Exploitation of Mineral Resources71 Under this law, the word \"land owner\" refers to general landowners, where indigenous communities could be included. Under Article 5, \"legal owners or possessors of private land can use gravel, sand, stones and clay without requiring license, but they are not permitted to transport beyond the boundary of that land for business purposes\". The law does not provide a mechanism for obtaining free, prior informed consent. Neither does it mention the right of land owners to reject exploitation of resources in their lands. However, it does provide for compensation under Article 26.72 69 Passed January 12, 2001, and promulgated March 19, 2001 70 Article 5 71 Passed on 30 May 2001, and promulgated July 13, 2001 72 If there are people living in licensed operating areas for mining resources before an operating license is issued, the mining licensed concessionaire must pay just and equitable compensation to owners in case of impact upon land ownership. This compensation must arise from the agreement between owners and the concessionaire. 21 3.2 Policy for Highland Peoples' Development The Cambodian Government established an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) in 1994 to develop a policy on indigenous and ethnic minority peoples, as part of the government\u2019s plans to improve the quality of life of indigenous peoples living in highland and mountainous areas. The Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) is composed of a wide range of Ministries, including the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport; the Ministry of Health; the Ministry of Public Works and Transport; the Ministry of Social Affairs, Labors, Vocational Training and Youth Rehabilitation; the Ministry of Women's and Veterans Affairs; the Ministry of Environment; and the Cambodian Mines Action Centre. At present, IMC is the main body that represents the government in coordinating activities with national and international institutions working in the northeastern provinces of Cambodia, where the majority of indigenous peoples are living. From 1994 till 1999, IMC did several meetings and workshop in order to develop the draft of the indigenous policy and then the IMC officially ended its mandate at the end of 1999. From 2000 through until June 2001, there was no real work done and the policy was remained in draft form. In June 2001 the Government created the Department of Ethnic Minorities Development (DEMD) within the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), whose role is to prepare short-, medium-, and long-term development plans for indigenous peoples, to conduct research on identity, culture and traditions of indigenous peoples and to provide training for development workers in cooperation with different local and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93a5cc32-1769-407b-8b64-4fd0217f4be9": {"__data__": {"id_": "93a5cc32-1769-407b-8b64-4fd0217f4be9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "895f6e6efcd971553c148e3e155f442d901be4eccadabc344fa1e302cad20b05"}}, "hash": "895f6e6efcd971553c148e3e155f442d901be4eccadabc344fa1e302cad20b05", "text": "international development agencies. In addition the Department was given the mandate to prepare and revise the policy on the indigenous people in order to submit to the government for approval. The DEMD is playing an important role in finalizing the Policy for Highland Peoples' Development (now called National Policy for Development of Indigenous Peoples after the national consultation in August 2005). The drafting of the policy for indigenous peoples demonstrates the Government\u2019s intention to accommodate and preserve indigenous groups, give them some group-specific citizenship rights and promote a multicultural society. Strongly influenced by ILO Convention No. 169, this document details a number of objectives, intentions, and measures to accommodate the country\u2019s indigenous communities. The policy consists of three chapters - General Provisions, Guidelines and Action Plan. The main difference in the current draft to the original document is that the previous references to \"indigenous minority people\" have now been replaced with \"indigenous peoples\". The General Provisions highlight the need for indigenous peoples to be consulted in development processes and to be part of the decision-making process, and for indigenous peoples to have the same rights and duties as other Cambodian citizens. It also affirms that indigenous peoples have the right to manage their natural resources. Among the gaps in the present policy draft is the need to respect indigenous land rights, culture and indigenous knowledge per se and not judged based on what is appropriate. In Chapter 2, the guidelines to implement the policy address issues on environment, land, agriculture, education, health, culture, access to justice for indigenous peoples and infrastructure. Under environment, one gap identified is the lack of recognition of the role that indigenous peoples play in the management of their natural environment and natural resources as an important contribution to the preservation of national natural resources. The language on consent is weak and needs to be strengthened in line with emerging principles of Free, Prior and Informed Consent. On land, the proposed monitoring of the effectiveness of land use and the development of measures to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources by the Village-Commune Natural Resource Management Committee (VCNRMC) may not align with the interest of indigenous communities. There is a need to first explore the possibility of 22 allowing village elders within traditional authorities and members of the community to take on this role. There are some major gaps under the Guidelines for the Agriculture Sector. The existing statement in the Khmer version talks about research and extension and the increase of tree planting. This should be changed to emphasize improving existing agricultural methods by working jointly with farmers and making use of their local knowledge. There should be a clear statement of Government support for traditional and rotational forms of swidden agriculture. Emphasis to \"promote the investment in agricultural sector and organize an integrated agricultural production in order to increase agricultural production\" (Article 3.1) may not be the best option for indigenous communities. The guidelines discussion on education is progressive, including an article calling for the establishment of community learning centres and the training of indigenous teachers who would then teach in the own community. However, the policy could further include the use, practice and development of indigenous languages to be guaranteed by the State, the strengthening of, and respect for, of indigenous forms of education and transmission of knowledge, and the establishment of formal and informal, bilingual intercultural educative and literacy programmes in consultation and with participation of indigenous peoples. Likewise the guidelines for implementation under the Health Sector could look into the establishment of traditional health centres. The suggested policy guidelines under the Culture Sector appear to be comprehensive. On infrastructure, the main the issue is the lack of a mechanism to obtain Free, Prior and Informed Consent of communities prior to any development taking place. Chapter 3 of the Policy on the priority action plan outlines six points, namely: human resource development, particularly for women; poverty reduction; improving the information system for indigenous peoples; strengthening indigenous communities especially for traditional elders, women and children; ensuring community participation; and training of government staff and NGOs working with indigenous peoples. This policy was first submitted to the Council of Ministers in 1997 and discussed in two sessions, but was not approved. After several rounds of revisions through wide consultations, the Policy was again presented to the Council of Ministers in February 2006, but it was again rejected. 23 4.

It will also look at current efforts to harness indigenous natural resource management systems with other systems to illustrate the need to further develop such initiatives, as well as examine and illustrate the roles of government, NGO's, community organizations and donors. Recognizing the need for indigenous peoples' involvement in natural resource management, section 3.4 will highlight mechanisms and issues for effective participation. 4.1 Indigenous Peoples and State Legal and Policy Framework 4.1.1 Implementation of Laws and Policies It may appear that currently several laws and policies exist that protect indigenous rights. However, the actual implementation of these laws and policies is far from being realized. For example, the implementation of Land Law 2001 is hindered by lack of efforts to resolve land tenure issues with respect to affected communities who were included in national parks. As a result, the recognition of indigenous knowledge on forest resources, and community participation in park protection and management are takes a back seat. Conflicting information, such as the prohibition from living and conducting swidden agriculture within certain zones inside the park, are confusing for indigenous peoples and must be clarified. Although there is some progress in the titling of communal lands, many issues and questions remain. Pilot Project on Community Title Three areas were selected as pilot sites for the communal titling of land - two in Ratanakiri and one in Mondolkiri province. Lessons learned/issues 1. Where there are strong support groups, the project appears to have gone well. One of the pilot site in Ratanakiri which lacks such support groups is proving to be difficult; 2. Except the MoE, other Ministries are not actively involved in the project; 3. Too many issues and agencies involved, making the process confusing; 4. No person and body who works on the project consistently, either from NGOs or from other advisory bodies; 5. Indigenous organizations and communities are not empowered to pursue communal land titling; 6. There are doubts on whether the community is really interested in communal titles, even after the communities have clearly showed their preference for communal title. A series of information workshops were held to explain the difference between communal and individual titles. However, the process was over-simplified for example the provincial governor once came and asked the people to put up their hands to choose and they all chose to opt for communal titles; 7. Many see the community consultations as a time-consuming and unnecessary exercise; 8. Although many discussions were held about traditional authority, there are still doubts as to what this actually refers to; 9. \"Communal Title\" used in the land law has some negative connotations; and 10. A number of donors are willing to support the titling of land and there are plans to expand the project to another area. 24 Interview with Key Informants Although indigenous rights are now legally recognized in Cambodia under the Forest Law and the Community Forestry Sub-Decree to complement community management of forest that has been a traditional form of forest management in Cambodia, these legal instruments have not yet to be developed and implemented. 4.1.2 Implementing Ownership Rights Framework In Cambodia, indigenous peoples have traditionally managed natural resources communally under the guidance of community leaders. Currently they have come to accept ownership of land through communal titling of areas based on territories traditionally occupied by a particular community. Communal titles are perceived as providing security and would ensure that communities are in control and are better able to manage natural resources in traditional territories. This compliments the government's clear policy and recognition on the importance of the social function of land for sustainable economic and social development, poverty reduction, decentralized administration, good governance, equitable land distribution to assist the poorest of the poor, and tenure security to prevent or resolve conflicts. It also recognizes the importance of preventing illegal land acquisition and land concentration. However, titling on areas where indigenous communities are most vulnerable to being dispossessed has not been given priority. Indigenous Land Titling At a planning meeting in 2002 for the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS), some of the reasons why communal land titling will be beneficial for indigenous communities: 1. Ensure traditional access of established local communities to common property resources (land, forest and waterways) is not usurped by new groups; 2. Improve limited/insecure access of the poor to common resources; 3. Ensure tenure security for rural people by correcting weaknesses in existing land practices and laws, 4.

Improve farmers\u2019, rural poor and other vulnerable groups\u2019 access to land, water and other productive inputs for sustainable livelihoods, food security and overall socio-economic development. NPRS 2002 4.1.3 Implementing Use Rights Framework Cambodia's law on recognition of customary use rights is among the most progressive in the region. The Forest Law (Article 15) and the Sub-Decree on Forest Concession Management (Article 2) both provides for the rights of indigenous peoples living within or adjacent to a forest concession by ensuring that they do not interfere with the customary user rights of indigenous communities and to protect and maintain their access rights to forest resources that are of economic, subsistence and spiritual value to them. Recognizing that indigenous peoples are not immune to the possibility of overexploiting forest resources does not necessarily mean that their rights to use of resources should be curtailed, but rather that a check and balance for ensuring sustainable management should be put in place. Root causes for local overexploitation also need to be ascertained, and if necessary, relevant assistance provided. 4.1.4 Recognition of Customary Law 25 Again the recognition of traditional authorities\u2019 i.e indigenous governance over natural resource management, by the Land Law 2001 is very progressive. Customary laws on natural resource management is still very much respected by Cambodia's indigenous communities, and are being implemented as part of peoples' way of life. However, with the introduction of the commune councils and the Commune Council Law, coupled with the tendencies by most governments to look up to leaders who are literate or to put in place regulations that are more in line with state laws and policies, it can be very easy to replace the traditional authorities and customary laws. If this happens, it would pave the way for illegal land acquisition and land concentration and over-exploitation of resources that could seriously result in conflicts within the community and among authorities. In the long run, this could contribute towards the lack of confidence among community members themselves. Section 2.2 illustrated a highly evolved and time-tested system that remains very applicable to the everyday lives of Brao people. It suggests that indigenous natural resource management strategies can be much more effective, at least at the local level, if they were integrated into Brao law. For example, established Ya Weu could be asked to act as judges in cases when community natural resource management regulations are broken by outsiders or members of the community. Thus far, other laws on natural resource management have not attempted to incorporate customary practices and laws into statutory laws as seen in many countries in the region. The recognition of customary law and traditional authorities is a step in the right direction. A programme to train traditional leaders to engage and communicate effectively with government departments, and vice-versa would be more appropriate than introducing other forms of governance within indigenous communities. It is also important to clarify the roles of both commune councils and traditional authorities in every community. A new project by UNDP Cambodia is working with communities to clarify roles of traditional authorities and build from these exiting institutions instead of promoting new ones that are alien to indigenous peoples. 4.1.5 Conflict in Perceptions Contrasting perception between locals and outsiders, and wilderness and cultural landscape continues to dominate the debate over natural resource management. Conservation thinking tended to opt for preservation of \u201cwilderness\u201d areas and therefore the automatic rejection of any human influence. However, this focus on the steady state of \u201cwilderness\u201d has hindered a realistic appraisal of the role of disturbance processes and change in maintaining ecosystems (Ironside and Baird, 2003). Often the \"balance between protection of indigenous culture and becoming developed\" is equated with giving up certain rights. While culture is dynamic, it does not necessarily mean accepting modern lifestyles, but rather embracing aspects of both. Being able to attend school is used as a measure of development, even though indigenous peoples insist that school curricula must respect indigenous cultures as it has resulted in the alienation of indigenous youths from their own community. These are but a few of the conflicting perceptions of indigenous peoples and natural resources conservation and management held by communities and by outsiders. These conflicting perceptions tend to complicate the issues and result in indigenous peoples being treated as subjects for studies, rather than owners of the process of their own development and little effort is placed in trying to gain an understanding of indigenous peoples' own perceptions of their path of development. 4.1.6 Recognition of Indigenous Natural Resource Management System 26 Indigenous knowledge on natural resource management", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62c4de2d-7296-4da8-818b-5a4f2859249e": {"__data__": {"id_": "62c4de2d-7296-4da8-818b-5a4f2859249e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4533a0d0fde43824de793dd24a2c595d8f48d91175024eef5c3d84a1d4765fc"}}, "hash": "a4533a0d0fde43824de793dd24a2c595d8f48d91175024eef5c3d84a1d4765fc", "text": "needs to be recognized, an recognition that remains in Cambodia partial and even then, only on paper. Many of the recommendations for natural resource management still tend to rely on western concpets, rather than promoting indigenous customary practices. In the process of enhancing the capacity of indigenous peoples to promote natural resource management, there is a need to look at these issues to ensure that the process will promote traditional systems of natural resource management. A management plan that outlines benefits and responsibilities for both government and indigenous peoples would ensure that indigenous culture is protected, sustainable incomes from the forests are assured, and wildlife and biodiversity is conserved. Yeak Loam Lake Ecotourism Project Tampoun community around the Yeak Loam Lake harnessed their traditional knowledge in managing the habitat in and around the lake to provide an income through an ecotourism project. The community also established a museum and traditional structures to provide information about Tampuon cultures to visitors. Though the income is modest, the community is proud of their efforts, which has at the same time enabled them to conserve the natural beauty of the lake and surrounding forest. Wanai Lieng, Tampuon from Yeak Loam 4.1.7 Land Demarcation Land as a vital part of indigenous peoples\u2019 lives must be clearly demarcated. Numerous issues remain to be addressed that touch on key issues, particularly in the interface between indigenous peoples\u2019 concept of land and that of the State. Failure to recognize this would render much of the effort on natural resource management useless and may only end up facilitating further conflicts. Considerations on Land Demarcation There are some serious issues of sequencing and policy process to be considered. 1. There needs to be definition, identification and agreement of what constitutes \u2018state public property\u2019 \u2013 this requires a set of subsidiary processes to clarify what can sit within this overall category 2. There needs to be agreement on the definition and identification of the lands of indigenous communities 3. There needs to be definition and identification of those core areas of forests that should be retained under a protected area system and areas of high environmental service function (e.g. watersheds) 4. There needs to be definition and identification on the ground of those areas of forest that could be managed under some form of production (the actual institutional arrangements to be determined \u2013 e.g. groups (communities, communes), small-scale \u2018industrial\u2019 forests, concessions, direct management by the public sector) 5. There needs to be definition and identification on the ground of those areas that are available for agriculture (the actual institutional arrangements to be determined \u2013 family farms, small scale \u2018industrial\u2019 farms, large-scale concession agriculture) Without this clarity and agreement about the broad process and criteria for allocation of lands, insecurity will continue and permit the continued and escalating alienation of land by those who have the most power and political connections. In terms of sequencing, although logically the Land Law should take precedence, there is no mechanism to ensure that it does. Cambodia does not have a hierarchy of laws, although in terms of precedence set by when a law was passed, the Forestry Law should be applied 27 subsequent to the application of the terms of the Land Law. Under Forestry Law the Administration is empowered to determine the Permanent Forest Estate, even though logically steps 1 and 2 above should happen prior to the definition of the Estate. In both cases the process followed for definition and demarcation must be a local participatory process for clear mechanisms to address grievances over land allocation decisions. Mary Hobley - Forest 4.1.8 Developing Partnerships and Mutual Leanings Mistrust between government authorities and indigenous communities still hinders openness and sharing of responsibilities. Consultation and information-sharing that could build partnerships and mutual leaning are not built into mechanisms on natural resource management. For example, villagers believe that since the local people withdrew from the Virachey National Park, outside hunters and NTFP collectors have had more opportunities to exploit resources. It is not possible for park rangers to effectively control this influx, due to the park\u2019s size. The destruction of the rattan and eaglewood resources over the recent past can be partly attributed to the fact that there are no longer communities living in these areas. If partnership between park authorities and the people exist, villagers can assist in monitoring the park, as has been successfully demonstrated in other countries in the region. Indigenous peoples believe that if they were allowed to live in the park, they could help to control illegal hunting and NTFP exploitation. Some communities have already established committees for this", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90bd50de-e81e-43d8-96ba-5672138ad9e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "90bd50de-e81e-43d8-96ba-5672138ad9e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24eddf55910927e0cfb347dcd0cb8693fbd7c2db482f474546083b60356ca2bf"}}, "hash": "24eddf55910927e0cfb347dcd0cb8693fbd7c2db482f474546083b60356ca2bf", "text": "purpose. (Ironside and Baird, 2003). The policy to move indigenous peoples\u2019 communities and to change their cultures, thinking and way of life has only served to perpetuate mistrusts and suspicions, instead of harnessing the knowledge and skills on other livelihood strategies, particularly on swidden agriculture. Historical disharmony Challenges for developing partnerships and mutual learning are enormous as this goes against the history of relationships between indigenous peoples and outsiders. For indigenous groups, particularly in Northeast Cambodia, the slave trade, which continued over such a long period and with such intensity, was cultural rape. The disharmony continued with the relocation of Brao and Kavet people to lowland villages adjacent to the Sekong and Se San Rivers in the early 1960s in order to \u201ceducate\u201d and \u201cKhmerise\u201d them; then continuing with the draconian policies of the Khmer Rouge to make wet rice paddy rice cultivators out of swidden agriculture farmers, and finally with the policies of the State of Cambodia government to keep the people in the lowlands Ironside and Baird, 2003 4.1.9 Strengthening Links Between Government and Indigenous Communities The Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) for Highland Peoples Development formed by the Royal Government of Cambodia in 1994, and is composed of the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport; the Ministry of Health; the Ministry of Public Works and Transport; the Ministry of Social Affairs, Labors, Vocational Training and Youth Rehabilitation; the Ministry of Women's and Veterans Affairs; the Ministry of Environment; and the Cambodian Mines Action Centre. Having a committee at such a high political level to look specifically at indigenous issues is an important step in ensuring a broader understanding indigenous peoples' situation and is critical in the establishment of more equitable laws and policies. It is 28 unfortunate therefore, that the IMC was apparently dissolved after the creation of the Department of Ethnic Minorities Development (DEMD). Nevertheless, the DEMD has played an important role in finalizing the Policy for Highland Peoples' Development and has a potential role to act as an important link between government departments and indigenous peoples. There is a need to raise the profile and capacity of the DEMD as it appears to be at a low rank in the hierarchy of the government. An obstacle for strengthening links between the government and indigenous communities is the weakness on the side of the government staff in their understanding of the cultures and histories of indigenous peoples, in linking biodiversity conservation and indigenous resource management systems, ecological agriculture, forest management and regeneration processes and understanding the significance of swidden agriculture and forest collection activities for peoples\u2019 livelihoods. There is also an obvious lack of skills in communicating effectively with local people. Such a lack of understanding and ability to communicate is a crucial issue that must be addressed before effective relationships between the government and indigenous communities can be established and strengthened. 4.1.10 Research and Information Dissemination Several good examples exist in Cambodia of research work with indigenous communities in the field of natural resources management. There are also many institutions that involve government, local and international NGO\u2019s and UN agencies that have developed tools and models of participatory action research. However, the inaccessibility and remoteness of most villages hampers information dissemination. Producing information that is easily understood also poses a challenge. Many indigenous peoples did and still do not have access to formal schooling, making it difficult to promote written materials. More popular forms such as radio programmes and audio-visuals have been found to be most effective. Community Documentation Project The Ratanakiri Natural Resource Management Network (RNRMN) started a video project to document the situation faced by indigenous communities. In this project, indigenous representatives are given basic training in handling video cameras and editing, and subsequently assigned to take footages of interviews and scenes in their own villages. Video productions are done in Khmer or indigenous languages and translated into English for wider distribution. This activity has proven to be of immense support to communities facing various problems and an important awareness-raising and alliance-building tool. Wanai Lieng, RNRMN Sharing of Information The Community-Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) Learning Initiative in Cambodia has been considering plans to scale up its efforts in promoting CBNRM in the country and in the region towards the formation of a \u201cCBNRM Learning Institute\u201d. Initiated in June 2001, the CBNRM Learning Initiative has been actively working with local communities in the areas of capability-building, learning, networking, and policy support.

A major activity of the CBNRM Learning Initiative has been the holding of case study writing workshops that aim to synthesize insights from CBNRM efforts by local communities, enhance people\u2019s research and analytical skills, and 29 develop and extend the network of organizations and institutions in CBNRM. These case study writing workshops have not only served as a venue for the sharing of experiences among CBNRM practitioners in Cambodia and Southeast Asia, but have also contributed in promoting CBNRM as a viable and important aspect of socio-economic development efforts particularly in the case of the Royal Government of Cambodia. The workshop outputs have likewise served as basis for the development of relevant policy and legal frameworks in CBNRM. Regional Newsletter on CBCRM 4.2 Harnessing Indigenous Natural Resource Management Indigenous peoples\u2019 detailed knowledge can be use in community mapping to identify important cultural sites, terrestrial habitats and place names in their traditional territories, etc. Traditional resource management systems and the traditional legal systems of indigenous peoples or vice-versa, can also be integrated with other resource management systems. In remote areas, this traditional legal system could continue to be used to resolve their conflicts. Although the contribution of traditional knowledge on resource management such as the above has often been quoted, there is still a tendency for these statements to be mere lip service. The ground reality requires not only political will but active engagement especially from communities themselves. Nevertheless, there are already ongoing efforts particularly mapping of community protected areas. 4.3 Impact of Natural Resources Development on Women Women and Development Indigenous women play a major role in agriculture and collection of forest products. While men mostly do the hunting and fishing, and undertake more physical agricultural work, women have to be more knowledgeable and hardworking than men as their work involves the maintenance and the supervision of the field crops, and regular harvesting visits to the forest areas. Women also have to collect firewood and water, take care of the children, farm animals and manage with all the traditional activities. Women have good knowledge of resources available in the forest and around their fields. As more lands are taken for orchards, cash crops, oil palm and rubber plantations, women will be severely affected as they lose control of an important part of the surrounding village area which they currently use to gather, collect and cultivate food resources. While collective rights traditionally include women, sometimes even as primary managers, private ownership that has been introduced through the land law could exclude women in ownership and control of natural resources. In an impact assessment of the Yali Falls dam on the Se San River in Ratanakari, indigenous women complained about the loss of their livelihoods. Activities by women such as fishing using scoop baskets and nets to catch small fish and shrimps along the river, collecting of wild vegetables and bird eggs from the riverbanks during the dry season has been severely affected. The dam has also disrupted gold panning and dry-season gardens and women feel that have lost their independence, and have to rely on men to supply fish and some other food sources. 30 4.4 Institutional Structures For many years, NGOs promote food security programs including providing seeds of a variety of fruit trees, and promoting livestock rearing and agricultural technologies. Many NGOs and government departments are also working on natural resource management, which had established forest committees. Those organizations are Ratanakiri Network Support Project (RNSP), Highlander Association (HA), Non- Timber Forest Project (NTFP), CIDSE (now called Development and Partnership), ICC, Seila and CEDAC. At the same, many NGOs also involved with improving the infrastructures including school, Health Center, and rural road. Indigenous organizations in Cambodia are still unable to effectively engage with governments, local and international NGOs and UN agencies. The next four sub-sections will look at the institutions involved in natural resource management and the mechanisms for engagement. 4.4.1 Government Cambodia\u2019s current institutional approach on natural resources management is to assign responsibility for state resource management to sectoral ministries at the national level, which subsequently assign it through the provincial departments. Provincial governors also exercise control over state resources, particularly in areas where ministries do not have active management control. Active and sustained mechanisms to coordinate among these ministries and governors are lacking and very dependent on financial resources from international donors. As seen in Chapter 2, each ministry would be guided by the laws and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d45d1978-c7bf-4098-badd-68fe521717c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "d45d1978-c7bf-4098-badd-68fe521717c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f99d25ef0c26e3064ef22c088eeef9099e4054f105b59da1a79a981b5a47c4c5"}}, "hash": "f99d25ef0c26e3064ef22c088eeef9099e4054f105b59da1a79a981b5a47c4c5", "text": "decrees. 4.4.2 Community Organisations The growing capacities of a number of indigenous networks such as the Indigenous Forum and associations have played an important role in raising the awareness of communities, especially in remote areas. Particularly important are the roles in organizing activities to enable communities to understand the provisions in the land law, forest law and in international human rights instruments on indigenous peoples' rights as well as the ongoing processes such as the policy on indigenous peoples' development and the draft protected area law. Indigenous networks and associations could also play a role in encouraging collaboration with local and international NGOs and donors to enhance the capacity of community representatives and organizers to improve knowledge and skill to dialogue with the government, investors and donors as well as assist community representatives in attending relevant workshops and conferences at the national and international levels. Community organizations at the village level have an important role in promoting traditional natural resources management system and strengthening traditional authorities and mechanisms for decision- making of the community. This implies the active promotion and inter-generational transfer of knowledge on indigenous culture and identity. The village-level community organizations also need to coordinate their engagement and to participate effectively in various processes to voice their perspectives on community development to guarantee the rights and interests of indigenous peoples. 31 Highlander Association The Highlander Association (HA), which was set up as a network that is governed by committees at the village and commune level to strengthen solidarity and traditional practices such as reciprocity within communities, be it exchange of food or labour. It has conducted studies of indigenous peoples' livelihoods, history and traditional culture. It also conducts workshops and other educational activities to discuss about land tenure and natural resource management issues. Where requested, it also promotes income generating activities such as cashew nut marketing, animal husbandry and credit project as well as the collection and marketing of forest products. Members of the HA are actively involved in the process of registering communal land titles and in urging the goverment to implement laws and develop legal mechanisms to protect natural resources and indigenous peoples' rights. Dam Chanty, Highlander Association Roles of Traditional Leaders Traditional leaders govern the communities, including natural resources, using customary law. Traditional leaders mobilize labor and other resources to support community members during harvest, planting and ceremonies. They also play a role in supporting weak community members. Particularly, when conflicts arise, they have to bring the offenders and offended together in order to find mutual agreed settlements. The elders and women healers, who are also considered traditional leaders, conduct spiritual ceremonies, communicate with spirits and pray for the good health of community members. Leaders are also responsible for transferring traditional knowledge to young people. For many years now, traditional leaders have increasingly small roles and authority in governing communities, with the government progressively claiming more power. It is the government who created and gave authority to the local administrative structure which is now key in the management of local areas. Pat Chan Seng, Tampuon 4.4.3 Local, National and International NGO's Many NGOs have been active in promoting the land law, forest law and indigenous peoples' rights, focusing their efforts on the right to utilize, own and control land and natural resources. NGOs that have good relations with government have also facilitated engagement between communities and relevant departments. NGOs and the SEILA program of the government established the community forest and also strengthened the capacity of NRM committees. These NRM committee play an important role in facilitating the community in establishing rules and regulations for the community forest. These committee also developed the participatory land use plan (PLUP), assisted in demarcating community boundaries, provided classification of several types of land use and protection areas. However, the committees largely failed in these activities due to lack of support from local authorities (commune councils) and community members. A number of communities have also expressed a need for NGOs to have a more sustained campaign for the recognition of indigenous peoples' rights to natural resources, and to pressure the government to enforce laws have been adopted and which are supposed to protect their interests. 32 NGO Forum The NGO Forum is made up of local and international non-governmental organizations grounded in their experience of humanitarian and development assistance to Cambodia. The NGO Forum exists for information sharing, debate and advocacy on priority issues affecting Cambodia\u2019s development. The NGO Forum has an important role to highlight the impact of development processes and economic, social and political changes on Cambodians.

The former is aimed at cooperating with various organizations to ensure that the capacity of indigenous peoples to advocate for their own rights is strengthened and that their concerns are heard and acted upon by the government, donors and the wider community, particularly in relation to their rights to land and natural resources. The forest livelihood project strives to enable local communities living in and near forest areas to gain secure tenure over the forest resources that they have traditionally relied upon for their social, economic, and cultural development. www.ngoforum.org.kh 4.4.4 Donors and UN Agencies Donors and UN agencies played a very important role in shaping the laws and policies on natural resource management in Cambodia. Further technical and financial support to clarify these laws and policies to ensure their feasibility for implementation on the ground, particularly with and for indigenous peoples, has been significant. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that gaps in understanding indigenous systems, which also exists for donors and UN agencies, need to be addressed so as to avoid imposing western ideas on local institutions and customary laws and practices. The concerns that donors and UN agencies themselves have identified, such as having effective consultations, providing continuity and avoiding financial dependence, need to be seriously addressed in order to ensure that continued support is effective. 5. Challenges and Drawbacks This Chapter will focus on cases illustrating challenges and drawbacks in the implementation of laws and policies on natural resource management. 5.1 Illegal Land Sales and Land Grabbing The foremost challenge in relation to indigenous peoples and NRM today is the illegal sale and acquisition of land - \u2018land grabbing\u2019. Communities, concerned government officials, international agencies and NGOs concur that if this land grabbing continues, indigenous peoples are at risk of being displaced and all past efforts on legal and policy change and poverty-reduction strategies will be rendered useless. Many indigenous communities are being deceived daily into losing their lands, although there is a growing awareness within indigenous communities of the danger of illegal land acquisition, as expressed by the statement by a gathering of indigenous peoples in 2004. Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Statement on Land Sales 33 Numerous illegal land sales and land grabbing have been identified in Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri as confirmed by indigenous peoples by the Indigenous Forum in 2004. A statement by the NGO Forum to draw the attention of the government and developers in October 2004 stressed that this contradict the intent of the 2001 Land Law and the policy priorities identified by the Poverty Reduction Strategy of the government. To illustrate the nature of the problem, the statement mentioned examples such as the issuance of 70,000 ha of land concession over the land of the Suy indigenous people in Kompong Speu; 1,400 ha and 2,000 ha of gem mining concession over indigenous peoples' landing Lumphat district and Borkeo district respectively in Ratanakiri province and 200,000 ha concession proposed for Mondolkiri province. The statement said that the traditional management systems of indigenous communities are being destroyed by individual land sales of community land mainly to powerful businessmen. Land sales were approved by individuals within the community but in an environment of insufficient information, disinformation, and sometimes threats and intimidation. In other cases, the local authorities (commune councils) arbitrarily sell land without informing the people living on the land, while in other cases land is forcibly occupied by powerful indigenous and non-indigenous individuals with strong connections with powerful individuals. Indigenous communities are demanding for a moratorium on land sales and on granting land concessions that affects traditional lands until the adoption of the sub-decree on both indigenous collective titles and economic concessions. Indigenous communities also want the forests and water resources traditionally used by them to be recognised as part of the traditional management and ownership of indigenous communities. Respect for traditional structures is also urged to ensure community solidarity and cultures are kept strong, and for new governance structures need to respect and consult traditional systems. www.NGOForum.org.kh 5.2 Developing Partnerships and Mutual Learning Information dissemination as an important mechanism towards partnerships and mutual learning is a major challenge, due largely to language and cultural barriers. Most indigenous peoples have lacked access to formal education and Khmer literacy levels are low. In strengthening links between government and indigenous communities, a major challenge includes encouraging government staff to spend more time in villages, to learn from local people and increase interactions with key elders in the communities.

A report on the latest National Consultation Report states that \"the indigenous representatives seemed to get lost in the midst of these intellectual debates on the meanings of words and phrases. Some of them seemed to have difficulty to read the documents, hence clearly limiting their participation. All these are just observations without real discussion due to limited timeframe\". This indicates that there was a lack of information on the policy paper despite the length of time it has been in circulation. In circulating document, local languages should be used and promoted as much as much as possible through appropriate media such as community radio and audio-visual materials discussed earlier. Another drawback is misunderstanding about indigenous land use practices: 34 \"Misunderstandings abound regarding land use practices of indigenous peoples. Outsiders and government officials assume that the local people are nomadic, and that their farming systems are environmentally destructive, with low agricultural productivity. Even though humans have lived in and helped shape large areas of Virachey National Park, for example, within the wilderness paradigm it is heretical to suggest that swidden systems might have had, and could have, a role in conserving overall landscape biodiversity. The real question about the future role of swidden is: can swidden be used to stimulate the ecological processes that can best achieve the most productive food webs and the most biodiversity habitats both for community use and wildlife?\" (Ironside and Baird, 2003) More recently in Cambodia, efforts on collaborative management in protected areas have received a large amount of interest among government, international NGOs and funding agencies. However, the collaborative management initiatives in protected areas where indigenous peoples have been residing are facing major challenges as the case in Virachey National Park illustrates. Collaborative Management, Indigenous Peoples and Protected Areas Community members say collaboration so far has only been shallow and that a lot of what the Park staff says is empty because there has been a lot of discussion but little implementation. People feel the Park staff do not allow them to understand too much (access sufficient information) and that the staff work very far from the people. Kok Lak people compare the NTFP\u2019s regular partnership with the community with the partnership efforts of the Park staff in Virachey NP. Meetings are only once every 2-3 (up to 6) months. Sometimes meetings are short \u2013 1-2 hours. People say that if they have long meetings, the Park staff and rangers are afraid people will ask a lot about illegal activities in the park. People suspect Park staff of being involved in illegal activities. Before the staff did not have anything, now they have motorcycles and houses. Community representatives say there is no justice or equitability in the management of the Park. Examples used to illustrate these feelings included the fact that no Kok Lak people are employed, only Lao and Khmer people; that the community committees have been chosen to assist with Park activities but there have been no meetings with them for nearly a year; that a signed agreement was made about the boundary for a CPA but now they are told that people do not have any right to manage that area and must get a permit to enter anywhere in the Park; and that there is still no assistance with agriculture and with buffaloes for lowland rice growing despite promises by the Park staff prior to the establishment of the Park. Now, since the recent logging, villagers are starting to say that rangers want to stop people from going into the Park because they can make partnerships with local businessmen/companies (made up of Police, Military Police, Chinese traders) to exploit the resources of the Park. At present, small scale loggers are cutting Granugn wood in the forests to the south of the Park and people are worried that in the future this activity will encroach into the Park. Park Rangers are telling people not to hunt animals, and will even be stopped if they have a fish. People however see the rangers going on patrol and then they hear mines and guns going off in the forest. People also say they have seen the remains of samba deer, gibbon and monkey in the forest that have been eaten by the rangers. Local villagers have also followed up on a pangolin that was confiscated from a villager. When they asked the rangers they were told that the pangolin was freed but some villagers saw", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1aa8714-5efb-4d0e-a601-eb49b3e5ab91": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1aa8714-5efb-4d0e-a601-eb49b3e5ab91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ad8bf0aecaed2aaffeb377fb5b4a393497a739c2223a21da6bca8749fa4a4b3"}}, "hash": "9ad8bf0aecaed2aaffeb377fb5b4a393497a739c2223a21da6bca8749fa4a4b3", "text": "the animal in a local Chinese wildlife traders' house. Such observations and discrepancies serve to increase the mistrust with which communities view the establishment and management of National Parks. Ironside and Bunma 2004 35 5.3 Coordination between Government Departments Another major challenge is the lack of coordination between departments dealing with natural resource management. One example is the pilot project to title communal land in three areas in Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri. The departments involved are the Ministry of Environment (MoE), Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and Ministry of Land Management Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC). However, only the MLMUPC was actively coordinating with NGOs and the community to implement the project. To ensure success of the project and extension to other communities, it is imperative to have all three departments involved. Resources would need to be set aside for such inter- departmental coordination. 5.4 Land Alienation for Logging and Plantations As mentioned, the most serious problem that indigenous peoples face is land alienation. Large scale land alienation occurred during the last 2-3 years after the roads were built to Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri provinces, when newcomers moved in and land price increased. Alienation of land stemmed especially from the government planning development through land concessions. As a consequence of the land alienation, indigenous communities are deprived of their lands, threatening their very existence as peoples. Associated with indigenous land alienation and the expansion of cash cropping agriculture, deforestation is becoming a serious environmental problem. Many communities continue to be cheated by others - be they politicians or business people - to sell their land. More recently, communities from Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri have organised peaceful protest actions to draw the attention of the government to their plight. While such actions received consideration from local government officials, the central government still tend to use police action against the communities. Monitoring Land Alienation The agency responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Forestry Law and the Sub-Decree is the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (particularly its Department of Forestry and Wildlife). In this respect, there are concerns that the Ministry\u2019s overt pro-exploitation policies conflict directly with its responsibility to implement the community management goals of the 2003 Sub-Decree. Despite the passage of the new Forestry Law and a moratorium against logging announced in January 2002, the acute problem of forest mismanagement persists. For one thing, the government continues to grant timber concessions outside the revised legal framework and has also failed to terminate many non-performing concessionaire contracts. The few contracts which were in fact terminated in recent times appeared to involve companies which were either bankrupt or not aligned with the \u2018right\u2019 political groupings. Overall, illegal logging by companies backed by political clout persists, and provisions of the Forestry Law are flagrantly breached. While the Forestry Law requires concessionaires to produce Strategic Forest Management Plans and Environmental and Social Impact Assessments, the government has reportedly been willing to accept assessments of extremely low quality. In some instances, assessments had simply been copied from previous reports. In this regard, the World Bank itself has been severely criticised for releasing loans to the government in breach of its own forest-reform conditions. The Forestry Law itself contains inherent weaknesses \u2013 one unsatisfactory feature is the failure to distinguish between \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cplanted\u201d forests. Thus, logging companies can simply claim to be engaging in reforesting and disguise the reality, that is, the destruction of villagers\u2019 community forests, grazing land, commons and fallows, to be replaced by even-aged stands of species of fast-growing (but often alien) trees. The influence of vested interests over the forestry sector is also illustrated by the government\u2019s decision in 36 April 2003 to terminate the representation of an independent NGO monitor in the Forest Crimes Monitoring Office. This Office had been established to monitor illegal logging activities and comprised officials from the Department of Forestry and Wildlife and the Ministry of Environment, together with Global Witness - as an independent observer. Subsequently, Global Witness was fired following conflicts with the government over the documentation of several cases of connivance by government officials in illegal logging. Singapore Yearbook of International Law (SYBIL) 5.5 Large-scale Development Projects Another major challenge with respect to indigenous peoples and natural resource management is the implementation of large-scale development projects such as dams without obtaining the consent of affected communities. In some cases, the appeals and suggestions of indigenous peoples are disregarded. Problems of lack of consent and redress are compounded in projects that are trans-boundary, involving neighbouring countries.

The dams have resulted in deaths from floodings, erratic river levels, worsened water quality, increased health problems, a severe decline in fisheries and riverine biodiversity, and these effects continue to threaten the livelihoods and lives of the people who depend on the river. While these problems continue, they are likely to be exacerbated by more dams that have already been commenced or are being planned in Vietnam and Lao PDR, on the Sesan River, Srepok River, Sekong River and Mekong River. These dams are being planned or built without adequate assessment of past impacts, without rectification of the problems of existing dams, and without first conducting comprehensive future environmental and social impact assessments. International donor agencies and multi-lateral banks continue to support and validate their construction without funding the construction directly by supporting associated projects such as power line construction and funding feasibility studies. In this way, large international institutions such as the Swedish International Development Agency, the World Bank, the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation and the Vietnamese and Lao governments, along with funding from the Russian and Ukrainian governments, effectively undermine the lives of indigenous peoples in north-east Cambodia. In addition, it has been announced during the past year that the Cambodian and Vietnamese governments have signed agreements for the construction of two hydropower dam projects, which will be built on the Sesan and Srepok Rivers inside Cambodia. There are very strong local concerns that industrial power generation and the model of industrial development that it supports have profound and long-term negative impacts on the lives of indigenous people. All of these dams are being built despite the demands of the communities who live along these rivers. The demands of the villagers include the restoration of the natural flow (of the river); compensation for past harm; no more dams until agreement is made with the villagers; improvement of the notification system; benefit sharing and economic development; insurance if the dam breaks; and greater participation in environmental governance. In addition to dams affecting the northeast, a survey by the Cambodian Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy has proposed hydro-power dam projects in numerous areas throughout Cambodia. If constructed, these dams will affect indigenous people in at least eight provinces. 37 Graeme Brown, CPAC 5.6 Enhancing Capacity of Indigenous Communities In cases of indigenous land alienation, it is very clear that indigenous communities do not know that the Land Law grants them rights to collective property under the responsibility of their traditional authorities and their mechanisms for decision making. If they were aware of this they would not be so vulnerable to the threats of brokers. It is also clear that they do not know that the Land Law prohibits indigenous common property alienation, so a contract to sell indigenous land has no legal effect, because the subject matter of the contract is illegal. Indigenous peoples have expressed as a problem the loss of their culture, languages, customs, and traditional authorities. It seems that many groups of indigenous peoples are not aware of the legal statutes enforce protecting their rights. Further, they do not find institutional channels to actualise their demand for the enforcement of those rights. A handful of indigenous students at the local universities and colleges, and indigenous community leaders have therefore found it extremely important to get exposed to relevant laws, international instruments as well as learn from the experience of other indigenous communities outside of Cambodia. 5.7 Harnessing Indigenous Livelihood Strategies If poverty reduction is to be effective, indigenous peoples' customary use of natural resources in their territories needs to be harnessed in partnership with conservation strategies. The challenge is to use a combination of effective joint management strategies and recognition of the rights of communities over their resources. Access Rights to NTFPs There should also be recognition of local community rights to control the use of several NTFPs in National Parks. In the recent past, exploitation of NTFP in National Parks has been anarchic and destructive. Part of the reason for this has been the inability of local communities to control access to important resources, and, therefore, to implement their own form of sustainable management. The recent effort by the park and communities to control the destructive harvesting of malva nuts is a good example of the kinds of joint management approaches that can be successfully implemented. However the park needs to go further in granting local communities management rights, so that they have an incentive", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "276d75ea-59e4-4c84-8344-34bcdc075ed2": {"__data__": {"id_": "276d75ea-59e4-4c84-8344-34bcdc075ed2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37a9fd0095f4507e2ae6665d95f298b93dd0c3ca144dc17e9707efa8ea62ee58"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b3ec94e-08a3-4ab9-8ea4-9ec9019b54a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab60a3187f75609e72b4acf3ccffdf7f6f5bb36e175384da6c9f067bff8e9938"}}, "hash": "09064127657329cfbe6752b2f4228253d413684aa9bbf90c535c11bc53c0d6cd", "text": "to sustainable manage natural resources, knowing that they will be able to benefit from them in the future if they are manage them properly now. People wish to protect for their own future use, and more specifically, to protect from unsustainable exploitation and destruction by outside interests. Due to the historical records of communities collecting and trading these forest resources for considerable periods of time, several of these NTFPs could be considered to be the \u201ccultural inheritance\u201d of the Brao, Lun, Kavet and Kreung people. Ironside and Baird, 2003 38 5.8 Use of Criminal Laws and Police in Land Conflicts Although there are specific laws regulating the use of various natural resources, these laws are often not used when conflicts arise. Instead, the police are brought in and criminal laws exercised, which are often more expedient in dealing with indigenous peoples who are struggling for their rights to their land. Unjust Treatment of Indigenous Persons There are a considerable number of indigenous people in prison. Several prisoners stated that they had been tortured during the period of detention in police custody. The President of the Court and the prosecutor told us of the lack of lawyers in the province to defend the accused persons during the trial. Even though the law states that a defendant is entitled to legal representation. Indigenous minorities have faced trials without lawyers or translators. Prisoners complained that they did not have resources to pay for lawyers or the other fees that they were asked to pay. An indigenous prisoner told us that his wife had to sell all the family property (two buffalos and lands) to pay for all the costs related to his case. He has eight children, and now he has no property to support his family. Pathways to Justice, p103 5.9 National Implementation of International Instruments The presence of several UN agencies and international NGOs in Cambodia has provided the necessary financial and technical support to indigenous organizations and provided an avenue to share international legal instruments such as the United Nations Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have also adopted policies to recognize and respect indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, and have determined that their policies apply to indigenous peoples in Cambodia. However, the challenge to ensure that projects supported by such agencies and bodies to implement human rights standards are not met by mere lip service by local and national government officials is a major challenge. One drawback that is observed is the implementation of pilot projects that are money-driven and which have not seen long-term commitments or benefits. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) established an office in Cambodia to promote ILO Convention 169. It has been a major challenge to get government departments to support the activities of this office, even the promotion of the UN-declared International of the World Indigenous Peoples' Day on August 9 each year. The ILO office and the Department of Ethnic Minorities Development, which organized an event to celebrate the international day in 2005, were disappointed when several indigenous representatives traveling from several provinces to Phnom Penh were not allow by the local authority and stopped by police, a recent instance of a regularly observed tendency on behalf of some parts of the police to obstruct and hinder indigenous organizations and associations.. 39 References 1.

Indigenous Peoples of Malaysia 1.1 Indigenous Peoples of Sabah Based on the 2000 census, an estimated 39 indigenous groups make up about 60 percent of the estimated 2.6 million total population of Sabah. They speak more than 50 languages and 80 dialects, with the Dusunic, Murutic and Paitanic groups the largest among them. In 1970, the term \u2018bumiputera\u2019, literally meaning \u2018sons of the soil\u2019 was created primarily to facilitate the implementation of Malaysia\u2019s New Economic Policy (NEP)1. The special position and privileges as \u2018bumiputera\u2019 accorded to the Malays in Peninsular Malaysia were extended to all native groups in Sabah and Sarawak in the early 70\u2019s (when?) but the term is objectionable to many indigenous peoples of Sabah since they are non-Muslims and non-ethnic Malays. The Indigenous Peoples Network of Malaysia and other indigenous organizations now use the Malay term \"Orang Asal\" or \"indigenous/original people\" as a collective term to refer to themselves. This term is accepted and used by the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, but there is still debate among some government agencies. However, indigenous peoples in Sabah often interchange the term \"indigenous/orang asal\" and \"native/anak negeri\", and thereby accept the use of the latter in many legal documents. The Sabah Native Ordinance 1952 outlines who is a \u2018native\u2019. The definition of \u2018natives\u2019 is wide and includes, inter alia, any person whose parents, or at least one parent, is indigenous to Sabah and have (has) been living as a member of a native community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba6236bc-3dd2-401d-92be-fa2df2448430": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba6236bc-3dd2-401d-92be-fa2df2448430", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59a54ebfa685ed32133069b341ca8d3787adac4bb8d9c2fb9171cb52170075f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8a0e861-c0ff-4da8-a6f3-10a15cf4a90b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bef98a766db8a2bd5f9daa44a14b3f95b0ed9078dd0d8ffd550ea9360e3a9ad9"}}, "hash": "5c4671959d15661ea02bd75d129b88362a5768949750c78ee19a30cb0a57a30c", "text": "It also includes indigenous peoples of Sarawak, Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore and the Sulu group of islands in the Philippines Archipelago who have settled in Sabah before 1963 and have been members of a native 1 The NEP was introduced to strengthen unity through (1) reducing and ultimately eradicating poverty by increasing the level of income-expanding opportunities for employment and (2) restructuring society in order to correct the economic imbalance between the different ethnic groups. 4 community in Sabah for three to five years consecutively preceding the claim to be a native of Sabah. Basic Information about Sabah Covering an area of 73,619 square kilometers (73.7 million ha), Sabah is the second largest of the 13 states in the Federation of Malaysia. Sabah occupies the northern part of the island of Borneo and borders Sarawak in the west and Indonesia in the south. Together with Sarawak, Sabah makes up East Malaysia, which is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the South China Sea. The climate of Sabah is hot and humid throughout the year and is not affected much by severe storms and typhoons. The landscape is highly dissected and steep and about 60 percent of Sabah\u2019s area is mountainous. Most of the lowlands are confined to the coastal region. Both the coastal belt and mountainous slopes are heavily forested, and tropical rainforest of one type or another characterizes most of the state. Sabah has been called \u2018the land of biodiversity\u2019 in reference to the State\u2019s rich", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2843ee52-cdee-4576-91e2-a0b53882b789": {"__data__": {"id_": "2843ee52-cdee-4576-91e2-a0b53882b789", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f59d5f55ea93a8fbd0ae5352e035503449ccb998aa3a1ed700cad0eaa61abd43"}, "3": {"node_id": "b708028d-32a9-4fcd-9016-f90455d42c78", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c06cc70dfe15cc05154609577ecbbb0b9472fda9f7fac9383cec26ef43677036"}}, "hash": "82f08fa39204ec202b548bd6ee6fab923032212555786cdca1b434c86c602457", "text": "natural resource endowment contributing to one of the highest species-biodiversity in the world. Archaeologists estimate that Sabah was populated at least 30,000 years ago when the early inhabitants frequented the Madai limestone caves for shelter and food. Hunting and gathering were probably their main economic activities with little or no agriculture. Subsequent documentation of communities living in the coastal plains of Sabah indicates that they were largely self-reliant, producing food and other necessities for themselves. Forest and land were the main resources, which everyone had rights to use, cultivate or occupy. A communal way of life was practised and decision-making was more by consensus than enforced authority. Increasing piracy, invasions, slave-raiding and oppression from the Brunei and Sulu Sultans who considered themselves the owners of the land and the people forced communities to move inland [historical period? Estimated dates?]. As trade developed, combined with feudalism, people had to produce not just for subsistence and for barter, but also to pay poll taxes and custom dues that were imposed by the Sultans, Datus and their functionaries. Very often people responded to these oppressive acts by getting together and fighting back, though not always successfully. From the 17th until the early 20th century, slavery was a thriving trade while piracy was rife from the 18th century onwards. The commercial potentials of Sabah\u2019s natural resources have been a decisive factor in shaping the State\u2019s history. Until 1877 Sabah was part of the Brunei Empire, but that year the sultans of Brunei sold the northern part of Borneo (Sabah) to a British trading company. The British government granted the trading company a Royal Charter and the North Borneo Chartered Company was established. In 1888, control was consolidated when North Borneo became a British Protectorate. As any other company, the main objective of the Chartered Company was to secure a profit. The expanding market for tobacco and later rubber stimulated European interest in setting up plantations in Sabah and the Chartered Company realised that to achieve this, it was necessary to clarify legally the boundaries between the land that were used by the natives and those that were available for such plantations. Thus, as part of the aim to develop the agricultural production and to gain access to resources, a system of codification and land titling started under British rule. After the Japanese Occupation during World War II, Sabah became a British Crown Colony in 1946 and the exploitation and control of 5 Sabah\u2019s natural resources, especially timber and farmland, continued. In August 1963, Sabah became independent but joined the Federation of Malaysia in September 16, in the same year. 6 Table 1.

The ancestors of today\u2019s Orang Asli never lived in isolation nor were they removed from the political situation of the day. As early as the 5th Century A.D., for instance, the Orang Asli played a significant role in the Malay Peninsula\u2019s economic history as collectors and traders of primary products. Being the only ones who had the needed knowledge and skills to locate and extract these commodities, the Orang Asli were sought by traders from India, China and the Mon civilisations in Southern Thailand. Forest products such as resin, camphor, ivory, rattans and even gold were bartered for salt, cloth, beads and iron tools. Sea products \u2013 such as the rare black branching coral known to the Malays as akar bahar and the famed tripang or sea slug used as an ingredient in Chinese soups and medicinal preparations \u2013 were also traded by the coastal Orang Asli. Some of the Orang Asli groups also played very dominant roles in the administration and defence of earlier political systems in the Malay Peninsula. Thus when Parameswara with his following appeared in Malacca from Tumasek (as Singapore was called) and later established one of the first Malay kingdoms, there was already a small fishing village at the site, whose population included the Orang Laut. In fact, Hang Tuah, the most famous Laksamana in Malay folklore, was himself of Orang Laut background. For centuries to follow, the Orang Laut devotion to the Malay rulers of Malacca, aided via judicious marriages into the royal family itself, was a crucial factor in the kingdom's preservation and prosperity. Marriages between Malay rulers and Orang Asli brides were also not uncommon. Aspiring heirs in Negri Sembilan, for example, had to resort to claiming Orang Asli (matrilineal) ancestry in order to be eligible for hereditary positions. 8 Orang Asli Population, 1999 Sub-Group Population Negrito Kensiu Kintak Jahai Lanoh Mendriq Batek 254 150 1,244 173 167 1,519 3,507 Seno Semai Temiar Jah Hut Che Wong Mah Meri Semaq Beri 34,248 17,706 2,594 234 3,503 2,348 60,633 Aboriginal Malay Temuan Semelai Jakun Orang Kanaq Orang Kuala Orang Seletar 18,560 5,026 21,484 73 3,221 1,037 49,401 113,541 9 However, the rise of the Malay sultanates coincided with a trade in Orang Asli slaves that prompted many Orang Asli groups to retreat further inland and to avoid contact with outsiders. For the most part, from this time, the Orang Asli lived in remote communities, each within a specific geographical space (such as a river valley) and isolated from the others. They identified themselves by their specific ecological niche, which they called their customary or adat land, and developed a close affinity with it. Much of the basis of their culture and religion is derived from this close association with their particular environment. Their basic economic activities \u2013 hunting, gathering, foraging, swiddening and some trade \u2013 remained unchanged for a long time. Some Orang Asli still practise these activities with little modification. Colonial Impact/The Emergency For the most part, prior to the early 1900s, the Orang Asli were regarded as pagans and kafirs (unbelievers) and were called various names such as the much-despised sakai (slave or dependent) and orang liar (wild men). Except as excellent material for anthropological research or as ripe subjects for the zeal of missionaries, the Orang Asli were of no particular importance to the successive colonial rulers and were generally ignored administratively. One positive effect of British colonial rule on the Orang Asli was the abolition of slavery and debt-bondage. On the other hand, the British colonialists were also of the view that Orang Asli were defenceless creatures with limited intelligence, and consequently declared that the Orang Asli should remain in isolation from the rest of the Malayan population and be given protection. This was the onset of a long-term attitude of paternalism towards the Orang Asli.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3f1dfef-e594-497e-aba9-bb744690a007": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3f1dfef-e594-497e-aba9-bb744690a007", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37381975be0bf9858630766770a137c60f50209ca9653af521a5a45c41f49e03"}, "2": {"node_id": "dae5b7b1-f1e3-49af-ad96-fd886061e5b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e70199037a3dec1cc96acfd5818e76d5705d3a801285a8916367f3f9ec4d835a"}}, "hash": "c7b854495538220283177fa956419b85c08eacaae78d252717c01d887f13b5a2", "text": "In the period leading up to the Japanese Occupation (1942-1945), the British administrator's contact with the Orang Asli was largely confined to the creation of aboriginal reserves and preventing the forest dwellers from felling trees or hunting protected animals.

The dreaded resettlement camps were replaced by \u2018patterned settlements\u2019 (later to be called \u2018regroupment schemes\u2019) established close to, though not always within, their traditional homelands, and where a small shop and medical facilities were available within the watchful sight of the security forces. The strategy nevertheless proved successful and Orang Asli support for the insurgents eventually waned. When the Emergency was declared officially over in 1960 a period of much more active and direct involvement by the state in the affairs and lives of the Orang Asli begun. 11 Modernisation and Integration with the Mainstream In 1961, a year after the end of the Emergency, the Government resolved that it should \u2018adopt suitable measures designed for their [Orang Asli] protection and advancement with a view to their ultimate integration with the Malay section of the community.\u2019 This policy of integration into the Malay mainstream was to be achieved by promoting economic development projects among the Orang Asli, delivered mainly through the agency of the Department of Orang Asli Affairs (JHEOA). However, the onset of the Second Emergency (1968-1978) that saw the communist insurgents operating once again from the forest homelands of the Orang Asli, forcing the authorities to give priority, yet again, to security. As a result more Orang Asli settlements, especially along the forested spine of the peninsula, were removed from their traditional environment and relocated into large new regroupment schemes, not unlike the Felda schemes for landless settlers. Even after the communist insurgency formally ended in 1989, the policy of regroupment remained with the rationale that the perceived nomadism of the Orang Asli made it difficult and uneconomic for the government to bring development to them. Nevertheless, while the expressed goals of the government remain largely unchanged \u2013 viz. to improve the wellbeing and to integrate the Orang Asli with the national society \u2013 there were significant changes in the way these were to be achieved. Changes included the introduction of privatisation as a tool for the development of Orang Asli areas, their participation in tourism, and the development of an entrepreneurial class of Orang Asli youth. The strategy also involved efforts at introducing a value system based on Islam for the integration of the Orang Asli with the wider society in general and the Malays in particular. The rapid pace of modernisation in and around their traditional territories has affected the way of life of many Orang Asli communities. Developments in social services have also improved their condition, especially in regards to access to health and educational facilities. Nevertheless, as a community, the Orang Asli still lag far behind other Malaysians in all indicators of wellbeing. This is likely to change for the better as greater self-awareness and self-confidence have resulted in more Orang Asli becoming increasingly vocal and pro-active in seeking their rightful dues and in improving their situation. Despite the vast changes occurring around them, the Orang Asli remain a distinct and proud community. 12 2. Indigenous Natural Resource Management System in Sabah Sabah's natural resources comprising various landform, soils, climate and vegetation provide a diverse agro-ecosystem for the many indigenous communities. The majority of indigenous communities are subsistence farmers practising diversified agriculture, including cultivation of wet and hill rice, vegetables and fruit trees. Rural indigenous farmers often pursue a wide range of livelihood strategies where parts of the production system serve as subsistence and others as income generation. Rotational agriculture (or swiddening) however is becoming increasingly rare while permanent agriculture practices (both annual and perennial crops) as well as off-farm activities are becoming economically more important. Apart from farming, many of the land- based indigenous communities rely on the diverse forest resources for their food, medicine, fuel, building materials and other household needs. Along the coastline and river mouths, there are many fishing communities who derive their cash incomes both from agriculture as well as fish sold at the market. 2.1 Concepts and Principles of Indigenous Natural Resource Management Natural resources to indigenous peoples in Sabah include land, forest, agricultural areas, and rivers and coastal areas, in which land is central and often understood to encompass all these natural resources collectively.

Natural resources are significant not only as a means of production but also as part of indigenous peoples' spiritual and cultural traditions, giving them their identity as peoples. Indigenous knowledge, innovations and practices on natural resource management is a little understood yet highly complex system, one that is closely interlinked with other indigenous systems. It incorporates a keen awareness of the environment, an appreciation for conservation and continuity, encourages sustainable innovation, and places the well being of the community as the focus of all activities. 2.2 Framework and Institution of Indigenous Natural Resource Management The goals of indigenous natural resource management are economic self-sufficiency and environmental sustainability. The indigenous natural resource management system is closely linked with other indigenous systems such as social, cultural, spiritual, economic, governance, juridical, health, technological and learning systems. Management of natural resources through the adat has been established for generations and unwritten laws are transmitted by parents and elders in the community. Adat management of resources is also an integral part of community institutional control over lands and resources. Traditionally the Council of Elders governs the management of natural resources through customary laws and socialization of the whole community. The Council of Elders is composed of the village head, elders and the bobohizan (priests/priestesses). Natural resource management involves both physical and spiritual realms and its practices are manifested by every indigenous person in their daily activities such that it has become a way of life for the community. The balance between the spiritual and physical realms will determine the 13 condition of the universe and the immediate environment of communities, including the circumstances and conditions of the people. In spiritual terms, the \"hot\" (ahasu) condition symbolizes tragedy resulting in sickness, death or bad luck. It is believed that this condition comes about when members of the community go against set rules \u2013 be they socio-cultural, spiritual or those that relate to the environment. When the condition is ahasu, traditional communities believe that only the bobohizan can restore the balance through ceremonies. For the physical realm, the village head and elders instruct and enforce the adat to ensure that the whole community not only manages resources in a responsible manner but also passes on the knowledge to the next generation. In the past, the ketua kampong and elders were selected based on their wisdom and expertise. They make decisions on a consensus basis, taking the interest of the community as whole into consideration. A big part of their role was to manage the natural resources of the community to ensure sustainability and fairness. The institution of the Council of Elders has now disappeared, having been replaced by the JKKK or Village Development and Security Committee. Members of this committee used to be elected by the community but in recent years, their appointment has been based on allegiance to the political party in power. Although the Council of Elders no longer exists in most indigenous communities, the bobohizan and knowledgeable elders are still called upon to perform the ceremonies. Today, the government recognizes only the village head (ketua kampong) as the traditional authority, in charge of the administration of the customary juridical system. However, as s/he is also in the employ of the government, his (most of the village heads are men, with a just a handful of women ketua kampong) power is gradually being taken away. Their role as instructors and enforcers of the adat has diminished, and many are relegated to routine settling of family disputes and some inter-village conflicts. The management of natural resources is very often neglected. PACOS Trust, a leading indigenous organisation, and many indigenous communities in Sabah have to come to accept the setting up of committees to manage natural resources as an approach in community organizing. Resources Management Committees are formed through community meetings, often having women, youth and elders as members, and are functioning well with various activities. However, there is also a growing realization and reflection on the importance of strengthening traditional institutions and to ensure that indigenous natural resource management systems once again become vibrant and relevant systems and where customary laws and the adat are put in place to guide community members in education (knowledge transmission) and monitoring within indigenous territories. 14 2.3 Indigenous Natural Resource Management Practices The indigenous concept and principles on the use and ownership of natural resource management are realized though a variety of practices that embody spiritual beliefs and respect for natural resources. Box 1 illustrates some examples of these practices that are still used today.

Land ownership can be confirmed by a headman and is identified by the presence of certain signs such as fruit trees or the burial grounds of ancestors. Boundaries are marked by certain trees, a large rock/megalith, and the rolok bush or by reference to rivers or streams. To ensure that forest resources are not taken without permission of the owner, certain signs \u2013 understood by most indigenous communities \u2013 are placed strategically around the lands. To ensure that forests are healthy and productive, unnecessary cleaning and cutting of trees is prohibited. The opening of farmland is usually on a small scale and restricted to areas of secondary forest growth. When fertility of the land for hill paddy cultivation is reduced, a fallow period is observed to give the land a rest and to restore its fertility. Wildlife \u2013 Seeds, Plants (including medicinal plants) and Animals To ensure that wildlife continues to exist, selective hunting is practiced whereby only matured animals and game are hunted. In the same way, knowledge on seed selection and storage, maintained in particular by women, are important management strategies at the household and community level. A practice of leaving the last fruits to ensure continuity of plant varieties is still maintained by many communities. Indigenous peoples believe that medicinal plants have spirits and that respect is necessary before taking any plants. The concept of \"use and protect\" ensures plants and animals with medicinal properties are not over-harvested and practices such as taking only what is needed still prevail among indigenous communities. River, Water and Aquatic Life When the number of fish is on the decline in rivers and inland waters, a communal understanding can be proclaimed through the practice of managal, the marking of a stretch of river as \"no fishing\" zone for a certain period of time (six months to a year). The proclamation is performed through a ceremony called the monogit, where the community slaughters a pig and eat it together to mark the period of abstinence. What is the ceremony called? It is unclear if it is managel or monogit (Managal is the practice, monogit is the religious ceremony Natural Resource Management and Indigenous Spirituality Indigenous concepts of resources management are based on the worldview that all matters have a spirit (moinat) and therefore ought to be treated with respect. As such, the arbitrary taking of life is prohibited \u2013 whether plants, animals, birds, and arbitrary destruction of the environment through logging, clearing of land and other activities that will disrupt harmony and cause conflict between the spiritual and physical realm is likewise banned. Indigenous spirituality is thus the expression of respect for spiritual being, social relations and the environment in which they manifest. 15 2.4 Inter-Generational Transfer of Knowledge The village head, or ketua kampong, presides over community meetings and hearings and plays a major role in ensuring that the traditional land boundaries, and the exclusive ownership of certain natural resources according to customary laws, are adhered to. The maintenance and transfer of knowledge is a responsibility of every individual in the community, although parents and elders play a particularly strong role. Such knowledge is learned orally through constant references/repetitions, by encouraging children to observe and to put them into practice in their daily life. Herbalists, carpenters and priests/priestesses acquire and pass their knowledge through apprenticeship. They learn not only their trade but also study the natural resources important to their work, and the traditional knowledge concerning the management of those resources. Communities are aware that the traditional knowledge on natural resource management is eroding gradually due to several political, economic and socio-cultural factors that are impacting on the lives of indigenous communities. This includes consumerism, cultural borrowing and exposure to other influences brought on by the arrival of roads, western education models, cash economy and mass media. All these have changed indigenous peoples' perceptions on natural resource management. The separation of the younger generation from their immediate environment and the compartmentalized way of thinking also means that they are no longer accustomed to the holistic approach inherent in the indigenous concept of natural resource management. This leads to a lack of reflection on the concepts and principles of community- based resource management. 16 3. Legal and Policy Framework on Natural Resource Management This Chapter reviews and analyzes current laws and policies regarding natural resource management, land tenure and resource access, with a view to identifying gaps with respect to the recognition of indigenous peoples' rights. 3.1 State and Federal Constitution The indigenous peoples, or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0163d701-26ef-4db5-8cbb-282b293ab053": {"__data__": {"id_": "0163d701-26ef-4db5-8cbb-282b293ab053", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b27b8bd5c8485148237a907cbd70eedf0b019d0feda374387ce1d91877437793"}}, "hash": "b27b8bd5c8485148237a907cbd70eedf0b019d0feda374387ce1d91877437793", "text": "\"natives\", of Sabah are accorded special rights and privileges under Article 153 of the Federal Constitution. Further, Article 161A(5) provides that State law in Sabah and Sarawak may provide for the reservation of land for natives or for giving preferential treatment in regards to the appropriation of land by the State. The Federal Constitution specifies the division of powers between the state and federal governments. The Constitution\u2019s Ninth Schedule divides the various responsibilities, privileges, and jurisdictions into three lists: List 1, the Federal List; List 2, the State List; and List 3, the Concurrent List. Article 73(b) of the Federal Constitution also empower the States of Sabah and Sarawak to enact their own laws though their State Legislative Assemblies. 3.2 Natural Resource Management Laws in Sabah In Sabah, there is no single law or policy that governs natural resource management. Resources are compartmentalized (e.g. according to land, fisheries, forests, parks, wildlife, water, plantations and biodiversity). Any given law and its accompanying \u2018rules\u2019 govern the management of a particular resource under a specific department created to administer the law. Many laws on natural resource management also overlap in their jurisdiction and this requires inter-departmental and inter-ministerial coordination. 3.2.1 Land Ordinance, 1930 A whole section of the Land Ordinance is dedicated to Native Lands (Part IV, Section 64 to 86), with some other relevant sections also found in the main body of the law. The law also covers various sections on sub-surface and surface resources, as well as seas and coastal areas. Section 15 on Native Customary Rights (NCR) is also provided in the Land Ordinance. NCR to land includes: \u2022 Land possessed by customary tenure; \u2022 Land planted with 20 or more fruit trees per acre; \u2022 Fruit trees, sago, rattan and other plants of economic value that are planted, upkept and regularly enjoyed as personal property; \u2022 Grazing land stocked with cattle or horses; \u2022 Land that has been cultivated or built on within 3 years; 17 \u2022 Burial grounds and shrines; and \u2022 Rights of way for people and animals. Customary tenure is defined as the lawful possession of land by natives by occupation or cultivation continuously for three or more consecutive years or by title deed. However in practice land titles are seen to be an indefeasible right of ownership. All land is considered to be state- owned and claims to non-state ownership have to be registered and approved by the state. Section 15 was an attempt to incorporate indigenous peoples' customary law on land ownership into the land law. However, due to the lack understanding of indigenous peoples' concept of land and natural resource management and the misrepresentation of customary law, this has resulted in inconsistencies and gaps within the process of land delineation. Section 15 clearly outlines the criteria for NCR, but practical experiences in the titling of indigenous peoples' land have shown that many problems remain which hinder access to these rights, one key one being the failure to take into consideration indigenous natural resource management realities such as fallow period in rotational agriculture cycle (non-continuous cultivation). A further serious concern is the use of Section 28 to supersede Section 15 of the Ordinance because it allows the Governor to alienate land for \"public purpose\". What \"public purpose\" may be is not well defined. Indigenous peoples have asked for Section 28 to be repealed because in many instances in the 1980\u2019s it was been used to alienate NCR land to government statutory bodies without compensation, and at the privatization of such lands in the 1990's ownership did not revert to the rightful owner but was made the private property of companies and individuals. This was the case for the Sabah Forest Industries and the Sabah Land Development Board. Non-implementation of existing safeguards is a further concern. Section 13 of the Ordinance requires the posting of a notice and validation in the area concerned in any application for land ownership. In reality this has not happened, with the posting of notices only in the district offices of the Lands and Survey Department, where indigenous people did not regularly visit or visit at all. Section 17 states \"except with the written permission of the Minister all dealings in land between non-natives on the one hand and natives on the other hand are hereby expressly forbidden and no such dealings shall be valid or shall be recognised in any court of law....\" However, this subsection has often been circumvented and many indigenous peoples have lost their traditional land in deals that did not benefit the indigenous owner.

Section 23 and 24 give the right to sub-surface and surface resources such as minerals, timber or other forest produce or any earth, gravel, stones, coral, shell, guano, sand, loam or clay, or any bricks, lime, cement or other commodities manufactured from these materials to the state. Most indigenous people have opted for individual native titles over their land, mainly because this is the most strongly promoted by the government. However, the Land Ordinance provides for other forms of title, including a communal title or native reserve, and simply registering land with NCR. Section 76 provides for the (Chief) Minister Communal Titles \"in cases where a claim to customary tenure of land has been established or a claim to native customary rights has 18 been dealt with by a grant of land and such land is held for the common use and benefit of natives and is not assigned to any individual as his private property\". The Director of Lands and Survey will hold the title in trust for the community concerned, without power of sale. Section 78 provides for the gazetting of Natives Reserves by the Governor if he thinks it necessary to protect the present and future interests and well-being of the natives of Sabah or any community. The Native Reserve would be held in trust by any person appointed by the Governor, and in most cases these are the district officer and the village head. 3.2.2 Land Acquisition Ordinance As mentioned, any land may be subjected to compulsory acquisition by the State deemed for \"public purpose\". Under Section 2(h) a broad definition of \"public purpose\" is provided, including resettlement, conservation and exploitation of natural resources. The Ordinance does provide explicitly for the determination of claims to compensation, although in many cases indigenous communities have lost Native Customary Rights land through such acquisition without compensation. This is because Section 9 allows only 3 months for the owner to register their interest and serve a notice to the authorized officer after which claims to compensation are considered invalid. 3.2.3 Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Enactment 2003 Under Part V of the Enactment on Riverine Fishing and Fisheries, Sections 35, 36 and 37 relate to Community Fisheries Management Zones. Section 35 allows for the declaration and recognition of indigenous system of resource management, while Section 36 and 37 create a new protocol by providing for the creation of a committee to administer such zones, and by introducing punishment related to the Community Fisheries Zone. As mentioned earlier, although the law itself is very progressive in recognizing community system of managing riverine resources (by creating committees under Section 36 and 37), it has in a sense contributed to the weakening of the traditional authority for the Tagal system (see also 4.1.3). Even though the state Fisheries Department has done an admirable job in promoting Tagal, by NOT specifying the need for equal partnership and equal decision-making by the community in the all developments in inland fisheries, the success of the traditional Tagal system was in a sense taken over by the Department. 3.2.4 Forest Enactment, 1968 and Forest Rules, 1969 There is no provision in the Forest Enactment 1968 for the recognition of indigenous land rights. However, the enactment allows indigenous peoples to use forest resources for livelihood, including use for the benefit of the individual and the community and their traditional way of life (Section 41). Prior to the declaration of an area as a Forest Reserve, Section 8 and 9 require an enquiry to ensure that \"local inhabitants\" are made aware of the intention and to settle any claims. These two provisions represent the two biggest areas of contention for communities, 19 particularly regarding the process followed in the \u2019enquiries\u2019 and settlement of claims. Such enquiries and subsequent settlements were rarely done in accordance with the requirements. Several communities claim that their objections were never recorded and in fact they suffered repression as a consequence to their objections. Today, the area gazetted as forest reserves (49 percent of the total land area of Sabah) is already established and there is no provision within the Enactment for appeals or settlement of claims. 3.2.5 Parks Enactment, 1984 The objectives and functions of the (Department of) Sabah Parks, among others, are to preserve significant geographical, biological or historical features for the benefit, education and enjoyment of present and future generations and to provide accommodation and amenities without disturbing the environment of the Parks.

However, Section 20 of the Parks (Amendment) Enactment 2002 empowers the Parks Board of Trustees to also carry out bio-prospecting and tree plantations as well as developing commercial and industrial enterprises. The Law, however, does not provide for the participation of indigenous peoples in collaborative management of the Parks. 3.2.6 Conservation of the Environment Enactment 1996 and the Environment Protection Enactment 2002 The Conservation of the Environment Enactment was enacted in 1996 and came into force on 1st August 1998 coinciding with the establishment of the Department of Environmental Protection. The Enactment has been amended twice to strengthen certain provisions, in particular providing for heavier penalties for causing serious environmental degradation, mainly directed at large companies opening up tracts of land for plantations. However the Department of Environmental Protection lacks staff and resources and has not had any significant impact in realizing its mandate. The Department was the main body responsible to drawing up the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000. The Environment Protection Enactment enacted in 2002 to complement the Conservation of the Environment Enactment is still not in force. The Conservation of Environment the Enactment also has no provision for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and in fact, in several sections, restrictions are imposed on the use of land (Section 28) and activities affecting vegetation (Section 33). 3.2.7 Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 and the Wildlife Regulation 1998 The Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 recognises community hunting areas (Section 32) and honorary wildlife wardens (Section 7) from the community. The training of these wardens and the procedures to set aside community hunting areas that were developed by the Wildlife 20 Department and DANCED strongly emphasize indigenous knowledge on wildlife management and conservation. As in the all the other Ordinances and Enactments to reserve land for specific purposes, the Wildlife Conservation Enactment under Section 9 outlines the necessity for a notice to explain the purpose and call for settlement of claims. Section 9(2)(c) in particular requires explanation of \"native or traditional rights that will continue to be exercisable after the coming into effect of the declaration of the proposed sanctuary\". Section 9(2)(d) also requires a summary of representations made by communities likely to be affected. The main weakness of these provisions is the relatively short period of 90 days to be published in the government Gazette and posted in the office of the Lands and Survey Department located in town centres. No specific provision exists with respect to indigenous knowledge under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 . Many of the plant species that are used in traditional medicines are considered protected species and would require a license to collect, a requirement for indigenous communities as well as others. It is not clear whether this restriction has affected the indigenous health practices of communities. The Wildlife Conservation Enactment under Section 68 provides for the right of traditional owners of caves to collect edible bird's nest and complements the Birds Nest Ordinance 1914. 3.2.8 Water Resources Enactment, 1998 The Enactment recognises private water rights, which includes the water rights of indigenous peoples. It takes into consideration the economic and social impact on the owner or occupier of the land when making a water resources management decision, implying the necessity to examine land ownership and occupation rights of indigenous peoples. A requirement for consultation also means that the government is obliged to involve indigenous peoples in the management of catchment areas and water bodies. The process for, and right to, appeal are also stipulated in the law. (Section 16 on private rights to water states that the owner or occupier of land or premises may, free of charge and without requiring a license under this Enactment, exercise a private right to take, use and control, sufficient for household and subsistence agricultural purposes.) Although the Enactment appears progressive with respect to management of water resources, there are gaps with respect to setting aside water protection areas. In Section 36, interest to protect areas precedes the rights of indigenous peoples to land and does not recognize the fact that indigenous peoples may have been traditionally protecting the area adequately. An example is a case in Bundu, where communities have managed to stop large-scale loggers from entering their watershed area upstream. The area remained pristine but the declaration of the area as a water protection area did not stop logging companies from attempting to enter and devastate the entire area, creating havoc to peoples' lives in the process. 21 3.2.9 Sabah Forestry Development Authority (SAFODA) Enactment, 1981 There are a number of state agencies created in Sabah, especially during the economic boom of the 1980's, concerned", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "760aaaba-ef27-44cf-96d3-601de68e7383": {"__data__": {"id_": "760aaaba-ef27-44cf-96d3-601de68e7383", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c7ddce2879bc49fb986bf240c10b3c96866ab7331def8095677329060c5852e"}, "3": {"node_id": "078548f6-160e-42e1-b30a-5546733955ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "588b71fcf822880239db5c6c2747a956156616131b94979acc7fedbcb0842da2"}}, "hash": "4599666ccffd877b80f6a2425bf1dc2d03fbaa0b460168736ad2e4ebc6c1643c", "text": "with use of natural resources. Many of the lands alienated to these state agencies were indigenous peoples' lands claimed under native customary rights. They were acquired under Section 28 of the Land Ordinance 1930 or under the Compulsory Land Acquisition Act, with little or no compensation. These agencies include Sabah Forest Industries (SFI) and the Sabah Land Development Board (SLDB). In the 1990\u2019s these state agencies were privatized whereupon the alienated lands became private property. Of the many state agencies created in the 1980\u2019s only the Rural Development Corporation (KPD), the Sabah Rubber Industry Board and the Sabah Forestry Development Authority (SAFODA) remain as full government agencies. Section 39(1) of the SAFODA Enactment provides for compulsory acquisition of land. Although there are also provisions for appeals, the lack of mechanisms for notifying the owners on the ground effectively prevented the indigenous peoples affected to record and settle land disputes in an organised manner. An anomalous section, Section 47, SAFODA is deemed a Native entity for the purpose of any law relating to land. 3.2.10 Biodiversity Enactment, 2000 Although the draft Sabah Biodiversity Enactment did not undergo much public scrutiny prior to its adoption in 2000, sustained efforts by indigenous organizations to engage the government and to raise issues on recognition of rights to lands and resources, traditional knowledge and benefit- sharing has resulted in a number of progressive sections within the law. The law contains eight important sections that are relevant to indigenous peoples. Section 9(1)(j) of the Enactment provides for a system to ensure that the indigenous peoples and other local communities are, at all times and in perpetuity, the legitimate creators, users and custodians of traditional knowledge, and collectively benefit from the use of such knowledge. It also recognizes rights to biological resources in land claimed under NCR [Section 16(b)], and has provisions to ensure that any activities related to the collection of biological resources do not negatively impact the livelihood, quality of life and the way of life of indigenous peoples [Section 20(3) and Section 25(1)(b)]. The Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000 (SBE2000) however cannot be implemented until the Rules that accompany the Enactment are formulated and adopted. In 2004, indigenous organizations again went through a series of consultations with communities, NGOs and the government to produce the draft Rules related to sections relevant to indigenous peoples. The lack of any real movement towards adopting the Rules by the government indicates either low priority on these matters or the reluctance to impose restrictions on the state's \"green gold\". The SBE2000 signifies a potential coordinating body for natural resource management in the state and recognizing this, indigenous peoples have asked that they be part of the decision-making body i.e. the Sabah Biodiversity Council. 22 3.2.11 Other Laws There are several other relevant laws on natural resource management but they are less applied. These include the Birds Nest Ordinance 1914; Cattle, Grazing and Pounds Ordinance, 1952; Country Land Utilisation Ordinance, 1962; Drainage and Irrigation Ordinance, 1956; Fauna Conservation Ordinance, 1963; Town and Country Planning Ordinance, 1950; Water Supply Ordinance, 1961; and the Cultural Heritage (Conservation) Enactment, 1997. Apart from these, a number of Federal natural resource management laws that are applicable to Sabah and Sarawak include the Environmental Quality Act, 1974; Continental Shelf Act 1966; Fisheries Act 1985; Pesticides Act 1974 and the Petroleum Development Act 1974. 3.3 Policies on Natural Resource Management 3.3.1 Sabah Forest Policy 1954 The State Forest Policy 1954 underscores the Sabah Government\u2019s commitment towards natural forest management, conservation and reforestation. It strongly emphasizes the need for sustainable forest management, forest legislation, use of non-wood forest products, conservation of biodiversity, community forestry, recreation and tourism. Under the policy, communities may cultivate within forest reserves, move inside the forest freely and collect any forest produce. They are allowed to reside within the limits of forest reserves and are encouraged to participate in forest management through a joint forest management approach. The latest action taken by the Sabah Forestry Department to legally recognize cultivation within forest reserves is by approving Occupation Permits. Under the Sustainable Forest Management System, areas may be set aside for community forest areas.

The Strategy proposes a variety of actions covering land-use, land revenue, multiple use management, water catchments areas, community 23 forests, timber production, damaged forests, illegal logging, plantation forestry, biodiversity, mining, ecotourism, land applications, Environmental Impact Assessments, coastal development and others. For example, the Strategy calls for the preparation of a series of maps to assist in environmentally-friendly land-use planning. \"Environmentally sensitive\" areas also need to be identified and reserved. Implementation of these strategies supports conservation efforts covering the entire country both at State and National levels. 3.3.3 National Policies Federal policies that are also relevant include the National Development Policy, the 5-yearly Malaysia Plans, National Agriculture Policy, National Environment Policy, National Forest Policy, National Mining Policy, Soil Conservation Action Plan and the National Biodiversity Conservation Policy. 24 4. The interface between Indigenous and Statutory Systems and Laws on Natural Resource Management This Chapter is devoted to assessing the interface between indigenous and State systems and laws on natural resources management with a view to identifying gaps and challenges for further action. It will look at current efforts to combine indigenous systems with other systems on natural resource management to illustrate the need to further develop such initiatives; as well as examining and illustrating the current and potential roles of government, NGOs, community organisations and donors in improving natural resource management in Malaysia. Recognizing the need for indigenous peoples' involvement in natural resource management, Section 4.2 will highlight mechanisms and issues for effective participation. 4.1 Indigenous Peoples and the State Legal and Policy Framework 4.1.1 Ownership Rights Framework The key to access and control of resources is recognition of land rights. Existing laws on natural resource management do have some provisions for the recognition of native customary rights to land, and for settlement of claims arising from the need to gain consent of first or existing settlers. As illustrated in the Sabah Land Ordinance however, the interpretation of rightful occupation does not coincide with indigenous peoples' concepts and customary law on land ownership. The recognition of collective rights for indigenous peoples would mean the preservation of collective identity. Collective rights include access to, and control over, lands and resources, and also participation in, and control over, decision-making. This has led to the dispossession of traditional lands, the main source of material and spiritual well-being of indigenous communities. 4.1.2 Use Rights Framework Access to resources in many cases may be granted but this right is not consistent between the different laws, and is further complicated by gaps in the existing laws. Communities candidly refer to their continued use of resources as the \"close one eye\" policy, indicating the fact that it is not an official policy of the government. The Sabah Parks is developing a policy to create \"Traditional Use Zones\" within the Crocker Range Park, but this policy would be invalid without legal reform to allow it to be official. Continued use of resources in an unofficial manner leaves communities vulnerable to strict enforcement of existing laws, and such use must be made legally defensible. Explicit legal and policy attempts to do so, such as the policy to set aside \u201cCommunity Forest Areas\u201d under the Sustainable Forest Management System, are rendered useless as they are not implemented Forest Management Unit holders. 4.1.3 Incorporation vs Recognition of Customary Law 25 Recognition of indigenous resource management to date has been characterized by attempts to incorporate an aspect of the traditional management system into state/national laws. For example the customary tagal system of resource management was incorporated into the Sabah Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Enactment 2003. However, such a strategy may not necessarily capture indigenous concepts adequately, a situation illustrated by the incomplete incorporation of indigenous land ownership into the definition of native customary rights to land in the Sabah Land Ordinance. There is no requirement to recognize of customary law per se. Part of this unwillingness to recognize customary law stems from the fact that customary law in general, and on natural resource management in particular, is not well-understood or undocumented, and there is often fear of recognizing it from the side of governments. Past efforts of the government to recognize customary law has thus involved some form of codification to lessen this fear of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0be952eb-5429-4167-8016-e7a4b29d562c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0be952eb-5429-4167-8016-e7a4b29d562c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a25ced675cb9d7fe43c47fd4254c3f81215c50130b4c8d291f9cfe6b054bf7eb"}}, "hash": "a25ced675cb9d7fe43c47fd4254c3f81215c50130b4c8d291f9cfe6b054bf7eb", "text": "the unknown, a process which is inappropriate and rejected by communities as it ignores the diverse nature of customary laws of communities. The other weakness is the tendency to form committees to manage resources, taking away the control that was traditionally held by the community. Although such committees may in fact allow more participation, particularly from women and youth, it nevertheless means that the already-weakened traditional structure is increasingly sidelined. In the long run, it will further dis-empower indigenous communities in their aspiration for self-determination and a pluralistic society. 4.1.4 Consultation vs Consent Provisions and procedures for obtaining consent are implicitly or explicitly contained in most laws relating to lands to be set aside for native titles and protected areas, or the rights to access and use resources found therein. It is assumed that in Sabah where the rural areas are traditionally occupied by indigenous peoples, the spirit of these laws is to give priority to indigenous peoples' claim to lands and resources. Settlement of claims is also expected prior to gazetting of lands, and the granting of a title or permit. But apart from the fact mentioned earlier about the non-compliance with these provisions to provide adequate notice, the gap in the law also lies in the requirement for consultation rather than consent. The State assumes control and authority on how lands and resources are managed, and its authority pre-empts indigenous authority. Consent from indigenous communities is secondary to the government plans for land use \u2013 they are consulted about the use of their lands but do not necessarily have to give consent. 4.1.5 Conflicting Provisions Section 28 of the Land Ordinance 1930 continues to represent the most significant reason for indigenous peoples' dispossession of land in Sabah. This section is used widely to set aside land for \"public purpose\", wherein public purpose is interpreted as activities that are in line with the government's economic interest. This includes large-scale oil palm and tree plantations. Within the Land Ordinance itself, provisions for the recognition of native customary rights land under Section 15 is considered secondary to the legal right to gazette provided for in Section 28. 26 Land titles, which are considered as the strongest proof of rights to land, can also be subjected to acquisition for public good through the Land Acquisition Ordinance. 4.1.6 Conflict in Development Paradigms Differing concepts about the fundamental purpose and meaning of development lie at the heart of conflicts over land and natural resource management use. As far as the State is concerned, the \u2018use\u2019 of natural resources is mainly for exploitation to finance infrastructure development and other expenditures of the state. There is no regard for indigenous peoples' own concepts of development, which are often considered unproductive, and therefore indigenous peoples' customary use of natural resources is not encouraged or developed. Policies on large-scale development through exploitation of natural resource management have resulted in either social exclusion or discrimination of indigenous peoples, or loss of cultures and way of life. The majority of indigenous peoples in Sabah still live in rural areas, but increasingly migrating \u2013 either temporarily or permanently \u2013 to urban areas as livelihood deteriorates due to natural resources exploitation and insecure land tenure. Indigenous peoples are increasingly joining, or are forced to accept, mainstream development and commercialization. This poses a challenge to natural resource management especially in and around sensitive areas. The gazetting or declaration of parks and other protected areas under the current laws is also an important factor leading to unresolved conflicts between the State and indigenous communities, due to loss of access to or restricted use of resources within these areas. 4.1.7 Recognition of Indigenous Natural Resource Management System The underlying conflict between concepts on the appropriate use of resources by the State and indigenous peoples undermine recognition of indigenous natural resource management. The State views resources in a compartmentalized manner and separates the management of resources rather than conceptualizing resources management in a holistic way. The ecosystem approach is much closer to the concept of indigenous communities, employing traditional knowledge systems in the management of resources. Traditional knowledge about the management of resources such as seeds, medicines and other biological resources is recognized in the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000 but implementation is not possible as there are still no rules to accompany the Enactment. In the meantime, a Community Protocol on research and access to resources has been implemented by communities. The fact remains that the indigenous concept of using and at the same time protecting the environment is not well accepted by the government.

At the same time, inputs such as chemical fertilisers and pesticides continue to form the bulk of government agricultural subsidies. 27 4.1.8 Repressing the Nurturers Enforcement of existing natural resource management laws is also a challenge for many departments because of limited human and financial resources. In the past, particularly when dealing with conflicting claims by indigenous peoples over resources, the police and army personnel were used in suppressing communities attempting to protect their rights to resources. Such direct and violent suppression often happens when lands and resources has been given to private corporations as logging concessions, plantations, dams and mining. The positive provisions within natural resource management laws described above are seldom used and instead communities who are often the protector and nurturers of natural resources are the ones arrested and charged for a criminal offence under the penal code. 4.2 Harnessing Indigenous Natural Resource Management One tool to assist in management of resources through the indigenous NRM system is zoning according to traditional use, with the involvement of communities as the mapping and other related activities. Community boundary mapping and resource mapping can be established using modern instruments such as GPS, and employing up-to-date satellite images for developing GIS. Zoning of areas can be crucial in implementing resource management that has been traditionally practiced but has not been recorded or done in a systematic way. Such zoning and mapping must be done locally with in-depth discussions involving those knowledgeable about the community area. Customary laws may not be adequate to meet new challenges and issues with regards to access and control of resources. When communities in Sabah realized that there was no comprehensive adat to regulate access and control over community resources, in particular by researchers and bio-pirates, they developed a community protocol for this purpose. Traditionally, indigenous communities monitor and assess their own resources on the level of responsibility and needs of the community. Since most communities do not own instruments such as early-warning systems, they usually rely on their observation and traditional knowledge to monitor and assess the condition of community resources. Hence the development of a community protocol was to equip communities with tools generally available to the government and the encroachers. 4.3 Engaging Institutions Cooperation between Donors, Government, NGOs and Community Organisations While it is extremely important to engage all players in the management of natural resources, indigenous communities must be accorded recognition as \"rights-holders\" over indigenous territories. Whereever possible, when indigenous peoples' organisations have sufficient organizational capacity to bring together various institutions, they should be encouraged to lead in such multi-sector cooperation. The role of each institution should be clearly outlines and 28 specified. This section examines engagements and cooperation between various bodies with indigenous communities. From the experiences in a number of such engagements in Sabah, some of the lessons learned are: \u2022 Community consultations must not be misused or misinterpreted; \u2022 It is necessary to work to ensure inter-departmental coordination; \u2022 It is important to ensure that in bilateral aid, the donor adheres to their policy on indigenous peoples that is based on accepted international human rights standards, and to apply this policy to help raise awareness of the departments being aided; \u2022 Sufficient time must be set aside to ensure indigenous communities understand the issues at hand and that NGOs working with indigenous peoples should be able to provide sufficient information for the communities to make informed decisions in a culturally appropriate manner; and \u2022 Hiring of consultants, especially those dealing with communities, should take careful consideration to ensure that the person is willing to listen to other perspectives, especially community perspectives. Community Protocol and the SBE 2000 In an effort to find ways to protect indigenous knowledge and access to biodiversity in the traditional lands of indigenous communities, a series of community workshops were organised by PACOS Trust between 1998 \u2013 2000, under the Sabah Anti-Biopiracy Programme. These consultations resulted in the formulation of a Community Protocol. The Community Protocol is aimed at getting bio-prospectors, specimen collectors and researchers to respect communities\u2019 ways of life and indigenous knowledge. After getting wide feedback from communities, government departments and NGOs, the protocol was finalised and printed as a poster for wide dissemination. Regional workshops and training were also encouraged and organized by donors of the programme. Then in 2000, as part of an effort to advocate for a law and policy on Biodiversity, the PACOS Trust, together with communities involved in drafting the protocol, called for a seminar with relevant NGOs and government departments, in particular the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "604d22e7-bd21-4d98-8d2b-151a1afa66ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "604d22e7-bd21-4d98-8d2b-151a1afa66ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a8563e61cf7d4e9d860e527a2ed526fcdbced8929d184135e15e7b96affe16a"}}, "hash": "4a8563e61cf7d4e9d860e527a2ed526fcdbced8929d184135e15e7b96affe16a", "text": "Sabah Museum and the Environmental Conservation Department. It was at this seminar that the draft SBE 2000 was revealed. Although there was no opportunity given to communities to comment on the draft Sabah Biodiversity Enactment (SBE) which was circulated for comments for only one month, PACOS Trust felt that their effort to engage communities, NGOs and government has resulted in the inclusion of a number of good sections within the SBE2000 adopted in November 2000. 4.3.1 NGOs Non-governmental organizations in Sabah have been key players in bridging the gaps in understanding of donors and the government, as well as providing indigenous communities information and knowledge regarding respect to indigenous peoples and natural resource management. In particular the PACOS Trust, a community based NGO, has not only helped enhance capacities of indigenous peoples in negotiation, it has also played a role in enhancing capacities of government departments. 29 It is important to note that NGOs that wish to support indigenous peoples' struggle for the recognition of their rights have to be consistent \u2013 both in bridging the communication gap that often exists and also in building communities to effectively and independently engage with government and companies in the long term. Watershed Conservation \u2013 Training of Government Staff by PACOS Trust Between February 2002 and March 2004, PACOS Trust was commissioned by the Drainage and Irrigation Department (DID) of Sabah with financial support from both the Sabah government and DANIDA, to provide training on community participation to the staff of DID. The training was aimed at providing the necessary skills, knowledge and sensitivity to the DID staff to ensure effective participation of indigenous communities in its effort to consult with them on the proposed Water Resources Master Plan. Such training was possible due to a strong support by the Director of DID and the Chief Technical Advisor from DANIDA. Although the Master Plan 1994 and the Water Resources Enactment 1998 only provide limited protection for indigenous peoples, the fact that the DID is implementing the consultation clause in the Enactment has enabled indigenous communities to understand these provisions and express their concerns to the department. The DID recognized that without the assistance of PACOS Trust, which is experienced in establishing rapport and gaining the trust of communities, the consultation with affected communities would not have been possible. 4.3.2 Government Several government departments have implemented the existing provisions in various natural resource management laws and policies which respect indigenous peoples' customary practices. However, the government still tends to undermine indigenous peoples' customary rights and often views indigenous resource management system with disdain. There is a great potential therefore for further recognition of indigenous peoples' rights to avoid costly conflicts that could undermine natural resource management in Sabah. Implementation of the Customary Tagal system Indigenous peoples in Sabah have practiced the Tagal system for generations to control over-harvesting of fish resources from rivers. It involves an agreement by the whole community on the conditions, areas, duration and fines with which the Tagal is to be enforced. Every member of the community is expected to monitor the implementation while the enforcement of punishment would usually be the responsibility of the village headman using the indigenous juridical system. A ceremony to mark the beginning and the end of the Tagal is a part of the whole system. The Fisheries Department had for years been trying to control over-fishing in rivers in Sabah, with little success. The posting of signboards along riverbanks detailing department rules, however, did not deter offenders. A pilot initiative by the department using the Tagal system to control fishing and a subsequent study in Kampung Babagon in Penampang district in 2000, was observed to be successful. In 2002, having concluded that this indigenous resource management is effective in the conservation and protection of fish resources, the Department decided to incorporate the Tagal system into a new bill, which was 30 subsequently adopted as the Sabah Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Enactment 2003. In its implementation of this Enactment, the Fisheries Department organized seminars and workshops and supervised the enforcement of the Tagal system. It also carried out research on freshwater fish, replenished fish stocks in rivers, and continued to assess the effectiveness of the system. Currently, 212 areas involving 107 rivers in 11 districts in Sabah are revitalizing this traditional practice and are being coordinated and systematically managed. Awareness-raising efforts and cooperation between the villagers and the government are also ongoing. 4.3.3 Community Organisations Since the traditional institution in indigenous communities no longer exists, many village chiefs and elders have had to take on the role of ensuring the continued management of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b38d696-1346-492f-86ec-e779dbbe57b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b38d696-1346-492f-86ec-e779dbbe57b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59840303660a3f824635866ac2299188c308fd5616bb0e947f0f2ccdf31ab1eb"}}, "hash": "59840303660a3f824635866ac2299188c308fd5616bb0e947f0f2ccdf31ab1eb", "text": "natural resources. Some communities have now established Community or Peoples' Organisations to facilitate various tasks, including securing land rights where they been contravened or compromised. Indigenous communities consistently state that they are not anti-development, and community organizations have an important role in expressing a community\u2019s own aspirations with respect to the management and development of natural resource in its territories. Participation and the informed consent of communities are key in such efforts. Community organisations also have an important role to protect natural resources from being exploited. Community Organisation Reclaiming Traditional Lands Under Section 28 of the Sabah Land Ordinance, 4,940 hectares of native customary rights (NCR) land were acquired by SAFODA in Kanibongan for the planting of Acacia Mangium in 1983. The Rungus indigenous communities were given oral assurances that the land would be returned to the people after the trees were harvested. However, the agreement was never fulfilled and the people were told that the government would be developing the land further. The communities involved organised several actions to protest this through a network of 21 villages under the leadership of KK Muringkat, the village headman and chairperson of the network. Their strategies include lobbying political leaders and organizing community land rights workshops with PACOS to raise awareness and to get support from other communities in other districts. Becoming more courageous after meeting with other communities facing similar problems, the network met with lawyers, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission and the Sabah Chief Minister in 2003. Finally, their struggle for the restitution of their land paid off and the communities' traditional lands were degazetted from the land vested in SAFODA on 1st March 2005. 31 4.3.4 Donors Prior to 1997, participation of NGOs and community organizations in project planning and implementation were very rare in Sabah. Technical cooperation between Germany (via GTZ) and the Sabah Government (Forestry Department) to develop the Sustainable Forest Management System at a pilot site in Deramakot Forest Reserve represented the turning point in incorporating a \"social component\" in bilateral support to the State. Similar projects funded by the Danish development agency, DANIDA, and several government departments in Sabah further enhanced the participation of indigenous communities and NGOs. Technical cooperation with DANCED (and later DANIDA) which has firm commitment to a policy on indigenous peoples led to active participation of PACOS Trust and the community in the various pilot areas. The Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) which does not currently have a policy on indigenous peoples' policy have a potential to formulate such a policy through the Borneon Biodiversity Ecosystem and Conservation (BBEC), a project between the Sabah government and JICA. DANCED and Capacity Building of the Sabah Wildlife Department to Ensure Participation of Indigenous Peoples The approval by the Danish government through DANCED of support to a capacity building project for the Sabah Wildlife Department (SWD) initiated a project which included a community component aimed at obtaining better understanding of various aspects of hunting and wildlife management by rural indigenous communities in Sabah. In the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 there are two provisions that relate to the participation of local communities in sustainable wildlife management \u2013 the Animal Kampung (Village) Hunting License, AKHL (Section 32) and Honorary Wildlife Warden - HWW (Section 7). These two provisions involve developing an understanding of indigenous knowledge on wildlife management. In November 2001 the Sabah Wildlife Department Capacity Building Project and PACOS TRUST initiated the Pilot Project on AKHL and HWW. Two indigenous communities were selected as pilot areas and the main objectives of the Pilot Project were to develop a model for the issuing of AKHLs to local communities in Sabah, to develop appropriate wildlife management mechanisms and to appoint a number of community Honorary Wildlife Wardens. In cooperation with the local communities, mechanisms for participation in, and administration of, hunting and wildlife management were developed, including the formation of a Community Wildlife Committee; the appointment of a number of HWWs to assist SWD in implementing the Wildlife Conservation Enactment; an agreement on hunting quota stating the types and number of animals that be hunted; development of a Community Hunting Protocol; and the development of a Hunter Ledger to be filled out by the communities to manage and monitor hunting quotas. The experiences gained during the implementation of the Pilot Project show that local communities are willing to participate and compromise on natural resource management even if it means a restriction to their hunting activities when it ensures recognition of their rights to manage their wildlife resources and assists them in developing appropriate wildlife management mechanisms.

Indigenous peoples themselves have created and strengthened many opportunities for participation, particularly when capacities are enhanced and openness is expressed by the government. Workshops, seminars and conferences organized by government departments, the academia and NGOs are important venues to articulate opinions, (although these have sometime been criticized as inappropriate for indigenous peoples as English is often used and the venue chosen is often not conducive for discussions). Communities have also called several dialogues but government representatives have not reciprocated by attending these meetings, thus denying themselves the opportunity to also listen to, and see the conditions, that indigenous peoples are subject to. Another mechanism for participation is through the submission of written comments on natural resource management. This has not proved effective for either the government and indigenous peoples \u2013 the government being poor in providing relevant information in an appropriate form, and communities being inarticulate and unable to process feedback in the short time-frame often required for these comments. The role of NGOs in facilitating this process and bridging the gap has, however, made this mechanism more effective. More recently, the condition attached by donors to development cooperation (see 4.3.4) has given rise to more direct participation of indigenous peoples in the implementation of pilot projects. However, the weakness of these pilot projects lies in the lack of commitment by both donors and the government departments involved to enabling the replication of the projects in areas outside of the pilot areas. The issue is not only about funding but about acceptance. It could be that to these pilot projects are \"alien\" solutions in natural resource management issues and do not capture the minds and hearts of both government departments and communities. Yet it is possible, and potentially very successful. An example of an initiative that received tremendous support is the implementation of the Tagal system (see 4.3.2), which has been accepted without further injection of funds. Participation would be ensured if decision making with prior informed consent was recognized throughout the process. In many instances, the opportunities to express opinions \u2018granted\u2019 to indigenous peoples are mere lip service and often made to pacify communities. Sadly, input on natural resource management is often ignored. 33 Women's Participation in Natural Resource Management The Convention on Biological Diversity recognizes the important role of women and women's knowledge in conserving and nurturing biodiversity. Yet, development projects are often targeted for men and the recognition of women's knowledge by institutions still has a long way to go. Nevertheless, after years of struggle, some changes have been achieved. Female heads of households, including single mothers, are now recognized by law and there are now more opportunities in capacity- enhancement for women (for example in food processing and teachers training). However, projects and programmes are seldom designed to take into consideration active participation of women. For example, women are asked to cook during functions and women with children are not given necessary childcare support. If they do participate, they are not encouraged to speak and their ideas are not actively sought. Development of Rules for the SBE2000 As mentioned in the example in the box above, the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment was adopted in November 2000. However, it could not be implemented until the Rules to the Enactment were formulated and adopted. PACOS Trust thus undertook several consultations with communities and government to develop the Rules accompanying the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000 in order to fulfil the requirements of section 9(1)(j) which requires the creation of a \u2018system\u2019 that ensures indigenous peoples \"\u2026 shall all times and in perpetuity, be the legitimate creators, users and custodians of traditional knowledge, and shall collectively benefit from the use of such knowledge.\u201d This system also draws upon the requirements of the various relevant international legal instruments, some of which have come into force subsequent to the passing of the Enactment. The result of an extensive consultation process with representatives from over 40 indigenous communities, the system provides a culturally appropriate means for the dissemination of information, the obtaining of consent on mutually agreed terms, in accordance with customary law and the equitable sharing of benefits with indigenous communities. Practical benefits include increased efficiency in collection efforts and effective monitoring of illegal collection activities, poverty alleviation and the realization of human food security and health and cultural integrity within indigenous communities. 34 5.

A section also highlights a number of cases to illustrate these challenges. 5.1 Implementation of Laws and Policies on Indigenous Resource Management System As seen in section 2, there are numerous laws and policies that accorded certain recognition to indigenous peoples but this information was not popularized or effectively disseminated. As a result, many indigenous peoples lost their land and resources especially when companies, government statutory bodies and outsiders took advantage of this lack of information. One important example is the requirement for making claims for native customary rights to indigenous lands. Here the Lands and Survey Department failed to provide information about a form (LSF 1898) that would make the process easy for indigenous peoples to secure their rights to their lands. Another challenge is actual contravention of the laws themselves (such as use of Section 28 of the Land Ordinance 1930) or in the course of implementation (when the government failed to settle NCR claims prior to the gazetting of forest reserves). The implementation of policies and strategies by the government has also failed to take into consideration the rich knowledge and experiences of indigenous peoples in natural resource management that has been handed down over generations. It is only recently that remedies have been taken when certain actors decided to have a more serious look at these laws. However, the damage had been done and the indigenous resource management system continued to erode as the alienation of land for resource exploitation occurred actively between the 1970's and 1980's. Today, 49 percent of Sabah total land area of 74,000 sq. km has been allocated as Forest Reserves mainly for commercial logging, while 12 percent is for plantations. 5.2 Community Perceptions and Responses Contradictions between policies and implementation have served to confuse the people. One example is in Bundu in the Tambunan district where villagers were shocked to be told that the area which they have been protecting for generations and which had been gazetted as a watershed area was given out by the government to loggers. The logging activities devastated the catchment area and silted the river which they relied on for irrigating their paddy fields. The situations within indigenous communities have also made it difficult to understand and appreciate the laws and policies. Although traditional institutions have been replaced by a so- called Village Development and Security Committee that is supposed to be composed of more educated and informed representatives, this has worked against the community. Very little 35 information is actually transmitted to the ordinary members of the community, especially those in the rural areas, and if there is, the information is often biased towards the government. As a result there is little reflection on the policies and laws and how they affect indigenous rights. Many communities are convinced that the laws and policies do not function and cannot guarantee their rights to manage natural resources. Petitions to relevant departments have been sent and when these failed to get a response, some communities have made police reports or press statements to draw attention to the disrespect of indigenous peoples' rights or exploitation of natural resources. Often the government response has been to reprimand communities, to voice its displeasure or threaten communities using laws that are unfair resulting in further conflict. Some communities have thus resorted to filing court cases against the encroaching company or the government. Three such cases that will be illustrated here are: Bundu in Tambunan, Tongod in the Kinabatangan district (see 5.3.2) and Desa Montoki in the Ranau district. 5.3 Cases illustrating Challenges and Drawbacks 5.3.1 Coordination between Government Departments The Sabah Wildlife Department Pilot Project mentioned earlier (see 4.3.4) highlighted some of the major constraints preventing local communities from exercising their rights to participate in natural resource management as stipulated in various enactments and policies described earlier. In this case, the Forest Management Unit holder, namely the Sabah Foundation, which was granted a 100-year term to manage the area sustainably is not willing to recognize the community hunting area, as the Sabah Foundation plans to allow logging there. There is now an ongoing dialogue between the Sabah Wildlife Department, communities and relevant government agencies to make the Forest Management Unit holders comply with their obligations under the Sustainable Forest Management System and for them to recognize the importance of involvement of local communities in natural resource management. 5.3.2 Non-recognition of Indigenous Peoples' Rights to Land On 6 September 1999, the government issued and registered a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd477cd4-ad3c-4235-9481-91569a4a5843": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd477cd4-ad3c-4235-9481-91569a4a5843", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "843df685dcd8e20a3eceb628872047e20fb1d147921b0825712348ca22a9042d"}}, "hash": "843df685dcd8e20a3eceb628872047e20fb1d147921b0825712348ca22a9042d", "text": "Country Lease to a company for the cultivation of oil palm on NCR land belonging to the Dusun Minokok indigenous communities in Tongod in the Kinabatangan district, thus alienating their land from them. The communities had been residing as a native community in the Tongod Region for seven generations. They inhabited the Tongod Region even before the formation of the Colonial Government of North Borneo and have established villages in various localities along the tributaries of Tongod River. As natives of Sabah, and by virtue of their long and continuous occupation and use of the land upon which they have continuously cultivated and resided, the community acquired NCR, native titles and usufructuary rights over the land. The communities\u2019 customary and proprietary rights were not extinguished by any enacted law or any law subsequently enacted. 36 For years, the government informed the community that it was undertaking a settlement scheme for the benefit of the communities such as the Tongod Regional Planning Study (TRPS) and that upon completion of the Study, the land occupied, used and enjoyed by the community would be allocated to them. Further, the government led or misled the community to believe that their land applications submitted and accepted since 1985 would be kept in abeyance pending the finalization of the TPRS and that until then there was no necessity to submit land applications. The community filed a case against the company and the government, in which the court decided in favour of the community and ruled that the alienation through the issue of the Country Lease was unconstitutional, violating Article 161A (5) of the Federal Constitution with regard to the special positions of natives in the State of Sabah. It further decided that the government ought to have exercised their powers under Article 8(5) of the Federal Constitution and the Sabah Land Ordinance (Cap. 68) to protect the NCR land. The action of the government was thus discriminatory, unfair and unconstitutional having violated Article 8 of the Federal Constitution that guarantees equality of all peoples before the law and Article 13 of the Federal Constitution which guarantees that no person shall be deprived of his property without adequate compensation. 5.3.3 Implementing Resource Use Rights In 2004, Sabah Parks drew up a management plan for the Crocker Range Park (CRP). Within the boundaries of the Park are a number of communities that have existed long before the State came into being. After a series of consultations, two proposals were made with regards to the settlement of claims by indigenous peoples. One is the establishment of \"Traditional Use Zones\" for areas such as community hunting areas and watershed areas, both of which will remain as such within the CRP and will be jointly managed. Another is the excision of land, particularly traditional agricultural areas. Communities will be accorded rights to the resources within the Traditional Use Zones. However, the Parks Enactment and the categorization of CRP as a strict protected area (IUCN category II), currently does recognize the utilization of resources and the involvement of communities in management committees. The challenge lies in the amendment of the law to accommodate these needs amidst debate within various government departments that are not supportive of such moves within protected areas. A Collaborative Management Learning Network in Southeast Asia could help bridge the gap in terms of laws and policies for the recognition of resource use rights within protected areas. 5.3.4 Resettlement of Communities \u2013 GRID, Gana Although the Forest Enactment and forest policies allows indigenous communities to remain within forest reserves, the resettlement of communities does occur as seen in the Gana Resettlement and Integrated Development (GRID) project implemented in Kampung Gana, Kota Marudu in 1997. The project cost RM 8,765,000.00 (USD2.3m) and has brought about physical and socio-economic changes to the Dusun Sonsogon indigenous community. The expressed goal of the project is to ensure sustainable use of forest resources in the area as well as in the Lingkabau Forest Reserve (LFR) while improving the standard of living of the local 37 communities. It is planned that the local population are to be the main players in the management of the area and directly benefits from the forest produce. The key issue is the management of natural resources to ensure that all forest resources within the commercial forest reserves are managed on a sustainable yield basis for economic, social and environmental purposes To affected indigenous communities, the GRID project means the resettlement of communities living inside the forest reserve.

A forest reserve is more likely to survive if it has the support of the local people and working with local people is the only way to achieve long term forest protection. The Sabah Forestry Department recognizes that this can only be accomplished with active cooperation and participation of the communities bordering forest reserves. 5.3.5 Information Dissemination Two initiatives by PACOS Trust in 2004 (a process to draft both the Rules that would accompany the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000 and the Crocker Range Park Management Plan), demonstrated commendable efforts in information dissemination, particularly to indigenous communities. In the past, various government officials and politicians have repeatedly expressed the need to take the views of indigenous peoples seriously, but this was always seen as merely lip service. When the Crocker Range Management Plan was unveiled, only three months were set aside for comments. Sabah Parks was unable to provide official translation of the documents, but were open and willing to financially support the document to be translated into Malay. PACOS Trust undertook this challenge to translate, disseminate and collect feedback from affected communities within this stipulated timeframe. It is yet to be established whether the comments that were painstakingly collated by PACOS Trust and submitted to the Sabah Parks would be taken into consideration and incorporated into a revised management plan. Responding to concerns by some government departments and communities, PACOS also initiated the dissemination of the Biodiversity Enactment and drafted the Rules related to the provisions on indigenous peoples' rights. It was heartening to observe the active participation of many government departments, research institutes and NGOs in the drafting of the Rules. 5.3.6 Provisions and Mechanism for Obtaining Consent Obtaining the consent of communities for the declaration or gazetting of protected areas such as watersheds, forest reserves, sanctuaries and parks has failed dismally in the past. In more recent Enactments such as the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000, stronger provisions for obtaining consent from communities can serve as a test as to whether this will change. Internationally, the principle of Free, Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) is gaining acceptance and mechanisms are being drawn up to ensure that genuine consent is obtained from indigenous communities. FPIC 38 gives indigenous peoples the right to be consulted and provide (or deny) their consent, to negotiate terms of agreement and to decline a project that is not beneficial. A big challenge remains in ensuring that existing laws and policies are amended to include FPIC provisions, and to include provisions for redress and restitution to those communities whose claims were not settled when their lands and resources were taken for protected areas. 5.3.7 Interpretation of the Laws Section 15 of the Sabah Land Ordinance 1930 was adopted from a standard law by the British colonial rulers and has not been changed much in the subsequent years. Among the contentious elements in the definition of Native Customary Rights (NCR) under section 15 (b) is the number of fruit trees per acre of land to be found when ascertaining NCR. Even though indigenous communities and organizations have repeatedly asked the government to amend the section as it was not an appropriate indicator, these fell into deaf ears and a recent amendment instead increased the number of fruit trees from 15 to 50 per acre. Indigenous communities have also been voicing their petition to repeal Section 28 of the Sabah Land Ordinance and have sent memoranda to the national Human Rights Commission and the Sabah Chief Minister. However, due to the low capacity in negotiation skills and the lack of sustained efforts on the part of communities, this has not been successfully achieved to date. 5.3.8 Enhancing Capacity of Indigenous Communities Enhancing capacities among indigenous communities is also a big challenge because of the lack of resources and support for such efforts. Very few NGOs and support groups have the time or patience to do capacity enhancement in a manner that is sensitive to communities. Many young people who have had some formal education have either left or are seldom in the community. Others who received tertiary education often see the efforts of their elders and members of the community to assert their rights over natural resources as futile or backward. Even though there are now more opportunities to engage with the authorities, many are unable to do so because these engagements are mainly based on conditions established by the government. Often meetings are held in 5-star hotels, conducted in English and further constrained by a limited number of invitations given at short notice. As such, these meetings do not build", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d02bc81-6f8b-4e37-ad04-cad6a4b2720e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d02bc81-6f8b-4e37-ad04-cad6a4b2720e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1c33ba511b978ca5a8f606b34bcf5ed31bb5b21a5013bbd0713d917dbb8826e"}}, "hash": "a1c33ba511b978ca5a8f606b34bcf5ed31bb5b21a5013bbd0713d917dbb8826e", "text": "indigenous peoples' capacities but instead can be disempowering. Capacity enhancement through building of community organizations also takes much effort, resources and long-term partnerships. 5.3.9 Erosion of Indigenous Resource Management System Natural resources are now viewed as an individual property rather than being collectively owned by the community. This has created competition in some communities leading to unsustainable resource utilization. An example is the extraction of timber in a community forest by individuals 39 for self-gain. The challenge to be met is re-establishing communal responsibility and revitalizing the indigenous resource management system so that resources can be utilised in a sustainable manner for the wellbeing of the community. Another drawback is non-genuine project development by some communities. In some instances, indigenous landowners have applied for various projects stated as forest management when the real intention is the extraction of timber. An example is application for logging rights in water catchments system for a gravity-fed water management project resulting in the destruction of the area. Another example is for application for the establishment of less suitable grazing reserves in steeply forested areas instead of low-lying hilly grassland areas. These areas are abandoned after the commercial logs were extracted. The challenge is both in effective enforcement and in building understanding to overcome the desire for short-term monetary gains. There are also many instances where communities facilitate illegal felling timber in their native reserves in return for various favours from a logging company such as the repair of the drainage and irrigation for their rice fields or the repair of football fields. Such an idea stemmed for example in the early 1990's in Sabah, when the Forest Department sanctioned logging in return for building wooden houses to replace traditional houses. The challenges would involve good dialogue with the community to ascertain their needs and for the government to respond appropriately to these needs in a timely manner. 5.3.10 Use of Police in Land Conflicts The involvement of the police in resource conflict is a serious and on-going issue in Sabah, and is in direct contravention of national and state law. The following illustrates how the police was involved in a land-grabbing incident by a Chinese businessman, Mr. Ooi Say Tuan, in the indigenous village of Kg. Togudon in the Penampang district. On 26 July 2005, two police personnel came to the house of Mr. Kopit Tayu, an indigenous person from the Dusun indigenous group, to arrest him. He was not told any reason for his arrest and only upon reaching the Penampang police station was he informed of the accusation against him for stealing the belongings of Mr. Ooi Say Tuan. Mr. Kopit was held for 7 days. Then on 25 August 2005, a plainclothes policeman and Mr. Ooi came to the house of Mr. Martin Galagub at 7:30 pm asking him to go to the police station to discuss about the land in which he has built his house. Martin was threatened that his non-compliance would result in actions against him. At the police station, Martin and the village headmen Mr. Gamato Galagub, were forced by Ooi to consent to compensation of RM7,800 (USD2053) and to sign a letter of agreement between Martin and Ooi, a letter written by Sergeant Hassan Sani. On 26 September 2005, Mr. Soikun Sumporo received a call from a police officer from the Penampang Police Station ordering him to come to the station without giving any reasons. At the station, Sergeant David Jamilong informed him that he and his family are ordered to leave their present house within 7 days as the land they are living in Kg. Togudon was owned by Ooi. The next day Ooi and 7 others arrived at Soikun's house to forcibly evict him. 40 5.3.11 National Implementation of International Instruments Current issues on natural resources management are being actively debated at the international level, particularly at the processes related to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In line with usual international compartmentalization of issues, indigenous issues are being discussed separately at the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PFII), leading to inconsistency in debates and agreements across the two fora. Malaysia ratified the CBD and is also often represented at the PFII. However the representations at these fora do not reflect the decentralized manner in which the States operate. As such, government delegates from Sabah and Sarawak, where the majority of indigenous peoples reside and where laws and policies on natural resource management are enacted separately, are not included in the official national delegation. For example, none of the government departments from Sabah were officially invited to the 7th Conference", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5fe0fec-8883-4291-ad33-1eaab5831aa8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5fe0fec-8883-4291-ad33-1eaab5831aa8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdf0c6a433f3f99a5af6acd0c3a9845959fe16523fbe7c3f1728b183727f2d5e"}}, "hash": "bdf0c6a433f3f99a5af6acd0c3a9845959fe16523fbe7c3f1728b183727f2d5e", "text": "of Parties that was hosted by Malaysia in 2004. The opportunity accorded in terms of understanding international debate on indigenous peoples and natural resource management are not maximized, making it even a bigger challenge to effect national implementation of international instruments. 5.3.12 Impact of Natural Resources Development on Women In a study conducted by PACOS in the Bundu village in Sabah in 2001, women said that the depletion of natural resources has made it more difficult for them to go about their traditional activities such as the preparation of food and making of handicrafts. Women also feel more burdened with the responsibility of looking for increasingly scarce income-generating alternatives, especially if they are denied access to natural resources for food, water and fuel (firewood). Also since the health of the family is often the responsibility of women, the burden is placed on them to keep families healthy in the face of a deteriorating environment. Once the forest resource is too far away or too dangerous for them to get, some of the traditional social reproductive roles of women are taken over by men. Thus the independence of women erodes as they increasingly depend on men to accompany or assist them in getting the scarce resources for the daily needs of the family or for handicrafts. 41 6. Laws on Natural Resource Management affecting the Orang Asli This Chapter will focus on the Orang Asli, the indigenous peoples in Peninsular Malaysia. It attempts to demonstrate that while the various laws affecting Orang Asli rights to their traditional lands and resources may not be explicit in protecting these rights, there is actually enough in our local laws to support recognition of this inalienable right \u2013 if we only want to do so. The hierarchy of legislation in Malaysia is as follows: 1. The Federal Constitution; 2. Acts passed by Parliament; 3. Regulations and other subsidiary legislation passed by the executive (Ministerial Regulations); 4. State laws and regulations. Ironically, as we shall see for the case of the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia, it is the last category \u2013 state laws and regulations \u2013 that effectively take precedence in determining Orang Asli rights to their traditional land and resources. 6.1 State Laws and Regulations Several laws and regulations affect the status of the Orang Asli even though they may not directly concern them or mention them specifically. Some examples are Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Act No. 172) and the Local Government Act 1976 (Act No. 171) \u2013 both of which effectively remove any semblance of autonomy that the Orang Asli may have had over their traditional lands. The following laws, however, have a greater bearing on the Orang Asli insofar as the management and control of their territories and the resources found therein are concerned: \u2022 National Land Code 1965 (Act No. 56) \u2022 Land Conservation Act 1960 (Act No. 385), revised 1989 \u2022 Land (Group Settlement Areas) Act 1960 (Act No. 530), revised 1994 \u2022 Protection of Wildlife Act 1972 (Act No. 76), revised 1976, 1991 \u2022 National Parks Act 1980 (Act No.226) \u2022 Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 (Act No. 134), revised 1974 The National Land Code established a uniform system of tenure under which title to an interest in land depends on registration. This act applies only to the Peninsula and deals with matters of tenure, title, and land transfer. Under the Act, authority over all land, mineral, and rock material is given to the respective states. The Land Conservation Act 1960 consolidates the law relating to the conservation of hill lands and the protection of soil from erosion and the inroad of silt. Section 5 provides that no person shall plant any hill land with short term crops (i.e. crops that normally complete their life cycle 42 within two years after planting) without an annual permit from the Collector of Land Revenue. Section 6 goes on to prohibit the clearing of hill land. These provisions are detrimental to Orang Asli communities who live in forest and forest fringe areas and who still depend on the traditional swiddens for their subsistence. The Land (Group Settlement Areas) Act 1960 enables land agencies such as the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA), the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) and other agencies such as the Pahang Tenggara Development Authority (DARA) to take over State land and to develop them for the purpose of land settlement which culminates in the issue of titles to the settlers. Frequently Orang Asli traditional areas have been converted to such land schemes with them not enjoying both the fruits of the programme nor being", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71f202cb-5875-4f0e-85cd-88274de8c493": {"__data__": {"id_": "71f202cb-5875-4f0e-85cd-88274de8c493", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33d2ecfc39ec803b2da31beafe66d019a114a13accc7385b9df5c6add077492e"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c48a3a3-3421-468e-9692-5c6cee506abd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcbc86748eef33ab5225fb18fffa5e28dab2e5ce99d23424ca2c579e520217d2"}}, "hash": "c5a604e3ec567662dfc5021aa82e7b2278bdefec8de4ac1c76ceaef3840a699e", "text": "entitled to such titles for the land. A law that expressly mentions the Orang Asli (or \u2018aboriginal community\u2019) is the Protection of Wildlife Act 1972 (Act 76). Wildlife Reserves and Sanctuaries may be declared by the state under this legislation. In such areas, an Orang Asli may shoot, kill or take certain wildlife for the purpose of providing food for himself or his family. Another law that is applicable to the Orang Asli is the National Forestry Act 1984, which provides for the administration, management and conservation of forests and forestry development in the states. It also states that forest produce is property of the state and that harvesting requires a license. Basically, it treats the Orang Asli harvesters of such forest produce (e.g. rattan and petai) as labourers of the traders who hold the necessary licences (or \u2018bund\u2019 as they are called in Perak) from the Forest Department. The National Parks Act (Act 226) 1980 is an act to provide for the establishment and control of National Parks and for matters connected therewith. While usufructuary rights of the Orang Asli may not be curtailed in such parks, their right to own and control their traditional territories certainly come under serious jeopardy. The Aboriginal Peoples Act (1954, revised 1974) is the only law that specifically refers to the Orang Asli. While the Act provides for the establishment of Orang Asli Areas and Orang Asli Reserves, it also grants the state authority the right to order any Orang Asli community to leave \u2013 and stay out of \u2013 an area. In effect, the best security that an Orang Asli can get is one of \u2018tenant- at-will\u2019. That is to say, an Orang Asli is allowed to remain in a particular area only at the pleasure of the state authority. If at such time the state wishes to re-acquire the land, it can revoke its status and the Orang Asli are left with no other legal recourse but to move elsewhere. Furthermore, in the event of such displacement occurring, the state is not obliged to pay any compensation or allocate an alternative site, and may only do so. Thus, the Aboriginal Peoples Act laid down certain ground rules for the treatment of Orang Asli and their lands. Effectively, it accorded the Minister concerned \u2013 or his representative, the Director-General of the Department of Orang Asli Affairs (JHEOA) \u2013 the final say in all matters concerning the administration of the Orang Asli and in matters concerning land, to the state authority. 43 All these laws give the Federal and State Governments a tremendous amount of leverage against the Orang Asli. (This, at least, is how the above laws, and especially the Aboriginal Peoples Act were interpreted \u2013 until, that is, the October 2005 decision of the Court of Appeal in the Sagong Tasi case, as discussed below.) Even supposedly sustainable and rights-respecting initiatives such as the Malaysian Timber Certification Council (MTCC) prefer to hide behind the catch-all clause \u201csubject to national laws\u201d knowing full well that such national laws generally favour the interests and greed of the well-placed and well-heeled rather than the Orang Asli inhabitants of the areas they now seek to exploit or appropriate. 6.2 The Federal Constitution, Land, Natural Resources and the Orang Asli The welfare of the Orang Asli comes under the Federal List in the Federal Constitution, while land and forest matters come under the State List. Also, as every state is independent under the Constitution, federal legislation in most cases is not binding on the states. On the contrary, the Federal Constitution accords substantial powers over land use and natural resource management to the respective States. Although under the Constitution the Federal Government is empowered to make laws it deems necessary to ensure continuity throughout the country, the Federal Government often serves merely as a coordinating entity. As such, federal agencies like the Department of Orang Asli Affairs (JHEOA) would consequently assume only a liaison and cooperative role with respect to the state authorities. In fact, this line of rationalising \u2013 that while the Orang Asli are a federal concern, all matters pertaining to land reside in the state over which they have no say or influence \u2013 is an oft-heard explanation whenever those responsible for gazetting or reserving lands for the Orang Asli are asked for the reason for the dismal progress in this matter.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c48a3a3-3421-468e-9692-5c6cee506abd": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c48a3a3-3421-468e-9692-5c6cee506abd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33d2ecfc39ec803b2da31beafe66d019a114a13accc7385b9df5c6add077492e"}, "2": {"node_id": "71f202cb-5875-4f0e-85cd-88274de8c493", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5a604e3ec567662dfc5021aa82e7b2278bdefec8de4ac1c76ceaef3840a699e"}}, "hash": "bcbc86748eef33ab5225fb18fffa5e28dab2e5ce99d23424ca2c579e520217d2", "text": "That there is a glaring precedent in the case of FELDA (which effectively utilises the Land (Group Settlement Areas) Act of 1960 to direct states to give up some of their land for landless settlers in their development schemes)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b9c70fc-cb91-4f4a-915d-8dbae11d4864": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b9c70fc-cb91-4f4a-915d-8dbae11d4864", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "205fbb475c3ae323c72b8669fc9e4394f198902620fc93d115c41a2e65056ea0"}, "3": {"node_id": "055317e7-0b59-47dd-a042-582280837d9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e8765afda45e7b4dbabfb773f4336f08270f73c8052feb8058b9b8d423da225"}}, "hash": "a1611d1439faf72a755b3c0b6b3cd217564d3b015d8113bf3b846a4716291cce", "text": "is somehow lost on these administrators and decision-makers. The crux of the problem lies in the fact that with forests being such a valuable productive resource in the country, it is in the interest of the States to maintain control over their forest lands. Creating Orang Asli reserves in their now-valuable land banks would effectively deny the State of a revenue-generating facility as such reserves would now come under the purview of the Federal Government. Thus, it does not make economic sense for the States to gazette lands for the Orang Asli. This is, of course, based on the presumption that States enjoy the legal right to those lands that are contested by the Orang Asli as their own. But as we shall see below, this perception is steadily giving way to an interpretation of natural resource laws that are bound to bring changes to the way traditional territories are controlled and managed. 44 6.3 The Changing Status of the Orang Asli in Natural Resource Law 6.3.1 Only Orang Asli have rights to forest produce in Orang Asli areas (Koperasi Kijang Mas v Kerajaan Negeri Perak) In 1992, the Ipoh High Court, in deciding the case of Koperasi Kijang Mas & 3 others versus Kerajaan Negeri Perak & two others, held that the State Government of Perak had breached the Aboriginal Peoples Act, 1954 (revised 1974) when it accepted Syarikat Samudera Budi Sdn. Bhd's tender to log certain areas in Kuala Kangsar. These areas included lands which have been approved by the State Government as Aboriginal Reserves namely the regroupment schemes of RPS Sungei Banun and RPS Pos Legap. The High Court went on further to hold that Syarikat Samudera accordingly had no rights to carry on logging activities and that only Orang Asli as defined in the Aboriginal Peoples Act had the right to the forest produce in these reserves. An important point canvassed by the State Government was that the lands, although approved as Aboriginal Reserves, had not been gazetted. Justice Malek, in a strong opinion, held that gazetting was not a mandatory requirement for the recognition of reserves and the relevant laws therein. The approval of the State Government for the lands to be aboriginal reserves had, without the necessity of gazetting, created the reserves and thereafter only Orang Asli have exclusive rights to the forest products in the reserves. This decision has important implications for Orang Asli land rights as official sources indicate that some 29,144.18 hectares of aboriginal lands in 2002 have been approved, but are yet to be gazetted. In respect of these lands therefore, Orang Asli have some measure of statutory protection from encroachment and displacement by many other interests. 6.3.2 Orang Asli have proprietary interest on the land Adong bin Kuwau v. State of Johor In 1997, the Johor High Court awarded compensation to 52 Jakuns for the loss of 53,273 acres of ancestral lands. The state government had taken the forested land and leased it to the Public Utilities Board of Singapore who subsequently constructed a dam to supply water to both Johor and Singapore. Justice Mokhtar concluded that the Jakuns had proprietary rights over their lands, but no alienable interest in the land itself. That is to say, while the Jakuns may not hold title to their traditional lands, they nevertheless have the right to use it for their subsistence and other needs. In this instance, the court ruled that while certain lands are reserved for aboriginal peoples, they also have recognized rights to hunt and gather over additional lands \u2013 the \u201cright to continue to live on their lands, as their forefathers had lived.\u201d Such proprietary rights were protected by Article 13 of the Federal Constitution, which required the payment of \u201cadequate compensation\u201d for any taking of property. In accordance with this, the 45 Jakuns were awarded a sum of RM26.5 million for their loss of income for the next 25 years. With interest accrued, the final payment was RM38 million. This judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal in 1998, with no leave being granted for appeal to the Federal Court.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "055317e7-0b59-47dd-a042-582280837d9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "055317e7-0b59-47dd-a042-582280837d9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "205fbb475c3ae323c72b8669fc9e4394f198902620fc93d115c41a2e65056ea0"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b9c70fc-cb91-4f4a-915d-8dbae11d4864", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1611d1439faf72a755b3c0b6b3cd217564d3b015d8113bf3b846a4716291cce"}}, "hash": "8e8765afda45e7b4dbabfb773f4336f08270f73c8052feb8058b9b8d423da225", "text": "6.3.3 Orang Asli have proprietary interest in the land Sagong Tasi v Kerajaan Negeri Selangor Sagong Tasi was among 23 family heads from Bukit Tampoi in Dengkil, Selangor who had 38 acres of their land taken from them for the construction of the Nilai-Banting highway linking with the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport in 1995.

With the help of a pro bono team of lawyers from the Bar Council, the Temuans took their case to the courts. They asserted that are the owners of the land by custom, the holders of native title to the land and the holders of usufructuary rights (i.e. right to use and derive profit) to the land. They also maintained that that their customary and propriety rights over the land which they and their forefathers have occupied and cultivated for a long time were not extinguished by any law. In April 2002, Justice Mohd ruled that the Temuans did have native title under common law over their lands. As such compensation was to be paid to them in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act, 1960. The four defendants (the Selangor state government, United Engineers Malaysia (UEM), Malaysian Highway Authority (LLM), and the Federal Government) appealed. In October 2005, Court of Appeal Judge Gopal Sri Ram, sitting with two others, unanimously threw out the appeal and held that the High Court was not misdirected when it decided, based on a large quantity of evidence and fact that was not challenged, to rule that the Temuans did indeed have propriety rights over their customary lands. As such, these lands should be treated as titled lands and therefore subject to compensation under the Land Acquisition Act. Thus it can be seen that the Orang Asli were deemed to be in possession on titled rights to their lands all this while \u2013 only that the state and federal authorities chose to impose their interpretation of the natural resource laws to their own advantage. Unfortunately, this was a right that had to be challenged in court and not one that was conceded with magnanimity as befitting a position that is just and equitable. Earlier, we noted that in the hierarchy of legislations in Malaysia, the State laws and regulations appear to be given greater weight and authority over the Federal Constitution. That this is so was clearly elaborated by Justice Gopal in his judgement of October 2005. His 59-page judgment in the Court of Appeal is more than just an affirmation of the rights of the Orang Asli to their traditional lands. It was a condemnation of the way the Orang Asli have been treated by the authorities and a wake-up call to the government to fulfil its fiduciary responsibility towards the community. In his words, \u201cHere you have a case where the very 46 authority \u2013 the State \u2013 that is enjoined by the law to protect the aborigines, turned upon them and permitted them to be treated in a most shoddy, cruel and oppressive manner.\u201d 6.4 Failure in Fiduciary Duty Acknowledging that the purpose of the Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 was to \u201cprotect and uplift the First Peoples of this country\u201d, Judge Gopal asserted that \u201cit was therefore fundamentally a human rights statute, acquiring a quasi-constitutional status giving it pre-eminence over ordinary legislation. It must therefore receive a broad and liberal interpretation.\u201d This was in keeping with the early debates and discussions as recorded in the Federal Legislative Assembly hansards, newspapers of the day and archival records which clearly showed that Orang Asli lands were to be recognized. For example, as noted in the judgment, when the Orang Asli representative, Tok Pangku Pandak Hamid, asked the Minister of Education if the government had any plans to ensure that the hereditary lands of the Aborigines are reserved for their use, Enche Mohd Khir Johari replied: \u201cSteps are now being taken to create these reserves and there are also in existence others which were gazetted prior to the introduction of the Ordinance\u2026.

This prompted Judge Gopal to comment that, \u201cI am yet to see a clearer case of a party taking advantage of its own wrong.\u201d 6.5 Making the Aboriginal Peoples Act compliant with the Federal Constitution The practice to date has been to use the 1954 Act as the legal basis for compensating the Orang Asli only for their crops and dwellings whenever their lands are taken. The 1954 Act has also been used to argue that the Orang Asli do not hold proprietary interest in their land, and that the state governments exercise wide powers as to the disposal and compensation of these lands. The Orang Asli as such are only tenants-at-will, living on state land at the state\u2019s largesse. Citing a number of legal precedents and justification, Judge Gopal reversed this interpretation. In light of the obvious conflict between the 1954 Act and the Federal Constitution, wherein Article 13(2) states that, \u201cNo law shall provide for compulsory acquisition or use of property without 47 adequate compensation,\" he ruled that relevant portions of the 1954 Act had to be brought into conformity with the Constitution. This is achieved, he says, by not reading the words in section 12 of the 1954 Act, \"The State Authority may grant compensation therefor\" as conferring a discretion on the State Authority whether to grant compensation or not. Rather it is by reading the relevant phrase as \"the State Authority shall grant adequate compensation therefore\", that the modification is complete. This is a pro-active move that has the positive effect of restoring justice to a community that has long been denied of their rights by the narrow interpretation of natural resource laws. The judge added that, \u201cI am aware that ordinarily we, the judges, are not permitted by our own jurisprudence, to do this. But here you have a direction by the supreme law of the Federation that such modifications as the present must be done.\u201d 6.6 Conclusion and Recommendations For the Orang Asli, the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of Sagong Tasi and 6 Ors v Kerajaan Negeri Selangor and 3 Orang Asli is without doubt a landmark decision in many respects. It shows that there are enough laws to protect the rights of the indigenous peoples to their traditional lands and resources if the government has the will to do so. Indigenous peoples are increasingly pressured to file cases in the court and this is proving expensive \u2013 not just for indigenous communities but also for the government. For the government losing a case can be a cause for embarrassment and bad publicity that can be avoided by being pro-active and reviewing policies and laws that denies indigenous peoples their rights to resources. Various recommendations have already been made in the different chapters. However, indigenous peoples and governments present at a local consultation to validate the preliminary report of this research have unanimously agreed on: The formation of an Inter-Ministerial Committee, or a body that has sufficient authority, at the state and national level to review the various policies and laws on natural resource management and indigenous peoples, with a view of streamlining such laws and policies to protect indigenous rights. The Committee is also expected to identify sections that should be amended and the obstacles to the implementation of such laws and policies. 48 References Anaya, James & Robert A.

Introduction This regional synthesis paper covers the natural resource management country studies conducted in Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Cambodia in 2005 and 2006. It will draw some key conclusions and recommendations and also make a comparison between the situations found in these studies. In the country studies, there are various terms use to refer to indigenous peoples. For example in Thailand, the term used is \"indigenous hill peoples\", while in Malaysia, they are referred as indigenous peoples or specifically Orang Asli for the indigenous groups in Peninsular Malaysia. With the exception of Bangladesh, the papers dedicated a chapter on the term(s) used in each country and the background and history of indigenous peoples. In this synthesis paper, the term \"indigenous people(s)\" will be used. 2. Indigenous Peoples and Natural Resource Management 2.1 Indigenous Peoples' Status Except for Malaysia, a common feature mentioned in all studies is the non-recognition by the state of indigenous peoples as distinct groups of peoples with their own distinct systems. Nevertheless, this does not indicate the absence of a concept of indigenous peoples, and the constitutions and laws of some of the countries do refer to, or have special provisions for, indigenous peoples. Table1: References on indigenous peoples in the Constitution/Laws References in the Constitution References in various Laws Cambodia No special provisions Land Law 2001 (indigenous community/communities), Forestry Law of 2002 (local communities) Malaysia Natives of Sabah and Sarawak, Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia Various laws in Sabah eg Land Ordinance, 1930; Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Enactment 2003; Forest Enactment, 1968 (Natives or Anak Negeri). Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 (Aborigine or Orang Asli) Thailand \"Traditional, local communities\" \"Hill tribe minorities\". Thailand National Forest Policy 1985 Bangladesh \"Backward Section of Citizens\" includes indigenous peoples HADC Act, 1989 (Tribe/Tribal); Act 12 of 1995 (Primitive Hill Dwellers) A common feature in all the countries studied, even where the status of indigenous peoples is recognized, is the policies of discrimination and exclusion of indigenous peoples in regards to land ownership and natural resource management. Even when there are historical facts showing indigenous peoples as rights- holders to particular resources, the governments still ignored these and continued to alienate land to companies and government agencies, and to resettle outsiders into indigenous peoples' lands. In a landmark court case by the Orang Asli in Peninsular Malaysia, the judges decided that the government has failed in it fiduciary duties to the Orang Asli. In Thailand, the enforcement of the 2 Citizenship Act and the fact that most indigenous people could not speak Thai at the time of the nationality surveys made it difficult to prove their origin even if they have been living in Thailand for hundreds of years. In Bangladesh, the government's population transfer programme of the 1980s on plain lands and gently sloping lands that were already occupied and owned by indigenous peoples on the basis of formal private titles or customary law resulted in violent land-grabbling, in which state security forces have been directly implicated. Large numbers of indigenous peoples were forced to seek shelter in the remoter hill and forest areas, themselves causing pressure on existing inhabitants of those areas and depleting the available resources. 2.2 Indigenous Resource Management System The studies noted that natural resources to indigenous peoples include land, forest, agricultural areas, and rivers and coastal areas, in which land is central and often understood to encompass all natural resources collectively. Traditional communities have a close relationship to land and resources and see themselves as part of the whole ecosystem. Natural resources are significant not only as a means of production but also as part of indigenous peoples' spiritual and cultural traditions, central to their identity as peoples.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11b73651-105b-4c5d-beef-e944e2ccfd8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "11b73651-105b-4c5d-beef-e944e2ccfd8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Regional Synthesis Paper", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ccb3269f15408ddffb13e7b16153beccb458afc48706fb8c6f1ecb4309e283a"}, "2": {"node_id": "32f90147-05ba-4dd1-a6a4-b9da5a81a324", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73661ae6cc546b84f9d0540be2a97b66198877416e0265a800a422244062c708"}}, "hash": "2d7d0bd0e2313489ee7a3f49752e741891f80f463f277c0115db5eef81cde5ac", "text": "Indigenous knowledge, innovations and practices on natural resource management are little understood by outsiders yet are highly complex systems, closely interlinked with other indigenous systems.

Indigenous peoples believe that the balance between the spiritual and physical realms will determine the condition of the universe and the immediate environment including that of the people. Indigenous resource management systems are closely linked with other indigenous social, cultural, spiritual, economic, governance, juridical, health, technological and learning systems. Examples provided in the studies include juridical systems with clear concepts and punishment such as that of the Brao community in Cambodia and the indigenous peoples of Sabah, Malaysia. Customary management of natural resources has been established for generations and unwritten laws are transmitted by parents or elders in the community. Institutional control over resources are still strong in traditional communities with traditional elders such as the mauza headman and village karbaries in Bangladesh, and those in Cambodia using customary laws and socialization of the whole community. All the studies cite non-recognition of indigenous resource management systems as a serious issue that stems from: i. lack of understanding by the state of indigenous resource management; ii. lack of recognition official of traditional administration; iii. conservation ideas which do not recognize other systems of resource management; particularly those which are considered 'non-scientific'; iv. the pursuit by states of profits, modernisation and a development paradigm that is in conflict with indigenous resource management - such development ideas have led to the alienation of the rich resources in indigenous territories from the traditional owners. The country studies also mentioned only a limited recognition of customary resource rights within the laws, and these will be discussed in more details in Chapter 4. 3 Table 2: Indigenous Resource Management System Cambodia Malaysia Thailand Bangladesh Land -Maintain clear territorial boundaries between community land - Sub-division of land into several individually managed plots - Rotating farm plots and maintaining evenly dispersed populations - Festivals, ceremonies are tied into agricultural cycles -Traditional ownership of a plot of land -confirmed by a headman and identifiable by the presence of certain signs for landownership - A practice of leaving the last fruits - chose their farming site carefully depending on the kind of cultivation - Use traditional knowledge on soil identification suitable for specific crops - Prevents exploitation of land beyond what it can sustain - leaving the land fallow for seven to ten years - Communal ownership of land - Clearing of land only done during dry season - Practice swidden cultivation - Able to retain their possession, and at least partial control, of their homesteads and farmlands - Subsistence- based agriculture Forests -Forest spirits are kept as protector -only old or knowledgeable herbalists, mostly women, are allowed to collect medicinal plants. - Many plants species are also protected based on similar belief to that of wild animals. - Ensure forest resources are not taken freely without permission of the owner - Ensure that forests are healthy and productive - Unnecessary cleaning and cutting of trees are prohibited - Identifying forest areas which are cultivable - Forests are categorized and differentiated depending on a number of factors Wildlife -Demarcate hunting areas -Certain breeding areas are not disturbed -Discourage over-hunting - Ensure wildlife continues to exist - Practice selective hunting - Demarcate community hunting areas and have community wildlife wardens - Believe there is an owner for each and every life form - Believe that wildlife and the forest environment are interdependent and related to each other - Conducts a ceremony before any hunting expedition 4 Rivers, Watershed and Aquatic Life - Only allow fishing methods that do not deplete fish resources - Outsiders are not allowed to fish - To ensure constant supply of fish, communities prohibit the cutting down of fruit trees that are known to be a good source of food for aquatic life. - Marking of a stretch of river as \"no fishing\" zone for a certain period of time (six months to a year) - Belief and taboos against disturbing any watershed area or springs. - Streams and other aquifers situated within the community- managed mauza reserve forests protected from bank erosion and siltation Traditional Medicines - Collected from forest areas that are conserved by communities for curing certain aliments - Believe medicinal plants have a spirit and that respect is necessary before taking any plants. -The concept of \"use and protect\" ensures plants and animals with medicinal properties are not over-harvested and practices such as taking only what is needed Seeds and Plants - An intricate system of seed sharing and exchange - An intricate system of seed sharing and exchange 5 3.

Natural resource management laws in Bangladesh and Malaysia appear to have common provisions and underlying concepts, perhaps derived from laws of British India. For example, forest laws and policies tend to reject community management of forests in favour of management through government bodies - namely, the Forest Department \u2013 which integrates policing and administrative functions. Land Laws incorporated customary laws but these are limited and often have inaccurate concepts of land ownership and management underpinning the relimited recognition provided. 3.1 Institutional Framework on Natural Resource Management Management of natural resources in the four countries is administered by the following: i. Government Departments or Agencies Natural resources are compartmentalized and are under the jurisdiction of specific government departments. Malaysia, as a federation of 13 states, has placed land and forest matters under states control, where the Federal Constitution accords them substantial powers over land use and natural resource management. Also, as every state is independent under the Constitution, federal legislation in most cases is not binding on the states, so the government departments managing natural resources are directly under the purview of the state. In the other countries, these departments are centralised and under the direct control of the central government. ii. District/Provincial Council/Body and Sub-district Council/Body The implementation and monitoring of natural resource management laws are decentralised to Councils/bodies at the district or provincial level, and subsequently to the sub-district level. For the CHT, the Hill District Council administration is rather pluralistic in that it includes traditional, bureaucratic and elective regional authorities with separate, and sometimes, concurrent, responsibilities. It is at the District or Sub-district level that indigenous peoples are more likely to influence decisions on natural resources. Illustration 1 \u2013 Tambon (sub-district) Administration In Thailand, the Constitution of 1997 heralded a significant benchmark towards a more inclusive participatory approach. Along with this, the Tambon Council, Tambon Authority Act and Decentralization Act, if implemented effectively and sincerely, has the potential not only to overhaul the bureaucratic set up of natural resource management but also the whole administrative structure. In Tambons, such as the Ban Luang Tambon Administrative Organisation, where there is a strong representation of indigenous communities, there are already signs of the local administration being more receptive to resource management initiative of indigenous peoples. Although community forests do not have a legal basis, authorities have informally started recognizing them, indicating a more open interpretation of laws. However at the time of publication the Constitution of 1997 has been overturned by the coup of 2006 and the new Constitution is being drafted. It is not clear what provisions for local participation will be retained in the new Constitution. 6 3.2 3.2 Summary of Laws and Policies on Natural Resource Management The laws and policies on natural resource management identified in the country studies are summarised in Table 3 with a brief indication of the gaps with respect to the provisions related to indigenous peoples. Other gaps not related to the implementation of the laws and policies follows in this chapter. \u2022 Inter-Departmental Coordination As a way to manage natural resources, all the countries involved in the study have compartmentalized natural resources, with laws governing the use and management of these resources. While this may provide focus to the specific department or unit charged with a certain resource, it could also prove to be a setback. As pointed out by these studies, the lack of inter-departmental coordination has only exacerbated problems and defeats the purpose of managing resources effectively. Illustration 2 \u2013 Sabah Wildlife and Sabah Foundation The Sabah Wildlife Department Pilot Project (Malaysia Country Report p:28 & 32) highlighted inter- departmental coordination as one of the major constraints in making the sustainable resource management in collaboration with local communities successful. It also highlights the hurdle for communities in exercising their rights to participate in natural resource management as stipulated in various enactments and policies such as the Forest Enactment and the Sustainable Forest Management System. In this case the Sabah Foundation, which was granted a 100-year term to manage a forest area sustainably, is not willing to recognize the Community Hunting Area identified by the Murut community in Inarad, as the Sabah Foundation plans to allow logging there. Community Hunting Areas are recognised under the Sabah Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997. There is an ongoing dialogue between the Sabah Wildlife Department, communities and relevant government agencies to make Sabah Foundation comply with their obligations under the Sustainable Forest Management System and for them to recognize", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e7a6180-49e1-4b70-8850-cf7175a99071": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e7a6180-49e1-4b70-8850-cf7175a99071", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Regional Synthesis Paper", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ec320b15c2c503fd90ae05c8fe6634000821bd46180776f5c41414ae7d2f7b9"}}, "hash": "0ec320b15c2c503fd90ae05c8fe6634000821bd46180776f5c41414ae7d2f7b9", "text": "the importance of involvement of local communities in natural resource management. \u2022 Non-conformity with National Constitutions In some cases, there appears to be non-conformity of some laws with the national constitution. In Thailand for example, although Article 46 states that \"Individuals who form into traditional, local communities have rights to preserve and revive their customs, local knowledge, arts or culture at the local and national levels; and to participate in the more balanced and sustainable management, maintenance, and utilization of natural resources and the environment. This would be in accord with the enacted law\", the laws on natural resource management that have been enacted do not have provisions for indigenous peoples to participate effectively in natural resource management nor are there provisions which respect indigenous peoples culture, particularly culture related to natural resource management. In Malaysia, the judge in a landmark case by the Orang Asli (Sagong Tasi v Kerajaan Negeri Selangor) ruled that relevant portions of the Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 \"had to be brought into conformity with the Constitution\". 7 \u2022 Negative Perceptions on Indigenous Peoples The Bangladesh study noted that historically, indigenous peoples have been systematically denied access to lands that were required by the empires, kingdoms or colonizers. The legacies of these past policies have continued in different forms up to the present day, particularly with regard to lands categorized as \u2018forests\u2019 or required for state forestry. In Thailand, indigenous peoples were initially excluded from getting titles over land on the basis that they were not Thai citizens when the Land Code came into being. More recently, exclusion from ownership rights is based on the watershed classification that designates most highland areas as off limits for any human activity. In Cambodia, challenges in developing partnerships and mutual learning are enormous as this goes against the history of relationships between indigenous peoples and outsiders. For indigenous groups, particularly in Northeast Cambodia, the slave trade, which continued over such a long period and with such intensity, was cultural rape. The disharmony continued with the relocation of Brao and Kavet people to lowland villages adjacent to the Sekong and Se San Rivers in the early 1960s in order to \u201ceducate\u201d and \u201cKhmerise\u201d them; then continuing with the draconian policies of the Khmer Rouge to make wet rice paddy rice cultivators out of swidden agriculture farmers, and finally with the policies of the Cambodia government to keep the people in the lowlands. encouraging reforestation and export of wood and wood products and community forestry such as reforestation on public land by private sector, tree planting on marginal agricultural land and establishment of forest woodlot for household consumption; encourage integrated wood use; amendment of forest laws; substituting fossil fuels with wood use through energy plantations; Illustration 3: Thailand National Forestry Policy (TNFP), 1985 This Policy contains discriminatory attitudes towards indigenous peoples. Among the key aims of the aims of the Policy are \u2026.\"to formulate guidelines to deal with forest degradation problems e.g. shifting agriculture, forest fires, forest clearing by the hill tribe minorities etc; incentive for reforestation by the private sector; and rural settlement planning to conform with national natural resources management and conservation plans.\" \u2022 Poor Implementation of Laws More progressive natural resource management laws have emerged in the last few years in Sabah, Malaysia and Cambodia, while the fate of the Community Forestry Bill in Thailand remains unclear. However for other laws which have been in existence for quite a while, the common complaint has been the poor implementation of laws that support the rights of indigenous peoples. In Bangladesh for example, the study found that most of the land reform laws have hardly been implemented due mainly to structural prejudices deeply ingrained in the society and reflected through all sorts of bad governance, vested interests, existing power structure, corruption etc. \u2022 Contentions over Sub-surface Resources Although not discuss in the country reports, contentions over sub-surface resources found in indigenous territories continue to be an issue. According to the laws of these countries, minerals rights fall under the control of the state. In Malaysia, state-federal conflicts have also ensued because mineral rights are directly under the Federal government. Apart from sub-surface resource, contention on resources above ground such as timber is also directly under the purview of state governments. 8 Table 3: Provisions and Gaps in NRM Laws and Policies Cambodia Title of Law/ Policy Subject Provision Gap Constitution of Cambodia 1993 Individual and collective ownership of property Article 44 \u201cAll persons, individually or collectively, shall have the right to ownership.

Interface between Indigenous & State Processes in Natural Resource Management 4.1 Indigenous Peoples and State Legal and Policy Framework on Natural Resource Management \u2022 State Natural Resource Management Framework Except in Thailand, legal provisions recognizing the ownership rights of indigenous peoples over their natural resources do exist, and there are many instances where customary processes are incorporated into the laws. However, these attempts to incorporate customary processes into legal provisions have shown either a sad lack of understanding by government staff or, in enforcing the laws, the stark difference between indigenous and non-indigenous insights has become apparent. The study in Sabah, Malaysia, noted the attempt to incorporate indigenous peoples' customary law on land ownership into Section 15 on Native Customary Rights (NCR) Land of the Sabah Land Ordinance 1930 showed lack of understanding of indigenous peoples' concepts of land and natural resource management, and resulted in misrepresentation of customary law. This has in turn resulted in gaps within the process of land delineation. Experiences in the titling of indigenous peoples' lands have also shown that the failure of the authorities to recognise indigenous resource management such as fallow periods in swidden agriculture cycle has delegitimised customary land ownership. In all the country studies, use rights in many cases may be granted but this right is not consistent and is often complicated by gaps in the laws. Communities candidly refer to this as the \"close one eye\" policy, indicating the fact that it is not an official policy of the government. The examples from Sabah, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Cambodia do acknowledge the limited legal recognition of use rights of natural resources", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75fafc68-6e50-450b-9b1a-4ec829f4cf72": {"__data__": {"id_": "75fafc68-6e50-450b-9b1a-4ec829f4cf72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Regional Synthesis Paper", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "378e1bb4a622be64a7ad8beda8cb264bdcbf3fd00da273636aac24825aaca7f0"}}, "hash": "378e1bb4a622be64a7ad8beda8cb264bdcbf3fd00da273636aac24825aaca7f0", "text": "for indigenous peoples. In Thailand, indigenous peoples' rights over natural resources have a long way to go. Illustration 4: Land Tenure and Use Rights in Thailand Much of the insecurity over land tenure, and the consequent impact this has on natural resource management, is centered on the manner in which the government has approached and viewed natural resources as the legitimate domain and subject of State policy-making without considering other right holders. The Thai government has been extremely inconsistent vis-\u00e0-vis its policies for natural resource management. Policies have been modified or changed radically to suit economic or political interests, especially when such policies intersect with indigenous peoples. For instance, while laws and policies on national parks and wildlife sanctuaries do not allow settlements or use of resources within its borders, which has resulted in relocation of indigenous peoples, tourism is widely promoted and infrastructure and private construction for tourism is allowed in national parks. Use-rights of resources within national reserve areas and wildlife sanctuaries are ambiguous and not clarified and give vast leverage to authorities to use the law at their convenience. Only where there is strong collective community initiative will this ambiguity allow indigenous communities to negotiate use rights with the local authorities. \u2022 Traditional Administrative System The recognition by the Cambodia Land Law of 2001 of traditional indigenous authority and customary law as a legal process in the determination of legal claims is very important. However, with the 18 introduction of the commune councils and the Commune Council Law, coupled with the tendencies by most governments to recognise leaders who are literate or support regulations that are in line with state laws and policies, it can be very easy to replace traditional authorities and customary laws. If this happens, it would pave the way for illegal land acquisition, land concentration and over-exploitation of resources that could result in serious conflicts within the community and with authorities. In Bangladesh, areas outside the reserved forests (\u201cmauza-circle\u201d lands) are administered by circle chiefs or rajas, and below them, the mauza headmen (mauza chiefs or heads). The headmen are responsible for resource management, land and revenue administration, maintenance of law and order, and administration of \u201ctribal\u201d justice. \u2022 Conflict in Development Paradigms As far as the State is concerned, natural resources seem to be mainly for acquisition and exploitation to finance infrastructure development and other expenditures of the state. There is no regard for indigenous peoples' own concepts of development, which are often considered unproductive, and therefore indigenous peoples' customary use of natural resources is not encouraged or developed. Policies on large- scale development through exploitation of natural resource management have resulted in either social exclusion or discrimination of indigenous peoples, or loss of cultures and way of life. The majority of indigenous peoples still live in rural areas, but increasingly they are migrating \u2013 either temporarily or permanently \u2013 to urban areas as livelihood deteriorates due to natural resources exploitation and insecure land tenure. Indigenous peoples are increasingly joining, or are forced to accept, mainstream development and commercialization. This poses a challenge to natural resource management especially in and around sensitive areas. Parks and other protected areas have also become important factors that have led to unresolved conflicts between the State and indigenous communities, due to loss of access to or restricted use of resources within these areas. In Thailand, the study concluded that laws drafted before the last decade expressly exclude the utilization of resources within national forest reserves and other protected areas. They criminalize activities of indigenous communities which they have traditionally carried out for their sustenance. Though there are thousands of communities managing and protecting their local forests, their activities are deemed illegal. Current laws and regulations prioritize the private sector and/or state activities in these lands. In Bangladesh and Cambodia, partnership between the government and foreign companies to exploit mineral and gas resources in indigenous lands occur with obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of affected communities and raise serious questions about environment destruction and threats to people's health. 19 4.2 Harnessing Indigenous Natural Resource Management - Incorporation vs Recognition of Customary Law and Processes The Bangladesh and Malaysia country studies note that recognition of indigenous resource management is being done by incorporating aspects of the traditional management system into state/national laws. However, such a strategy may not necessarily capture indigenous resource management concepts adequately. This will also not recognise customary law per se. In Cambodia, the Land Law 2001 recognises customary law but how this will be achieved in practice, remains to be seen.

Unfortunately, past efforts by the government to recognize customary law has often meant codification, which goes against the diverse customary laws of communities. The other weakness is the tendency to form committees to manage resources, taking away the control that was traditionally held by the community. Although such committees may in fact allow more participation, particularly from women and youth, it nevertheless means that already weakened traditional structures are further sidelined. In the long run, it will further dis- empower indigenous communities in their aspirations for self-determination and a pluralistic society. Perhaps rather than adapting indigenous institutions to a rigid structure with codified rules and regulations, statutory provisions should be flexible enough to accommodate the malleable nature of indigenous institutions. 4.3 Engaging Institutions - Cooperation between Donors, Government, NGOs and Community Organisations The studies showed varying experiences in engaging institutions are seen in the different countries. Generally NGOs that have good relations with government have facilitated engagement between communities and the relevant government departments, while the capacities of communities to engage directly with governments and donors are growing. Most positive is the case of Sabah, Malaysia where indigenous organisations have been able to directly contribute to the implementation of laws or enact new laws at the local level through close cooperation between donors, government, NGOs and the media. In Cambodia, donors and NGOs have been especially crucial in supporting indigenous peoples not only to link with government but also in the process of building community organizations since indigenous peoples are still unable to effectively engage with governments, local and international NGOs and UN agencies. Due to the unique political history of Cambodia over the past two decades, donors and UN agencies to a large extent played a very important role in shaping the laws and policies on natural resource management in Cambodia. NGOs in Thailand have been instrumental in positively or negatively shaping policies on natural resource management, depending on their perspective as seen in the development of Light Green and Dark Green NGOs (see also chapter 6.d). Donors have been instrumental in influencing the government to undertake programs and projects for highland development, with most projects having a strong component focus on a decentralized natural resource management model that seeks to ensure livelihood and socio-economic needs of affected groups. Community organizations have been active in negotiating with different players within the natural resource management setting in developing a people-centric approach toward natural resource management. They have been able to create cultural spaces to express indigenous traditional knowledge, concepts, and beliefs in the use and management of natural resources. Most importantly they 20 have been able to put into place, self-governing rules on natural resource management within communities. In the CHT, Bangladesh, pro-people NGO interventions are especially pertinent because of the disadvantaged situation of the region\u2019s population with regard to access to social extension services of the government. Organizations working to facilitate the spread of formal education, functional literacy, and vocational skill improvements, accelerating women's access to education and training opportunities, etc. are still very limited in the CHT. The study viewed the strong role NGOs play in natural resource management positively but stressed that it is important to maintain the requisite balance between inaction and overly active interventions that weaken local self-dependent efforts. However national NGOs, as in the case of government agencies, need to be sensitized prior to starting operations in indigenous-inhabited areas. 4.4 Mechanisms and Issues on Participation of Indigenous Peoples in Natural Resource Management In many instances, the talks of indigenous participation are mere lip service and often made to pacify communities and sadly, input on natural resource management is often ignored. The participation process through institutional reforms and capacity-raising initiatives noted in the Bangladesh study are similar to the other countries. This involves firstly the representation of indigenous peoples - both men and women - in decision-making, policy reviews and reforms and in legal and programme implementation. Secondly, is an adaptive approach to take the positive aspects of indigenous knowledge systems related to natural resource management. Another important mechanism is information dissemination, which has to address language and cultural barriers. A major challenge is encouraging government staff to spend more time in villages, to learn from local people and increase interactions with key elders in the communities. Submission of written comments on natural resource management by communities would be yet another mechanism for participation. Participation would of course be enriched if decision making with free, prior informed consent is recognized throughout the process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b453711c-3466-4640-87f8-d60e1b7cdbf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b453711c-3466-4640-87f8-d60e1b7cdbf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Regional Synthesis Paper", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d448da977cfa0f04f3ac35caf9062174d9777b077d12b578f941f7e079ce871"}}, "hash": "3d448da977cfa0f04f3ac35caf9062174d9777b077d12b578f941f7e079ce871", "text": "5. Gender and Natural Resource Management In most countries, and noted particularly in the Bangladesh study, laws and constitutions in all countries prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex but this is not reflected in the government's natural resource management policies. Women\u2019s primary responsibilities, such as cooking, fetching water and gathering firewood, are directly related to the use and management of natural resources. Although generally women are part of the work allocation and labour responsibilities in cultivation, the ability of women in plant and seed conservation and experimentation means they have a crucial in preserving the diversity of traditional medicines and food sources and natural resource management in general. Women suffer numerous hardships when ecological degradation occurs in forests and other common pool resources, making it difficult for them to go about their traditional activities such as the preparation of food, medicines and making handicrafts. Women also feel more burdened with the responsibility of looking for scarce income-generating alternatives, especially if they are denied access to natural resources for food, water and firewood. The degradation of natural forests results not only in the extinction of many 21 plants, economic well-being and health of the family and society but also but indigenous women\u2019s knowledge systems. Gender roles within indigenous communities are changing continually as a result of state policies. Thus, it is necessary that any policy formulation on natural resource management takes gender equations into account. There is a need to acknowledge the specific needs, perspectives, and roles of women in natural resource management. Illustration 5: Indigenous Women in Bangladesh Indigenous women of Bangladesh are traditionally regarded as occupying a lower social standing than men. The indigenous women\u2019s status is low in terms of the right to inheritance, legal and political rights, decision-making powers and in other spheres. One of the most acute problems faced by indigenous women is the denial of their access to customary owned land. This is added to the gender-based discrimination faced by them in other ways. Land scarcity among indigenous communities generally affects women more adversely than indigenous men. The inheritance laws of most indigenous peoples, including the most numerous groups such as the Chakma and the Santal, tend to be discriminatory against women. The notable exceptions are in the case of the Khasi in greater Sylhet and the Mandi or Garo in the plains, and to a lesser extent, the Marma in the southern Chittagong Hill Tracts. Apart from the above exceptions, the common trend of the indigenous communities is that only sons inherit landed property. The denial of indigenous women\u2019s substantive participation in the political spheres further reinforces their low status in society and they remain substantively invisible in the eyes of the policy makers. 6. Challenges and Drawbacks The country studies cited very specific challenges and drawbacks related to the promotion and recognition of indigenous peoples' rights and participation in natural resource management. A list of these challenges and drawbacks are made below, with some brief explanation on some points. Details can be garnered from the individual studies. a. Citizenship Rights The denial of citizenship to a high number of indigenous peoples in Thailand has compounded land tenure insecurity and has directly affected natural resource management. The possession of citizenship documents is essential to accessing any facilities or services, and to prove rights over land and natural resources. b. Donors' Policy on Indigenous Peoples It is important to ensure that in bilateral aid, the donor adheres to their policy on indigenous peoples that is based on accepted international human rights standards, and to apply this policy to help raise awareness of the departments being aided. c. Obtaining Free, Prior Informed Consent Sufficient time must be set aside to ensure indigenous communities understand the issues at hand and that NGO\u2019s working with indigenous peoples should be able to provide sufficient information for the communities to make informed decisions. Free, prior and informed consent also means that communities have the right to say no to a proposed development initiative. 22 d. Competing Discourse on Natural Resource Management In Thailand, the conflict in ideological discourse between different NGO camps - the Dark Green and Light Green camps - also impacts on indigenous peoples and natural resource management. Dark Green NGOs whose concept of nature is associated with an idealistic self-contradictory notion of \u201cundisturbed\u201d nature have been quite successful in blocking promising initiatives such as the Community Forest Bill because of middle class support and elite representation. The opposing discourses are not as simple as a disagreement in approach towards natural resource management but also power relations, class equations and social structuring.

Misused/Misinterpreted Community consultations Hiring of consultants, especially those dealing with communities, should take careful consideration to ensure that the person is willing to listen to other perspectives, especially community perspectives. Consultation and meaningful participation are often viewed as interchangeable by governments and donors, yet they are two very different processes. This needs to be clearly acknowledged, and meaningful participation should be the goal for all communities in an area of influence of a given development initiative. f. Enhancing Capacity of Indigenous Communities The study in Cambodia explicitly mentions the need to enhance the capacity of indigenous institutions and other support institutions for indigenous peoples. It seems that many groups of indigenous peoples are not aware of the legal statutes that exist to protect their rights. Further, they do not find institutional channels to actualise their demand for the enforcement of those rights. g. Non-Recognition of Indigenous Natural Resource Management System h.

Conclusions and Recommendations 7.1 General Recommendations This chapter will deal mostly with the recommendations made in the country studies but will also include recommendations from the author with the aim of making these recommendations more coherent. 7.1.1 Comprehensive Legal or Policy Review 7.1.1.1 Legal and Policy Review and Reforms The studies recommended for a comprehensive review of laws and policies regarding lands and other natural resource management and identify the reforms needed. Although the research and the consultations identified the laws and policies that relates to indigenous peoples and pointed out gaps, they could not delve in the necessary level of detail. This would have to be conducted in each country in a manner where indigenous peoples and other actors including human right workers, development planners and social scientists, can contribute effectively. Legal and policy reforms should then follow such a comprehensive review. In any such reforms, the importance of indigenous resource management processes need to be acknowledged as far they are appropriate to the socio-economic and cultural needs of indigenous peoples today. Policy reforms also need to be cautious to incorporate representation on the basis of ethnicity, class and gender. 7.1.1 Natural Resource Management Laws and Policies to be brought into conformity with the Constitution Where provisions for the recognition of and protecting indigenous rights are specified in the Constitution, the highest authority in any country, natural resource management laws and policies that are contrary should be brought into conformity with the Constitution. 7.1.1.3 Enactment of Laws on Natural Resource Management Where necessary laws on natural resource management do not yet exist, but where the needs are expressed by indigenous peoples, enactment of new laws would be needed. These laws should be in line with existing and emerging international instruments that recognises the rights of indigenous peoples. 7.1.1.4 Implementing Policies The Bangladesh study provided some clear recommendations on implementation of policies that can cover other countries and are also mentioned in other recommendations. It recommends the development of detailed administrative guidelines, particularly in situations where government officials lack of knowledge on indigenous culture, and where discriminotory attitudes exist among non-indigenous officials in government positions. These could include: a. Increasing indigenous representation in key decision-making bureaucratic positions; b. Disseminating information to indigenous peoples regarding their rights; c. Providing greater access to information on indigenous peoples, their languge, culture, economic systems and cutivation patterns, etc. to educational institutions, training academics of government functionaries and NGOs; 24 d. Supplementing existing policies with indigenous-focused administrative guidelines and express references to customary laws and practices; e. Accepting the plurality of indigenous peoples\u2019 situations. It is vital for the interest of the indigenous peoples themselves that these differences are understood prior to designing and implementing major development interventions; f. Following the principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) before any major decision- making involving the rights and welfare of the indigenous peoples; g. Acknowledging indigenous technology and innovations as rational and scientific (such as practiced in agriculture, forestry, watershed management, etc), in line with Agenda 21 (Chapter 26) and the Convention on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2e3270f-6340-4ff8-90a8-02863bf144d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2e3270f-6340-4ff8-90a8-02863bf144d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Regional Synthesis Paper", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ad433148aa6b017ce4b9d8acd9c2fb51d0aaf64b8db70f4b9e423e4ad1d3d66"}}, "hash": "3ad433148aa6b017ce4b9d8acd9c2fb51d0aaf64b8db70f4b9e423e4ad1d3d66", "text": "Biologial Diversity and related processes; h. Developing policies to redistribute state-appropriated common forest lands to indigenous communities conditional upon their sustainable use; i. Involving indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent communities in collaborative management of state\u2013managed forests and to share the resources of such forests in an equitable and parctiable manner; j. Taking effective measures for the practice of autonomy or self-government to indigenous peoples, especially in relation to development issues, policies and programmes. 7.1.2 Recognition of Indigenous Peoples 7.1.2.1 Acknowledgement of Customary Resource Rights Existing laws on natural resource management, where gaps exists, have to include provisions on the recognition of customary rights to land, and in particular the settlement of claims by getting the consent of prior or existing settlers. As illustrated in the Sabah Land Ordinance however, the interpretation of rightful occupation does not coincide with indigenous peoples' concept and customary law on land ownership. This also implies the recognition of collective customary resource rights for indigenous peoples that could preserve collective identity. Collective customary resource rights would include a community's access to, and control over, lands and resources, and also participation in, and control over, decision- making. The study in Bangladesh, in recommending acknowledgement of customary resource rights, noted that this provision could be far more equitable towards indigenous communities, and far more likely to result in successful promoting of state-indigenous forestry, than the over-centralized and bureaucratized system currently practiced by the Forest Department. 7.1.2.2 Recognition of Traditional Administration In Cambodia where traditional authority is recognized in land claims, measures should be taken to ensure that these are implemented. In other countries like Sabah, Malaysia and Bangladesh, though this is not provided for in the law, it has been a practice to involve traditional headmen in validating land claims. Newer village administrative institutions like the Commune Councils in Cambodia, the 25 JKKK in Malaysia should not replace the traditional authority. In fact efforts to assist traditional authorities such as keeping ethnographic records and resource maps should be provided by the State. Traditional authorities can also be given training to help resolve natural resource conflicts. 7.1.2.3 Revitalisation of Indigenous Resource Management System Natural resources are viewed by some indigenous communities as individual property rather than a collective resource, creating competition that leads to unsustainable resource utilization. The challenge of re-establishing communal responsibility and to revitalize indigenous resource management system so that resources could be utilised in a sustainable manner for the wellbeing of the community first need to be realised and efforts towards this end by the community themselves be given support by donors, government and NGOs. Recognition and revitalisation of traditional governance and administrative system, and indigenous development concepts will go hand-in-hand with these efforts. In many communities and at the regional level through regional organisation such as the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact Foundation, ongoing community reflections and exchanges to revitalise indigenous resource management and indigenous development concept have already started. 7.1.2.4 Harnessing Indigenous Natural Resource Management If poverty reduction is to be effective, indigenous peoples' customary use of natural resources in their territories needs to be harnessed with conservation strategies. The challenge is to use a combination of effective joint management strategies and recognition of the rights of communities over their resources. Strengthening indigenous management systems is also the best way to reduce tension between state and customary systems, and create synergy. A management plan that outlines benefits and responsibilities for both government and indigenous peoples to ensure indigenous culture is protected, sustainable incomes from the natural resources is assured, and wildlife and biodiversity is conserved. Collaborative management efforts in protected areas need to be supported and appropriate legislation amended to ensure participation is legally recognized within collaborative management structures. Indigenous peoples\u2019 detailed knowledge can be used in community mapping to identify important cultural sites, terrestrial habitats and place names in their traditional territories, etc. Traditional resource management systems and the traditional legal systems of indigenous peoples or vice-versa, can also be integrated with other resource management systems. And in remote areas, this traditional legal system could continue to be used to resolve their conflicts. Active engagement of communities themselves in these efforts needs to be taken and not merely lip service on the side of authorities. 7.1.3 Participation of Indigenous Peoples in Legal and Policy Formulation Participation of indigenous peoples in legal and policy formulation maybe accepted and oft- mentioned by policy makers themselves, but perceptions on the process may differ. Effective participation would imply not only accepting opinions of indigenous peoples, but also involvement in decision-making in the whole processes of legal and policy formulation. This also implies empowerment of indigenous organizations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abdf1762-b656-4422-8d26-0a430f686236": {"__data__": {"id_": "abdf1762-b656-4422-8d26-0a430f686236", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Regional Synthesis Paper", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe9bf8a28e7277dee3775adb7c03a4df5862e7034105b79ed22a9ab999c6514f"}}, "hash": "fe9bf8a28e7277dee3775adb7c03a4df5862e7034105b79ed22a9ab999c6514f", "text": "and communities. 7.1.4 Provisions and Mechanism for Obtaining Consent Free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) was quoted by all the studies as a prerequisite for sustainable and acceptable natural resource management. As such, legal and policy provisions for FPIC need to 26 be ensured, as well as the mechanism for obtaining such consent, developed. At the international level, guidelines and principles for FPIC already exist and this can be used to develop such provisions and mechanism. 7.1.5 Removing Discriminatory Attitudes Discrimination against indigenous peoples is noted in all the studies. Recommendations made to remove these include acknowledging the indigenous peoples\u2019 contributions towards the country\u2019s political, social, economic and cultural integrity and its development process. This includes in the official versions of the national histories and in other national discourses and public information systems; providing exposure on indigenous culture, history, life style, etc to government functionaries having major responsibilities on indigenous issues; and to use state-sponsored media and encouraging the private media to help dispel these attitudes. 7.1.6 Promoting Gender and Equity in Natural Resource Management As pointed out earlier, there is a need to acknowledge the specific needs, perspectives, and roles of women in natural resource management. Women's active participation in decision-making and the equitable sharing of benefits between men and women is crucial for ensuring long term sustainability of natural resource management. The recommendations elaborated by the Bangladesh report are also relevant for the other countries in that bringing about gender equity in natural resource management would need committed support from other actors, including political, social and community leaders, local NGOs and national NGOs due to longstanding gender-insensitive practices based on customary beliefs, religious and social conservatism, or otherwise, but it is a matter that requires consistent and urgent attention. Policies on women that are generally aimed at the addressing discrimination faced by other women may not be appropriate, so it is important to ensure that laws and policies are made appropriate for preventing discrimination against indigenous women. Other important interventions would include addressing the human rights issues of indigenous women who are under-represented in political bodies and local government units; the lack of funds necessary for mobilization women; and need to raise awareness about the negatively discriminatory inheritance laws towards women. 7.1.7 Enhancing Capacities of Indigenous Peoples, Traditional Leaders , NGOs Support for indigenous initiatives on community organising and leaders training programmes where indigenous organisations and traditional leaders themselves raise their capacities are crucial in this respect. However, where NGOs are willing to assist in the enhancement of capacities of indigenous communities, resources and support to NGOs and support groups in a manner that is sensitive to communities should be provided. Capacity enhancement through building of community organizations should also recognise that these take much effort, resources and long-term partnerships. 27 7.1.8 Research and Information Dissemination There are also many institutions that involve government, local and international NGO\u2019s and UN agencies that have developed tools and models of participatory action research on natural resource management. Several good examples exist in Cambodia of research work with indigenous communities that can be used as models elsewhere in the region. The challenge of inaccessibility and remoteness of some indigenous villages need to be taken into account in the dissemination of information. Producing information that is easily understood also pose a challenge. In Cambodia, there are many indigenous peoples who did not have access to formal schooling, thus creative and popular ways of conveying information are important such as radio programmes, audio-visuals need to be developed. 7.1.9 Advocacy at National and International Level Where serious conflicts on land and natural resource management exist, the studies recommended the development of effective strategies and tools for advocacy both at the national and international levels. National level advocacy programmes would focus on the implementation of Agreements (the CHT Accord in the case of Bangladesh), Constitutional provisions and the recommendations made in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and other relevant strategy documents. Strengthening the capacity of both informal (traditional leaders and other community level organizations) and formal institutions on customary laws and practices would enhance advocacy goals. International advocacy should aim to make effective use of the international intergovernmental processes, including the mechanisms of the UN human rights treaty bodies, the Human Rights Council, and the offices of Special UN Rapporteurs. In particular, these should refer to international customary laws and international treaties ratified by governments. Strengthening of existing national, regional and international networks, and creation of further networks would further enhance progress in this regard. Given the situation of extreme political, social and economic disadvantage suffered by most indigenous peoples, this needs", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3545c294-46a6-4f1d-8740-c3f71587a354": {"__data__": {"id_": "3545c294-46a6-4f1d-8740-c3f71587a354", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Regional Synthesis Paper", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-regional-synthesis-paper", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbc28b5078c02aa235aeedf6365002860888b07d4e865ac54594d986d2d488a4"}}, "hash": "dbc28b5078c02aa235aeedf6365002860888b07d4e865ac54594d986d2d488a4", "text": "to be an integral strategy perspective for quite some time in the foreseeable future. 7.2 Specific Recommendations Some specific recommendations made in each country studies are: a. Inter-Ministerial Committee (Malaysia) In Malaysia, the national consultation on the research recommended the formation of an Inter- Ministerial Committee, or a body that has sufficient authority, at the state and national level to review the various policies and laws on natural resource management and indigenous peoples, with a view of streamlining such laws and policies to protect indigenous rights. The Committee is also expected to identify sections that should be amended and the obstacles to the implementation of such laws and policies. b. Policy for Highland Peoples' Development (Cambodia) 28 In Cambodia, the adoption of the Policy for Highland Peoples' Development was specifically mentioned c. Implementation of the CHT Accord of 1997 (Bangladesh) In Bangladesh the CHT Regional Council Act of 1998 obliges the government to consult the CHT Regional Council prior to the passage of any new laws on the hill region. d. Democratization and Decentralization (Thailand) Democratization and decentralization, emphasizing on indigenous participation are identified as key processes in Thailand. The study noted that lack of indigenous participation in natural resources management in Thailand stymied most of the policies and laws before they were even implemented. Involvement of indigenous peoples as the right holders would therefore ensure a sense of ownership and the successful implementation of laws and policies. e. Land Demarcation (Cambodia) The lands of indigenous peoples, as a vital part of their lives and cultures, must be clearly demarcated. Some specific issues on the process are noted in the box below: Cambodia: Considerations on Land Demarcation There are some serious issues of sequencing and policy process to be considered. 1. Definition, identification and agreement of what constitutes state public property \u2013 this requires a set of subsidiary processes to clarify what can sit within this overall category 2. Definition, identification on the ground of lands of indigenous communities 3. Definition, identification on the ground of those core areas of forests that should be retained under a protected area system and areas of high environmental service function (e.g. watersheds) 4. Definition identification on the ground of those areas of forest that could be managed under some form of production (the actual institutional arrangements to be determined \u2013 e.g. groups (communities, communes), small-scale \u2018industrial\u2019 forests, concessions, direct management by the public sector) 5. Definition, identification on the ground those areas that are available for agriculture (the actual institutional arrangements to be determined \u2013 family farms, small scale \u2018industrial\u2019 farms, large-scale concession agriculture) 29", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34baef88-1167-4537-850c-a99d2f053d89": {"__data__": {"id_": "34baef88-1167-4537-850c-a99d2f053d89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d359099f8177c32a5ab6eb4d09347bd7ad7f560f06c798c2ecfa9dcc8679f06"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f1b7a3e-c39b-42aa-9ef8-6a1caee8ba07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7741f2d6c8a25b418899be0957d53da49eafef7f0bfd6a46ce2e0af53754236a"}}, "hash": "bbfa683ba62a49e2f669266b6a0f61772b61e2a7908fb7ee8d1c3b0a89d7aab3", "text": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies Thailand United Nations Development Programme Regional Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Programme Regional Centre in Bangkok Jannie Lasimbang & Chingya Luithui UNDP- RIPP Natural Resource Management Country Studies ______________ Thailand Report Prepared by: Chingya Luithui Jannie Lasimbang Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact Foundation i Contents 1.

Indigenous Peoples of Thailand 1.1 Introduction Thailand is home to various populations \u201ccharacterized by diversity of indigenous1 and tribal peoples, with large numbers of peoples of different cultural beliefs and histories residing within its geographical borders.\u201d2 They are concentrated in around 20 provinces in the Upper and Lower North and the Western region of Thailand, a mainly mountainous area. However, official recognition has been granted to only 10 ethnic groups; namely, the Karen, Hmong, Lahu, Iu Mien (Yao), Lisu, Akha, Lua (Lawa), H\u2019tin (Kachin), Khamu, and Mlabri, despite there being many more.3 They are officially designated by the Thai government as \u2018Chao Khao\u2019 which means \u2018hill tribes\u2019 or \u2018people of the hills\u2019. Aside from these groups, the \u2018Chao Thale\u2019 or the \u2018sea gypsies/people of the sea\u2019 are usually considered Thailand\u2019s indigenous peoples.4 \u201cSome of them, like the Lawa, H\u2019tin, Mlabri and most probably the Karen, have been living in areas now part of the Thai nation state before the Thai speaking ethnic groups immigrated at the beginning of the second millennium.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f1b7a3e-c39b-42aa-9ef8-6a1caee8ba07": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f1b7a3e-c39b-42aa-9ef8-6a1caee8ba07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d359099f8177c32a5ab6eb4d09347bd7ad7f560f06c798c2ecfa9dcc8679f06"}, "2": {"node_id": "34baef88-1167-4537-850c-a99d2f053d89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbfa683ba62a49e2f669266b6a0f61772b61e2a7908fb7ee8d1c3b0a89d7aab3"}}, "hash": "7741f2d6c8a25b418899be0957d53da49eafef7f0bfd6a46ce2e0af53754236a", "text": "Others, like the Hmong, Yao and Lahu immigrated since the middle of the 19th century into present day Thailand or in the beginning of the 20th century like the Lisu and Akha.\u201d5 A 2002 survey quoted a population of 1,203,149, with around 164,413 households in 3,429 villages.6 Far from the stereotype of homogeneity ascribed to these groups, they are highly heterogeneous. These indigenous hill peoples have their own cultures, languages, customs, modes of dressing and belief systems which are distinct from the majority Thai lowland settlers.7 They have systems of natural resource management that are \u201ccentered on traditional knowledge which they have developed, tested and passed down from generation to generation for hundred of years\u201d.8 There are many customs and mores to govern the practices of natural resource management within these communities. Often these governing rules are, however, not known and comprehended by the authorities and the public.9 The hill tribes are not recognized as distinct in terms of their indigenousness.10 In a 1992 submission to the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Thai government stated, \u201cone of the great sources of pride of the Thai people is their rich and diverse ethnic and cultural heritage. The hill-tribes of Thailand and their distinct lifestyles are part of this colourful heritage. These tribes are among the many ethnic groups that constitute Thai society. They are not considered to be minorities or indigenous peoples but as Thais who are able to enjoy fundamental rights and are protected by the laws of the Kingdom as any other Thai 1 The term \u201cindigenous\u201d as used in this paper exclude the majority Thai population, the Muslim Chams of Southern Thailand and the Chinese.

For instance, the Karen, Lawa, H\u2019tin, Khamu etc are said to live in altitudes between 400 \u2013 1000m above sea level; the Hmong, Iu Mien, Lahu, Lisu and Akha in the higher reaches above 1000m.13 Moreover, altitude of settlement is linked to agricultural systems used and development Groups living at the lower altitudes traditionally planted rice in sedentary forms of rotational swidden systems, sometimes in combination with paddy fields, while those living at higher altitudes practiced swidden cultivation with long cultivation and long fallow periods. However these bases of differentiation are becoming archaic. For one, because of state intervention and international development influences, agricultural practices have changed radically; and settlement patterns of these groups have undergone many changes. Those \u201ctraditionally\u201d found in higher uplands can be now found in lower uplands and valleys. 1.2 \u2018Chao Khao\u2019 or \u2018Hill Tribes\u2019 The term \u201chill tribes\u201d was used as a generic term for the various non-Thai groups living in the uplands of northern and western Thailand in the late 1950s. The term \u201cis related to the term chao pha (forest people) which was frequently used to denote these non-Thai minority groups before the term chao khao came into use. Among the various ethnic Thai groups of Southeast Asia, pha \u2013 referring to \u201cforest\u201d, \u201cwild\u201d, \u201csavage\u201d \u2013 is generally conceived as opposite to muang \u2013 referring to \u201ccivility\u201d or the \u201chuman domain\u201d. Frequently, the pole of \u201ccivility\u201d was identified with dominant ethnic Thai groups, while the \u201cforest/wilderness\u201d pole was related to marginal ethnic minority groups at the edge of the Thai polities.\u201d14 During the 19th century, these \u201cforest peoples\u201d played an important role in the economy of Thailand by facilitating access to forest products aimed for the Asian market. However, with the growth of large trading with European markets where Thais supplied goods such as rice and teak, the economic importance of these peoples decreased. With this decreasing economic importance also came shifts in approach toward these peoples. The ruling elites then \u201cperceived them as unsuitable for modernization and to be left on their own. It was not before the middle of the 20th century when the state, in the name of modernization, national security, and \u2018international\u2019 anti-communism expanded into the peripheral forest and mountain areas, that the chao pha re-emerged in national politics as the troublesome chao khao or \u2018hill tribes\u2019.\u201d15 The framing of the new social category chao khao was part of the nation building process in which, in the first half of the 20th century, national identity and definition of \u2018Thai-ness\u2019 was linked to cultural traits, particularly Buddhism, language, and monarchy.16 As a result, these groups were not integrated into the Thai administrative system. Other important factors within these developments were the efforts to eradicate the opium trade and to control the communist insurgency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a56bf1a2-9d1b-4ed7-bc03-36a486dbf57a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a56bf1a2-9d1b-4ed7-bc03-36a486dbf57a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "783b031eda1ce16bfbe3b513226bc463d636de308b1c8b38992ed09d529520f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "7323ba68-24f8-43f0-8f2b-375574f2a341", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8110f804ce61bdd2d9786b6fa66a9c39576c5d1bd6a6396930f55bdd177731e1"}}, "hash": "67a551788463facc650b924fd21fd22a423dc8a01c964c5ca846dd4a1bd0684e", "text": "Opium was an important source of income for the state during the 19th century and the first part of 20th century.

As a result, it became more important to establish stronger state control over the upland regions of the north.17 Consequently the Central Hill Tribe Committee (CHTC) of Thailand was established in 1959, and a national policy towards the \u201chill tribes\u201d was formulated for the first time. The objectives of the policy were \u201cnational security,\u201d reflecting fears that communist influences may spread among the ethnic groups of the uplands, control and substitution of opium cultivation, as well as the abolition of shifting cultivation, which in the international development community had been perceived as destructive, a threat to forest resources, and a hindrance to development.18 \u201cVery soon the term was identified with a negative stereotype of forest destroying, opium cultivating, dangerous foreign troublemakers. Originally this image was mainly derived from the Hmong19 as their swidden cultivation systems frequently included opium cultivation, and some of them were involved in the communist insurgencies of the 1960s. It was soon branded on all the different groups categorized as \u201chill tribes\u201d.\u201d20 The creation of this category of people had major political connotations. Their traditional areas were territorially included within the Thai nation state but were culturally excluded as \u201cothers within\u201d.21 One of the most prominent manifestations of this stereotype of the \u201cothers\u201d is the denial of citizenship to a large number of indigenous peoples in Thailand. This social category of the chao khao came to be defined as being non-Thai, underdeveloped and environmentally destructive and problematic. The result was the implementation of national policies to solve the \u201chill tribes\u201d problem. Public perception of the marginalized hill tribes was strongly influenced by all these which in turn reinforced official policies against the hill tribes. Since then, these stereotypes of hill peoples have remained widespread. They have been revived and exploited in the community forest debate and resource conflicts of the 1990s. It was perceived that the \u201chill tribes\u201d have, due to their place of residence and their way of life, excluded themselves from the Thai nation, even worse, are threatening the welfare of the country by destroying its forests.22 Because of these negative stereotypes, a number of indigenous activists in Thailand do not like the term \u2018chao khao\u2019 and its literal translation of \u2018hill tribes\u2019 and a range of terms such as chao thai phu khao \u2018Thai mountain peoples\u2019 and chon pao puen muang \u2018indigenous tribes\u2019 have been used. For political correctness, the term \u2018hill peoples\u2019 has been introduced as the dominant English term.23 1.3 A Brief Historical Look at Approaches toward Indigenous Peoples of Thailand Much of the available literature on the history of Thai government policies affecting indigenous hill peoples report the 50s as the period when \u201cproblems\u201d regarding indigenous hill people were first identified. For instance, Hengsuwan states, \u201cThai government first acknowledged and started setting policies to problems related to highlanders in the late 1950s\u201d.24 While it may be true that policies relating directly and specifically to indigenous hill peoples began to be pursued in the 50s, other laws were already in existence which had an effect on them. Forest laws were enacted before the 1950s which 17 Djedje R.S., & Korff, R. (2003). p 6 18 Sumarlan, Yanuar.

For a brief discussion on the causes behind Hmongs joining the Communist insurgency in the 50s and 60s and its implications, see Lee, Gary Y.

However, \u201cthe earliest policy affecting hill tribes is the first Nationality Act of 1913, which granted Thai citizenship based on bloodline (Thai father) and territorial basis (born in Thailand), thus replacing previous customary laws.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b87eb1f3-f056-49f7-945c-6089f310cd58": {"__data__": {"id_": "b87eb1f3-f056-49f7-945c-6089f310cd58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3d76b23d6fe5a58ef7aa78737e5c8ba742750bfb815f5020aee556c829c5178"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b3ac249-803d-4f08-bd90-87151a2e3015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99263cd07d1191f9ff8da03b36b78c7474ec098caf15c3845543d499be405c0f"}}, "hash": "a20f267fc926fb7c4b2bb1d44e314bcf02c598ff61e550fe1ed92f10fe7ae893", "text": "A first national census in 1956 failed to include hill tribes and thereby excluded them from Thai nationality, which remained so till 1965 thereby setting them apart very early on.\u201d25 Despite the long-term impacts of the negligence in the implementation of the early nationalization policies, most authors agree that the creation of the Central Hill Tribe Committee (CHTC) was a pioneering point in the approach of the Thai government toward indigenous hill peoples.

The settlements were established in four areas: Tak, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Phetchabun provinces.\u201d26 However several obstacles and difficulties were encountered as a result of which the resettlement project was shelved. This was followed by the commissioning of a study in 1961-62, supported by the UN Narcotic Drugs Division, on the various indigenous groups in the uplands. It led to the establishment in 1963 of mobile units called Hill tribe Development and Welfare Centers to look after the \u2018hill tribe\u2019 groups, as well as the setting up of the Tribal Research Centre in Chiang Mai in 1964.27 Because of the link that was seen between hill tribes, opium cultivation and communist insurgency, \u201c\u2018hill tribe\u2019 policies, from the middle of the 1960s to the middle of the 1970s, were under the primacy of \u2018national security\u2019 concerns, and in the \u2018battle zones\u2019 the military became responsible for the ethnic minority groups.\u201d28 The attempt of the Thai government to eliminate opium-poppy (Papaver somniferum) cultivation by outlawing it in 1959 became the key factor that triggered highland development.29 The First National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP) of Thailand was drawn up for implementation in 1961-66. This plan included a section which aimed at preventing forest and watershed destruction; ending opium cultivation; bringing socioeconomic development of the hill tribes; and instilling a feeling of loyalty to Thailand among the hill tribes. Besides building schools in some areas where hill tribes resided, the implementation of some minor development projects and the establishment of the Tribal Research Center, the plan could not be implemented comprehensively.30 The policy toward the hill tribes were reformulated in 1968 aimed at concentrating scattered settlements, resettlement to the lowlands, as well as the creation of confidence and the assimilation into Thai society to secure loyalty toward the state.31 For the most part, until the 1980s, no major changes in government policies toward the hill tribes took place.32 25 Puginier, Oliver.

Individuals without citizenship or other formal legal status face numerous obstacles in everyday life. They are not able to access government services in health, education, exercise their political rights and enjoy basic rights such as the right to unrestricted travel. The implications of this with regard to natural resource management are numerous. Consistent management of resources is not possible as people without citizenship do not have the legal right to remain in their areas of settlement, whether they have been there for generations or not.34 There are many documented cases of people pushed and trafficked into underground economy such as sex-work among indigenous women and children, resulting in high cases of sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS which in turn extracts a high price on already stretched resources. Consequently, obtaining Thai citizenship has become a key priority for indigenous peoples in Thailand. The first population census was conducted in 1956 according to the National Household Registration Act. However, indigenous peoples were not covered due to the lack of access to their villages, lack of officers and prejudices. An official survey on the hill tribes was conducted in 1969-70 covering 16 provinces of Northern Thailand and an estimated 111,591 people were officially recorded. However, the enforcement of the Citizenship Act had already made most hill-tribes aliens. The fact that most indigenous peoples could not speak Thai made it difficult to prove their origin even if they have been living in Thailand for hundreds of years.35 The Nationality Act of 1965 granted Thai citizenship to people belonging to ethnic minority groups who were born in the kingdom providing both of their parents were Thai nationals.36 These limits on citizenship qualifications slowed or impeded citizenship approval for many ethnic minority persons.

The distinction between refugees or those who entered Thailand after 1975 and who are thus not entitled to citizenship remains in effect.38 Government officials have been accused of disinterest in effectively implementing policies that would recognize citizenship of indigenous peoples. One oft cited reason by officials is the influx of immigrants and refugees from neighbouring countries, especially Burma, which has caused officials to be more restrictive in granting citizenship. This has resulted in people with legitimate claims facing a long and tedious application process to obtain citizenship. District officials who are required to cooperate are also often not too willing to go into the interior mountain and therefore neglect such areas. Another reason is the corruption associated with the process. 33 Siriphongwanit, Anuphong & Leake, Helen. 34 Jantakad, Prasong, & Gilmour, Don.(1999).

However there are phrases that describe the concept of natural resources. For instance, the Karen phrase ta ba-ter often used to describe naturally occurring things, means \u2018that which has arisen by itself.\u2019 Another phrase used to describe naturally occurring things is ta ler aku taw kawae which means \u2018things arising spontaneously\u2019. Similar to the Karen, the Hmong has the term ib txwm ntuj tsim teb rau meaning \u2018things that arise by themselves naturally\u2019. The prefix \u2018ta\u2019 used by the Karen has the simple meaning of \u2018thing\u2019. However it possess the deeper underlying meaning of things that are unseen, the existence of a force or power above everything else and from which nature emanates. This kind of associating natural resources with spiritual and cultural meanings is not unique to the Karen. Other indigenous groups have similar belief systems. Very similar to the Karen, the Lisu also believe in the connectedness of natural resources and that they originate as a result of some supernatural forces.40 For indigenous peoples in Thailand, \u2018natural resources\u2019 is understood to be an all encompassing concept including land, forest, water bodies, trees, wildlife, agricultural areas, watershed areas etc having cultural, economical, political and spiritual significance. For them, natural resources are intrinsically linked to each other and any impact on one of them affects the rest. However, different categories for each of these components of natural resources exist. Each indigenous group classifies forests and land based on their belief, the climate, vegetation or physical characteristic. For example, the Karen has an extensive classification of forest categories.41 Such a highly evolved scientific understanding of natural resources strongly suggests the ability of these indigenous groups to manage natural resources. The fact that the last remaining forests and natural biodiversity hot spots of Thailand are in areas which have long been the domain of indigenous groups is no coincidence and can be seen as a proof of their NRM skills. 2.2 Indigenous Natural Resources Management Systems For indigenous groups in Thailand, natural resource management denotes the utilization and maintenance of natural resource through traditional knowledge combined with modern technology.42 These different groups share similarities in the management of their resources but also possess distinct and culturally grounded way of managing resources as well. Because natural resources are understood to be an integral part of their everyday life, respect for them, and their importance is manifested in everyday activities and practice, as well as in ceremonies and rituals. The knowledge for management of these resources is embedded in the social, cultural, economic and political milieu of the peoples. Taboos, ceremonies and rituals which express respect and devotion to 39 This part is drawn from information supplied by IMPECT and IMPECT & FPP publication. 40 Saelee, Kamonphan (2005) 41 See Box 1. 42 Thailand: Country Case Study. p 145. 6 the spirits that are believed to guard different natural resources not only serves an important ceremonial role but also ensures that rules for resource use are adhered to by community members.

Land has physical, spiritual, cultural, economical and political significance. Different indigenous communities have differences in their concepts of land ownership and use as well as similarities. The Lisu, who traditionally practice shifting cultivation. choose their farming sites carefully, depending on the kind of cultivation they intend to take up, identifying forest areas which are cultivable, i.e. not prohibited by taboos or areas which they traditionally believe should not be disturbed and where the area does not slope too much as to cause erosion. A group of four or five family usually looks for a suitable site together. Once a site is selected, a sign such as a piece of wood with a cross on the top is cut and placed to mark the area as occupied. Planting occurs only after a ceremony asking for permission, help and protection from the spirits of the area is performed. According to their traditional knowledge, black and loamy soil is fertile and good for all kinds of crops; they plant rice, corn and sesame in warm places while opium poppy and beans are planted in cold areas. They believe that land has life and it dies if care is not taken in its use. This prevents them from exploiting land beyond what it can sustain. They leave their land fallow for a minimum of five years for regeneration. However there are no tenure rights over these fallow lands, anybody with the permission of the previous user can cultivate it if it has regenerated enough. The Karen (Pgakanyaw) also practice swidden cultivation, planting rice and various vegetables such as cassava, tubers, corn, pumpkins, chili and eggplant for domestic consumption throughout the year. This agricultural system involves leaving the land fallow for seven to ten years before replanting. Like the Lisu, they choose their agriculture area with careful consideration of a number of factors such as whether the area is a taboo forest, watershed etc. Ownership of swidden agricultural land is partially communal, in that if it is not used by the original owner, then that owner is obliged to hand it over for use by other community members. The land may not be sold or passed on to one\u2019s descendants. Clearing land for new cultivation sites is never done during the rainy season. Forests are also categorized and differentiated by both the Lisu and the Karen depending on a number of factors. Perhaps the most extensive forest categorization is practiced by the Karen (Pgakanyaw) people. They classify forest according to various criteria \u2013 topography, altitude, climate, belief, and use. These categories have many more sub-categories which may overlap with each other. 7 Box 1. Karen (Pgakanyaw) and Lisu Classification of Forests Karen (Pgakanyaw) Ker Ner Mu (Montane Evergreen Forest), Ker Ner Pa (Evergreen Forest) and Kaw Be Ko (Deciduous Forest) are classifications based on topography, physical attributes and climate. Pga Ta Du (Taboo Forest) which includes: Du Mu Ber (meaning a forest area with a shape resembling a toad or turtle); Pga Maw Pu ('salt lick' forests, where cattle find salt-licks); Taw De Do (meaning big hair like forest); Pga Ti Per taw ('water coming out of a hole' forest, or forested areas around a spring); Pga Swa Ko (burial sites); and Pga ta Nghae Lo Pu (ritual area forests). Most of these taboo forests are watershed areas, have trails and waterholes frequented by animals, and support a diverse range of species of plants. These forest are absolutely forbidden to be disturbed, there can be no activity of any kind within them. Besides these taboo forest types, there are also the \u2018Th Ta\u2019 (forests with powerful spirits), areas that were once cultivated but are associated with unpleasant events that occurred to the family or community in the year it was used, therefore creating fear in re-cultivating them; the \u2018Du Pga\u2019 (forests to protect and safeguard) are forests that protect the ecological system in the main cultivation area of a village.

Close to this area, but set apart is the \u2018Der Ker\u2019 (adjoining the village) forest believed to protect the community. It is also the area where they tie umbilical cords of new born babies to selected trees. Once a tree has been selected for a child's umbilical cord, it is believed that the tree is then linked to the life of the child. The tree brings fortune, goodness and protection for the child throughout their lives. However any damage sustained by the tree is believed to damage also the child whose cord was tied there. This practice indicates and signifies the relationship between human and trees. Aside from the Der Ker, there is also an additional forest encircling the village called \u2018Ngaw Ker Ter\u2019 which protects the village from becoming too dry, provides food for domestic animals and where rituals to propitiate spirits such as the se k okra, the wit a, and the ser ta. Gardens and paddies called \u2018Ker Rer\u2019 and the swidden fields called \u2018Du La\u2019 are also separately classified. Lisu The Lisu also have important forest areas which they believe should not be disturbed. The A Pa Mo Hi, a forest area very close to the village, is the abode of the god \u2018A Pa Mo\u2019, and in whose honour a shrine is set up within the forest. The Lisu believes that A Pa Mo protects and guard the village from harm and destruction, thus existence of the village depends on A Pa Mo. This forest area is regarded in high reverence and fear. No tree-cutting, hunting and collecting of plants are allowed here. The I Da Ma forest, found about two kilometers from the village and considered to be the abode of the god I Da Ma, is normally on a mountain-top. Hunting or tree-cutting are allowed not allowed here. The third important area is burial sites. No specific burial site exists in Lisu tradition and sites are selected according to the wish of the family or the dead person. The Lisu believes that if three people are buried in the same site or near each other, the area should not be disturbed. Besides these, forest areas for which the \u2018Mue Kua\u2019, the act of returning the forest back to the spirits has been performed, cannot be degraded in any way. Similarly other indigenous groups also have different classification and use of land and forest resources; and taboos and restrictions for the sustainable use of natural resources. 8 2.2.2 Wildlife and Animals Indigenous communities in Thailand believe there is an owner for each and every life form. Each animal and birds have their own protector. Further they believe that wildlife and the forest environment in which they live are interdependent on, and related to, each other. Without the forest, wildlife cannot survive; without wildlife, it will not have diversity. The role of animals in spreading and propagating plants by eating seeds of plants which they deposit elsewhere, is widely acknowledged and recognized by indigenous communities. Accordingly, they are mindful of this when they go hunting for animals and birds. The Iu Mien people conduct a ceremony before any hunting expedition in which they ask the permission of the gods of the animals to hunt them. In the ceremony, they also have to specify how many animals they want to kill. There are strict ethical practices which hunters follow. For instance, a hunter cannot hunt more than five big animals in a year. If a person hunts more than this, it is believed that it will bring bad luck and disaster to him. In such a situation, the hunter has to propitiate the gods by burning silver and gold so as to buy those animals from their gods. The Akha also have a similar practice where a person is limited by the number of animals they can hunt in a year. Among the Lisu hunting can only be for food and after permission from I Da Ma (the protector and owner of forest) has been obtained. Hunting certain wildlife such as the hornbills, gibbons and elephants are considered absolutely taboo as it would bring calamity and disaster to the hunter and the community. There are also days on which no hunting can take place such as Ah-fyu-thi-nyi (the first day of the New Year), Li-Hi-Sua-Nyi (day of paying merit to a dead person), Jue-nyi (a village holiday once every 15 days according to the lunar calendar). 2.2.3 Watershed, Rivers and Aquatic Life For indigenous communities, water does", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48d7ae7c-8af1-470c-80ba-4330527a66c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "48d7ae7c-8af1-470c-80ba-4330527a66c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3396cb763c72c7d5e3c8bf0acb98bf03f902abc8bd45bb964366f853a6be1af6"}}, "hash": "3396cb763c72c7d5e3c8bf0acb98bf03f902abc8bd45bb964366f853a6be1af6", "text": "not just serve a physical need but spiritual purposes as well. Many indigenous communities use water for a number of rituals signifying its importance in their everyday life. According to traditional Karen (Pgakanyaw) belief, there was water on earth before anything else. They believe that it is the origin of all life forms and therefore it must always be protected. This motivates their preservation of forest, which they know is intrinsically linked to the conservation of water. All indigenous communities have beliefs and taboos against disturbing any watershed area or springs. Often forest areas with watersheds and springs are considered taboos forests by most indigenous communities. It is no coincidence but an indication of the knowledge of indigenous communities about the importance of such forest areas for the sustenance of plant and life forms that depend on it. The Karen (Pgakanyaw) likens the fontanel of a new born baby which they believe is the \u201cbrain water pushing up\u201d similar to the source of a spring where the water \u201cpushes up\u201d. They believe the soul of a baby resides in the fontanel and similarly the soul/spirit of a stream resides in the spring. Therefore they do not commit any act that would disturb such sources. Doing so would incur the wrath of the spirit of the area. There are a number of rituals followed by different indigenous communities which involve water and its use. The Hmong perform a ritual known as the Teng Hao Te in the area of the village\u2019s watershed. The purpose is to give thanks and to propitiate the Lord of the Water who protects and keeps the forest lush and the water source flowing the entire year for the community. This ritual is particularly important for communities where water is scarce, so as to ensure a yearlong supply. After the ritual, the watershed area cannot be disturbed. There can be no hunting, collecting of herbs or cutting of trees for any reason. The Hmong also have taboos against playing around and unnecessarily disturbing water bodies. Thus they believe one should not throw rocks or things into water without a reason as it will disturb the life forms 9 that live in it. Among Hmong, houses cannot be constructed too near a stream as it could disturb the flow of water or in times of excess water flow, endanger the lives of those who live in such houses. There are also strict taboos against changing the natural courses or disturbing the flow of water. 2.3 Natural Resource Management and Indigenous Spirituality For all indigenous communities, natural resource management always has a spiritual component to it. No natural resource exists without a spiritual connection. This belief is manifested in the ceremonies and rituals they perform. Some rituals and ceremonies are described below to highlight the connectivity between natural resource management and indigenous spirituality. Box 2. Some Examples of Indigenous Spirituality The Lisu belief that the Juedu Suepa and Juedu Suema are the protectors of watershed areas, Jhatusuepa and Jhatusuema are the god and goddess protecting the land, and I Da Ma, is the protector and owner of forest. The permission of these gods has to be taken before any of the resources under their control is used. The Mien also believes that everything and every place in the world have a spiritual owner and a spiritual protector. Thus any action that affects the natural resources or biological diversity must be done with care and forethought, and with permission of the spiritual guardians, rather than being done as the actions of humans as owners of nature. These beliefs are reflected in various ways, in daily activities, in traditional and in cultural forms that display traditional wisdom in the use and conservation of natural resources.43 The Iu Mien perform the Sib ta poong mian ceremony at the community level three days after the Iu Mien New Year. The ceremony is performed annually in a particular area of forest referred to as ho pry chan. This area of forest is a fertile water catchment area higher than the village settlement itself which retains moisture throughout the year. A tall and strong tree is the central point around which the ceremony is performed to give thanks to nature and the particular community spirits that are respected by the Iu Mien and which have provided protection to the community in the previous year-cycle. The ta poong mian spirit is invoked and thanked in particular, as also the yud tay hoong (sky god), taow te mian (land god), suy kaow mian (water god), ta tiew mian (forest and mountain god), ti taong mian", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20cdd528-60ad-4623-81aa-5a78c4ab2c68": {"__data__": {"id_": "20cdd528-60ad-4623-81aa-5a78c4ab2c68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac5e0111333e1b5cf880f0161ed6b20b4e1209662f5b067b4f86f57afbdb9a1e"}, "3": {"node_id": "0dd90b65-2989-467c-9e9a-e0d2f60e07d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a56de3c2417ab6b4b7edca2ce6518eb170b02ae8eb0f8127a2b3524425b71595"}}, "hash": "cb93ba518e1b98cc09c9d6c58437fb06ba9e32dce5a40976e3642615334fdbaf", "text": "(god of the ancestors) and tieb tin hoong (god of the underworld). After this ceremony is performed, all community members are prohibited from entering or using the forest area. The ceremony expresses the community\u2019s beliefs about appropriate natural resource use and displays respect for biological diversity. It also serves as a means to convey the Iu Mien traditional knowledge about conservation, which is then practiced and taught to succeeding generations. For the Hmong, resource management is closely linked with their dependence on the forest and its resources. Such close dependency fosters respect and reverence for natural resources that guarantees its proper use and management. They believe that resources have spirits that protect and own them. For example Xeeb Teb Xeeb Chaw is the Lord of the Forest and Mountains; Thep tu ti is the Lord of the Water. Their management of natural resources including forest, soil, water, and even wildlife resources, is based on recognition of the inseparable relationship between these resources. There are strong taboos to control resource use and to enable equitable sharing of resources by all the community. At the same time, there are restrictions against making use of resources belonging to others as well as people from elsewhere. They also believe that use of natural resources must inherently go along with conserving them for sustainable use; their traditional knowledge has elements of reviving resources. Certain ceremonies seek to bring these elements of use, conservation and revival together. 43 Ibid. p149. 10 The dong seng is a divination ritual or sacrifice designed to invoke the Lord of the Land to protect land resources and forest resources to shelter the members of the community so they will have good land and forests as well as wildlife. A tall straight tree with a thick trunk and lush branches, in a spot overlooking the community, is chosen for performing this ceremony. Four guardian spirits are invited to reside in the area: Thep Tu Ti (Lord of the land, forests, hills, and plants); Sasaeng Ti Chu (Lord of Wildlife); Fu Saeng/Yao Saeng (Lord of dangerous or meat eating animals, such as tigers); and Chu Seng Long Met (Lord of things below the ground or under the earth\u2019s surface). A pig or a chicken is sacrificed in the ceremony and used together with whisky, joss sticks, candle, gold and silver papers, and cooked rice. Once the ceremony is performed, there is a taboo against anyone entering and using the area for hunting, collecting herbs, cutting trees or for any other purposes. The dong seng is performed at the community level and has the role of fostering unity among community members. It also emphasizes the idea that different elements of nature are related to each other and that adverse action against one will affect everything. The flexibility of indigenous systems has been able to accommodate or adapt to other institutionalized religions such as Buddhism. For instance, Buddhist beliefs and rituals, such as the saffron cloth tying ceremony around trees, are now practiced alongside traditional systems of natural resource management. 2.4 Intergeneration Transfer of Knowledge Elders, priests and shamans in each indigenous community play a vital role in ensuring that their knowledge is passed down from generation to generation. There are various ways in which they do this. It could be through proverbs, sayings, poetry, songs, ritual chants, and riddles. For instance the Karen (Pgakanyaw) have an adage which goes \u201cDu pga o tit a yeu ti li lu no kae bo a sui\u201d which means \u201cIf you are seeking a fertile forest look for one with squirrels and tree shrews\u201d. The Hmong has a song, \u201cTxuag siav ces siav ntev/ txuag zam ces zam tshiab/ Txuag xyoob ces xyoob ntev/ txuag ntoo ces ntoo siab\u201d which translates into \u201cNever erring, life is long/ keep clean and your clothes will stay new/ Care for the bamboo, they will be straight/ care for the trees, they will be tall.\" In certain communities, there are teachers who transmit traditional knowledge. The Hmong have teachers in their villages who teach certain things like the performance of ceremonies such as the Dong Seng. This process involves learning the meaning and significance behind the ceremonies and not just the form of the rituals. Depending on the things taught, fees are given to the teachers. The Hmong also have different songs, poems and proverbs for different situations and circumstances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0dd90b65-2989-467c-9e9a-e0d2f60e07d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "0dd90b65-2989-467c-9e9a-e0d2f60e07d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac5e0111333e1b5cf880f0161ed6b20b4e1209662f5b067b4f86f57afbdb9a1e"}, "2": {"node_id": "20cdd528-60ad-4623-81aa-5a78c4ab2c68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb93ba518e1b98cc09c9d6c58437fb06ba9e32dce5a40976e3642615334fdbaf"}}, "hash": "a56de3c2417ab6b4b7edca2ce6518eb170b02ae8eb0f8127a2b3524425b71595", "text": "The Hmong also have different songs, poems and proverbs for different situations and circumstances.

This poses an urgent challenge for indigenous natural resource management. 2.5 Gender and Natural Resource Management Socioeconomic factors play a very important role in how natural resources are accessed and managed. Tuong Vi Pham notes that \u201cusing resources generate benefits for both men and women, but access to these resources differs by gender and this differential in turn influences opportunities in the development 11 process. As women get lesser opportunities, they depend more on natural resources.\u201d44 Indigenous women, like most poor rural women around the world, are severely affected by environmental degradation and limited access to natural resources due to their dependency on the natural environment for sustenance and health.45 The situation is no different for indigenous women in Thailand. For instance, it was found that one of the most heavily impacted group of people in the Asian economic crash of 1997 in Thailand were women, of which indigenous women constituted a significant number.46 Further, as indigenous women in Thailand face additional difficulties stemming from ethnic and racial prejudice in wider society, and negative impacts felt by women generally are no doubt harder still on women in marginalized groups. It is important to note that within indigenous communities in Thailand, the role of gender in work allocation and labour responsibilities can be seen very clearly. For instance, among the Lisu and Hmong, the role of women in decision making are limited even though they take equal part in the utilization and management of natural resources. Women have no role in choosing cultivation or housing sites. However, there are skills and expertise that is traditionally the domain of women such as knowledge regarding medicinal plants, selection and preservation of seeds and plants for planting. These skills and knowledge are passed down from mother to daughter, thus ensuring their continuity and adaptation. However women also participate in managing and converting forest areas for use. Activities such as swiddening, burning the swidden, sowing seeds, building fences and harvesting are shared by men and women. Seen in the overall context of indigenous natural resource management, the ability of women to observe, classify and experiment with plants and seeds plays a very important role in preserving the diversity of food sources and resource management. 44 Pham, Tuong Vi. (2002). 45 Mikkelsen, Caecilie. (2005). 46 For a brief analysis of the impact of the 1997 economic crash, see: Dennis. (1997). Supra n. 36. For a brief discussion on how changes in access to natural resources have impacted indigenous hill peoples, particularly women with regard to HIV infection, see Symonds, Patricia V. & Kammerer, Cornelia Ann (1992). 12 3. Legal and Policy Framework on Natural Resource Management In the past two decades, rapid industrialization in Thailand has witnessed an accompanying decline in the environmental health of the country. As with many neighbouring countries, Thailand has experienced a host of environmental problems stemming from rapid industrialization, ranging from deforestation and declining fish yields to air and water pollution in major cities and industrial areas.47 The response of the government has been to enact laws and formulate policies. However such laws have not always resulted in positive developments for indigenous peoples. 3.1 Structure of Government and Hierarchy of Laws Thailand is a constitutional monarchy, with the King as the Head of State. The Prime Minister heads the government and presides over a Cabinet of Ministers. The Thai Parliament is the supreme law-making authority, and consists of the Senate whose members are elected for six year terms, and the House of Representatives, whose members are elected for four-year terms48. The structure of governance is divided into national, provincial and district levels, with the provinces headed by governors and districts by district chiefs. Recently, decentralization efforts have shifted more focus on administrative roles at the sub-district which is governed by a Tambon Administrative Organization consisting of the Kamnan and the village headmen of all hamlets in the Tambon, and the Tambon doctor, and of elected members, elected by the people in each of the hamlets in the Tambon.49 The hierarchy of laws in Thailand is very clear and simple. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land from which the authority of other law emanates. \u201cActs\u201d are passed by the Parliament under the Constitution. To clarify and implement the Acts enacted, the respective Ministries may make \u201cRegulations\u201d and \u201cNotifications\u201d. 3.2 Environmental Institutions The responsibility of managing natural resources in Thailand is shared among various ministries and departments.

The new Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) includes three main administrative \u201cclusters\u201d: the environment cluster, covering pollution and environmental quality control; the inland water resources cluster; and the natural resources works cluster covering protected areas, forestry, coastal and marine conservation and mineral development, managed, for example, the Department of National Park, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation, Royal Forest Department, Department of Water Resources, Department of Mineral Resources, and Department of Coastal and Marine Resources. The National Environment Board (NEB) and the Office for Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP), previously under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MOSTE) have also been moved to MONRE. OEPP was changed into the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP). The NEB was formed as a policy-making and coordinating body on natural resources, chaired by the Prime Minister and comprised of the head of all the sectoral ministries whose activities affect the environment, head of departments and government boards, and the private sector. It seeks to 47 Asia Pacific Center for Environmental Law.

To do this, it submits policies and plans to the Cabinet for approval, and has the power to prescribe environmental standards, approve Environmental Quality Management Plans and provincial action plans, recommend amendments, improvements and enforcement of laws, and the monitoring of environmental compliance by government agencies and state enterprises. It is responsible for delivering policy recommendations to the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), which incorporates these recommendations into its five-year National Economic and Social Development Plans (NESDP). Environmental policies stipulated in the NESDPs are translated into action plans by the various ministries and their constituent departments. Following the government restructuring, the Ministry of Interior, Community Development Department and Department of Local Administration have been more active in efforts to help local communities develop integrated sustainable resource management plans. The Royal Project Foundation has been developing arrangements under which local communities and the environment can coexist harmoniously.50 3.3 The Constitution of Thailand, 1997 Thailand has adopted 16 versions of Constitution since 1932 when it transformed into a democracy. The most recent Constitution of 1997 is considered the true public version as the Thai people were involved in drafting it from the very beginning, it is however being re-drafted by the post-coup government of 2006. For the purposes of this paper, we will focus on this most recent Constitution and it's relevant environmental clauses, in the hope that the new Constitution of 2007/2008 will not alter this too much. The intention of the 1997 Constitution was to create people\u2019s participation, recognition of human rights and dignity, creation of political stability, establishment of mechanisms for checking utilization of state power to promote good governance, and decentralization of power to the public.51 Significant provisions touching on issues of participation which affects indigenous peoples\u2019 rights are Articles 46, 56, 59 and 79. Article 46 Individuals who form into traditional, local communities have rights to preserve and revive their customs, local knowledge, arts or culture at the local and national levels; and to participate in the more balanced and sustainable management, maintenance, and utilization of natural resources and the environment. This would be in accord with the enacted law.

This would be in accord with the enacted law. Article 59 Individuals have the right to be informed, explained to, and reasoned with, by government organizations, state agencies, state enterprises, or local official organizations, prior to the approval or implementation of a project or activity that may affect the quality of the environment, health, quality of life, or other important gains or losses related to them or their local communities; and the right to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be0e532b-25e4-4258-a6cd-bae8ce05cff4": {"__data__": {"id_": "be0e532b-25e4-4258-a6cd-bae8ce05cff4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4da13c920f90e8515d82b8ec787cd21f75f518a5419a026a1407e097e3dc6f58"}, "3": {"node_id": "7414f07f-ae3d-4574-9e50-69dca8ea2a19", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "795af23f03d092a63c9162d70d757219ab4493f545875072b4f4f431d68c5463"}}, "hash": "60f416c23bbe38cc015ac97d421241379663da041e8d6cab323253dbcc92ed83", "text": "express their opinion on such an issue.

Other provisions that are important to environmental management are Articles 49, 50, 69 and 290. Article 49 deals with rights and duties in the expropriation of immovable property. Preserving natural resources or the environment is a valid ground for restricting the liberty of individuals to engage in an enterprise or an occupation under Article 50. Article 69 cast a duty on every person to conserve the national arts and culture and local knowledge and conserve natural resources and the environment. Article 290 sets out the powers and duties of local governments in promoting and maintaining the quality of the environment. 3.4 Laws on Natural Resource Management There are more than 20 laws on forest and resource management in Thailand.52 Not surprisingly, there are conflicts in laws and policies and in the functioning of different departments and agencies of the government. For instance, there are 16 agencies for forest management, 6 agencies for mangrove forest, and more than 24 agencies for water resources provision and distribution.53 3.4.1 Forest: Laws & Policies A century ago, forests54 covered 72 percent of Thailand\u2019s territory. This accounted for approximately 230 million rai (1 ha = 6.5 rai) of land. In 1961, less than 40 years ago, that number was still relatively high at 171 million rai or 53 percent of the country. However, most recently (1995), only one quarter or 26 percent (82 million rai) of Thailand remained under forest cover. From 1961 to 1995, Thailand lost an average of 2.6 million rai of forest every year.55 In contrast with this, the area designated as National Forest Reserve continued to increase to about 46% of the country in the early 1990s.56 In 1992, in compliance with the 7th NESDP and the increasing challenge of resettlement, the Royal Forest Department (RFD) divided the national forest reserve estate into three zones.57 The Conservation Forest Zone (Zone C) is prohibited for agriculture and covers existing protected forest areas and areas of natural forest minimally affected by human activity. However, some of this area especially in the Northern watersheds remains occupied by permanent agriculture, shifting cultivation and associated human settlements. The Economic Forest Zone (Zone E) was set aside from arable land suitable for commercial tree plantations for distribution to landless farmers. The E-zone is often devoid of forest and some has been under cultivation for well over a decade. Some E-zone lands are in degraded forest areas. The Agricultural Zone (Zone A) portion of the national forest reserve estate was set aside expressly in deforested areas deemed suitable for agriculture. These areas are in the process of being allocated to 52 Makarabhirom, Pearmsak. (1999). 53 Ibid. 54 The country has two main forest types, evergreen and deciduous. They make up 36 & 54% each.

(Italics added). It is evident that the policy does not include any design that encourages community participation in forest management. The policy encourages the private sector to become involved in tree planting projects for both domestic and export supply and there is an emphasis on partnership with the private sector. However, the private sector was interpreted to mean concessionaires and business people rather than rural people.62 This led to a sharp rise in the number and total area of industrial tree plantations in the Northeast.63 Further it identifies hill peoples and their practices such as shifting cultivation as causes of forest degradation.

The policy\u2019s aim of maintaining 40% forest cover would give rise to many problems for indigenous hill peoples later. 3.4.1.2 Forest Act 1941 There is a very strong sense of State ownership of forests in Thailand, which began with the creation of the Royal Forest Department (RFD) in 1896.64 The establishment of the RFD planted a long-lasting influence on the future of Thailand\u2019s forestry policy, which saw it's inception as a policy of \u201ccutting and processing timber for export to Europe.\u201d65 The Forest Act of 1941 further strengthened State ownership by declaring that any land not acquired or possessed under the land law would be considered as forest [Sec. 4 (1)]. It automatically brought such land under state ownership. From the outset, the main purpose was the control of the harvesting of forest products, and the act did not contain any specific conservation goals.66 The Act mainly focuses on timber trees or forest products seeking to regulate activities within the forest and prohibiting such activities as logging of preserved species of timber, extracting forest products, firing, and land occupation. It divides reserved timber species into two categories: (i) ordinary reserved timbers which are species for logging for which permission must be obtained; and (ii) special reserved timbers which are rare species or species needing to be preserved for which logging permission cannot be granted [Sec. 6]. A provision which has direct consequence for indigenous land use and natural resource management is Sec. 54 which prohibits the clearing, burning, occupying or possession of any forest land. Contravention of this provision attracts a fine extending from fifty thousand baht to one hundred thousand baht and possible imprisonment for between two and fifteen years. 3.4.1.3 National Reserved Forest Act 1964 The National Reserved Forest Act, at the time it was enacted, sought to revise the law on the protection and reservation of forests. This Act, along with the National Park Act of 1961, now forms the basis for the determination, control and maintenance of National Reserved Forests and other protected areas in Thailand.

The Minister of Agriculture is responsible for the implementation and execution of this Act and is empowered to appoint competent officers and issue ministerial regulations [Sec. 5]. Section 6 declares reserved forest existing at the time this 1964 law takes effect to become National Forest Reserve under this law. Further it gives power to the competent Minister to determine any other forest as National Reserved Forests with a view to reserving its nature, timber, forest products or other natural resources, which shall be made by a notification in the ministerial regulations. The Ministerial Regulation along with a map of the determined area is required to be put up in the office of the District or Sub-district, Sub-district Headman and in open and conspicuous places in the villages concerned [Sec. 9]. 64 Bugna, Sahlee, & Rambaldi, Giacomo. p. 40. 65 Sumarlan. p. 49. 66 Rasmussen et al. 17 Once a forest is determined as National Reserved Forests, a committee for such National Reserved Forests shall be set up [Secs. 10 & 11]. A person having a claim over or to exploit any National Reserved Forest can file an application within 90 days from the point at which the regulation comes into force [Sec. 12]. The Committee inquires into the claim and depending on their findings, can fix compensation; or file an appeal with the concerned Minister against the decision of the Committee [Sec. 13]. Within the National Reserved Forests, no person shall occupy, possess, exploit and inhabit the land, develop, clear, burn the forest, collect the forest products nor cause by any other means whatsoever any damage to the nature of the National Reserved Forest [Sec. 14]. However logging or collection of forest products and logging of reserved timber species may be done after obtaining permission from the Director General [Secs. 15 & 16]. Sec. 16 (bis) provides that in cases where any National Reserved Forest, in whole or in part, is so deteriorated that it\u2019s old shifting cultivation land or grassland or valuable timber has become scanty or otherwise with fewer standing trees and cannot naturally be rehabilitated, it will be regarded as deteriorated forest. Such deteriorated forest can be declared to be part of a land reform scheme. A person can apply to inhabit and exploit such land [Sec. 16 (bis) (1)]. Such person can also regrow and reforest in additional land if he can prove his competence to do so [Sec. 16 (bis) (2)]. The Act also has penal provisions which impose liability for an offence ranging from five hundred baht to imprisonment up to 15 years. Most forest officers recognize that the National Forest Reserve Act focuses on \u2018land\u2019, whereas the Forest Act mainly targets timber trees or forest products. However, the Forest Act also contains provisions that regulate forestlands spatially.67 As with other laws described in this paper, the impact of the imposition of the National Forest Reserve Act had direct negative impacts on highland indigenous communities. It is stated in the law that any claim to user-rights or ownership rights to land declared as National Forest Reserve must be made within 90 days of the demarcation and declaration of the new status. Indigenous communities simply are not informed of these legal changes to their lands and territories, due either to the remote sites of their communities or language barriers. As with other laws regarding the legal status of lands in Thailand, this Act led to many indigenous communities becoming illegal encroachers on their own lands. 3.4.1.4 National Park Act 1961 The concept of protection of forests in National Parks stemmed from the United States of America, where parks were established in the last century to protect extraordinary natural features of educational and recreational value for the sake of all (non-Indian) Americans.68 The model of Yellowstone National Park in the USA was taken as the basis for protected areas in Thailand, mainly on the advice of US National Park officials.69 There are a total of 102 national parks in Thailand of which 81 are terrestrial parks and the remaining 21 are marine parks.70 A national park is an area of least ten square kilometers that contains natural resources 67 Wataru. 68 Brenner, Verena, et al.

An area may also be declared a national park for its historical or cultural features.71 The National Park Act of 1961 closely followed the enactment of the Wild Animal Preservation and Protection Act (1960) and provided the legal basis for the creation of national parks in Thailand. The Act is a very short law with only 30 provisions; however it has wide ramifications for indigenous hill peoples. It is identified as one of the most used law in arresting and detaining indigenous hill peoples.72 Under the law, a national park may be created from \u201cany area of land which is of interest and be maintained with a view to reserving it for the benefit of public education and pleasure \u2026 (such) land shall not be owned or legally possessed by any person other than a public body [Sec. 6. italics added.].\u201d It is very clear that the purpose of creating parks under the law is not for conservation or preservation of resources, and that \u201ceducation and pleasure\u201d superseded the emphasis on sustainable use of resources. Under the law, a National Park Committee has the duty to give advice to the Minister in charge of implementing the law on: (1) determination of land to be reserved as National Park and extension or cancellation of the National Park; (2) protection and maintenance of the National Park; and (3) matters consulted by the Minister [Sec. 15].73 Section 16 of the law is the main backbone on which the maintenance and protection of a national park rest. It prohibits a number of activities within a national park. Most significantly it makes unlawful any act that a person depending on forest resources would commit. As such it impinges directly on the use rights of forest resources for indigenous peoples. The penalty for violation of section 16 ranges from paying a fine of 500 baht to imprisonment not exceeding five years [Secs. 24 \u2013 27]. SECTION 16, National Park Act, 1961. Within the National Park, no person shall: 1. occupy or possess land including build up, or clear or burn the forest; 2. collect, take out, or alter any act whatsoever things, endanger or deteriorate timber, gum, resin, wood-oil, turpentine, mineral or other natural resources; 3. take wildlife out or alter any act whatsoever things or endanger the wildlife; 4. alter any act whatsoever things, endanger or deteriorate soil, rock, gravel or sand; 5. change a waterway or cause the water in a river, creek, swamp or marsh to over flow or dry up; 6. close or obstruct a water course or way; 7. collect, take out, or alter any act whatsoever things, endanger or deteriorate orchid, honey, lacquer, charcoal, bark or guano; 8. collect or alter any act whatsoever things, endanger flowers, leaves or fruits; 9. take in, take out any vehicle or drive it on the way not provided for such purpose, unless written permission has been obtained form the competent officer; 10. cause any aircraft to take off or land in the place not provided for such purpose, unless written permission has been obtained from the competent officer; 11. take cattle in or allow them to enter; 12. take in any domestic animal or beasts of burden; unless he has complied with the rules laid down by the Director-General and with the approval of the Minister; 13. carry on any activity for benefit, unless written permission has been obtained by the competent officer; 14. post a notification or advertisement, or scratch or write on any place; 71 National Park Division.

The 1960 law provided protection for wild animals in general by establishing wildlife sanctuaries and non-hunting areas. The 1960 law provided total protection to nine species, prohibiting hunting of these species. This has been increased to 15 species in the 1992 law. 3.4.2.1 Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act 1992 This Act establishes a National Wildlife Preservation and Protection Committee, chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives and with a membership drawn from various government departments [Sec. 9]. The Committee is empowered to designate wildlife conservation areas, to list species subject to protection, and to undertake certain related activities [Sec 15]. The Act forbids hunting, propagating or breeding, possessing, trading, collecting, endangering or possessing any protected and preserved wildlife or their nests [Secs. 16 \u2013 21]. Exceptions to some of the prohibitions are acts such as killing protected and preserved wildlife for educational or research purposes may be permitted by the Minister [Secs. 29 \u2013 3]). The competent Minister has the power to declare wildlife sanctuaries by announcement in the Royal Gazette [Sec. 33]. No person can hunt wildlife, collect or endanger any nest within a wildlife sanctuary except for educational purpose and then only with permission [Sec. 36]. Further no person can enter, possess or occupy land, construct, cut, fell, clear, burn or destroy trees within such wildlife sanctuaries [Secs. 37 & 38]. These provisions make unlawful most acts that forest dependent communities living inside wildlife sanctuaries would perform for their daily survival. Extensive penal provisions for violations of the Act are set forth with punishment ranging from 5 thousand baht to imprisonment not exceeding five years. 3.4.3 Land Laws Historically, the evolution of individual land rights and enforcement mechanisms is the result of increases in population density relative to land availability.74 Before 1900, all land belonged to the king from which he made grants to nobles, officials, and other subjects. Such grants could be passed on to heirs, mortgaged or sold. Land could also be cleared and used by farmers who, after three years of continuous cultivation, established an informal land claim. In 1901 the Department of Lands (DOL, Ministry of Interior) was established to formalize title deeds. The process of administrating land evolved gradually and culminated in the formulation of the Land Code of 1954. 74 Puginier (2002a). p. 85. 20 Land is administered by 14 government departments in two ministries; the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. Three broad classification of land can be made: 1. State Land; 2. Undocumented Land; and 3. Private land. State Land: Forest Land is administered by the RFD; Government Real Estate is under the Treasury Department; Public domain land is under Department of Lands. This gives rise to a situation where different documents for land use and ownership are given by different agencies, sometimes in conflict with other. Undocumented Land: In forest areas, where \u201cencroachment\u201d has taken place, for land that is privately cultivated, the RFD gives an STK-1 claim or the Agricultural Land Reform Office (ALRO) gives a Sor Por Kor75 - 401 claim certificate. This can be converted to a certificate of utilization by DOL through a complex process. NS-3 certificates are issued by the Department of Public Welfare (DPW) for communal self-help projects; KSN certificates for cooperative settlements are issued by the Department of Cooperatives Promotion. Private Land: Again for private lands, that is land not owned by the state, there are different types of title and utilization documents. NS-4 from DOL indicates of full ownership while NS-3 or NS-3K from DOL proves that the person named has put the land to use. STK-1 and NS-2 allows temporary land occupation and a claim of a person who possessed the land and made use of it prior to 1981. Within the classification of private land also comes Communal Land which is not further defined. Indigenous peoples were initially excluded from getting titles over land on the basis that they were not Thai citizens when the Land Code came into being. More recently, it is based on the watershed classification that designates most highland areas as off limits to human activity. 3.4.3.1 Land Code 1954 & Land Code Promulgation Act, 1954 The Land Code of 1954 (\"the Code\") was promulgated through the Land Code Promulgation Act of 1954.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f52c9ae6-e87d-499b-b62e-672e4ac7f13c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f52c9ae6-e87d-499b-b62e-672e4ac7f13c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f923589edd2a927ec9db4254e3a453bd30bd4460ca29c302d3064fa895761b8"}, "2": {"node_id": "c7c81c3b-80dd-41f0-8c48-80e8a8bf1292", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35929a2994c90b29305eee3a43e1c331fbc940732aba7be1777f24e5c1f924dc"}}, "hash": "24a8507e174550f44581f8acf8f6a7bb4445bd15a267cb7d735833d39adaf558", "text": "The Code has the most important bearing on the question of land ownership and by implication on the process of centralization.76 The Government, through Sec. 5 of the Land Code Promulgation Act, provided the option that anyone occupying any forest land as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1c5f692-86ff-4698-8183-8b3d8653b3eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1c5f692-86ff-4698-8183-8b3d8653b3eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "981a27e54b48f5a55ffacca7fcfa1db92515c68254f868b8018d3ea2bf75624c"}}, "hash": "981a27e54b48f5a55ffacca7fcfa1db92515c68254f868b8018d3ea2bf75624c", "text": "of November 30, 1954 can receive a land use claim certificate provided he/she can prove his/her claim within 180 days. Most indigenous hill peoples living in remote areas were unaware of this law and even those living close to provincial towns were unaware of this time stipulation and failed to take advantage of it, thus becoming encroachers. The Land Code also declared 50% of the country as forest land under the management of the Royal Forest Department (RFD) [Sec. 1]. The Land Code defines land as the land surface everywhere including mountains, hills, streams, ponds, canals, swamps, marshes, waterways, lakes, islands, and the sea coast [Sec. 1]. It vested ownership with the state of all lands for which there is no owner [Sec. 2]. The Land Code classifies land by soil fertility and land suitability, and used the first general soil map produced in 1953 as a basis.77 Chapter 2 of the Code concerns cadastral survey for land reform purposes and the establishment of the National Land Allocation Commission which shall be the main public body to administer land allocation. Three types of documents corresponding to stages of land acquisition are defined in the Code: occupancy, utilization and legal possession [Secs. 29 \u2013 33]. This system has the potential to be exploited where a person after getting legal possession sells the land and starts a whole new process of occupancy in another 75 Sor Por Kor documents are title deeds for cultivation and can be used as bank loan security, but cannot be sold legally. 76 Banerjee, Ajit Kumar. (1997). p. 9. 77 Puginier (2002a). p. 85. 21 land area leading up to legal possession again. Deforestation has been attributed to this as the Land Code encouraged the clearing and occupation of forest land by establishing legal systems for land titling.78 Chapter 3 deals with delimitation of rights in land. Sec. 34 places a limit on the size of land that may be owned for agricultural or other uses. Detailed rules on the size of land that may be owned by one or more persons are given in the Chapter. It allows a person to own land beyond the limit in certain cases, one of which is that he has the ability and equipment to utilize the land [Sec. 47]. Industrial ownership of land beyond the limit is also allowed under Sec. 48. A reason given for the disparity in land ownership in Thailand \u2013 10 per cent of the population owns up to 100 Rai (16 hectares) and above, while as much as 90 per cent of the population own only 1 Rai (0.16 hectares) each and 2 million families are landless \u2013 is the land ownership prohibition under the law that preferentially grant the ownership rights to the government and private sector, overlooking the rights of community and practices of common property ownership.79 Chapter 4 deals with the issuance of documents of title to land. A complicated process of applying for different titles is set out in the chapter. Other chapters in the Code are Cadastral survey (5); Registration of rights and juristic act (6); Limitation of rights in land for religious purposes (7); Limitation of aliens\u2019 rights in land (8); Limitation of rights in land of some categories of juristic persons (9); Trade in land (10); Fees (11); Penalties (12). 3.4.3.2 Land Development Act, 1983 The main emphasis of this Act is the regulation of land development which is defined as \u201cany act done to soil or land in order to increase its richness or quality, or to increase agricultural produce, and includes the improvement of soil or land which lacks natural fertility or lacks fertility due to its utilization, and soil and water conservation to maintain natural balance or for suitable utilization of land for agriculture\u201d [Sec. 3]. A \"Land Development Committee\" composed of ministers and Government officers is envisaged [Sec. 4]. The Committee considers land classification, planning for land utilisation, land development and determination of areas for land utilisation for submission to the Council of Ministers for approval; determine the areas for land survey for the benefit of surveying the fertility of land and suitability in the utilisation of land; prescribe measures for soil or land improvement or measures for soil and water conservation so that State agencies may employ them and advise farmers to that effect; and approve the establishment of land development agencies at various levels in any area; etc. The Land Development Department is responsible for carrying out a survey and analysis of soil or land in order to ascertain the fertility and suitability for the utilisation of land, to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29041948-d158-446d-b944-50c584894d5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "29041948-d158-446d-b944-50c584894d5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b52ba8f7a0f41838816adb3f851bc00fb05f82cae7728ee505a00dcdb3f829ce"}, "3": {"node_id": "8cfa9452-7409-48df-89e8-a82ca5045469", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "993d11b1302caf7ac4d38d027cf2d7688a2324152dd24ea197102f76cd2974f5"}}, "hash": "a5ebbd2b969660c95e1eb1ad6c15c67ea6ef4068fa1d2fbb1f50c1cdb2c30a72", "text": "effect land classification and land development, to prepare census of land or the economic condition of land pursuant to this Act and to carry out other matters as assigned by the Committee [Sec. 10].

(2003). 22 3.4.4 Other Laws and Policies Impacting Natural Resource Management 3.4.4.1 Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act, 1992 The law is a framework piece of legislation which sets out broad standards for the maintenance and conservation of environmental quality. The law also seeks to improve and maintain environment quality. Environment quality is defined as the \u201cbalance of nature, being composed of animals, plants, natural resources and man-made objects\u201d [Sec. 4. Italics added]. It calls for participation of the public in the management of matters affecting the environment and lay down the framework for collaboration between the government and NGO's [Secs. 6, 7, and 8]. A private individual can lodge a petition against a person who violates laws on conservation of natural resources. Sec. 12 establishes a National Environment Board consisting of cabinet members and government officials. The Board has the power to submit policies and plans for enhancement and conservation of the environment to the Cabinet, prescribe environmental quality standards and carry out other functions as outlined in Sec. 13. Chapter 2 establishes and governs an \"Environmental Fund\u201d. Secs. 32 to 51 (Chap. 3) provide for environmental quality standards, environmental quality management planning, conservation and environmentally protected areas, and environment impact assessment. The Minister shall, with the approval of the National Environment Board, formulate an action plan called \"Environmental Quality Management Plan\" to implement the national environment policy [Sec. 35]. Secs. 42 to 45 provide for the establishment of national parks, wildlife reserves watershed areas, and other protected areas. Environmental Impact Assessments are mandated for specified types of projects [Secs. 46-51]. Chapter 4 addresses pollution control while Chapter 5 deals with promotion measures for pollution control. The next chapter imposes liability on any person who pollutes or does anything that damages natural resources. Chapter 7 contains penal provisions for violations of the Act. 3.4.4.2 Thai Forestry Sector Master Plan In 1993, the RFD proposed the Thai Forestry Sector Master Plan (TFSMP). The TFSMP was strongly influenced by the Tropical Forestry Action Plan.80 Another factor attributed to the proposal is a policy paper \u201cTen Measures to Save the Forests,\u201d submitted to the Thai Government which highlighted three areas for action: a comprehensive plan for protecting forest areas that had been part of the concessions; the administration of \"economic\" and \"conservation\" forests under separate regulations; and the rights for local villagers to own and manage their ecosystems as community forests.81 The TFSMP admitted that past approaches to forestry has failed and that there was a need for a more participatory forest management with local people as partners. Consequently it encouraged a more participatory approach. It stated that \u201clocal communities and individual villagers will have decision- making powers entrusted to them concerning the forest resources they depend on.\u201d82 Further it attempted to strengthen sustainable management and conservation of natural forests and ecosystems, develop a strategy for policy implementation through sustainable and participatory methods, and enhance capacity 80 Colchester, Marcus, & Lohmann, Larry. (1990). See also: Lohmann, Larry. (1993). Lohmann argues strongly that the TFSMP was also a result of influence from \u201cJaakko Poyry Oy, the largest logging, pulp mill and plantation consulting firm in the world and active in commercial forest exploitation in dozens of countries\u201d. 81 Sureeratna Lakanavichian.

The main task was focused on up-stream watershed rehabilitation by reforestation on abandoned shifting cultivated areas. This is symptomatic of an approach used for watershed management at that time, a 're-greening' of the watershed area by reforestation assuming that only the forest can produce optimal yield and distribution of water. This was the first effort at formal management of watersheds in Thailand.87 However degradation of watershed areas continued and hence an inter-institutional watershed management program was initiated and a Committee on Watershed Conservation and Development was set up. Problems of non-cooperation were encountered in its functioning and it was abandonded quickly. Meanwhile the Soil and Water Conservation and Management Division under the Land Development Department and Watershed Research Sub-Division under the RFD were established. The latter became the Watershed Management Division in 1975. Presently, responsibility for watershed management in Thailand falls under the Watershed Management and Conservation Office within the Department of National Park, Wildlife & Plant Conservation.88 The first watershed classification was made by the National Environment Board soon after it was established in 1975. It divided watershed into 3 classes in which 60% of highland areas fell into Class 1 where no resource utilization could take place and all residents were required to be evacuated. Much controversy was generated as a result. Due to the controversy over the first watershed classification, a revised version was presented in 1983 by the National Environment Board. The classification divided watershed forests into 5 classes according to physical features. The current status of this classification remains:89 Watershed class Physical environment Proposed management Area in Sq. Km. Ratio High elevation (> 500 m), very steep slopes (> 35 %) Protected or conservation forest, headwater source Class 1 Class 1A High elevation and very steep slopes (> 35 %) Permanent forest cover 84,463.70 16.66 83 Broge, Niels. et al. (2001). 84 Ibid. 85 Jantakad & Gilmour. 86 IUCN (1996) 87 Watershed Management Division. 88 ICEM. pp. 87-88. 89 Adapted from PUGINIER (2002a). p. 76. & OEPP (1996) 24 Class 1B Similar to 1A, yet partly cleared for agriculture or settlement Should be reforested or maintained in permanent agroforestry 7,626.66 1.48 Class 2 High elevation and steep to very steep slopes Commercial forest, with logging, grazing allowed 42,768.62 8.32 Class 3 Uplands (200-500m) with steep slopes Fruit tree plantation, grazing, agricultural crops 39,283.77 7.65 Class 4 Gentle sloping lands Upland farming, row crops, grazing, fruits 81,033.69 15.81 Class 5 Gentle slopes, flat areas Lowland farming, paddy and other crops 251,483.62 49.01 No settlement can exist in Class 1A and 1B. However, this remains highly controversial as most of the indigenous hill peoples are settled within these areas and the classifications were made without consultation. Therefore, a more comprehensive review of factors influencing management should inform appropriate amendments. The policy focus of watershed rehabilitation has been an evolving process. The later part of the 70\u2019s focused on watershed rehabilitation with reforestation of abandon swidden area, relocations of hill tribe villages and improvement of quality of life as the main activities. The period between 1980 and 1990 saw shift in policy toward integrated watershed management with land use planning, soil and water conservation measures, forest fire control and promotion of agricultural extension as the main activities. This changed to participatory watershed management with an emphasis on local people\u2019s participation, village committee, watershed network, rules and regulations in 1990 \u2013 1999. From 2000 onwards, policy focused on watersheds for the people.90 However, watershed management is already being affected by the privatization of water in Thailand.91 3.4.4.4 Cabinet Resolution of 30th June 1998 The Cabinet Resolution of 30th June 1998 is perhaps the most important singular document that currently affects the rights of indigenous peoples in Thailand and natural resource management.

The then Deputy Agriculture Minister went on record to say \u2018encroachers\u2019 (clearly referring to \u2018indigenous hill peoples\u2019) were behind the forest fires.94 Very soon thereafter, the forestry chief was reported to have raised the possibility that settlers in conservation forest 90 Jantakad & Gilmour. 91 For an analysis of the impact of privatization of water on its management in Thailand see: CHANTAWONG, Montree, et al.

All these led to a halt of settlement approval in the form of another cabinet resolution on 30 June 1998, which cancelled the three April 1997 resolutions regarding human settlement in forests and recommended the old strategies of classification and zoning, with the eviction of villagers living in \u201csensitive areas\u201d. 3.4.4.5 Cabinet Resolution of 10th August, 2004 This Cabinet Resolution intends to initiate a \u2018New Plan of Forest Villages Project\u2019. This Project aims to lessen the incidence of trespass on forests; create collaborative management practices, to protect, conserve and sustainably use resources, with communities living within the Project areas. The target area includes many indigenous communities living in forested areas. This Resolution is very positive in its recognition of the possibility of people and forest coexisting. The Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Vegetation and the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources are responsible for implementation of this Resolution. Unfortunately, the method of implementation is based on the Cabinet Resolution of 30th of June 1998 which has had very negative impact on people living in forested areas and does not support original patterns of community living. 3.4.4.6 Cabinet Resolution 17th January 1989 (Order number 32/2532). Between 19 and 24 November 1988, heavy rains triggered massive landslides, affecting all of Thailand's eastern coastal provinces, killing 373 people, injuring hundreds and rendering thousands homeless. Many reasons for the flood were identified but logging became the most infamous culprit. Persistent pressure following the disaster convinced the Government to impose a total logging ban on 17 January 1989 in the form of a Cabinet Resolution (Order number 32/2532). This resolution revoked all logging licenses in natural forest and effectively banning all forms of logging, particularly in the uplands.96 However logging in plantations and mangrove forest continued. The main goal of the resolution was the protection of remaining natural forests and the punishment of encroachers in protected forests. However the ban is not without its controversy. When the ban was imposed, there were no clear policies and strategy in place to implement it. As a result, illegal logging continued and the ban was largely seen as a political maneuver. At the same time the ban, with the intention of protecting remaining forest, also had the effect of putting more pressure on the government to address the \u201cproblem\u201d of indigenous hill peoples living inside protected areas, in some cases resulting in relocation and forcible removal. 95 15/4/1998 ( Bangkok Post ) 96 Jantakad & Gilmour. 26 3.4.4.7 Tambon97 Council and Administrative Authority Act, 1994 Political developments in the last two decades have served to shift the administrative structure in Thailand toward an increasingly decentralized model. On the wave of political reforms initiated in the 1990s and the demand for an opening of the governance structure of the country to allow people\u2019s direct participation, decentralization became a high point on the agenda.98 The Tambon Council & Tambon Authority Act was promulgated in 1994 but it came into effect only in 1995.

The Tambon Administrative Authority Council Administrative Committee (TAACAC) is composed of one Chairman and two Members elected by the TAAC [Sec. 58] and has the powers and duties of administering the day to day businesses of the Tambon Administrative Authority (TAA). The TAA has a number of duties and businesses listed out in Secs. 67 and 68 of the Act, amongst which is the duty to \u201cprotect, look after and maintain natural resources and he environment\u201d [Sec. 67 (7)].

The district officer can report to the Provincial Governor and recommend the dissolution of the TC [Sec. 38] and TAA [Sec. 91] if he deems fit. The TC and TAA are expected to be self-governing and financially self-sufficient. However in many cases, the structure of these organizations is highly bureaucratic and still involves the Ministry of Interior controlling the activities of these organizations through the provincial governors and district officers. They are also required to get their plans and budget approved from higher authorities. In these respect the 97 There are four different types of local administrative units envisioned by the new Constitution: the provincial administrative organizations, the municipalities, the tambon (sub-district) administrative organizations (TAOs), and special administrative bodies, namely, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and the City of Pattaya. Cuachon, Nora. (2002). p. 144. A tambon is a group of 5-15 mubans (village or hamlet, averaging 200 households), the head of which is the kamnan.

(1999). 27 aim of decentralization is not achieved. At the same time, there is also a presence of autonomy in areas such as fund and revenue generation. The amendments that were made to the law have increased the role of these organizations to include even activities of natural resource management. The decentralization of administrative authority, and importantly budgetary control, to the tambon level has had beneficial effects on the levels of political participation among indigenous peoples. Demographically weak at the national level (indigenous peoples account for only 2-3% of the national population) indigenous peoples have never been represented in national politics, and only twice to date in provincial politics. At the district level, participation in politics has been slightly higher, but with the devolution of authority to tambon levels, indigenous peoples are for the first time (in some cases) holding the majority of the local political seats and controlling the local decisions about health, education and other matters devolved to the tambon level. 3.4.4.8 Determining Plans and Process of Decentralization to Local Government Organizations Act, 1999 (Decentralization Act, 1999) The Act provides for setting up a \u201cCommittee of Decentralization to local government Organization\u201d compose of the Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Minister as the Chairman and Ministers and heads of departments, twelve representatives of local governments and another twelve persons or experts [Sec. 6].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e44ad314-f80c-402e-9946-b74c8693dc77": {"__data__": {"id_": "e44ad314-f80c-402e-9946-b74c8693dc77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86be4f06dc929733386b9384697823d62cd59e64240034a3c1009ffef66ae07c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b14eee11-ce28-45fd-a8ba-7a883f80ca67", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4377ef01635f01ad21d610ce99a43704e4580fae7474090a8cf46180db00d460"}}, "hash": "29289a32d0ef07cccb7ab41e9ac6c3df0788a442ad0c94ff22823615986217f5", "text": "6].

It also sets out a set of similar powers and duties for the provincial administrative organization. The Act also sets out a series of procedures through which decentralization can take place and proceed [Secs. 30 \u2013 34]. The Act changed the ratio of expenditure between central government: local government to 80:20 in 2001 and 65:35 in 2006 [Sec. 30 (4)]. Previously, it was 91:9 where half of the 9% was allocated to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration.100As touched on earlier, this devolution of budgetary control means a real shift of power in terms of the decisions made at a local level. For indigenous areas, it has meant at least some budgetary control, for the first time, is vested in the tambon and thus within reach of indigenous community leaders. 3.4.4.9 Master Plan on Highland Development The first Master Plan for Development of Highland Populations, Environment and Control of Narcotic Crops (Master Plan for Highland Development) was implemented in 1992-96 by Centre for the Coordination of Hilltribe Affairs and Eradication of Narcotic Crops (COHAN) although it was drafted much earlier in 1983.101 The Office of the Narcotic Control Board (ONCB) coordinated projects in the 20 provinces in which the plan was implemented, together with the respective Provincial and District 100 Cuachon. p. 147. 101 The 1st Master Plan was drafted by the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC), the Social Research Institute of Chiang Mai University (CMU) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 28 Hilltribe Committees (DHCs).102 The objectives of the plan were to improve the socio-economic situation of the hill tribes, to encourage permanent settlement and community registration and to conserve the environment.103 In this sense, the Master Plan was no different to other policies on hill peoples that had already been formulated before. To implement the Master Plan, hill tribe communities/villages were classified into four groups:104 1. Permanent villages which had more than 50 households with permanent settlement and no migration for the last 20 years, suitable for permanent agriculture, outside watershed class 1 or wildlife areas, with government agencies present and car transport possible; 2. Potential permanent settlements which were those villages that posed no threat to national security, has 20-50 households, with no migration for 10 years, with permanent houses and suitable for permanent agriculture; 3. Non-permanent settlements which were communities that did not fulfill the conditions for group 2; and 4. Special: special community.105 To get legal recognition, a community must not be a threat to national security; it must have government agencies operating on a permanent basis; it must have accepted development initiatives of the government and can support them; it must be located in suitable zones where permanent cultivation is possible; it must comply with the Local Administration Act of 1914 and the voluntary self-protection law of 1979; and it has at least 50 households, not shifted in the last 10 years and practices permanent agriculture. Once these criteria are fulfilled, it must register with the Village Directory of the Department of Local Administration where it obtains a village number and a Thai name. It must also have a village committee chaired by a headman with two assistants, one in charge of community defense and the other of village management. These criteria are clearly discriminatory against highland communities, many of which have been made illegal by changes to land zoning and the declaration of national parks and other forms of reserved areas. Similarly, the criteria focusing on permanent agriculture and permanent site (having not shifted in 10 years) means that many smaller indigenous communities are rendered illegal by their inability to match the required criteria. The 2nd Master Plan for Highland Development (1997-2001) did not show major changes from the first one, though it mentioned implementation problems such as a lack of coordination among agencies, restrictive forest policies, a slow citizenship process, and a lack of planning meetings between provincial and local organizations.106 It was characterised by three strategies: the creation of security for highland communities; the management of natural resources with a focus on people and forest living together, economic diversification and land use boundaries; and administrative cooperation between the government and the private sector.107 It also stressed the importance of the clear demarcation of village land use boundary for planning, temporary residence and relocation.

The Master Plan also divides all highland communities into 4 groups, according to which the future of the community is determined, as shown here: 1. Formally registered villages under the Local Administration Act of 1914 2. Villages established without yet receiving formal registration, but likely to qualify for registration 3. Villages established without formal registration, and lacking the capacity to be registered formally (to be relocated) 4. \u2018Special category\u2019 communities with special dispensation from the Cabinet to remain for the time being. The current Master Plan reinforces negative stereotypes of indigenous hill peoples. For instance it associates drug trading, destruction of forest and water resources, soil degradation with indigenous hill peoples. In spite of the decentralization initiatives that are already present, such as the Constitution, the Master Plan encourages a centralized approach without involvement of local administrations. One of the biggest challenge and shortcoming of these Master Plans is that there was completely no involvement and participation of indigenous communities in their formulation despite the fact that they are the target and \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d of the Plans. Aside from the problems this approach poses in formulating a policy sensitive to the needs of the community, there are problems in implementation as well. 3.4.4.10 The National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP) As previously mentioned, the first NESDP contained some provisions that affected indigenous hill peoples. However it was not until the 5th NESDP that indigenous hill peoples\u2019 issues were directly included for the first time. The entry of a host of international development agencies and donors in the 1980s \u201cdivided northern Thailand into development project areas\u201d109. It required coordination and hence the 5th National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP 1982-86) included hill tribe issues for the first time.110 Security concerns, opium reduction, reforestation, reduction of population growth and conversion to 'good Thai citizens' were the main objectives.111 During the implementation of this plan, a special Committee for the Solution of National Security Problems Involving Hill Tribes and the Cultivation of Narcotic Crops was created by the Ministry of Interior. The Centre for the Coordination of Hilltribe Affairs and Eradication of Narcotic Crops under the Third Army was also set up in 1986 to coordinate between government agencies. Around the same time that the First Master Plan for Highland Development was implemented, the 7th NESDB was also executed. This plan called for sustainable development and three development key objectives were adopted. They included economic growth, income distribution, and development of human resources, quality of life and environment. The most important feature, vis-\u00e0-vis indigenous hill peoples, of this Plan was the declaration that 25% of the country should be protected conservation forest. The period also saw the enactment of the new Watershed Act 1993 which classified 45.9% of the country as national forest reserve.112 109 Puginier (2002). 110 Ibid. 111 Chotichaipiboon, T. (1997). p. 100 112 At the time, conservation forest constituted 27.5%, and economic forest 16. 2 % and agricultural production areas 2.2%. 30 The Asian economic crash of 1997 brought home the fact that the rapid growth Thailand had enjoyed could not be sustained without adverse social and environmental consequences.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbf06770-9c63-4f26-9bf6-1d8a8a6d908b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbf06770-9c63-4f26-9bf6-1d8a8a6d908b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d288b604777767301d37664d36681c271bc6d784c51dc593ac25359ee4a9d6df"}, "2": {"node_id": "08d31056-f45b-4e59-a91f-d3bdcfdbbd32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34413fb620fed60de532abe85e34c53fc74f36c97b0e382cb4deee075f48a7de"}}, "hash": "38475a005336c9c26ce0325b95c0bc8336fee89df689369d2c2ebd8524beddae", "text": "It also led to the realization that vulnerable people in remote rural communities needed to be empowered to enable them to participate more actively in future growth and development.113 These concerns were reflected in the 8th NESDP which marked a distinct shift from previous Plans that emphasized economic growth, to focus on sustainable use of resources and participation of people.

The National Policies, Measures and Plans on the Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Biodiversity (1998-2002), was approved as an administrative framework to implement the CBD. Seven strategies were outlined in the Plan for implementation:115 \u2022 Build capacity of institutions to conserve biodiversity; \u2022 Enhance efficiency in management of protected areas; \u2022 Improve incentives for conservation of species, population and ecosystems; \u2022 Conserve species, populations and ecosystems; \u2022 Control and monitor activities that threaten biodiversity; \u2022 Encourage traditional cultural management of biodiversity; \u2022 Promote cooperation between international and national agencies in the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity. 113 Ross, Dr.William & Poungsomlee Dr. Anuchat. 2003. p. 69.

Interface between Indigenous and Statutory Systems and Laws on Natural Resource Management One obstacle in local communities\u2019 participation in natural resource management is the gap between the way of living of indigenous peoples, policies and other legal frameworks put forward by the government which impinges the community\u2019s rights and ignores the people\u2019s customs and tradition. Such obstacle had led to conflict and violence in enforcing laws on the part of the government agencies.116 The present Thai legal framework of natural resource management is based on the concept that public resources can be divided into separate categories according to their utilitarian value, encouraging commercial ends for their use. Such a perspective places emphasis on the physical property of the resources and ignores the value in other domains such as local culture and tradition that serve as the basis for customary legal framework for resource management. It results in the statutory laws serving the interests of only certain groups in the society. There is a need therefore to look at how such gaps can be negotiated. 4.1 Interaction between Indigenous Systems and Statutory Systems A constant point of interaction between indigenous systems and the codified system of the State is the conflict that regularly arises when they overlap, or as often is the case, exclude each other. Some key issues that need to be acknowledged to address the problems include: 4.1.1 Non - Recognition of Indigenous Natural Resource Management System Most of the existing laws and policies of Thailand on natural resource management were enacted and formulated without the participation and consultation of right holders. And often, these laws were modeled on the laws of other countries that fail to appreciate local situations. Further, the adoption of \u201cscientific\u201d approaches to natural resource management continually encouraged a top-down forest and resource management approach. A consequence of this approach was the sidelining of indigenous knowledge and institutions and non-recognition of indigenous systems in natural resource management. However it is important to recognize that \u201cindigenous institutions represent established local systems of authority and other phenomena derived from the socio-cultural and historical processes of a given society.\u201d117 Because they originate from local cultures, their implication and potential for natural resource management is vast. There are already indications that certain state agencies have already incorporated a participatory approach toward natural resource management incorporating the views of indigenous rights holders. For instance, a Community Forestry Development Center was established in the Phupan National Park, a site of constant conflict and contestation over natural resources, to study and develop the process and method for use of natural resources with the local people. It was previously under the management of the Community Forestry Division of the RFD but it has been decentralized to the Udonthani Forestry Region Office, a further indication of a more participatory approach.118 However, it", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7cbd491-585d-434f-9a21-c5a407a857db": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7cbd491-585d-434f-9a21-c5a407a857db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec16eec3bcc3594bd25b43e6d78e6dc5144aeee6716b8cc8c2a2265de8f60b56"}}, "hash": "ec16eec3bcc3594bd25b43e6d78e6dc5144aeee6716b8cc8c2a2265de8f60b56", "text": "is often the case that participation is defined and viewed differently.

As it has been right observed, \u201cThe fierce and often violent arguments on deforestation and strategies for forest protection are only intelligible against the background of the unsolved land rights issue in Thailand.\u201d119 Much of the insecurity over land tenure, and the consequent impact this has had on natural resource management, is centered on the manner in which the government has approached and viewed natural resources as the legitimate domain and subject of State policy making without considering other rights holders. Such claims of power comes with arbitrariness in policy making. In this respect the Thai government has been extremely inconsistent vis-\u00e0-vis its policies for natural resource management. Policies have been modified or changed radically to suit economic or political interests, and this is especially so when such policies intersect with indigenous hill peoples. As it has been observed, \u201c[the] government\u2019s political and administrative policy affecting tribal populations changes continually\u201d.120 For instance, while laws and policies on national parks and wildlife sanctuaries do not allow settlements or use of resources within its borders, and it has resulted in the relocation of indigenous hill peoples, tourism in these protected areas is widely promoted. Infrastructure and private construction for tourism is allowed in national parks.121 Use-rights of resources within national reserved areas and wildlife sanctuaries are ambiguous and not clarified. It gives vast leverage to authorities to use the law at their convenience. On the other hand, in areas where there is a strong collective community initiative, this ambiguity also allows indigenous communities to negotiate use rights with the local authorities. For instance, in the Sopsai watershed in Nan Province, indigenous villagers have been able to gain recognition from the local authorities over their \u201ccommunity forest\u201d and land use practices. This has been attributed to the presence of a strong community mobilization within the watershed.122 Similar experiences in other places have also been documented. 4.1.3 Citizenship Another significant factor compounding land tenure insecurity and affecting natural resource management is the denial of citizenship to a high number of indigenous hill peoples. As pointed out previously, the possession of citizenship documents is essential to accessing any facilities in Thailand. Without such document no use rights can be proven, let alone right over land. 119 Brenner et al. p. 11. 120 Chotichaipiboon. 121 Leepreecha, Prasit. (2005) p. 8. 122 Kitewachakul, Nitaya. (2005). 33 Citizenship and Land Rights In 1999, between April and June, indigenous hill people organized demonstration in Chiang Mai to ask for Thai nationality and land rights. The demonstration was broken up by 1,600 police and rangers in the middle of the night - presumably on the orders of the then governor of Chiang Mai.123 However it resulted in some efforts by the government to recognize the citizenship rights of indigenous hill peoples. After the protest of 1999, the government decided to review the citizenship applications. On 29 August 2000, the Cabinet adopted a resolution to complete the review of citizenship applications by 28 August 2001.124 Under the Cabinet Resolutions hill people were classified under three groups: 1. People residing in Thailand who migrated to Thailand between 1913 and 1972125; 2. People who migrated to Thailand between the 14th of December 1972 and the 3rd of October 1985 and are eligible for permanent resident status126; and 3. People who have allegedly migrated after 3 October 1985 and are considered \u201calien and illegal\u201d and can be forcibly removed from the country.127 The process of reviewing citizenship applications were to be completed within one year; however, four more subsequent cabinet resolutions were made and even by mid 2004 there were 377,677 individuals who did not have Thai citizenship or any legal status.128 In June 2005, in a meeting discussing citizenship rights, participants called for the amendment of Sec. 7 (bis) (3) of the Nationality Act which denies citizenship to children born to parents with alien status in Thailand. This provision is said to affect over 200,000 tribal children whose parents have yet to be granted legal status in the country. These children have been classified as stateless and, as such, have been denied rights to education, health services and other welfare benefits granted to a Thai citizen.129 The law requires proof that a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "967e0cba-7a87-446b-bf97-e256fe8bc4df": {"__data__": {"id_": "967e0cba-7a87-446b-bf97-e256fe8bc4df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0aa046ff4da5c84ff5150cb29f1edb080a574dac809395f25aa21e6fa884ba8d"}, "3": {"node_id": "d0c14558-528c-414a-9333-b0ace4d3152c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2177d2abc42ac663b14afdbfe4a53331886363f34bb1da8b20fad9a36d249a1a"}}, "hash": "f5e76f9b1900319097ee552237f9b5c45188cd18cffda8b852c977822aec2523", "text": "person, plus o
