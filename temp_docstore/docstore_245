This report compiles and reviews evidence from existing studies, exploring the linkages between gender inequality, economic growth and development. The findings suggest that decreasing gender inequalities has the potential of accelerating human development and growth.

Countries, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, and Nepal, where the girls\u2019 secondary enrolment ratio is below 50 percent also suffer from high child mortality. Asian history has shown countries that have invested in gender equality have been able to show early declines in fertility levels, which is vital to development. Thus, the report presents a \u2018business and development case\u2019 for equality interventions. However, severe disparities remain between countries in the Asia Pacific region in female education. Although primary school enrolment is improving in most countries of the Asia-Pacific region, change is slow in some countries and rural areas. Nearly half of the out-of-school girls in the world live in Asia and the Pacific. The Asia-Pacific setting shows that women have responded to education opportunities with enthusiasm and have made major contributions to the dynamism of the region. In this context, I am sure, this report is timely and would support policy makers in building a case for investment in gender equality. This report has been authored by Patricia Alexander under the guidance of Hafiz Pasha and the Gender Steering Committee with invaluable support from Koh Miayoi, James Lang, Radhika Behuria and Roohi Metcalfe. Mention must be made of Richard Leete for the conception of several of the charts on Asia-Pacific data, Bhagya Wickramaratne for sustained administrative support, and David Anandaraj for research assistance with data and chart formats. The Regional Centre in Colombo would also like to thank those who have read earlier drafts of this report and made valuable comments and suggestions, including Anuradha Rajivan, Claire Van der Vaeren, Yumiko Yamamoto, Yubaraj Khatiwada, Kazuyuki Uji, Gry Ballestad, Charmalee Jayasinghe, Caitlin Wiesen, Pramod Kumar and Anuradha Seth among others.

Omar.Noman Chief of Policies and Programmes UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo Foreword Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting vi Asia-Pacific: Education in Historical Perspective* Education, apart from its intrinsic value and status as a human development goal in its own right, has historically been valued by many Asia Pacific countries as a benefit to society. Whether by pursuing the goal of \u201ceducation for all\u201d, or by specifically targeting education of girls and women, over a period of three decades, the Region has raised its position in the global rankings for female education \u2013 at both the primary and higher levels. But the global rankings show that the region as a whole still has a long way to go to take a place at the top. Table I, below, shows that in the 1960s, of 93 countries for which data is available, no developing country in the Region ranked in the top 20 countries for average years of female primary schooling. Six countries in the region ranked among the bottom 20. Developed countries topped the rankings while least developed countries were at the bottom. Table.(I):.Average.Years.of.Female.Primary.Schooling,.Top.and. Bottom.20.Countries.

Barbados Belgium Pakistan Gambia Netherlands United States Bangladesh Liberia Norway Canada Afghanistan Benin Japan Sweden Benin Gambia Switzerland Netherlands Togo Mozambique Argentina Finland Central African Rep.

Gender Equality: An Economic Case Introduction While the commitment to gender equality by governments of the Asia-Pacific Region is of public record, and has been well articulated by many regional leaders, the resources to finance strategic investments to enable such equality are not easily available in practice. This report argues that finding the means to make these vital investments is not merely a choice but a necessity. It focuses on recent compilations of evidence showing that countries that have failed to narrow gender disparities have paid a price, and one that can be measured. Conversely, those countries that have invested in closing the gaps have benefited in ways that can also be quantified. Failure to decrease gender disparities has hampered the attainment of development goals, including less success in reducing child mortality, improving safe motherhood, and decreasing malnutrition rates. There also has been a cost to economic growth, and data are available to show how high the price has been. While economic growth alone is not enough to ensure development, there is general agreement that it is next to impossible to find investible resources\u2014which can fund other development objectives\u2014without economic growth. There is now available a new generation of studies that link gender equality in educational attainment to better development outcomes, and provide measures of degree. These studies emerge from a concurrence of several factors. In recent years there has been a better supply of high-quality datasets for longer historical periods and more countries. There has also been an evolution in computing methods, along with better techniques in econometrics, as these 30-year panel datasets have now been put to use for a decade and more, and tests of methodology and sensitivity are building a consensus of confidence in the conclusions they make possible. This report looks at empirical evidence that gender equality and progress in human development are linked, and that there is strong interaction between them. The reviewed studies ask, how the impact of gender equality is seen: are there elements of equality that can be viewed as both a consequence and a driver of human development? Not only do both women and men benefit when progress in human development gives them access to a better standard of living and quality of life, there are social and economic benefits too when women are better off. Because women hold so much responsibility for the livelihood of households, and for the nutritional care and health protection of children; and because messages to mothers reach their families and networks more effectively, women are key agents in the effort to extend services effectively. Put another way, the position of women in the economic and social fabric of society means that development objectives such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will not be achieved without incorporating women\u2019s priorities, potential for leadership, and full participation in the process of planning and human development.1 Gender equality is clearly a human rights issue, but the evidence shows that equality is a core issue of development effectiveness, essential to achieving lasting gains in all development", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "574ac2f8-7b57-423d-8b5b-850d5a36af5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "574ac2f8-7b57-423d-8b5b-850d5a36af5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18d8bc7992a3c8573019cb7a9bf1583710af8eb722d4a0b3e293d07467e22496"}}, "hash": "18d8bc7992a3c8573019cb7a9bf1583710af8eb722d4a0b3e293d07467e22496", "text": "programmes. By the time of the adoption of the Millennium Declaration in 2000, a mounting body of empirical evidence had demonstrated that countries\u2019 investments in gender equality, represented by a narrowing of education disparities, have paid off in higher growth, total fertility decline (resulting in better maternal and child survival), and better health outcomes. However, some of the strongest evidence has not been accessible to policy makers 1 For a list of the Millennium Development Goals, see p. vi. Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 2 Gender Equality: An Economic Case and opinion leaders: often it has been couched in complex econometric terminology, and presented in specialized journals that have not caught the attention of the media or of finance ministries in government. This report takes the most recent econometric results and presents them in some new forms that bring into sharp relief the \u2018business case\u2019 for specific equality interventions. The report is organized as follows. The rest of this section provides a discussion of the gender\u2013economy nexus and its drivers. Section 2 looks at the ways in which policy research has hypothesized the links from one factor to the others\u2014what are often termed transmission mechanisms\u2014foreshadowing the empirical evidence. It presents global data that demonstrate that these links are significant and persistent, as evidenced by long-period panel datasets now available. Section 3 relates the global evidence presented in Section 2 to current data for the Asia-Pacific countries. It shows some of the associations that would be expected in light of the global evidence, and also brings out exceptions linked to policy choices of countries. Some of these exceptions include countries that have been able to decrease gender disparities despite low income levels, and have seen related benefits occur in health and other development outcomes. Conversely, in other cases, countries that might have realized important gains have in some cases failed to capitalize on potential benefits\u2014as a consequence of institutional, traditional, or other factors. Section 4 provides some conclusions and priorities for strategic investments that can support efforts to meet Goal 3, and by integrating awareness of gender dimensions into investment decisions can better the chances of meeting all the MDGs. For convenience, the organization is summarized here: Women\u2019s Economic Rights Are Box 1: Economic Rights When the equality of men and women was first addressed in the UN covenants, equity was seen by some to be a matter falling exclusively under the rubric of civil and political rights. However, in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the UN member countries had established both components\u2014civil and political rights alongside economic and social rights\u2014as fundamental. As set out in subsequent agreements, economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCR) include the right to work and to safe working conditions; the right to an adequate standard of living, including food, clothing, social security, and housing; access to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; a healthy environment; and the right to education. The Vienna Declaration in 1993 historically recognized that violence against women and girls constitutes a severe violation of rights, and that women\u2019s rights are human rights The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly,1 defines discrimination against women, commits countries to incorporate the principle of equality of men and women in their legal system, and provides the basis for realizing equality between women and men through ensuring women\u2019s equal access to, and equal opportunities in, political and public life, education, health and employment. It is the only human rights treaty that affirms the reproductive rights of women and targets culture and tradition as influential forces shaping gender roles and family relations. Through these and various other supporting measures, the UN and its member countries have made it unequivocally clear that gender equality is a human rights issue. The importance of these concepts is their overriding of an earlier interpretation that the right to equality is limited to a civil and political right, which would not encompass the economic and social rights dimensions of women\u2019s inequality; they supersede a notion that the paradigm of ESCR is gender neutrality. Why is this important? Civil and economic rights are closely intertwined: for example, the right to speak freely means little if citizens do not enjoy a basic education. Similarly, the right to work means little if workers are not allowed to meet and assemble in groups to discuss their working conditions. Women\u2019s land rights intersect with other problems such as discriminatory inheritance patterns, agriculture and development issues, gender-based violence, the appropriation and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c093611-228a-4119-84cb-1808f412cb57": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c093611-228a-4119-84cb-1808f412cb57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bb474b250f540d97f0cc4f8e754b1d2f0d87de6f348b3b8c1dab679f522d4e7"}}, "hash": "4bb474b250f540d97f0cc4f8e754b1d2f0d87de6f348b3b8c1dab679f522d4e7", "text": "privatization of communal and indigenous lands, as well as gendered control over economic resources and the right to work. The interdependence of women\u2019s human rights highlights the importance of women being able to claim their rights to adequate housing and land, in order to lessen the threat of discrimination, different forms of violence, denial of political participation, and other violations of their economic human rights. Referring to economic, social, and cultural issues as \u2018rights\u2019 uses the legal framework developed under international law, and gives individuals legitimate claims against state and non-state actors for protection and guarantees. The human rights legal framework provides a way to hold public officials accountable for development policies and priorities.2 1 There are 185 signatories to CEDAW; of these 84 countries have also signed the Optional Protocol. 2 The background on the concept and applications of gender rights as economic, social, as well as political rights is taken from the Women\u2019s Economic Equality Project website (Center for Economic and Social Rights 2007), as well as the Australian National University College of Law series online (Bailey 2007). Section 1 Gender Equality: An Economic Case Section 2 Theoretical Linkages and Empirical Evidence Section 3 Asia-Pacific Setting: Education and Other Development Outcomes Section 4 Conclusions and Strategic Priorities Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 3 Human Rights By presenting the economic or \u2018efficiency\u2019 arguments for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, this report in no way minimizes the importance of human rights or \u2018equity\u2019 arguments\u2014these arguments are mutually supporting and not contradictory. The United Nations (UN) and its member countries, through their adoption of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and various other supporting measures, have made it unequivocally clear that gender equality is a human rights issue, and that the right to economic equality is an integral component of the whole panoply of rights to which all people are entitled. The right to equality is not limited to political and civil rights (see Box 1). By showing that the impairment of women\u2019s right to equality and empowerment both denies a human right and also sabotages development, we strengthen the argument that the right to human development itself is threatened by gender inequality. It is important to make the case, as the report does, for effective policy measures that help implement in practice the rights of all people to both equality and development. The Economy\u2013Gender Interaction The interaction between the economy and the nature or form of gender relations is complex. Because the relationships interact, effects may be compounded. Various writers have hypothesized effects in different ways. One way to conceptualize the possible interactions is to distinguish the direction and nature of potential effects. Some basic impact sequences can be formulated, as for example: \uf06c Economic inequalities and discrimination (between women and men) harm the development of women and girls, and ultimately do not benefit men and boys \uf06c Economic equality between women and men fosters the human development of both sexes \uf06c Gender stereotyping and inequalities limit the development of the economy and society, hampering the contributions of women and lowering productivity overall \uf06c Greater gender equality can promote economic growth, social development, and policy effectiveness. These hypotheses are summarized schematically in the Chart, on the basis of the direction and nature Chart: Effects of Gender Inequality and Equality Negative effects of inequality Economic and social inequality \uf075 gender disparity, negative effects on women and girls Gender inequality \uf075 economic development hampered Positive effects of equality Equal economic rights and opportunities \uf075 raise status of women More equal status of women and girls \uf075 benefits for economic and social development Economy \uf075 gender Gender \uf075 economy of effects between gender roles and economic outcomes. The major, though not exclusive, focus of this report is on the lower right-hand cell of the matrix in the Chart. The report draws on studies that have shown how investments in raising the capabilities and access of women and girls (specifically, raising women\u2019s and girls\u2019 attainment in secondary education) have contributed to social and economic outcomes that are of benefit to the whole society. How are these effects transmitted? Is there empirical evidence to support claims of association and causality? This report is laid out as a response to Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 4 these two questions, and provides a discussion of the empirical and policy work that has focused on them. To illustrate the mechanisms of transition, the discussion is grouped around several \u2018drivers\u2019 of human", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbfab03c-235a-4452-88e3-7f1881a91be4": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbfab03c-235a-4452-88e3-7f1881a91be4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93656f7683db1918077b061596cec74caa7d99ca0bb01a65d5a0645a43a58f68"}}, "hash": "93656f7683db1918077b061596cec74caa7d99ca0bb01a65d5a0645a43a58f68", "text": "development that are commonly identified with successful development interventions, namely education, health, labour force participation, and political representation. The driver identified by the report as prime mover to the others is access to education. The report addresses the impacts of education on subsequent outcomes, and looks at the feedback effects of the other factors and the broader implications for investment policy options. The contribution of the reviewed empirical work has been to zero in on gender gaps in education as the measure of choice for gender inequality as a whole, and to rigorously test the reliability of this measure as a predictor of economic growth, independent of other factors. The evidence then points to the ways in which decreasing disparities in education contributes beyond economic growth to other development objectives, including fertility decline, reduced child mortality, and improved nutritional outcomes\u2014all key targets of governments\u2019 development interventions. Drivers of the Gender\u2013Economy Nexus Raising the status of girls and women, which requires policy measures, interventions in infrastructure and services, and institutional change, brings about changes in economic and other human development outcomes by setting up a number of \u2018virtuous circles\u2019 that continue to impact on the abilities of the target and subsequent generations. We can clarify these numerous virtuous circles by focusing here on several priority ones: four key development interventions that are commonly identified as \u2018drivers\u2019 through which changes in conditions for women and girls in turn contribute to development in multiple sectors. These key intervention and investment areas are: education, health, employment, and political participation. (It is recognized that these interventions are not simply the product of financial investment alone. Besides adequate finances, each requires public policy decisions, and changes in the way services are designed, communicated, delivered, and developed over a sustained period.) The virtuous circles are deemed mutually supporting in the following set of feedback loops: \uf06c Education raises the qualifications and thus the eligibility of individuals to be selected for better jobs. This not only enables more (better educated) persons to attain higher incomes, but also is likely to afford them better access to information\u2014which provides the means to access health and other services, for themselves and their dependents. Further, persons earning higher incomes frequently become those who make up the better-informed population. A better quality of information in turn is likely to lead to a heightened demand for accountability of public officials\u2014a recognized driver of better governance\u2014and to augmented civic participation. Citizens who articulate their contribution to public opinion are likely to support policy options for more and better schools (among other services), thus continuing the cycle. \uf06c Health, under which general topic we include access to high-quality services in preventive care and nutrition and to a full range of sexual and reproductive health services, is a driver of improved morbidity and mortality outcomes. Better care and nutrition for the mother leads to lowered infant and child mortality, which provides the impetus for the demographic transition to lower fertility and mortality rates: families can choose to have fewer children when children\u2019s chances of survival are higher. With lower fertility rates, children and mothers enjoy better health, while lower dependency ratios mean that income is distributed over smaller numbers, thus raising the standard of living of households. \u201cEducation raises the qualifications and thus the eligibility of individuals to be selected for better jobs\u201d Gender Equality: An Economic Case Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 5 The education and health drivers work in tandem towards raising women\u2019s participation in higher-productivity labour force sectors. Better educational attainments and lower maternal and child mortality, with the accompanying reduction of total fertility, provide women with more opportunity to participate in income-earning activities. \uf06c A higher participation of women in non- agricultural wage labour may be a parallel occurrence with structural changes in the economy as investments in the industry and services sectors grow, drawing labour from low- productivity, low-income agriculture. A higher participation rate in the higher-productivity sector can be a route to better incomes, which are demonstrated to result in expanded child- related expenditures (such as schooling and better nutrition) when incomes go to women as opposed to incomes flowing to men. In parallel, better incomes provide the means to purchase some commodities and services that previously demanded unpaid labour time of women (such as substituting purchased energy sources for foraged biomass fuels). With more time available, more women can participate in community affairs, and are likely to experience greater civic awareness, to encounter opportunities for labour and community organizing, and to raise the demand for improved transparency in governance. \uf06c Participation in community", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "518ce2ca-0daa-4fcf-9e1a-c21b9f582ca0": {"__data__": {"id_": "518ce2ca-0daa-4fcf-9e1a-c21b9f582ca0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "937325e47785129beeefd5f2e799ec3e2266b6c33c9e66dc6265aaf0dc2fffa9"}}, "hash": "937325e47785129beeefd5f2e799ec3e2266b6c33c9e66dc6265aaf0dc2fffa9", "text": "and political affairs not only drives improved governance, but also broader access to services that governments make available to their populations, and therefore a better quality of life overall. There is evidence from many countries that a larger presence of women in national and local government changes the emphasis of public sector programmes (see Box 10), and can lead to augmented and better use of aid flows towards the social sectors. These drivers interact, and reinforce each other. Linkages between some of these drivers are illustrated in the chart in Box 2, which focuses on three related indicators. The chart suggests an impact of total fertility rates (TFRs) and of the availability of health services (resulting from social infrastructure investments) on mortality outcomes. The chart shows maternal mortality ratios (MMRs\u2014 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births), plotted against the percentage of births that are attended by skilled health personnel, for selected Asia-Pacific countries for which data are available in the period 2000\u20132005. The data indicate a high correspondence between the provision of peri-natal services and the rate of maternal mortality. (The data for the chart are given in Annex 1.) (The reduction of maternal mortality is one of the targets of MDG 6, Improve maternal health.) As expected, where countries are able to bring support services to women giving birth, survival of mothers is significantly better. The Box 2: Information is a Sound Investment: India\u2019s National Family Health Survey As countries strive to achieve economic development, it is vital that they focus on ways to improve the health, education, and status of women, especially those in the rural and poorer areas. Increasing the human capital and productivity of a vast proportion of the population that has been neglected will have beneficial effects on poverty reduction and economic growth, and will in addition have favourable intergenerational and dynamic effects. The interactions between women\u2019s condition and development indicators are easily identified in systematic data studies. In India, the National Family Health Survey 2005\u201306 (NFHS), conducted by the Union Health Ministry and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), was released in 2007. The Survey found that malnutrition affects almost 46 percent of children under the age of three. The worrying Indian levels have persisted despite the record GDP annual growth rate of eight percent over the past three years and forecasts of 9.3 percent for 2007. The NFHS found that levels of anaemia in children and women had worsened compared to seven years ago\u2014around 56 percent of women and 79 percent of children below three years old were anaemic. The Survey found only a marginal drop in the number of underweight children compared to the NFHS seven years ago when levels were recorded at around 47 percent. Indian per capita incomes are higher than those in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), yet nutrition levels in India are poorer. About 35 percent of children in the SSA region are malnourished\u2014significantly lower than the Indian rate. UNICEF officials confirmed that nutrition levels in India were not so much related to lack of food as was the case in many parts of Africa, but because of the frequency and quality of food intake of children. UNICEF identified lack of knowledge on the part of mothers on how to care for sick children and poor health services as contributing factors in the high levels of under-five mortality (Bhalla 2007). This example highlights the importance of investing in the education of women. By enhancing their status and self-confidence, education provides an avenue of access for women to their own better health, and to knowledge of health issues for their children. What is more, because of the intergenerational impact, it is not only the children of these women who will benefit, but even the subsequent generations of girls who grow up to bear children themselves. Such instrumentalist arguments for women\u2019s education can only add weight to the commitment to \u201ceducation for all\u201d that reflects the intrinsic value of learning to every human being. Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 6 Box 3: Lower MMRs with Skilled Birth Attendants, and with Lower Fertility Rates The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has been selected as one of the MDG indicators; its importance extends beyond that of a health measure alone. Because nearly all maternal deaths can be prevented if a mother can reach an equipped birthing facility, the indicator is a measure of the conditions for women and children, and of the capacity of a country to provide services to the population.

Some countries with high fertility rates in harsh post-conflict settings (Afghanistan and Timor-Leste, for example) have experienced great difficulty in bringing down MMRs.

By comparison, 12 of 13 countries with MMRs below 100 provided skilled birth attendants in more than 95 percent of all cases. High total fertility, which increases the physiological burden on mothers, is also closely related in the data to higher MMRs. Very high fertility (7.3 and 7.8 births per woman) is observed in Afghanistan and Timor- Leste, two of the four highest mortality countries. In 13 of the 17 countries with MMR above 100, TFR is also above the data average of three births per woman.

Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 7 The discussion of key drivers of development is intuitively appealing. However, policy makers need to work on the basis of evidence. They quite reasonably want to determine which \u201cdrivers\u201d have the most impact, which knock-on effects can be expected, and where resources should be directed. Determining that some interventions generate benefits beyond their economic cost, and that some have a measurable effect on economic growth that is stronger than that of other interventions makes possible strategic choices, and eases the challenge of effective allocation of scarce resources. This section summarizes the theoretical effects that have been hypothesized to explain the impact of increasing gender equality. It then presents empirical results that for the first time have made it feasible to entertain direction-of-causality propositions, to arrive at a quantitative measure of the strength of these effects, and to confirm the robustness of these measures. These results rest on empirical evidence that had partially supported these hypotheses over the past three decades, but more recently has been assembled into a series of multi-country studies. The discussion first introduces the data, and then fills in some details on how the findings were made and tested and the investment coefficients they represent. Direct and Indirect Effects of Development Interventions The effects of investments in education have long been appreciated for the ways they can contribute to productivity and total output. While education is of value in and of itself, and a human right, research has also pointed to the additional instrumental effects\u2014 contributions to economic growth, and to various development goals including child mortality, fertility, nutrition, and the education of the next generation. A decade and a half ago, the classic finding was made by Lawrence Summers, in a review of comprehensive research results, that investment in the education of girls may be the highest return of investment available in the developing world (Summers, 1991).3 His work summarized a number of well-substantiated findings that: (i) higher death rates are symptomatic of the more general pattern of female deprivation in the developing world; (ii) underinvestment in girls is an economic problem resulting from a vicious cycle caused by distorted 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b2a18b9-d259-48b2-871e-37173d67bfb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b2a18b9-d259-48b2-871e-37173d67bfb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eba871a693e4fd1008744ec284240251dc023baf49baf29ad70ff23a3a559f0a"}, "2": {"node_id": "37c14ab2-d5ea-4385-9cc1-a68bf241b902", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0610d56c153310cfdb5c70af6cc19678dddde00f9b15d11e3ded78ec8dbe8e66"}}, "hash": "b3d1364807af7cea662457089f71952ec984261a6ec5337db32b97af6542ac02", "text": "Theoretical Linkages and Empirical Evidence incentives; (iii) educated women choose to have fewer children and can provide more for those they do have; (iv) the social benefits alone of increased female education are more than sufficient to cover its costs; and (v) priorities should be to reduce the cost of schooling for girls and make special efforts to accommodate the practical needs of parents.

He calculated that if more girls had gone to school a generation previously, millions of infant deaths could have been averted each year, and tens of millions of families could have been healthier and happier. The econometric literature that followed on Summers\u2019 focus on the key role of female education hypothesized that educational effects operate in direct and indirect ways.4 Three important routes for the transmission of the education effects were most often suggested: via economic growth, reduction of fertility, and improved child survival and health. These are explained below. Economic growth: As direct effects, by simple logical reasoning, if fewer girls than boys are able to acquire an education (and we assume that the innate abilities of girl and boy children are equivalent), then the society would lose out from inequality in two ways: fewer educated adults enter the workforce, and the average ability of those who go to school would be lower than it would be if the whole pool of children had access to education. A series of positive effects are believed to flow, by this and related reasoning, from female education directly to higher productivity of human capital and higher economic growth (even controlling for prevailing employment rates), and indirectly to higher quality of education through generational and sibling mutual-support effects.4 Fertility: Female education has been shown to have a direct effect on total fertility (and attendant health benefits of birth spacing), which then is believed to support growth via indirect demographic effects. The \u2018new household economics\u2019 of the post-WWII era modeled the effects of higher opportunity costs of educated women (of staying at home rather than participating in the wage labour market), and greater bargaining power of women with higher education, and showed that female education is an important determinant of the fertility rate.5 3 This paper was subsequently published in an expanded and updated version in L. H. Summers (1994), \u2018Investing in All the People: Educating Women in Developing Countries\u2019, Seminar Paper 45, Economic Development Institute, World Bank, Washington, D.C. 4 This account of the theoretical links draws on the presentations of Abu-Ghaida and Klasen (2004) and Klasen (2002). 5 In the 1960s, American economist Gary Becker and other human capital theorists developed the New Household Economics, which for the first time applied market concepts and models to household production and time allocation analysis. These new tools were used to explain the gendered division of labour, market behaviour of household members, and male\u2013female differences within these. In the 1970s and 1980s, these concepts were applied to further analyses, in both industrialized and developing countries, of labour market discrimination, and to bargaining models of the household which allowed for dimensions of power and conflict in decision making. (Alexander, P. 2000). Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 8 Indirectly, higher education levels and ratios, by lowering fertility and hence population growth, lower the dependency burden (increase the proportion of income earners). This raises the supply of savings in the economy, and raises investment demand (for physical plant and social infrastructure) as the economy expands. In societies where the expanded workforce is absorbed into employment, per capita economic growth will rise, even if wages and productivity remain at previous levels.6 The demographic effect is temporary, since eventually the working-age population will reach retirement age, and fewer children will have entered the labour force to support them; nevertheless, if the temporary wave of workers is able to find employment, the boon can accelerate growth in an important take- off period. Some economists estimate that 1.1\u20131.9 percent of the per capita annual growth in East and Southeast Asia between 1966 and 1990 was due to this temporary opportunity, and that the contribution to reduced fertility made by high female education was a large indirect component of the increase\u2014quantifiable in addition to the measured direct contribution of lower fertility and child mortality (discussed further on).7 Child.mortality.and.malnutrition: Child survival rates are higher where mothers are better educated, because the care of children is preponderantly in the hands of mothers. Education increases mothers\u2019 knowledge of important factors in child health, such as vaccination and nutrition requirements, sanitation practices, and better breastfeeding regimes. Increased bargaining power also increases mothers\u2019 say over the allocation of household resources, and this may result in more expenditure going to child health, nutrition, and schooling. Historical Debates on the Determinants of Growth, and Contemporary Evidence Since the Millennium Summit in 2000, discussion on the impact of investments in social interventions has increasingly influenced debates in macroeconomics, specifically on the determinants of economic growth.

Modern macroeconomics has been largely an effort to identify the forces and settings that spur or hamper it, and to predict the impact that policy can have on the rate of growth. Beginning with Solow and Samuelson in the 1950s and 1960s, technological change and the rate of investment were the focus of attention, and attempts were made to model this relationship. Later theorists focused on the development of \u2018human capital\u2019\u2014education and innovation\u2014as additional and important determinants of economic growth. More recently, econometric methods have been used to test and quantify the role of capital investment (initial levels and rates of increase), savings, population growth, and human capital accumulation, as well as geographic factors, political stability, trade openness, and a range of fiscal and monetary policy environments and approaches. Until recently, few of the \u2018growth theories\u2019 had looked at gender and inequality as important contributing factors, although some researchers showed a reverse relationship: that low levels of development and economic growth appeared consistently to present barriers to women\u2019s access to higher educational attainment. They examined how educational decisions are made by households: the costs and benefits that determine how much families invest in educating their daughters and their sons, and the choices poor families make when potential earning outcomes of girls and boys are unequal (King and Hill, 1993). In the same period, a widely reported study of a growth \u2018success story\u2019 in Asia offered not a theoretical but an empirical link with long-term investments. It took note of a possible effect of investments in education for girls. In an exhaustive examination of the \u2018East Asian miracle\u2019, which searched for clues to these countries\u2019 success, researchers pointed out 6 Studies reviewed in Abu-Ghaida and Klasen (2004: 6\u20137 ff.). 7 Klasen (1999: 8; 2002: 352). Theoretical Linkages and Empirical Evidence Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 9 that the high-performing Asian economies (HPAEs) were the earliest to close the gender gap in primary education and to improve girls\u2019 access to secondary education (World Bank, 1993, p. 47) (see Box 4).8 While closing inequality gaps in education is one part of the story, it is clear that many other factors play a role in generating economic growth. The question asked by the current group of studies is, to what extent or by how much does a long-term reduction of gender inequalities contribute to economic growth? Does a better level of female education, in and of itself, have a positive effect on economic growth, and can the impact be measured? Further, to demonstrate a possible direction of causality, it is important to look at countries\u2019 experience over time, and to control for other factors. Although suitably large datasets were not available until recently to test gender effects within the determinants of long-term growth, this situation has changed in the past decade, with better and more extensive data being put to use by researchers (including 30-year time series, cross-sectional datasets, and panel data). The.30-year.Datasets The data referred to in this report are a group of panel datasets that are complete for the years 1960 to about 1992. They were drawn from several sources by independent researchers and used over the period leading up to and since the Millennium Summit. A number of papers using these data have been presented in conferences and published in academic journals.9 The work over the past decade has particular value because the ongoing development debate has refined the specification of models, making it possible to isolate and test several important factors, and to quantify the contribution of each of them.10 Why, it might be asked, is it useful mid-way through the Millennium commitment, to make reference to datasets that end ten years before the Millennium Summit took place? There are two important reasons. First, these data cover a full generation of investments and development outcomes and thus provide an opportunity to study the results of different kinds of investments over the long term. They make up the first data series that are complete for all indicators and for a large enough number of countries to make comparisons meaningful for every region. This key dataset is in current use by authors in the fields of growth theory, development strategy, gender, and a host of related areas in health, education, public policy, and governance.

It is the synthesis of the studies of the past decade and more that is the real story. It is the consensus on the degree of impact of investments in gender equality, and Box 4: The \u2018East Asian Miracle\u2019 and Education for Girls The high-performing Asian economies (HPAEs) closed the gender gap in primary education much earlier than other countries at the same level of per capita income.8 The research found that the extension of education to girls was not necessarily achieved by means of strongly gender-focused policies; however, the national commitment to education as a key means of raising incomes swept all children, boys and girls, onto the enrolment bandwagon. \u2018East Asia was faster in eliminating gender gaps in enrollment. \u2026 Nearly all societies have historically provided educational opportunities first to boys and only later, usually gradually, to girls. This gender gap in education may have far-reaching effects on development if, for example, the lower educational attainments of women reduce their ability to improve nutrition or sanitation at home or their productivity outside the home. The HPAEs narrowed the gender gap much more quickly than other developing economies, despite cultural norms that put greater value on the education of sons and, in some cases, actively discouraged the education of daughters. \u2026 In general, the reduction of gender gaps resulted from a successful push for universal education rather than a deliberate attention to the education of females. Nonetheless \u2026 the specific benefits of educating girls appear to have been substantial\u2019 (World Bank 1993: 47). 8 The World Bank\u2019s investigation into the post-WWII success of East Asia designated several East and Southeast Asian economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Thailand as \u2018high-performing Asian economies (HPAEs)\u2019. The development strategies they discerned in the rapid development of these economies replicated a pattern seen earlier in Meiji Japan, and subsequently in China and Viet Nam. This study and later debate around the success of these economies\u2019 strategies produced a general acknowledgement that the HPAEs had not followed a \u2018hands-off\u2019 approach to development, but had actively intervened to guide investment patterns through managed incentive structures, even though the HPAEs all represented market-driven economic systems. 9 Data on incomes and growth generally have been drawn from the Penn World Tables, on employment from NBER and WISTAT, on child mortality and female share of the labour force from World Development Indicators and UNICEF, and schooling from tables compiled by Barro and Lee (1995).

The empirical work on the role of gender disparities in education contributes systematic reaffirmation of the use of educational targets and indicators to stand as a proxy for the gender equality goal, in the MDGs and other development strategies. A core message of these studies is that the education indicator works, not because gender equality in education is sufficient on its own to achieve full equality and empowerment of women, but precisely because the impact of girls\u2019 education, and of the gender gap in education, have been shown by this decade-long discussion to be important factors, consistently and over time, affecting health, mortality, and fertility, as well as economic growth itself.

Theoretical Linkages and Empirical Evidence Figure 1: Growth Rate of Per Capita GDP, and Increase in Years of Female Schooling (Average for 1960-1992), 109 Countries, by Region Note: SA: South Asia; SSA: sub-Saharan Africa; ECA: Eastern Europe and Central Asia; EAP: East Asia and Pacific; LAC: Latin America and Caribbean; MNA: Middle East and North Africa; OECD: Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Data refer to unweighted averages of the countries in each region. Left and right axes are different scales. Source: Constructed from data in Klasen (2002). Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 11 Measurable.Effects The central, and probably the strongest, result of the use of global panel data has been to provide real numbers that quantify the gains and losses countries can expect, depending on whether they heed or ignore the core gender disparity message. The first, striking observation from the panel data was the strong correlation between income growth and women\u2019s schooling. The data showed that on average, country groups that had the most success in raising the schooling attainment of the female population of age 15 years and above, were also the country groups with the highest per capita GDP growth rates. Figure 1 shows a comparison of growth rates of per capita GDP over a 30-year period, and the growth rate of schooling attainment for females over 15 years of age, over the same period, for 109 countries for which comparable data were available, including both industrialized and developing countries. The countries are arranged in seven economic and geographic groupings, and the representation of countries in each group was sufficient to allow for robust comparison. The average compounded annual per capita GDP growth rate over the period 1960-1992 for each group is shown in one series of points, while another series shows the average annual growth of total years of schooling of the female population aged 15 years and above (data for this indicator were available for the period 1960-1990), again for each group. (See Annex 1 for data for the figure.) East Asia and Pacific countries (including Southeast Asia) have had the highest per capita annual growth rates over the period, averaging 4.2 percent for the region as a whole. Eastern Europe/ Central Asia and the OECD countries also had a high average growth rate, both regions averaging 3.2 percent per annum. South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle-East and North Africa regions have experienced low or very low growth\u2014all below 2 percent per annum. The figure also shows the average annual rate of growth of years of schooling of the female population aged over 15 years. Again, East Asia and Pacific countries raised years of schooling for girls by 0.11 percent per year, on average, over a 30-year period. Close to this rate was the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region, with 0.09 percent growth per year, and Middle East\u2014North African countries at the same pace. By contrast, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa raised female schooling at a much slower rate\u2014by 0.06 and 0.04 percent per year, respectively. The rate for OECD countries is not high, but this reflects the existing low gender gaps in educational attainment already reached by the starting point of the datasets (1960). The regional pattern of these two indicator growth experiences is arresting. In all country groups but one, the relative pace of the growth of female educational attainment is matched by the relative pace of per capita GDP growth. The East-Asia and Pacific group, with the highest rate of per capita GDP growth over 30 years, also led all other country groups with its 0.11 percent annual increase in years of schooling attainment for women.

By comparison, lower growth groupings (below 2 percent per annum), notably South Asia and sub- Saharan Africa, also failed to raise women\u2019s schooling attainment at the pace of other regions. The most evident exception to the pattern is the group of Middle-East and North Africa countries. These countries appear to present a counter-factual experience that underlines the case; that is, despite the increase in schooling for females, which has been important in the region on average, most Middle- East and North Africa countries have not seen a large share of women enter the wage labour market. These countries appear not to have capitalized on the potential contribution of women to productivity and output. The results in Figure 1 illustrate a correlation between two indicators averaged over a 30-year period: (i) average annual growth of years of schooling, for females over 15 years of age, and (ii) the average rate of growth of per capita GDP, for a large number of countries. The question of interest, in the face of the correlation pattern, is how much this female schooling effect may have directly or indirectly been a contributor to the different rates of economic growth of the countries studied.12 Could a direction of causality be established; that is, has female schooling itself affected the rate of economic growth, or has high schooling merely been a result of rising incomes? 12 The coefficient of correlation is 0.70. Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 12 In the face of this strong result, users of the panel data have made efforts to address the direction of causality issues, and other explanatory factors. Using various forms of growth regression frameworks, they used the data to model the impact of macroeconomic and other factors that might be expected to affect growth rates. They included in the models, among other variables, the initial level of GDP, investment rates and trade openness (as shares of GDP), the level of technology, population as well as labour force growth, dummy variables to represent regional factors, and education specified in various forms. Both female and male schooling, rates of increase, and ratios between these levels and rates of change were modeled, while in several studies total years of schooling at the starting point (1960) was included as a variable. Considering a range of variables in the model, the result of regression analysis showed that, while initial GDP levels had a strong effect, as did the total increase in schooling for both females and males, the next most important effects were the decrease in gender disparities in education, measured by means of two variables, namely the gender ratio for years of schooling at the starting year, and the growth of that female\u2013male schooling ratio over the period. Beginning with economic growth as the dependant variable, regression analysis showed the relative impact of each of the factors, controlling for all other factors (including some variables not listed in the summary). In the one study shown (Knowles, Lorgelly and Owen (2002), see Table 2), the impact of gender inequality in education on levels of GDP per capita is estimated. Using average levels of female and male education (in log form) over the 30-year period, the authors find that female education has a significant positive impact on GDP levels. For every 1 percent rise in female education, levels of GDP per capita are shown to be 0.37 percent higher, while the rate of growth of per capita GDP would be 0.21 percent faster. In other parameterizations of the model, they find that gender inequality specifically, modelled as a ratio of female to male educational attainment, significantly reduces per capita income levels.13 The initial educational gender equality ratio (in 1960) is seen to have a strong effect on growth performance over the period, as is the rise in gender equality. In the studies, these two effects are stronger than that of average investment levels, openness to trade, and labour force growth over this 30-year term. As hypothesized in the discussion on growth and development linkages, population growth (linked to fertility) has a measured negative effect.

(In the case of African countries, the effect of gender disparities in education appears to be even stronger than in other regional developing countries.)14 Education.Gender.Gap:.A.Measure.of.Gender. Inequality One of the features of the research is the use of gender inequality in education as a measurement yardstick, to some degree representing gender inequality overall. This factor has the advantage of being observable and measurable, and one for which data is available for most countries. By contrast, gender inequality as a concept is too broad and general to be specifically measured, while some other components of gender inequality, such as individual poverty, resource allocation within the household, and unpaid (unrecorded) economic activity usually are not captured in country statistical studies such as the census or the household socio- economic survey, and not available in consistent form for more than a few countries. (Box 6 reviews the different variables used in the reviewed studies, and the alternate forms in which education was included as a variable.)

In their drafting of MDG-linked investment plans, policy makers facing constrained budgets are concerned to know the following: Are given 13 This can be stated as a 0.37 growth elasticity of female education. Male education is found to have only an insignificant impact (Knowles, Lorgelly and Owen 2002). Re-parameterization based on Klasen (1999), cited in Abu-Ghaida and Klasen (2004). 14 Studies on earlier data that found the impact of female education to be ambiguous (the best known by Dollar and Gatti 1999) have been rejected by several authors because of their use of a shorter time frame (1975-1990) and poor specification of the education variables; see Abu-Ghaida and Klasen (2004: 9) and Klasen (2002: 350, 357-58, 369-70) and Klasen (1999: 19\u201321). Theoretical Linkages and Empirical Evidence Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 13 Box 5: Summary of Empirical Findings of Reviewed Papers In a summary of empirical work by eight authors, the reviewers reported robust findings that over a 30-year time frame, countries with higher levels of gender equality in education (that is, a higher ratio of female to male educational attainment) experience higher per capita income levels and higher GDP growth rates, and conversely, those that have been slower to close the gap have faced slower growth than their neighbours. To ensure that the studies did not merely identify higher overall education levels on the basis of the greater wealth in richer countries, the authors controlled for such factors as the average level of education in the countries under study, their investment rates, population growth, and the specific technological levels in these economies (Abu-Ghaida and Klasen, 2004, pp. 8-11). The review also reported strong findings that a large gender gap in education has other negative effects experienced as slower decline in fertility rates, higher rates of child mortality, and higher prevalence of child malnutrition (Ibid., pp. 112-13). The reviewed studies are summarized in the table below. The development indicators studied (per capita income, fertility decline, child malnutrition, and mortality), are shown in column (1), while the educational variables used to assess the impact on these indicators are shown in column (3). The measured results, shown in column (2), demonstrate that countries with higher observed levels of female education or more rapid reduction of education gender gaps (the variables of column (3)) experienced better results in per capita income growth and slower progress in social indicators\u2014by the range of amounts shown across the studies.

Is it possible to quantify the impact of investments in gender equality? While results averaged over many different countries cannot predict impact in any one instance, findings for the group can give an indication of the impact experienced by countries when regarded over time. The studies tested gender equality investments for their impact on several economic and development outcomes, namely GDP level and rate of growth, total fertility, child mortality, and malnutrition rates. Figures 2a and 2b summarize the findings on economic growth\u2014which were consistent in order of magnitude in the work of different authors. All studies found consistently that increasing gender equality (represented by closing the gender gap in secondary education) corresponded with a positive and significant effect on the level of per capita GDP at any point in time. As shown in Figure 2a, study authors found that for a 1 percent rise in female schooling levels, the level of per capita GDP at any time was 0.37 percent higher (while controlling for all other factors, including investment and initial GDP levels, population and labour force growth). Overall, the empirical results indicate that countries with lower educational attainment for females will suffer lower per capita growth rates of 0.1 to 0.3 percent per year, implying that over the period of the MDG objectives (2000-2015), a country that had a purchasing power parity based GDP per capita of $1500 in 1995 would have missed out on a 10 percent higher income for every person by the 2015 target year\u2014and the effect would appear to be largest for those countries where the gap is most severe.15 The effect of closing the gender gap in secondary education was tested by several of the studies. Figure 2a shows reported findings that for a 1 percent rise in the ratio of female to male secondary schooling, annual per capita GDP growth rates were higher by 0.30 percent.16 Figure 2b illustrates three additional development outcomes tested by this group of studies including TFR, under-five mortality rate (U5MR), and child malnutrition. All three indicators showed a measured impact from raising female secondary schooling, defined in different ways. For example, a 1-year rise in schooling attainment of females over 15 years of age was found to decrease TFR by 0.36 percent. Looking at child mortality, a 1 percent rise in the female\u2013male secondary schooling ratio was found to decrease U5MR by 1.42 percent. A 1 percent increase in the female secondary enrolment rate decreased child malnutrition rates by 0.17 percent.

The value of the work of Klasen and others in this group of studies rests on the high quality of the panel data, the repeated testing of the assumptions by many authors, the specifications of the models; that is, what factors are judged to be relevant, and how these factors are used (e.g. as stocks, flows, levels, change and rates of change, etc.), and the sensitivity analysis done on these elements. 15 Abu-Ghaida and Klasen (2004: 19-21). 16 Klasen (2002: 362). 17 Abu-Ghaida and Klasen (2004: 12).

The implications of Figures 2a and 2b are noteworthy: the indicators represent consistent global findings that are measured across very different countries. In the context of strategic investment planning to finance MDG-based planning, such persuasive evidence of the impact of closing gender gaps on per capita incomes, health, and mortality makes important input available to decision makers. Section 3 looks at these gender drivers and outcomes again, focusing on the Asia-Pacific region and the current performance of selected countries for which data are available. Several of the factors discussed are MDG indicators. Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 16 In the light of the evidence that investments in gender equality make good business sense\u2014that is, they are shown to enjoy significant and positive returns in long-term data worldwide\u2014this section now turns to the Asia-Pacific setting. A check of the current data for the region provides a snapshot that tells us how well countries are managing to reduce gender gaps in education, specifically secondary education. We also look at the degree to which performance in schooling attainment for girls may be linked to income levels. Second, this section looks at the picture for other development indicators. We focus on the four drivers identified in Section 1 as key to positive development outcomes: in addition to education, we look at health services, participation in the modern wage sector, and political representation. This discussion is set in the context of investment needs of Asia-Pacific region countries to meet their own MDG targets. To focus on the investments that are likely to provide the greatest return in promoting women\u2019s rights and demonstrated contributions, we return to the approach of focusing on the four key drivers of development identified in Section 1: education, health, labour force participation, and political representation. The section presents current data available for development indicators under these broad topics, and points to concerns for promoting equality and empowerment for girls and women. Some current critical issues are highlighted 3.

However, in South Asia, female literacy rates remain staggeringly low. In Pakistan, there are only 64 literate women for every 100 literate men. Compared to 57 percent of Afghan men, 86 percent of Afghan women are illiterate. In secondary schooling there are many countries at risk of not meeting MDG target 4, i.e. to eliminate gender disparities in both primary and secondary education by 2015 (the interim target, for 2005, was missed by more than 20 countries). The regional divergence at the secondary level is wider than at the primary level. In East Asia and the Pacific broadly half of children of both sexes are in secondary school. However, in South Asia this number is only 40 percent. The findings of the global data reviewed earlier focused on the importance of secondary schooling of girls in particular. The gender gap in secondary schooling remains the most pressing issue for countries. The gender gap in South Asia is the widest reported for any region worldwide. While 44 percent of boys in South Asia are enrolled in secondary schools of all types, only 36 percent of girls are enrolled.18 18 UNICEF (2007) \u201cThe gender gap in secondary schooling remains the most pressing issue for countries. The gender gap in South Asia is the widest reported for any region worldwide\u201d Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 17 Figure 3 shows girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 secondary school gross enrolment ratios (GERs) for most Asia-Pacific countries, as of 2005.19 As noted above, many countries in the region not only show serious gender gaps in enrolment ratios, but also experience low enrolments overall, particularly in South Asia. Bangladesh, where the government for many years has implemented important programmes of support to girls\u2019 schooling using stipends and other family incentives, has more girls than boys enrolled at the secondary level. Total enrolment in Bangladesh, 19 The secondary school gross enrolment ratio (GER) for all children, or for each sex, is the ratio of the number of children in secondary schools to the number of children of secondary school age in the population. It can be calculated for each sex, as well (i.e. girls\u2019 GER, boys\u2019 GER). Because the number includes enrolled students above and below the secondary school age, the ratio can be greater than 100 percent. Figure 3: Secondary School GERs, by Sex, Selected Asia-Pacific Countries Source: UNICEF (2007) Data for 2005 or latest year available however, has not yet passed the 50 percent mark. Nepal also has difficulty reaching 50 percent enrolment, and the gender gap is significant (46 percent GER for boys, compared with 40 percent for girls). India and Pakistan experience low enrolment ratios overall, and large gender gaps, with 50 percent of girls in secondary school in India, 13 percent behind boys, and just 23 percent of girls in Pakistan, 8 percent behind boys\u2019 secondary enrolment. Other low enrolment ratios occur in some least- Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 18 developed countries (LDCs), and some (but not all) of the Pacific island countries. Some Pacific island countries, by comparison, have achieved high secondary enrolment ratios, with very good results for girls. In Fiji, Kiribati, Palau and Tonga, enrolments in secondary school represent more than 80 percent of children in the age group, and these ratios for girls are higher than for boys. (As explained in the footnote, enrolment of children above and below the age group accounts for ratios that exceed 100%.) The enrolment ratios of girls and boys shown in Figure 3 are relatively high for many but not all countries. With notable exceptions, the regional achievement in secondary education is creditable. (Data for Figure 3 are given in Annex 1.) However, the exceptions give cause for concern. Since educating girls through the secondary level has been seen in global data to have a marked impact on the key development indicators, including economic growth and better mortality and nutrition outcomes for all, meeting the secondary-education-for-girls target is of vital interest to achieving targets in other key areas. While the global data suggest that countries cannot afford not to send girls to school through the primary and secondary levels, it is nevertheless reasonable to look at regional performance to see whether income at the national level explains low ratios where they occur.

Bangladesh, Kiribati, Mongolia, and Sri Lanka, for example, with per capita GDP below $1000 per year, have all achieved gender parity in secondary enrolment.20 As noted earlier, in some cases, girls\u2019 enrolments in secondary school have surpassed those of boys.

While many countries with high female secondary enrolment (GER) have low TFRs (including China, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam), others have had a strong pro-natality culture that may have countered the typical effect of female education. Examples of high TFRs persisting alongside high female education include the Philippines (3.2 births per woman) and several Pacific Island countries (Federated States of Micronesia 4.3, Kiribati 4.0, Samoa 4.2, Tonga 3.3, and Tuvalu 3.6). As may be expected, low female education levels are associated in Asia-Pacific with high TFRs, and this association is borne out in Cambodia (3.9), Lao PDR (4.5), Pakistan (4.1), Papua New Guinea (3.8), Solomon Islands (4.0), Timor-Leste (7.5), and Vanuatu (3.9). Education.and.Adolescent.Fertility A dimension of these data that warrants close attention is the rise of fertility among adolescents. Over the 1990\u20132000 decade prior to the Millennium Summit, the progress in reducing births among very young women was slow in Asia-Pacific; and in South and West Asia adolescent fertility rates (live births in one year per 1000 women aged 15-19 years) have in fact increased, as Figure 6 shows. The evidence indicates that the risk for pregnancy- related death is twice as high for adolescents aged 15\u201319 years and five-fold for adolescents aged 10\u201314 years, as compared to that for women in their early twenties. In addition, high adolescent fertility rates impact on a young person\u2019s opportunities to further schooling and to engage in a better quality of income earning activities (Barroso and Girard 2003: 4). There is a clear need to address not only education but the quality and content of education, including reproductive and sexual health education for young people. Rising trends in adolescent fertility rates are a cause for concern. Generally, higher education is associated with lower adolescent fertility in the Asia- Pacific region. Figure 7 shows recent reported levels of adolescent fertility in association with female enrolment ratios (GERs) at the secondary school level Worldwide, 10 percent of all births are attributable to adolescents, with the attendant risks of this age group. An attendant policy concern is the high level of unmet demand for birth control information.

The Asia-Pacific region demonstrates, as well, observed correlations in recent data between these outcomes and child survival.

The Government of Fiji requested the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to collaborate with UNFPA and other partners to support curriculum development on FLE, which emphasises family life and relationships, for example: preparation for marriage, household finances, parenting skills and life planning. The Government has supported the inclusion of sexual and reproductive health in the curriculum to address the issues of sexually transmitted infections, HIV and AIDS and teenage pregnancy. Courses will also cover population growth, personal health and nutrition, self-esteem and gender roles Source: Fiji Times, 2007. Asia-Pacific Setting: Education And Other Development Outcomes Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 21 secondary GERs in the data (see Annex 1 for data), at less than 25. Other countries where the GER is below 50 also suffer high child mortality, including Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Nepal. These data recall the outcomes linked to female education over time, shown in Figure 1, which summarized a persistent lag in closing gender gaps in the South Asian sub-region over the 30-year period investigated. (Sri Lanka appears in these data as an exception to the South Asian experience, with female secondary education ratios of 83, and low child mortality of 14 per 1000 births.) In countries with high female GERs, there is an observed correlation with low child mortality. Fiji, Republic of Korea, Palau, Japan, and Tonga all have GERs for girls above 90, and U5MR below 25 per thousand. These outcomes appear to be not entirely dependent on national income. The per capita annual GDP of these countries ranges from a low of $1930 (Tonga) to a high of $36,500 (Japan). The data may point to human-development-oriented policy choices in health and service delivery programmes (that is, higher human development index results are not strictly related to national income, but to other factors linked to social policies\u2014see UNDP\u2019s Human Development Report, various years). As the data for Figures 4 and 8 show, China, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam all have per capita GDPs of less than $1500 per annum, while their child mortality rates are all below 30 per thousand. In these countries, Source: UNICEF (2007) Data for 2005 or latest year available Figure 7: Adolescent Fertility Rate and Female Secondary GER, Selected Asia-Pacific Countries child health programmes combined with education for girls appear to have successfully delivered child health services to populations of very different sizes. This outcome may depend more on past than current policies, since child mortality rates do not display rapid, year-by-year changes, but move fairly slowly. Child mortality rates can be expected to depend on many factors that include not only mothers\u2019 education levels, but also birth spacing, past health and nutrition conditions, health facilities and institutions, and infrastructure. Health policy and investments have important consequences for maternal mortality, as well as mortality rates of children.

Gender.Equality Programmes supporting safe motherhood are both contributors and consequences of increasing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Like educational programmes, they can also be shown to be more effectively delivered as women\u2019s status and awareness of the benefits of reproductive health care are raised. \u2018Reproductive health care is defined as the constellation of methods, techniques and services that contribute to reproductive health and well-being by preventing and solving reproductive health problems. It also includes sexual health, the purpose of which is the enhancement of life and personal relations, and not merely counseling and care related to reproduction and sexually transmitted diseases.\u2019 (UN Millennium Project 2005, Task Force 3) While reproductive health information and services are vital to gender equality, the inverse is also true. Gender equality is essential to full access to reproductive health. Women will not benefit from the existence of health services if they are not empowered to demand them. However, the point is not that the provision of reproductive health services must be delayed until gender equality is achieved. The Millennium Project materials cite the example of Bangladesh, where women\u2019s autonomy and power is severely constrained and rural women are not free to travel outside the home. Bangladesh has won recognition for its deployment of outreach health workers who offer women information and contraceptives in their own homes, and have expanded women\u2019s traditional power and authority within the domestic sphere. While some argue that doorstep delivery enables women to remain in purdah, other writers judge that it nevertheless empowers women by giving them a broader social network, useful information, and more control over their reproduction21 (Barroso and Girard 2003: 8). Women.and.HIV A discernible feature of the HIV and AIDS epidemic in the Asia-Pacific region is its increasing feminization, which reveals the multiple vulnerabilities of women to HIV as well as its disproportionate impact on them. The multiple vulnerabilities of women arise from their poor social status and limited access to information and services, and the impact of gender- based violence (see next heading), adverse cultural practices and denial of rights in many areas. As discussed above, many women and adolescents in particular lack education and lifeskills to protect themselves when they are sexually active. 21 Cited by Barroso and Girard as: Sajeda Amin and Cynthia B.

In India, women account for 40 per cent of the epidemic burden, while in Fiji, they constitute 47 per cent of the new infections.22 One-third of new infections in the region are now among women, reaching as high as 60 percent in Papua New Guinea (PNG).

The average age of trafficked girls from Nepal to India, which was 14-16 years of age a decade ago, has come down to 10-14 years. A recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health in Kathmandu has found that 38 per cent of girls trafficked into sex work were HIV-positive. Among girls younger than 15 years of age, the HIV incidence was 60 percent. The study also shows that minor-age girls who have been trafficked are kept in brothels for longer periods. In most case, the avenues of rescue and reintegration into society are limited because of adverse social conditions, and many girls are re-trafficked. The unequal rights of women to inheritance and property in many parts of the region have been aggravated by HIV.24 Burdened by the care of their spouses, illness and responsibility of running the household, women are often denied the right to property when their spouses die. One study has shown that in India more than 90 per cent of HIV positive widows had stopped living in their marital homes after the death of their husbands.25 Studies in the region show that securing inheritance and property rights for women contributes to both preventing HIV and coping with its impact. The disproportionate impact of HIV on women is also evident in their extremely limited access to treatment compared to men. In India, for instance, women accounted for only half as many men on a government anti-retroviral programme, mostly because of lack of knowledge and difficulty, based in gender inequality, in accessing the services.26 An acute deficiency in the responses to women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV as well as its disproportional impact on women is the lack of avenues for their socio-economic and legal empowerment. Severe socio-economic deprivation can act as push and pull factors that may result in unsafe migration and trafficking of women and girls, or transactional sex for survival \u2013 which intensifies their vulnerability to HIV. Systematic efforts are required to address this gap. Addressing issues of inheritance and property in the context of HIV contributes both to preventing HIV and to mitigating the impact of HIV on women. Gender-based.Violence.and.the.Health.Sector Education in preventive measures to combat gender-based violence is one area where secondary education is a site of choice (see Fiji, Box 7). Because of the near-invisibility of gender-based violence in most counties\u2019 statistics, it can be hard to convince Ministries of Health to allocate funds for preventive work on violence against women, to include the topic in the training curricula for health personnel, or to develop protocols for the appropriate treatment of victims. Violence against women represents issues of rights, justice, and personal security. In addition, policy makers are increasingly recognizing the health and economic cost burdens posed by gender-based violence (see Box 8). Female victims of violence are heavy users of health 22 All data are based on UNAIDS (2006, 2007) estimates. 23 International Organization for Migration, cited on UNESCO (n.d.) 24 Swaminathan, H., Batla, N., and Chakraborty, S.

While the human impact of violence is incalculable, some of its effects can be quantified. The direct economic costs of violence against women include the spectrum of immediate health care and social and criminal justice system costs (including police, courts, and prisons in the cases that perpetrators are prosecuted). The price tags, most likely underestimated due to underreporting of violence, are nonetheless profound. In New Zealand, for example, the cost of family violence in 1993 was at least $1.2 billion.1 The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji estimated that direct and indirect costs of violence against women in Fiji amount to around $300 million per year, which is equivalent to 7 percent of the country\u2019s GDP.

In any case, women often choose to conceal the causes of their injuries, for fear of involvement in legal proceedings and retaliation by their partners. In large-scale, population-based studies in Papua New Guinea and Fiji, researchers found that approximately one-third of wives who were beaten sought medical treatment for their injuries. A study of wife-beating cases attending a major hospital in Papua New Guinea showed that 6 percent required at least overnight hospitalization. This is a considerable drain on scarce resources, especially considering that these are cases of deliberately inflicted injuries (this account taken from Bradley, 1999). Despite wider awareness of the extent and cost of gender-based violence, a 2003 survey showed that few countries in the Asia-Pacific region have passed legislation to protect women against four categories of violence considered to be most prevalent: domestic violence, rape, sexual harassment, and rape in marriage. Using a simple indicator that distinguished levels of effectiveness of legislation (presence of general legislation, provision for prosecution for violations, and specific measures in all four areas), only 5 of 50 countries were found to have a high level of legislative provision, while 27 countries had little or no legislation or effective provisions (UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific Statistics Division (UNESCAP-SD) 2004: 19-20).

Share.of.Wage.Employment Women\u2019s share of employment in the non- agricultural wage sector is indicator 11 of the MDGs (under Goal 3). The indicator measures the degree to which labour markets are open to women in the industry and service sectors, which not only affects equal employment opportunity for women but also economic efficiency through flexibility of the labour market and, therefore, the economy\u2019s ability to adapt to change. 27 Women\u2019s share of jobs in the modern sector is largely correlated with industrialization and growth. As such, it may be a response to rather than a driver of growth. Important policy and investment concerns, however, demand that development programmes look at whether or not and how women themselves have benefited from their participation in such jobs. (That is, governments must decide what kind of investment they wish to encourage, taking into consideration the labour relations practices of firms, their standards of conduct and accountability.) The current emphasis in development strategy discussions on \u2018inclusive growth\u2019 refers largely to the potential for the poor to work their way out of poverty, by finding income-earning opportunities and greater autonomy. However, the jobs that many of the poor are finding are frequently in self- employment and informal work; which are often insecure, dangerous, low-paid, and in the case of women, more poorly rewarded. 27 United Nations Development Group (2003). Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 26 While some women have been able to take up wage jobs, women\u2019s share of non-agricultural wage employment remains lower than men\u2019s share in every country of the Asia-Pacific region. Further, the share has not been increasing significantly in most countries. Women continue to earn less, either because they are doing lower-status work, or because they are paid less than men for the same work; between 1990 and 2000, changes in this relative position were small, and were negative as often as positive. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has lent support to the contention that we are witnessing a feminization of poverty, reiterating that women have a higher share of the world\u2019s working poor (i.e. those that work but do not earn enough to lift themselves and their families above the $1 a day poverty line). \u2018Of the 550 million working poor in the world an estimated 330 million are women\u2014a share of 60%\u2019 (International Labour Organization 2004: 3). Looking first at the evidence, Figure 9 shows that in most cases the female employment share of the industrial and service sector jobs is higher in the East Asian economies than in those of South and even Southeast Asia, although some recent entrants such as Cambodia prove outstanding exceptions. Cambodia\u2019s garment industry, in which more than 90 percent of the work force is female, antedates the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under the regime of the Multi-fibre Arrangement, investors in the Region who had exceeded their quotas began assembling or finishing garments in non-quota countries, including Cambodia. Data for Figure 9 are given in Annex 1. This degree of feminization of the industrial labour force to some extent mirrors the success of parts of Asia and the Pacific in joining the world trade club as lead members. There is now strong evidence that labour costs\u2014including the low wages of women in many of the countries studied\u2014are an important element of the ability of firms to seek profits by building an integrated production structure. The repeated successes of many Asian economies via the export manufacturing route are a manifestation of the integrated composition of world trade, in which firms are increasingly able to divide their production chain into a series of steps, and to source low-priced workers for the labour- intensive stages of production, while retaining other stages (such as research and development) in the

manufacturing (While developing Asia\u2019s share of trade rose to more than 21 percent of world total volumes over two decades, its share of parts and components leapt from 16 percent in 1992 to 32

non-production managerial workers and engineers\u2014as well as growing potential domestic markets.28 The above argument assists in demonstrating that the complexity of global production and the use of a high-quality, low-cost female workforce are linked features. The effectiveness of VIIT is largely based on the presence of a workforce that is dependable, adaptable to training and \u2018industrial discipline\u2019, and competitively priced. While there is ample data to show that women\u2019s participation in the labour force continues to rise, there is also strong evidence that employers have resisted closing gender gaps in wages. Other effects of trade, from studies of the whole decade, include greater participation of secondary-schooled women in new areas of the service sector, particularly in computer-based financial and telecommunications services, and a greater demand for \u2018flexible\u2019 labour\u2014e.g. part- time, short-time, non-unionized, home, and sub- contracted workers (Alexander 2000: 29). Demonstrably in many Asia-Pacific countries, the modern, global, industrial system has not led to an unequivocal expansion of formal, secure jobs and rising standards of living. Instead, it has given rise to \u2018a range of traditional and semi-industrial relations of production and exchange \u2026 being inserted into or displaced by the global system of production\u2019. This has meant, for many developing countries, the evolution of a plethora of informal, insecure, sometimes dangerous and degrading work settings, and the extension of the numbers of those trapped in poverty despite their best efforts (Chen et al. 2005: 10, 39, 40). \u2018Decent.Work\u2019 If women\u2019s high education levels and reliability combined with low wages have provided the ace that has helped many countries to compete globally, why, it might be argued, take steps to lose this competitive edge by raising women\u2019s wages? Inevitably, women themselves will campaign to overturn unequal pay and inferior working conditions. Demands for better working conditions have grown in many places where women have moved into the urban and wage sectors. In some cases as well, manufacturers have found themselves better able to sell to OECD country markets when they took steps to ensure buyers that they were according better working conditions, wages, and security to their female employees (Cambodian garment firms and some members of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers Association are examples of this experience). And as countries move up the value chain\u2014as, for example, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand have done historically\u2014from low-tech to medium-tech and medium-high tech 28 ADB (2006). Asian developing countries have taken advantage of the trend toward vertical specialization or \u2018fragmentation\u2019 of production by multinational enterprises from Europe, Japan, the United States, and other Asian countries themselves. \u2018Vertical intra-industry trade (VIIT)\u2019 refers to trade involving items that are in the same WTO Harmonized System tariff line but have price differentials of more than 25 percent, implying trade in items of different quality within the same statistical category. VIIT allows developing countries to participate in global and regional production networks by attracting foreign direct investment that makes use of relatively abundant factors of production, including labour of varying skill levels (ADB 2006: 7). \u201cIn the contemporary era no strong export performance in manufactures by any developing country has ever been secured without reliance on female labour\u201d Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 28 industries (and beyond), they are obliged to provide for higher levels of education of their labour force.

As the earlier discussion pointed out, a higher participation rate in the higher-productivity sector is a route to better incomes, which are demonstrated to result in increased child-related expenditures when incomes go to women as opposed to similar flows to men. In parallel, better incomes provide the means Source: Inter-Parliamentary Union (2007) Figure 10: Share of Seats in National Parliaments, by Sex, Selected Asia-Pacific Countries Asia-Pacific Setting: Education And Other Development Outcomes Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 29 to purchase some commodities that previously demanded a large share of the unpaid labour time of women. With more time available, more women can participate in training courses and community affairs, and are likely to experience greater civic awareness, to encounter opportunities for labour organizing, and to raise the demand for augmented transparency in governance. Better working conditions of women constitute only a part of this circle\u2014but they are a crucial part, because they are on the agenda of the labour force itself. In the context of commitments to human development targets, including the MDGs, strengthening women\u2019s economic security is critical to efforts to reduce poverty and promote gender equality. Further, decent work is basic to economic security. As countries witness a swelling tide of women workers into informal employment, combating poverty and achieving gender equality will require a major reorientation of economic and development planning beyond economic-growth- and-safety-net policy approaches. Political Representation Women\u2019s representation and participation in parliaments is one indication of their opportunities in political and public life, and is, therefore, significant in assessing an element of women\u2019s empowerment. For this reason, the \u2018proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments\u2019 has been designated indicator 12 of the MDGs (under Goal 3). Figure 11 shows the percentage of seats held by women in Asia-Pacific countries reported by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), with their shares well below the 20 percent mark in most countries. The variation in representation levels shows no relation to national income\u2014Timor-Leste, Afghanistan, Viet Nam and Lao PDR, with per capita GDP below $600 per annum, have female shares above 20 percent alongside Australia and New Zealand. In comparison the wealthiest country of the group, Japan ($36,500 per capita per annum) has few women in parliament: at 11 percent of seats going to women, it ranks no higher than Bangladesh (15 percent) and China (20 percent). In every country of the world, women hold fewer seats in national and local parliaments than do men. According to the IPU, women now comprise 17 percent of parliamentarians worldwide. While this number represents an increase from 12 years ago when the percentage stood at only 11.3, the increase has been slow and erratic, and indeed declined in 2007 from a year earlier. Figure 11 shows that Asia and the Pacific regions accord women below-average representation when compared with global percentages. Women\u2019s share is higher in the Americas (North and South) and Europe (20 percent), and only in the Arab States region do women have a lower share than in Asia and the Pacific.29 The experience in many countries has shown that having a certain portion of parliamentary seats reserved for women helps raise the numbers of women in national parliaments. In countries with gender quotas, as Figure 12 illustrates, women took 21.7 percent of the seats compared with the 11.8 percent of seats they won in countries without any quota or reservation system. 30 Asia-Pacific countries are not the best performers, with no Region country among the global top 20 ranked by percentage of seats in the national parliament held by women. However, seven Asian countries do make it into the top 50, and in some of these a reservation system for women has been adopted (Afghanistan and Pakistan appear in the top 50,32 while reservation systems exist for local representation in India (see Box 931) as well as small numbers in Bangladesh and Nepal, but not in Sri Lanka.)

The Pacific Islands communities have historically had less success in finding measures to ensure women\u2019s representation. As Figure 13 shows, the average percentage of seats held is well below that of Asia. What is more, as the data for Figure 11 show (for data see Annex 1), this number is boosted by the inclusion of Australia and New Zealand. Many of the smaller islands have no women representatives at all. In the 2007 national elections in Papua New Guinea, although 100 women ran several strong campaigns for the 109 open seats, only one (already a long-time sitting MP and cabinet minister) was elected. Pacific women\u2019s networks are assessing the reasons for this failure to convince electorates to vote for women. Many are calling for more government action, and the introduction of reservation systems to provide a model of women in political positions, for candidates and for the population as a whole. Figure 11: Women in National Parliaments, Asia-Pacific and World Averages Box 9: Women Making a Difference in Indian Local Governments In 1992, India adopted a Panchayati Raj (local council) system in several states that reserved one-third of seats for women. Women leaders through the Panchayati Raj Initiative (PRI) are transforming local governance by sensitizing their state governments to issues of poverty, inequality, and gender injustice. They are tackling issues that had previously gone virtually unacknowledged, including water supply and safety, alcohol abuse, education, health issues, and domestic violence. Contrary to fears that the elected women would be rubber-stamp leaders, the success stories that have arisen from the PRI are impressive. A government-financed study, based on field work in 180 villages in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh and coordinated by the Centre for Women\u2019s Development Studies in New Delhi, has found that a full two-thirds of elected women leaders are actively engaged in learning the ropes and exercising power. In both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the proportion of women in local self-government is now 44 percent as compared to the mandatory requirement of 33 percent. Tamil Nadu has 418 women elected from the general constituencies and not from reserved constituencies. Women are seeing this power as an opportunity for a real change for themselves and for their children and are using it to demand basic facilities such as primary schools and health care centres. Researchers have found that in some states most elected women are housewives, first-time entrants into politics, usually illiterate or educated only to primary level. In 2000 the Indian Institute of Social Science reviewed the progress of 100 elected women in four districts; most of the elected women including younger women were illiterate when elected to office. After two years in office, they demanded literacy training skill and generally felt the need of education for their daughters.

Do Reservation Systems Help? Box 10: Access to Justice in Afghanistan There has never been a female justice on the Scholar Council of the Supreme Court, Afghanistan\u2019s highest judicial body. The Afghan Women Judges Association (AWJA) estimates that of roughly 2000 sitting judges in Afghanistan, no more than 70 are female. According to civil society organizations, the need for women to be represented on this body is especially critical for a justice system that has long been criticized for its lack of sensitivity to gender concerns. Advocates have especially targeted the Supreme Court, due to its role in setting precedents and monitoring judges in the lower courts. Afghanistan\u2019s Supreme Court, unlike those of many other countries, does not hear cases. It is instead mandated to monitor judgments in the lower court system and approve sentencing in criminal cases, including capital crimes. Since only the most serious cases pass through the Supreme Court, including criminal cases that invoke the death penalty, it is essential that women\u2019s testimonies be analysed accurately, and without bias, so that irreversible mistakes are not made by the lower courts system. According to the AWJA, a qualified female justice on the Supreme Court would be able to correctly interpret Shari\u2019a law as it applies to women, and at the same time, incorporate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49be451d-d402-4082-93bb-0312330ff95d": {"__data__": {"id_": "49be451d-d402-4082-93bb-0312330ff95d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-gender-equality-global-evidence-and-asia-pacific-setting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c3bda913ff02829709e9d1835d4dd0cb390e2c2df488c177ae121dc87ea0341"}}, "hash": "7c3bda913ff02829709e9d1835d4dd0cb390e2c2df488c177ae121dc87ea0341", "text": "into rulings the international conventions to which Afghanistan is party. While Afghanistan\u2019s constitution makes no specific provision for women\u2019s placement on the Supreme Court, the constitution does include clear articles against discrimination, and gives both women and men equal rights and duties before the law. In March 2003, Afghanistan also became party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and thus is obliged under international law to ensure that Afghan women do not face discrimination, and can claim their rights as equal to men. (UNIFEM Project) Yet there is strong evidence that raising women\u2019s representation in decision-making bodies leads to better outcomes for women and for communities. Research has shown that when women are included in decision-making, governments are more responsive to household needs and community development (see Box 10). This observation was underlined a decade and a half ago by Mary Robinson, former UN Commissioner of Human Rights, and was cited by Pacific women during recent election campaigns. The Commissioner had pointed out that women were already contributing a valuable approach to governance: \u2018As women lead, they are changing leadership, as they organize they are changing organisations. When women lead and articulate their purposes, it seems that they work together not only as individuals but with a great sense of continuity and networking in a healthy way. Women have fresh and imaginative skills of dialogue and are setting a more open, flexible and compassionate style of leadership\u2019 (Speech at the Global Forum of Women 1992, cited in Gina Houng Lee 2006). Of course, parliaments vary in their independence and authority. As a measure of women\u2019s real political decision making, the percentage-of-seats indicator is not sufficient, because women still face many obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate. Thus, being a member of parliament, especially in developing countries and emerging democracies, does not guarantee that a woman has the resources, respect, or constituency to exercise significant influence (this indicator is discussed in United Nations Development Group, 2003, pp. 37-8). Indeed, parliaments are not the only governance institutions where the presence of women makes a difference to outcomes for the population. Governments can expect improved service delivery when they ensure a good gender balance in the courts, regulatory agencies, and public health and education systems. However, without the initial steps by sitting governments to create examples that can influence public opinion, traditional resistance to change may be difficult to overcome. Box 10 provides an example of efforts in this direction in the Afghanistan judicial system.

It presents recent syntheses of a large number of studies conducted and replicated over the past decade. The accumulated results of these studies have provided forceful evidence that countries that have under-invested in gender equality have lost economic output (in measured per capita GDP growth), and those that have narrowed gender gaps have benefited. The evidence is persuasive in identifying the costs associated with failing to meet the MDG 3 targets on gender equality over the Millennium term. As one synthesis concludes, countries failing to meet the goal of gender equity in education will lose annual per capita output growth at a rate of 0.1\u20130.3 percent per year (depending on the growth rate of GDP and pace of change in the education disparity). While these amounts may appear small, they can accumulate to significant values. For example, for a country with a PPP-based per capita GDP of $1500 in 1995, the loss of income could be as much as 10 percent for every person by the 2015 MDG target year \u2014and the loss will be greater for countries where the gender gap is most severe. Another study forecasts, on the positive side, that where countries do succeed in meeting the goal of gender equity in secondary enrolments, the effect for the 1985-2015 period could amount to 14 percent larger average per capita GDP levels.33 While the actual cost of gender gaps in education cannot be determined for each country precisely, it is important to recognize that these numbers are not guesses or untested hypotheses.

Conclusions and Strategic Priorities life, higher productivity, and greater potential for sustained growth and development. The data studies demonstrate that the consistent high average per capita growth rates of the East Asia and Pacific economies, outstripping averages for all other country groupings, has paralleled a long- term narrowing of gender disparities in secondary education in the East-Asia-Pacific grouping. Data presented for the Asia-Pacific region in the current period show that inputs to closing gender gaps have been uneven. They demonstrate some correlation of girls\u2019 secondary education with per capita income (although no claim for any direction of causality is made for cross-sectional data). The data also demonstrate, however, that some countries at lower income levels have managed to perform well in recent years in narrowing these gender disparities, and have at the same time benefited from better health and other outcomes. Making Investment Choices With the global findings and the regional performance results in hand, there is strong empirical evidence that progress in gender equality plays a key role in development results. The Asia-Pacific setting shows that women have responded to education opportunities with enthusiasm, have made major contributions to the dynamism of the region, and have expressed their willingness to take on leadership responsibilities through local and national representative bodies. The data also show critical areas of concern where better support is needed to help them continue this contribution, and where policy stances and government actions are on the agenda. In every country, policy makers therefore have choices to make. In the context of the urgency of MDG targets that are now at the mid-way point, and a continuing focus on national sustainable development strategy targets, governments face the challenge of identifying the most effective interventions their budgets can support. For investment planners, this highlighting of the centrality of gender equality becomes enormously significant. The point is not simply the efficacy of education in and of itself, but the derived benefits from education, in providing girls and women with the capacity, means and autonomy to take decisions ensuring the livelihood, health and future well-being of themselves and their households. 33 Both summarized in Abu-Ghaida and Klasen (2004: 19\u201320), using the growth effects illustrated earlier, pp. 14-15. \u201cCountries failing to meet the goal of gender equity in secondary education will lose annual per capita output growth at a rate of 0.1\u20130.3 percent per year\u201d Investing in Gender Equality: Global Evidence and the Asia-Pacific Setting 33 The merit of the empirical work has been to point to the benefits for societies of raising, not merely the educational levels of women, but their capabilities, and their access to resources that result in further positive development outcomes\u2014including birth spacing and safer motherhood, better child survival and nutrition, greater participation in the high-productivity sectors of the economy, and ongoing contributions in community life and good governance. This leads to an important question on the investment planning agenda: which interventions, in addition to education, will most effectively support increased means and ability of women to make decisions that have knock-on effects for other development objectives? Setting out to address such a question, Task Force 3 (Gender Equality and Education) of the UN Millennium Project identified a number of key interventions. The Task Force team began by defining in more specific terms the economic and social content of \u2018equality and empowerment\u2019. Using an analytical framework that defines development and empowerment as outcomes that increase capabilities to act autonomously, provide practical access to opportunities and resources, and ensure personal security, the team pinpointed priority needs and areas of action. These priorities were translated by the Task Force into feasible, short-term interventions that would contribute directly to efforts to meet the Goal 3 gender education target.34 The key areas of intervention, chosen for their affordability and impact, include: 1. Strengthening opportunities for post-primary education for girls while meeting commitments to universal primary education. 2. Guaranteeing sexual and reproductive health and rights. 3. Investing in infrastructure to reduce women and girls\u2019 time burdens. 4.

Eliminating gender inequality in employment by decreasing women\u2019s reliance on informal employment, closing gender gaps in earnings, and reducing occupational segregation. 6. Increasing women\u2019s share of seats in national parliaments and local government bodies. 7. Significantly reducing violence against girls and women.35 The value of this programme of priorities is that it identifies interventions that governments can realistically incorporate into their investment agendas. The proposed measures have in common that they are affordable, and feasible in the short to medium term; that is, these are steps that can realistically be taken within the time period remaining to the 2015 target year for the MDGs, or within the time frame of medium-term expenditure frameworks. At the same time, investments in these areas would impact favourably on the attainment of other MDG-type targets. For example, investments in water supply and local networks to supply cleaner, environmentally sustainable fuels (LPG and kerosene) not only reduce girls\u2019 time burdens and afford them the possibility of attending school; they also reduce the use of environmentally harmful biomass-sourced fuels, and improve air quality and health conditions in the dwellings of poor people, reducing respiratory disease burdens on the health system. Improving legal frameworks that ensure labour rights, and developing vocational training programmes, can bring more women into higher-productivity sectors, raise household incomes, and improve children\u2019s access to immunization programmes and other vital services. The list, therefore, sets out a basic core of strategic interventions that policy makers would want to maintain in the policy, planning, and financing cycle of the budget programme, not only in the annual calendar, but also in their medium-term expenditure programmes and dialogues with the donor community. It is important to recognize at the same time that these interventions are not only a question of financial investments. Their full implementation over the long term would demand institutional, legal, and social changes, with a strong political will among policy makers and opinion leaders. As the following section notes, building and maintaining a close relationship between government policy departments and gender equality advocates in civil society as well as government will serve as an important factor in sustaining public support for continuing gender equality interventions. Financing Gender Equality To deliver a programme that identifies the costs of essential investments in gender equality and carries them through to implementation, governments need to ensure several components of their strategic programme. i. First, to calculate the financial costs of the investment component of these interventions, countries require a number of inputs into their planning process for financing development objectives. They must identify their populations in need and the unit costs of specific interventions (including facilities, personnel, and delivery programmes), and calculate the costs and savings of scaling up to a target date. ii. Second, they need to assess which of the possible investments will be most strategic in a context of limited means, choosing those that have synergies with other goals as well as impact on gender equality. iii. Third, having assessed financial needs in the light of this strategic analysis, they need to link their priorities to an explicit framework within the annual budget estimates, and to defend these priorities through the technical and policy discussions that will shape the eventual expenditure and revenue outcome. As these points suggest, in the process of identifying, costing, and financing priority interventions for gender equality, it will be important to find synergies with investments in the whole range of mainstream budget expenditures. In a context of budget limitations, not all desirable investments will survive to appear in actual budget lines. Identifying the priority interventions to finance gender equality must be calculated, therefore, on the basis of explicit assessments in every country and sub-national areas within countries. Looking at the first priority on the list, for example, \u2018Strengthening opportunities for post-primary education for girls\u2019, costing the financial investment requires more information than the number of girls out of school, the catchment population of each school, and the unit cost of school facilities and operations. Sectoral needs assessments must be based on accurate information as to the particular impediments to school attendance in different areas of the country.

If, on the other hand, the obstacle is a lack of affordable transport and passable roads, the interventions will lie in the realm of rural roads and a financing plan for local mini-bus services. If the issue is young women\u2019s safety on the way to and from school, the attention would turn to school location, safe transport, and law enforcement by the courts.36 It is possible that expenditures limited to scholarships for girls, in isolation, may not have any impact on school attendance, and such expenditures would not be deemed to meet priority criteria. Point (ii) above underlines both responsibilities and synergies. Identifying the reasons for a gender disparity helps identify which ministry is responsible for the necessary expenditure; in the examples given above, these include some or all of the following: Public Works, Energy, Transport, Justice, Interior, and possibly though not necessarily Education. An analysis of gender concerns within every sector makes it possible to identify the array of responsibilities throughout the budget. When expenditure is constrained, priority can be accorded to those investments that act as drivers or catalysts to further synergies. The choice of infrastructure programmes, then, would take into account augmented school access alongside market access and other travel and transport needs. Point (iii) above highlights the importance of making gender equality investments explicitly justified and earmarked in the budget, and ensuring that these components survive the hurdles on the route to financing and implementation. Champions of key investments need to follow them every step of the way: \uf06c to defend them through the course of budget estimates and the negotiation of the total envelope \uf06c to articulate the role of these interventions in the statement of total financing needs and the estimation of the financing gap in discussions with donors, and \uf06c to support preservation of the fiscal space for strategic development expenditure, in the debate on rigid, short-term macroeconomic targets and conditions. As was noted above, a finance ministry can benefit from maintaining allies who support gender equality interventions, within government and among civil society and public opinion makers. The ministry, and other line and Central departments in planning, statistics, and aid coordination, can help women\u2019s ministries and networks play an important role in speaking up for vital expenditures. Sustained financial and capacity development support to women\u2019s ministries, to enable them to carry out their critical advocacy functions, is, therefore, another vital investment. This report has presented a summary of recently compiled evidence of the strong economic case to be made for investments in the education sector and to make opportunities available to girls and women. At the same time, this evidence shows that the loss of opportunities resulting from persisting inequalities undermines the potential for human development, which is a human right in itself.

As policy makers grapple with choices, and take part in global debates on \u2018Financing for Development\u2019, it is hoped that the evidence set out in this report can contribute to their deliberations. Meeting MDG 3, and focusing on gender equality to help meet all the MDGs, is a strategy that is demonstrating its effectiveness in enriching the potential of all countries to reach their human development goals. 36 The author is indebted to Lionel Siriwardena for underlining the importance of sectoral analysis in needs assessment.

Introduction Despite setbacks at the multilateral level, international rules protecting foreign direct investment (FDI) continue to proliferate at the regional and bilateral levels. The Asia- Pacific region offers no exception to this trend. Indeed, Asian Governments were in the vanguard of an earlier move to sew up narrow investment protection treaties, and they are now at the head of a trend toward broader comprehensive trade and economic agreements (with investment rules contained therein). Such agreements routinely provide high levels of international legal protection for foreign investment; recently, some of the broader economic agreements are incorporating separate commitments for liberalisation and opening toward foreign investment. While some work has been undertaken to examine the impact of enhanced investment flows upon economic growth and human development, there has been less appreciation that investment agreements also have significant impacts of their own. By imposing a series of disciplines upon the actions which Governments may take toward foreign investment and foreign investors, these agreements introduce quasi-constitutional brakes upon the legislative, executive, judicial and administrative actions of host Governments. Generally speaking, the agreements apply across the board \u2013 meaning that they will govern investments made in the full range of economic sectors: from natural resources to public services such as water, electricity or health services. Where the agreements also mandate some liberalisation, the interaction with the agreement\u2019s protection obligations may complicate efforts by Governments to regulate liberalised sectors or hinder efforts to revert to public ownership or provision in sectors where private provision has failed. Although rarely invoked for much of their nearly half-century of existence, investment protection agreements are now resorted to as a matter of course in the event of disputes arising between foreign businesses and their host Government. As a result, their arcane provisions are being seen to have tangible and important consequences for policy-makers, including in relation to the promotion of human development. 2. Investment Provisions in Asia-Pacific Treaties: An Overview i. Origins Investment protection treaties trace their origins to the late 1950s and early 1960s, and a desire on the part of Germany to shore up levels of legal protection for German investments flowing into the developing world.

However, a handful of Asian countries, for different reasons, were slower to engage in treaty negotiations, perhaps because they were slower to embrace FDI; stood to attract very little of it; or simply did not become independent nations until quite recently. These countries include India, Mongolia and some of the least-developed Asian countries (Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia), as well as the breakaway former Soviet republics. Figure 1 below presents the latest UNCTAD figures as to the number of BITs signed by Asia-Pacific countries to the end of 2003. It is important to note that these figures do not include bilateral or regional trade agreements with investment provisions.

Several authors have noted that enthusiasm for these treaties gathered pace in the 1970s in response to the New International Economic Order (NIEO), and to assertions by developing countries that they could nationalise foreign-owned property without paying full compensation.2 Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 7 ii. Features These early-generation bilateral investment treaties were characterised foremost by their brevity. Many were only a handful of pages, and they contrast sharply with the lengthy and detailed investment provisions found in modern regional trade agreements or economic cooperation agreements. This sharp contrast in length \u2013 and hence the degree of detail \u2013 may give rise to various development policy implications that will be discussed in subsequent sections of this paper. For present purposes, however, it is important to describe the contents of these early-generation BITs in general terms. A cornerstone of such treaties was the requirement that compensation be paid in the event of expropriation, nationalisation, or measures equivalent to such treatment. Often, this treatment would be buttressed with some minimum standards such as undertakings obliging host states to provide \u201cfair and equitable treatment\u201d and/or \u201cfull protection and security\u201d to foreign investors. Another common, but by no means universal, feature of many of these early treaties was a relative standard of protection, requiring that investors and/or their investments be accorded treatment that was no less favourable than that accorded to investors and/or investments of any third state. This guarantee of Most Favoured Nation treatment (MFN) sometimes would be supplemented by a further requirement that investors and/or investments enjoy treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investors and/or investments of the host state (i.e., national treatment). Yet another common feature of early investment treaties were provisions guaranteeing the free transfer or repatriation of funds related to investments (for profits, dividends and so forth). It was not unusual for these early treaties to adopt a restrictive approach to the investments that enjoyed protection under the treaty. Admission or entry of investments was at the discretion of the host state authorities, and the treaties often affirmed that this was a matter left to local law and regulations. What\u2019s more, some treaties expressly provided that their protections were only reserved for those investments that had been approved in writing, or that had entered the country pursuant to a given set of foreign investment regulations or statutes.3 The net effect was to leave in the hands of the developing countries the decision as to which forms of foreign investment would be permitted entry to a country, and, thus, which might benefit from the protective rubric of the given international treaty. As will be discussed later, this contrasts with the position of some more recent bilateral investment treaties and free trade agreements, in that modern agreements may provide some forms of guaranteed market access or rights of admission for foreign investment. Although these early treaties did not \u201copen the door\u201d for foreign investment, once investments were established in the host state, they enjoyed the legal protections found in the BIT. While it might be the case that the treaties represented", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85017812-2223-446b-b3dd-6f745722d5d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "85017812-2223-446b-b3dd-6f745722d5d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4df9c9f78502437bb228add2a6d2814d12e09fe012674c3ce890a1d24632a117"}, "3": {"node_id": "27469ef2-0714-4b11-a2b2-2fe430508319", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbc1eea6fedf45a4f585a560bc5b1d83d3c03cb79368b82c7ecb60e380e8e369"}}, "hash": "123605b174bd3785848f52bbac3e42c0798351cc1bf08e352dbf1187584461c9", "text": "a useful informal bargaining chip when foreign investors encountered turbulence in their host states, by and large this informal usage of the treaties is not well-chronicled. Given the sensitivity of investor-Government discussions, it would be rare for such discussions to be a matter of public record. Still the conventional wisdom has been that the treaties have been useful tools for foreign investors, even if their efficacy in stimulating new investment flows is still a matter of some contention.4 Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 8 While their informal usage remains a question mark, any formal invocation of the dispute settlement provisions found in such treaties also remains shrouded in mystery. Typically, treaties contain provisions for state-to-state dispute settlement in the event of a dispute or disagreement over interpretation of the treaty. The authors are aware of only one invocation of such provisions, occurring in 2003.5 In addition to these state-to-state dispute settlement provisions many investment treaties incorporate investor-to-state dispute settlement provisions, which permit investors to bring their own claims in the event of alleged violations of treaty provisions by their host state.6 While recourse to investor-to-state dispute settlement has been provided in treaties dating back to the 1970s, it was only in 1987 that the first recorded investor-state arbitration was mounted by a foreign (UK) investor against its host state (Sri Lanka).7 In the period since 1987, investor invocation of the dispute clauses of BITs has gathered pace, particularly in the last five years. Figure 2 below chronicles a steady rise in investment treaty arbitrations in recent years. (The spike in 2003 represents an unusual number of claims arising out of a single event, the Argentine financial crisis).

Investment treaty disputes frequently run into the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, and may see challenges to a broad range of Government measures or actions. Recent arbitrations have arisen from private provision of water, sanitation, electricity and transportation, as well as Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 9 disputes over the imposition of value-added taxes, environmental licensing and permitting, regulation of broadcasting, and compliance with state contracts and power- purchase agreements. However, while the investor-state arbitration process has the potential to provide a \u201cwindow\u201d onto the concrete meaning of investment treaty obligations, it must be cautioned that the view from this \u201cwindow\u201d is currently far from all-encompassing. Indeed, investor-to-state disputes are capable of being launched \u2013 and even fully resolved \u2013 without any public disclosure. As such, the number of arbitrations highlighted in the UNCTAD study represents only known arbitrations \u2013 those culled from interviews with lawyers and investors, analysis of news and media reports, and scrutiny of company documents and shareholder notices. Where investors and/or Governments seek to pursue disputes in secret, there may be potential for so doing, as described in the following section. iii. Dispute Settlement In contrast to the World Trade Organization and its internal dispute settlement body, investment treaties have spawned no single institution for resolution of disputes. Although investment treaties frequently give the consent of the signatory states to permit international arbitration of disputes with aggrieved investors, this process will be an ad hoc one, governed by one of several sets of international arbitration rules (in addition to any other additional procedural rules spelled out in the given treaty). A new arbitration tribunal will be convened for purposes of resolving each dispute. The arbitration rules most commonly referenced in investment treaties are those of the World Bank-affiliated International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27469ef2-0714-4b11-a2b2-2fe430508319": {"__data__": {"id_": "27469ef2-0714-4b11-a2b2-2fe430508319", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4df9c9f78502437bb228add2a6d2814d12e09fe012674c3ce890a1d24632a117"}, "2": {"node_id": "85017812-2223-446b-b3dd-6f745722d5d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "123605b174bd3785848f52bbac3e42c0798351cc1bf08e352dbf1187584461c9"}}, "hash": "dbc1eea6fedf45a4f585a560bc5b1d83d3c03cb79368b82c7ecb60e380e8e369", "text": "Another set of arbitration rules commonly found in investment treaties are those of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (or UNCITRAL).

These various rules were conceived with somewhat different ends in mind. The World Bank\u2019s ICSID facility was set up expressly for the purpose of arbitrating investor-state disputes related to overseas investments. By contrast, the SCC and ICC were, and continue to be, venues designed chiefly for the resolution of commercial disputes between two private entities (for example, a contractual dispute between two businesses). The UNCITRAL rules also were designed for the latter type of dispute (business-to-business) but can be used for investor-to-state disputes. A number of important consequences flow from the fact that investment treaty arbitration may be handled by a variety of different rules or venues. The first is that full transparency is lacking. While the ICSID, as a World Bank body set up for investor-state disputes, does publish a list of all arbitrations pending before the Centre, the other above- mentioned business-oriented arbitration rules impose no such requirement. It is literally impossible, therefore, to know the precise number of investment treaty arbitrations Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 10 operating under the UNCITRAL, SCC or ICC rules, without the cooperation of the parties involved in such disputes. Even where a case is publicly disclosed, either at the discretion of the parties or by operation of the ICSID\u2019s disclosure requirement, it remains typical for that dispute to be resolved in camera. With few exceptions, arbitral hearings and documents related to the arbitration will be closed to the public. Indeed, it is not even mandatory for the final award (i.e., the final judgment by the tribunal) to be released publicly in all cases. Collectively, these features make it difficult for analysts, scholars and even Governments to monitor the interpretation and application of these international treaties, and to assess the emerging policy implications thereof. Moreover, this lack of transparency also has given rise to uncertainty on the part of Governments as to whether certain actions on their part might give rise to potential violations of treaty provisions. Observers have noted the potential for regulatory or legislative chill in this realm, with evidence having emerged that foreign investors may rely upon investment treaty protections in an effort to ward off unwanted Government action.10 Notwithstanding the uncertainty generated by the opaque nature of investment treaty arbitration, a number of policy lessons are emerging from those cases \u2013 or rulings \u2013 that become a matter of public record. A number of these emerging lessons are examined in section 7 below. Although there are a remarkable number of BITs concluded by Asian countries, these agreements are not the only ones that govern foreign investment activity in the region. The following section examines some of these other international arrangements. 3. Other Agreements with Investment Provisions i. TRIMS At the multilateral level, World Trade Organization members have concluded an Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs). This agreement proscribes various trade-related investment measures and offers an illustrative (but not exhaustive) list of such measures. These may include measures that dictate a given level of domestic content to be used by foreign investors or limits placed on a foreign investor\u2019s ability to import or export while operating in the host territory. The TRIMs agreement was concluded as part of the Uruguay Round of negotiations in the mid-1990s; since then, a number of developing countries have urged greater flexibility in the enforcement of the agreement. India and Brazil have been particular advocates of amendment to the agreement so as to increase the scope for developing countries to impose such measures pursuant to their broader development policy strategies.11 ii. GATS The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is the WTO agreement governing \u2013 and seeking to liberalise \u2013 trade in services. Services trade can take place through various modes, including cross-border delivery or movement of natural persons across borders in order to deliver services. Another means by which services may be traded is by virtue of a Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 11 foreign service supplier establishing a commercial presence in the territory of the state to which it looks to supply services. The GATS introduces basic obligations for Governments to provide most-favoured nation treatment and basic transparency to foreign service providers. Where Governments elect to \u201cschedule\u201d deeper commitments in designated economic sectors, they may commit themselves to providing national treatment and market access to foreign service suppliers. GATS adherents commit to progressive liberalisation over time, through successive negotiating rounds. Because the GATS agreement does not provide for an investor-state dispute mechanism, alleged violations of the provisions may", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f8c67eb-fa1e-46c1-b9c7-7ff992648a6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f8c67eb-fa1e-46c1-b9c7-7ff992648a6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fca2ed9c234c172a44997d938b966a7b3475915b0640e2a991c026a32a66d4a"}, "3": {"node_id": "127165fd-441c-49c5-8dec-3a5b9bfbb323", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd2a88e167897ea9a97cb1110dde00ded7a67b6e00950246193b791ba27b5f46"}}, "hash": "cf3ae0a00bb67c27edbb23597676c526ed21adc6940f18af8213b74527c09a36", "text": "be remedied only through a foreign investor\u2019s home state electing to take up a dispute on behalf of that investor with the host territory. iii. ASEAN Investment Agreements Most notable amongst regional agreements in the Asia region are those concluded by the Association of South East Asian Nations. The 1987 ASEAN Agreement for Promotion and Protection of Investments introduced some basic investment protection for intra-ASEAN investments. This agreement was supplemented in 1998 by the Framework Agreement for the ASEAN Investment Area, an agreement that covers investment originating inside or outside of ASEAN, and whose primary objective is to liberalise and facilitate new investment flows. As such, the ASEAN Secretariat has hailed the complementarity of the 1987 and 1998 agreements, with one focused on protection for established investments, and the other on eliminating barriers to new investment.12 In terms of the key obligations in the 1987 Agreement, members are obliged to provide compensation in the event of expropriation or nationalisation of foreign investments; to guarantee free transfers related to foreign investments; fair and equitable treatment and protection for covered investments; and a requirement to \u201cnot impair by unjustified or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, disposition or liquidation of such investments.\u201d The agreement also offers recourse to investor-state arbitration under the rules of ICSID, UNCITRAL or centres for arbitration in the ASEAN region. Key provisions of the 1998 Framework Agreement include: to progressively open up industries to foreign investment; progressively grant national treatment; and provide for transparency of investment policies, rules and administrative procedures. iv. Energy Charter Treaty The Energy Charter Treaty is a so-called plurilateral trade and investment agreement conceived with the objective of encouraging investment from selected regions (primarily Europe, Asia and Australia) into the energy sector of the territories of the former Soviet Union. As of January 2005, 46 countries had ratified the ECT, including Japan, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. The ECT\u2019s investment rights include provision for national treatment, most-favoured nation treatment, protection against expropriation without compensation, fair and equitable treatment, most constant protection and security, free transfers, and a so-called umbrella clause obliging host states to \u201cobserve any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party\u201d. The impact of the last of these obligations could be to \u201cinternationalise\u201d contracts concluded by Governments with Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 12 foreign investors, and to make a breach of contract become a breach of treaty; however, tribunals have differed in their interpretation of this opaque treaty provision.13 The treaty provides for state-to-state dispute settlement, as well as investor-to-state arbitration pursuant to the rules of ICSID, UNCITRAL and the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce. A small number of arbitrations are known to have been launched since the treaty\u2019s coming into force, but there is no means of knowing precisely how many disputes have arisen \u2013 or have been resolved \u2013 pursuant to the ECT. v. Free Trade Agreements, Economic Cooperation or Economic Partnership Agreements Apart from the aforementioned regional, plurilateral or multilateral initiatives, Asian Governments are concluding large numbers of bilateral (and sometimes trilateral or quadrilateral) economic agreements whose provisions cover investment as well as a range of other issues (e.g., trade in goods, services, intellectual property rights, trade facilitation). Such agreements adopt a variety of names. Singapore and Japan have concluded an Agreement for a New Age Economic Partnership; India and Singapore have recently agreed to a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement; and Thailand and New Zealand recently inked a Closer Economic Partnership Agreement. Without intending to diminish the many differences and divergence between these Agreements \u2013 some of which will be analysed more closely later \u2013 these various agreements are hereafter referred to by the shorthand of EPAs (Economic Partnership Agreements). It is increasingly common for these EPAs to include state-of-the-art provisions on investment. The treaties may expand the menu of protections found in earlier-generation bilateral investment treaties by addressing new issues such as the use of performance requirements or providing for investment liberalisation. Moreover, these EPAs may overwrite the provisions of earlier BITs concluded between the parties, as was the case, for example, when the Republic of Korea and Chile concluded a Free Trade Agreement in 2003; that Agreement served to terminate an earlier BIT between the parties.

This failure is not for a lack of effort; attempts to conclude a multilateral agreement date back more than a half-century to the proposed International Trade Organization, a stillborn precursor to the current GATT system. The 1948 Havana Charter \u2013 which would have brought the ITO into being \u2013 included a series of international investment rules that were said to be the most controversial provisions of the Charter \u2013 and a critical factor in the Charter\u2019s non-adoption.14 In the subsequent decades, both the United Nations and the OECD would look to disinter the idea of a multilateral set of rules governing foreign investment flows. These efforts garnered several non-binding or voluntary codes applicable to different aspects of international investment, but proved fruitless when it came to the central objective. The OECD went so far as to conclude a Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 13 Property, although the treaty was never opened for adoption; it did, however, serve as a much-borrowed template for the BIT programs of capital-exporting nations. In the 1990s, the OECD would see a renewed push for a multilateral agreement on investment (MAI), this time attracting the attention and ire of non-Governmental organizations and the media. Criticism of the proposed agreement rose to such a pitch that it spawned several parliamentary inquiries, and ultimately seems to have led several countries to have cold feet about the proposed pact.15 The MAI effort was ultimately abandoned, following a formal withdrawal by the French Government in October 1998, citing concern over the proposed Agreement\u2019s impact on France\u2019s cultural sector. The investment issue also was taken up by member states of the World Trade Organization at the 1996 Singapore Ministerial Conference, when Trade Ministers agreed to convene a working group on trade and investment, whose remit would be to examine the relationship between the two issues and to test the waters for future negotiations on investment (moving beyond the limited role for investment in the aforementioned TRIMs and GATS Agreements). However, the Singapore Ministerial Declaration acknowledged, in express terms and at the insistence of India, that future negotiations would not be a foregone conclusion, but would require an \u201cexplicit consensus decision\u201d by WTO members.16 This hurdle would prove too high for the WTO, with many member states determined not to see the Organization clear it. Indeed, the question of whether to advance to multilateral negotiations on investment would linger on the WTO agenda for the the better part of a decade, although it was dealt what is widely viewed as a death blow at the 2003 Cancun Ministerial Conference. In Cancun, it became clear that there was insurmountable opposition to broadening the WTO\u2019s remit on the investment issue, and in August 2004 the WTO\u2019s primary governing body, the General Council, adopted a decision dropping the issue from the Doha Round of trade talks.17 While demand for multilateral rules on investment has not faded entirely, with some Governments, particularly Japan and the European Union, still harbouring an affinity for them, the dream appears to have been relegated once more to a disused railroad siding. 5. A Balanced Assessment of the Political, Economic, Strategic Motivations Driving Regional and Bilateral Agreements i. Rationales for Bilateral Investment Treaties Myriad explanations exist for the pursuit of BITs and broader EPAs containing investment rules. In the case of BITs, the agreements were first conceived as instruments for clarifying the legal rules applicable in cases where capital-exporting states saw their businesses subjected to interference or expropriation while operating abroad. This rationale was particularly influential during the 1960s and 1970s, as Governments were sharply split on the customary international law standards applicable to foreign investments. Another consideration driving BITs, particularly as time went on, was the desire on the part of capital exporters \u2013 and their home Governments \u2013 to remove foreign investment disputes from the jurisdiction of local courts and tribunals. By the 1980s it became commonplace for BITs to provide for international arbitration in the case of disputes Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 14 between a foreign investors and its host state \u2013 and for foreign investors to be permitted to invoke this mechanism without needing to exhaust its legal remedies in the host state. As such, BITs served not only to set the rules that would be applied to foreign investment disputes, but also the bodies that would interpret those rules. For their part, developing countries often acceded to these agreements so as to signal that they were now open to foreign direct investment \u2013 perhaps in contrast to earlier", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19f70cb9-0f5c-4358-8e24-76f4f9b1e4e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "19f70cb9-0f5c-4358-8e24-76f4f9b1e4e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c56fe331462959e329ad77a42fd375f73609b17e8b9eb021d4e4e85f09ea6b4"}}, "hash": "4c56fe331462959e329ad77a42fd375f73609b17e8b9eb021d4e4e85f09ea6b4", "text": "regimes, which viewed FDI with suspicion \u2013 and, what is more, that they were prepared to play by agreed rules when it came to treatment of such foreign investments. Closely tied to this rationale is the further desire of developing countries to attract such investment, and BITs were often touted as instruments for stimulating enhanced investment flows between parties. Although the economic evidence to support this proposition is mixed (see discussion in Section 6), it is clear that many Governments have viewed BITs as being either a central, or at least a useful, tool for attracting new investments. In addition, BITs may play a strategic role insofar as they can be steppingstones to other goals, such as broader market access for a developing country\u2019s exports or its ability to conclude a broader free trade agreement with a given country. For instance, an obstacle to the conclusion of a free trade agreement between the Republic of Korea and the United States has been the failure by the two parties to agree to terms on a bilateral investment treaty.18 ii. Rationales for EPAs (Broader Trade Agreements on a Bilateral or Regional Basis) In terms of the rationales for the conclusion of broader EPAs, some of these have been explored, at least in the East Asian context, in a recent paper prepared by IISD and the Singapore Institute for International Affairs.19 In general terms, the authors give some credence to the argument, put forward by Jagdish Bhagwati and others, that countries are caught up in a process which feeds on itself, as they jockey to keep pace with each other in the conclusion of new trade agreements and to ensure that they are not left on the sidelines without dance partners. In terms of specific economic imperatives, they identify various rationales, including: a desire to create larger markets; a desire to seek \u201cmore and better liberalization than is easily available at the multilateral level\u201d; and the earlier-noted desire on the part of developing countries to signal that they are prepared to play by agreed rules for the treatment of investments or transferred technologies. In addition, groups of countries such as ASEAN may seek regional integration so as to create a combined market more capable of competing with regional giants such as India or China. Finally, agreements may provide a springboard for export to an entire region; in this regard, the authors point to the Republic of Korea\u2019s recent conclusion of an agreement with Chile. With respect to strategic and political considerations, the authors of the IISD/SIIA paper point to the slow pace of liberalisation developments at the multilateral level as one familiar rationale for the proliferation of regional and bilateral economic agreements. Here it should be noted that Japan has hastened to pursue both narrow bilateral investment treaties, as well as broader EPAs with a range of countries in the aftermath of the recent failure of multilateral investment talks. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 15 cited the complicated negotiating environment at the WTO, and the inability of that forum to respond swiftly to desires for faster progress and commitments in new areas.20 The authors of the aforementioned IISD/SIIA paper observe that bilateral trade negotiations, in particular, may provide greater flexibility than unwieldy multilateral or regional forums when it comes to facilitating agreement between a given country and trading partners that may be at varying levels of development. So, for example, Singapore is pursuing individual negotiations with a number of regional neighbours, with each set of negotiations more closely calibrated to the state of development of the other negotiating partner. Regional and Bilateral EPA negotiations also may serve to fulfill strategic goals by shoring up security and political relations between partners, as seen in the China-ASEAN negotiations, or by seeking to stabilise relations between historically antagonistic parties, as in the ASEAN+3 initiative, which involves China, Japan and Korea. Japan has been forthright in its view that free trade agreements may help to shore up its diplomatic influence with other countries and thereby \u201cconsolidate its position within the international community.\u201d21 In another permutation of the security rationale, the U.S. Government has selected partners for its FTAs, including in the Asian region, on criteria that included support for broader US foreign policy goals, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq.22 The United States also has voiced another rationale that is a mixture of the strategic and economic, that of so-called \u201ccompetitive liberalization.\u201d23 This rationale has been used in the context of US negotiations in the Asian region, for example in negotiations with Singapore, as well", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4e71eb2-e54f-432c-a19e-87691fdfc62c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4e71eb2-e54f-432c-a19e-87691fdfc62c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "232def6e04e848a1fde21feb19abc829502ca215f61dd275f2dc46eec4f1c9d1"}}, "hash": "232def6e04e848a1fde21feb19abc829502ca215f61dd275f2dc46eec4f1c9d1", "text": "as in preliminary discussions with other potential partners such as Thailand. According to this rationale, the United States pursues commitments in its Free Trade Agreements that are \u201cWTO-plus\u201d in scope and/or depth. For example, intellectual property rights may be secured for wider ranges of products, processes and even life forms, or prohibitions on the use of performance requirements in the context of foreign investment may exceed those found in the WTO TRIMs agreement. The U.S. strategy not only secures commitments that would be unattainable at the multilateral level, but it thereby sets the \u201cfloor\u201d for any future multilateral negotiations at a higher level. Through the effective use of so-called \u201cforum shifting,\u201d negotiators may push ever-higher international standards thanks to their ability to move to new venues when a given venue or forum shows the signs of gridlock.24 These myriad rationales have given rise to a striking number of bilateral and regional agreements \u2013 both narrow investment agreements and broader trade or economic pacts. Before examining the features of such agreements, and their actual impacts upon human development, it is useful to assess the potential relationship between investment and human development. Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 16 6. The Relationship between Investment and Human Development Human development is a concept that places human beings \u2013 and the importance of their living up to their potential \u2013 at the centre of policy-making. UNDP has defined the term as one concerned with enlarging choices, enhancing outcomes and upholding the basic human rights and freedoms of individuals.25 By treating humans as the subject of development, not its object, the concept also lays particular emphasis on ensuring effective political participation, equity and security. Where economic development indices improve but individual fates differ starkly, human development might not be advanced. Indeed, the United Nations Millennium Development Goals \u2013 which seek to operationalise the concept of human development \u2013 do not look to raise aggregate standards of living or well-being; rather, they look to narrow socioeconomic divides by focusing attention on improving the condition of the least well-off. At the macro-level, economic growth, where properly managed, can be supportive of human development. However, some debate exists as to whether increased FDI contributes positively to such economic growth. The Asian Development Bank notes that \u201cwhile an exhaustive literature has already emerged to support each side of the debate, closure remains elusive.\u201d26 Equally germane, there is intense debate as to whether investment agreements serve to stimulate enhanced flows of foreign direct investment for countries that enter into such agreements. With respect to the latter question, several early studies cast doubt on the claim that bilateral investment treaties served to stimulate new investment flows.27 However, a spate of subsequent studies have generated a more mixed message, with the preponderance seeming to suggest some sort of positive impact, even if there is still some uncertainty on the point.28 Of course, myriad other factors will play a role in the attraction of FDI.29 These may include: \u2022 Political stability \u2022 Macroeconomic stability \u2022 Transparent and streamlined processes (for licenses, permits and so forth) \u2022 Size of market \u2022 Resource endowments \u2022 Infrastructure (transport, communications and so forth) \u2022 Distortion-free economic and business environment \u2022 Fiscal and monetary incentives \u2022 Regional groupings and preferential trading arrangements \u2022 Successful marketing of host country \u2022 Successful marketing of specific locales or country features, e.g., industry clusters \u2022 Policy measures, including those enshrined in national investment laws and international treaties Regardless of the method by which investment has been attracted into a developing country, it will be important that that FDI is harnessed to broader policy goals. Commentators warn not to view FDI as an end in itself, and that mere openness to FDI without a credible national investment strategy could mean that FDI will not be Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 17 successfully harnessed to domestic growth and development.30 Potential gains that may be realised from FDI are summarised below. FDI can introduce newer technologies into less advanced economies. In some cases, these technologies also will require domestic skills-building needed to operate and service these technologies. It should be noted, however, that technology transfer will not necessarily mean that proprietary information is shared readily; some have cautioned that the results of innovation, rather than the innovative capabilities themselves, may get transferred. FDI also may encourage domestic linkages and entrepreneurialism. The former occurs where the investor contracts for inputs with local suppliers, thereby creating so-called backward linkages. Similarly, where domestic firms are involved in the processing of an investor\u2019s products, this will create so-called forward linkages in the economy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f72b29f2-0c9e-402f-b5b2-713a13fa1ddc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f72b29f2-0c9e-402f-b5b2-713a13fa1ddc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "848438064edf5f43ccefb3ed27fd5c3d0c20aee81379215a583fe82bc394f8f9"}, "3": {"node_id": "932cffc6-0862-44fd-9d72-80481742be1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40c25b8be6f916bfb3d639ad706b6b13856b945d841abca3e988df4df811feb2"}}, "hash": "0bfcd9dca997ff9b2654bea5825685b8e87aae577f14d1a0ed1370b4eff3f9d7", "text": "Arguably, the opportunity to create such linkages may contribute to a more entrepreneurial domestic climate, as firms jockey to service the trans-national corporation.31 However, it is also possible that FDI can detract from domestic entrepreneurialism in those instances where trans-national corporations borrow on domestic markets, thereby competing with smaller and medium-sized domestic firms for capital. This phenomenon is referred to as \u201ccrowding out.\u201d FDI can have a salutary effect upon employment levels in the host state, as has been seen in a number of instances where investors have established export-oriented, labour- intensive activities.32 In addition, the trans-national corporation practice of employing and training locals in positions of middle and top management has spinoff effects for other domestic firms as employees change employers over time. However, not all FDI will necessarily have a positive effect upon employment levels. Mergers and acquisitions (M&As), which factor heavily in global FDI activity, may lead to job cuts as two or more firms are merged. Balasubramanyam notes that UNCTAD\u2019s exhaustive analysis of the evidence of negative impacts of such M&As yielded \u201cinconclusive\u201d findings.33 In some cases, it is acknowledged that M&As may have anti-competitive effects if they seriously reduce the number of players in a given market.34 FDI may impact on domestic savings and investment. As the authors of a recent IISD study note, these impacts will oscillate between positive and negative, depending upon circumstances. For example, it will be important that foreign investments not \u201ccrowd out\u201d domestic investments by tapping into the same pools of domestic capital and credit, or by pursuing investment opportunities to the detriment of domestic investors. At the same time, FDI may induce \u201ccrowding in,\u201d the stimulation of new investments in local firms with whom the foreign investor has developed business relationships. Another context where FDI can loom large is in relation to the environment and natural resources. Cleaner trans-national corporation production practices may be an environmental boon; however, in the absence of effective environmental management regimes, FDI can have highly inimical impacts upon resource use (fisheries, forests) or pollution levels. Several of these investment impacts have the potential to impact positively or negatively on human development. What appears to be critical to the effort to derive positive Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 18 benefits from FDI is an emphasis on institutions and policy structures designed to yoke FDI to the broader goal of human development. For example, the absence of strong and effective environmental institutions can quicken resource depletion and, in turn, destabilise communities dependent upon that environment. Likewise, where FDI generates economic \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d policy-making will need to mitigate the impact upon the losing side, or risk growing inequality \u2013 and even ethnic resentment and conflict where particular groups dominate economic relations.35 The ability to obtain public revenues from FDI, either through taxation, royalties or other fees, also may be important to the creation of broader public goods and services such as health and education. It is important to recognise that investment agreements are not conceived, by and large, with any of these wider goals in mind. To the extent that development is contemplated as an end of a treaty, it tends to be couched as \u201ceconomic development,\u201d which is treated as an inexorable byproduct of investment and investment treaties.36 Moreover, as will be elaborated upon in the next section, several tribunals charged with interpreting BITs have interpreted the purpose of such treaties to be \u201cinvestor protection,\u201d with the consequence that uncertainties in meaning have been resolved in favor of investor protection rather than state sovereignty or development policy flexibility.37 Nor are the treaties noted for introducing obligations or responsibilities to balance the rights and protections accorded to investors. A survey by UNCTAD of social responsibility themes in international investment agreements reveals that these agreements rarely impose any binding responsibilities upon foreign investors to further broader social, environmental or developmental objectives. One notable effort by the IISD to establish a balance between investor rights and responsibilities has been the Institute\u2019s Model International Investment Agreement for Sustainable Development.38 However, the absence of such balance in most existing agreements means that investor responsibilities, and certain human development externalities from FDI, may fall to the discretion of Government policy-makers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "932cffc6-0862-44fd-9d72-80481742be1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "932cffc6-0862-44fd-9d72-80481742be1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "848438064edf5f43ccefb3ed27fd5c3d0c20aee81379215a583fe82bc394f8f9"}, "2": {"node_id": "f72b29f2-0c9e-402f-b5b2-713a13fa1ddc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bfcd9dca997ff9b2654bea5825685b8e87aae577f14d1a0ed1370b4eff3f9d7"}}, "hash": "40c25b8be6f916bfb3d639ad706b6b13856b945d841abca3e988df4df811feb2", "text": "Thus, it warrants notice that investment agreements \u2013 by granting extensive rights and protections to foreign investors and investments \u2013 may place effective limits upon state action, including measures and policies designed to further human development ends.

Considerable analysis has gone into examining the impact of investment agreements upon Government action in furtherance of environmental, developmental, health and human rights goals. The following section surveys some of these impacts. 7. Provisions of Existing Agreements that Affect Human Development and How They Do So Generally speaking, bilateral and regional investment treaties move beyond the limited investment rules of the World Trade Organization; in this sense, all can be said to be \u201cWTO-plus\u201d in their impact. Even if one considers the ambitions harboured by the WTO for a multilateral agreement on investment \u2013 and at the attendant work of the WTO Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 19 Working Group on Trade and Investment \u2013 it is still the case that most bilateral and regional agreements exceed that (unconsummated) agenda. So, for instance, while WTO members declined to include protections against expropriation in their study of potential investment negotiations, such protections are the bedrock of bilateral and regional pacts. Moreover, while WTO Governments paid heed to the need to incorporate development safeguards and exceptions into any potential multilateral pact, it is not the case that all bilateral and regional pacts do so; many lack any sort of sectoral exceptions for sensitive social or economic activities. One area where the proposed WTO negotiations would have exceeded most bilateral and regional agreements is in the area of investment liberalisation. The vast preponderance of existing agreements provide protection only for established investments; that is to say, they do not mandate any rights for investors to establish new investments. By contrast, the proposed WTO negotiations were slated to push for the opening up of investment sectors, just as occurs already in services sectors governed by the WTO\u2019s GATS agreement.39 Among the small minority of bilateral and regional agreements that do contemplate some form of investment liberalisation are a number recently concluded by Asian Governments, including agreements between: Japan-Singapore, Japan-Mexico, Thailand-New Zealand, Republic of Korea-Chile, and India-Singapore. Bearing in mind that many elements of bilateral and regional agreements exceed the minimal commitments at WTO \u2013 and in many cases, even those contemplated as part of the proposed mandate for Doha negotiations on investment \u2013 the following sub-sections analyse some of the human development implications of these commitments. i. Impact of Expropriation Rules on Government Regulation or Introduction of New Public Programmes An early concern with regard to investment treaty protections is over provisions that mandate compensation in the event that a foreign investment has been expropriated or nationalised directly or indirectly, which might be interpreted so as to require compensation where Government action (regulation, legislation or other measures) results in a loss of profitability for an investor or investment. The concern for Governments was obvious: that legitimate public welfare regulations that had a negative impact upon a foreign investor might be characterised as expropriative for purposes of the treaty. Following the emergence of a pattern of disturbing investor litigation under the NAFTA, the IISD expressed concern that these claims might have the effect of turning the environmental movement\u2019s touchstone \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle into a \u201cpay the polluter\u201d principle.40 While recent tribunal rulings \u2013 at least in the NAFTA context \u2013 have emphasised that legitimate non-discriminatory regulations are not tantamount to expropriation, some Governments have taken the fear seriously enough that they have moved to clarify this point in more recent treaties.41 In recent months both Canada and the United States have introduced new investment treaty negotiating templates that seek to close this perceived loophole.42 In a related vein, the Japanese and Viet Namese Governments appear to have responded to concerns that expropriation provisions might be used to challenge legitimate taxation measures imposed upon a foreign investor or investment. In their 2003 BIT, the Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 20 two countries went to considerable lengths to shelter legitimate tax measures from allegations that they constitute a form of expropriation.43 If such precautions are viewed as necessary correctives against overly broad interpretation of expropriation provisions, it must be cautioned that the preponderance of investment treaties fail to take such precautions. In Asia, the Japan-Viet Nam treaty is very much an anomaly in terms of its approach to the taxation and expropriation issue. Many BITs and EPAs will fail to incorporate such safeguard language, potentially leaving signatories more exposed to lawsuits in the event that foreign investors object to acts of taxation or regulation. A second concern that has arisen in relation to investment treaty provisions on expropriation is that they may effectively", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5e2c62f-2172-410a-b214-5d574e416b6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5e2c62f-2172-410a-b214-5d574e416b6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cc7a9912b1808e49dc78e12c0719e1cff6bb0d9d1a0855d714fbfb102e9fcac"}}, "hash": "4cc7a9912b1808e49dc78e12c0719e1cff6bb0d9d1a0855d714fbfb102e9fcac", "text": "\u201clock in\u201d private delivery of a particular public good or service, by virtue of the onerous compensation obligations that might flow from any effort to unseat foreign-owned private operators in those sectors. For example, if foreign investors have a sizable stake in the sale of medical or hospital insurance, they might object to an effort by Government to move toward a taxpayer-paid universal system of public health insurance. If the creation of a national health or social insurance scheme would destroy the business line of existing private operators, they might have recourse to argue that they have suffered a form of expropriation under the terms of applicable investment treaties. This issue has yet to be fully explored and analysed in the development literature; however, it has been a point of some concern in Canada, where a Government-appointed commission found that investment treaty obligations could complicate efforts to expand national health services into new areas currently occupied by private (foreign-owned) businesses. The commission heard arguments that even Canada\u2019s existing universal health insurance scheme (providing insurance for doctor and hospital care, but not dental or pharmaceutical services) might not have come into existence in the 1960s had there been an obligation at that time to compensate those whose private business lines which stood to be damaged \u2013 or extinguished \u2013 by new social or health schemes.44 In the context of treaties concluded by Asian Governments, many do not commit the Government to market opening; however, where a government decides \u2013 either unilaterally or in the context of some liberalisation arrangement \u2013 to permit foreign investment in given sectors such as health or social services, the protection standards of ordinary BITs apply; the import may be to create a right to compensation for such companies should the Government move to create a public service or programme at some later date. As such, it is important to note that it is virtually unknown for expropriation provisions to be drafted so as to provide exception for the introduction of new essential public services, health or social insurance schemes. Accordingly, foreign investors who have built up a business line in an Asian territory may have recourse to treaty arbitration in order to seek full compensation in the event that a new social policy or programme \u201cexpropriates the investor\u2019s market share and future profits.\u201d The spectre of this happening should provide sufficient inducement for Governments to think carefully about long-term development goals. Where private foreign investment in select sectors is viewed as a steppingstone to the creation and financing of publicly funded and Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 21 administered social or health schemes, it should be noted that treaty obligations could complicate this transfer of service provisions from the private to the public sphere. ii. Exacting Administrative and Bureaucratic Standards Imposed on Host Governments A common investment treaty discipline requires host states to provide \u201cfair and equitable treatment\u201d to foreign investors and/or investments. A recent review of published arbitration decisions held that the fair and equitable treatment obligation imposes the following requirements on host states: to provide for due process in administrative and judicial contexts; to provide for Government transparency in some circumstances; to refrain from undermining the legitimate expectations upon which the investment had been made; to refrain from arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory actions; and to exhibit good faith toward investors.45 Cumulatively, these duties can set a high standard for host- state authorities, and even relatively wealthy countries have fallen afoul of these treaty obligations. For example, government agencies dealing with foreign investments in Canada and Chile have fallen afoul of the \u201cfair and equitable treatment\u201d obligation by arbitral tribunals examining claims brought by foreign investors in those territories.46 In each case, the Governments have been liable for millions of dollars in damages. Reasonable questions arise as to the ability of many developing countries to live up to these standards. Existing Government institutions and processes may be hobbled by a lack of transparency, clarity, efficiency and user-friendliness \u2013 with resultant drains on a country\u2019s development; however, Governments may lack the resources and capacity to transform such institutions and processes in the immediate term. As such, they face a dilemma as to whether to accede to binding international law commitments that may set the bar at an overly high level given their own state of development. Clearly, a need exists for countries to contemplate sequencing of their foreign investment strategies and policies so as to ensure that guarantees to provide \u201cfair and equitable treatment\u201d are not hollow undertakings, albeit ones that may expose the Government to expensive lawsuits from disaffected", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "483ff0aa-b869-420d-9db4-0d2dc254f182": {"__data__": {"id_": "483ff0aa-b869-420d-9db4-0d2dc254f182", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "635d1ddd635ae56c9efd23dcf2142e59f8ab83ef0c564bf48c382ef17d3fd430"}, "3": {"node_id": "0bd9e8b2-e0af-45f1-967b-5482775e34d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22c6b3e5f6cbb2cd63fcf0446101c1b37dc9f97db3f946eb1b0255ba06b163dd"}}, "hash": "efa2ef4291037a09dee351c608f7199f49f172cadd2c2a526a7cdefd5e2e364e", "text": "foreign investors. Notably, several of the most recent EPAs to be concluded in Asia do not include obligations for the provision of fair and equitable treatment. Both Thailand\u2019s 2005 agreement with New Zealand, and India\u2019s agreement with Singapore, are examples of what might be a new trend in investment agreements. By contrast, many \u2013 but not all \u2013 early-generation BITs concluded in the region seem to incorporate some form of this guarantee. However, a particular deviation from this pattern is seen in earlier BITs concluded by Japan, where treaties concluded with Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh in the 1980s and 1990s omit this obligation, and more recent treaties with the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam introduce such a provision.47 At times, Governments may enter into further express commitments that serve to supplement the general requirement to provide \u201cfair and equitable treatment.\u201d For example, Kyrgyzstan\u2019s BIT with the United States includes obligations to provide for permits, registrations, licenses and other approvals in an expedient manner.48 What\u2019s more, agreements may oblige the parties to significant transparency standards, such as those found in the Japan-Republic of Korea BIT, which provide that each party shall \u201cpromptly publish, or otherwise make publicly available, its laws, regulations, Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 22 administrative rulings and judicial decisions of general application as well as international agreements which pertain to or affect investment and business activities.\u201d By contrast, some agreements such as Canada\u2019s BITs with Philippines and Thailand will provide only a best-efforts commitment to such transparency.49 Further, some agreements may contain so-called umbrella clauses, such as that contained in the U.K.-Bangladesh BIT, which provides that \u201cEach Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.\u201d50 The upshot of such provisions \u2013 particularly when taken in sum \u2013 may be to impose significant obligations upon host state authorities and agencies, sometimes at all levels of Government. Federal Governments entering into such treaty commitments will need to ensure intra-agency coordination and efficiency, so as to facilitate the passage and operations of foreign investors. Where the internal capacity of Governments to meet such obligations is in doubt, Governments should give careful consideration to the international commitments being entered into by its treaty negotiators. iii. Affirmative Action Measures and Their Compatibility With Investment Treaties A fundamental precept of human development is the conviction that all human life is valuable. Economic growth without corresponding attention to the enlargement of people\u2019s choices and opportunities does not contribute to human development.51 Human development requires that improvements are felt across the population, and that gender or ethnic inequality must be targeted for amelioration \u2013 and ultimately, eradication. To give effect to the imperative of human development, Governments may elect to introduce policies or measures designed to improve the livelihoods of women, ethnic groups, indigenous peoples or other disadvantaged groups. Indeed, international human rights law even contemplates certain instances where so-called affirmative action will be necessary, with the United Nations Human Rights Committee having observed that \u201cthe principle of equality sometimes requires States Parties to take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination prohibited by (the UN\u2019s international covenant on civil and political rights).\u201d52 Without passing judgment upon the effectiveness or appropriateness of such policies, it is important to note that Governments may wish to introduce them and, as noted, may point to international human rights obligations as a further argument for having recourse to them. What is equally important to note, however, is that international investment treaties could pose unexpected obstacles to the introduction or maintenance of such policies. Several standard treaty provisions may complicate or bar certain forms of affirmative action targeted at select domestic groups. For instance, the grant of National Treatment to foreign investors might lead tribunals to dictate that any favourable treatment accorded to designated domestic groups (e.g., minorities) would need to be extended to foreign investors \u2013 perhaps undermining the Government\u2019s efforts to give targeted groups an advantage. Thus, some Governments have entered exceptions to the national treatment provisions of investment agreements in order to safeguard their ability to accord more favourable treatment to disadvantaged groups or persons \u2013 and to deny to foreigners the \u201cbest in Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 23 class\u201d treatment accorded to these disadvantaged groups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bd9e8b2-e0af-45f1-967b-5482775e34d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "0bd9e8b2-e0af-45f1-967b-5482775e34d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "635d1ddd635ae56c9efd23dcf2142e59f8ab83ef0c564bf48c382ef17d3fd430"}, "2": {"node_id": "483ff0aa-b869-420d-9db4-0d2dc254f182", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "efa2ef4291037a09dee351c608f7199f49f172cadd2c2a526a7cdefd5e2e364e"}}, "hash": "22c6b3e5f6cbb2cd63fcf0446101c1b37dc9f97db3f946eb1b0255ba06b163dd", "text": "For example, the recently concluded Thailand-New Zealand investment treaty preserves New Zealand\u2019s ability to introduce legitimate measures \u201cit deems necessary to accord more favourable treatment to Maori (indigenous people).\u201d53 Likewise, Canada\u2019s investment treaties with various parties will", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adf3e132-d6c9-49e2-9700-4b5f274ba3d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "adf3e132-d6c9-49e2-9700-4b5f274ba3d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0cdbf3e05dde0401fdad83e9cb7c81123130fa01f7f0047098246a746bcdf95"}}, "hash": "a0cdbf3e05dde0401fdad83e9cb7c81123130fa01f7f0047098246a746bcdf95", "text": "stipulate that special treatment may be accorded to Canada\u2019s aboriginal First Nations population, without fear of running afoul of the treaty\u2019s grant of national treatment to foreign investors.54 The corollary of this decision to include such exceptions is that the failure to do so could complicate \u2013 even jeopardise \u2013 the ability of Governments to introduce special policies for disadvantaged groups. This spectre has surfaced in the context of South Africa\u2019s Black Economic Empowerment Programme, where the Government\u2019s early investment treaties with various European countries neglected to provide shelter for such programmes.55 Only with more recent agreements has the South African government introduced safeguards into its investment treaties. By the same measure, many of the treaties concluded by Asian Governments fail to consider such exceptions, which may have the effect of restricting the policy space of those Governments in this area. Obviously, where a country is not in the habit of granting a guarantee of national treatment \u2013 see, for example, treaties concluded by Malaysia or China - it will not run into difficulties in this regard. But many other treaties that offer national treatment suffer from a failure to place limits on the reach of this obligation. In addition to the national treatment obligation, other investment treaty obligations may hinder affirmative action policies. For example, strictures against the use of performance requirements \u2013 which are rarely found in early BITs but occur more often in newer agreements \u2013 may prove problematic insofar as they forbid host governments from mandating that foreign investors source from domestic suppliers (e.g., minority-owned businesses) or meet employment quotas for the hiring of disadvantaged groups. Unless Governments have had the foresight to create exceptions to such prohibitions, the treaty strictures against domestic content/sourcing or local hiring obligations could collide with affirmative action policies, thereby putting at risk policies designed to serve human development objectives. iv. Arbitration Processes Removing Disputes From the Supervision of Local Institutions It is commonplace for BITs and FTAs to provide for recourse to international investor- state arbitration in the event of disputes. Moreover, the modern practice \u2013 at least since the 1980s \u2013 is to waive any requirement that foreign investors first exhaust their domestic legal remedies before turning to such forms of international arbitration.56 The upshot of this may be to remove significant disputes between foreign investors and Government agencies from the purview of local courts and tribunals. It is often suggested that recourse to international arbitration is important for foreign investors because local courts may be slow, capricious, corrupt, xenophobic or ill-equipped to resolve complex disputes. BITs and FTAs provide foreign investors with the means of detouring around these allegedly dysfunctional local institutions. Yet at the same time, these treaties relegate locals \u2013 including domestic businesses, who may be the lifeblood of domestic investment \u2013 to the mercies of these inadequate institutions. Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 24 By providing foreign investors with an escape clause, the impetus for broader improvement of domestic institutions \u2013 particularly as a result of external pressure \u2013 might be expected to be reduced. The ramifications of these special dispute procedures, with their special avenues for foreign investors, may be negative in human development terms. One author, in a recent study of the impact of BITs upon governance in developing countries, has warned that \u201cdeveloping countries can find themselves in a trap of low- quality institutions wherein no political coalition can form to support institutional improvement. Indeed, the presence of international alternatives to adjudicatory or regulatory bodies may reduce local institutional quality under certain conditions.\u201d57 While relegating locals to these local institutions, it also bears noting that the patchy, bilateral nature of the international investment regime also means that foreigners in identical investment circumstances may have vastly different dispute settlement opportunities, depending upon whether their respective home Governments have concluded investment treaties with the host state. This can be seen, for example, in contemporary Zimbabwe, where the outright seizure and nationalisation of property has generated international arbitration claims by Dutch nationals against Zimbabwe under the Dutch-Zimbabwean BIT, at the same time as locals, along with foreigners of other nationalities, have been left to pursue claims before local courts. The equitability of the present patchwork investment regime leaves much to be desired; from a human development perspective, it is difficult to square such stark differences in access to justice with standard notions of equality.

The present Argentine Government has objected strenuously \u2013 but seemingly to little avail \u2013 to the fact that its series of 1990-era investment treaties has served to catapult disputes with foreign investors related to Argentina\u2019s recent financial crisis out of the jurisdiction of Argentine courts and into the domain of international arbitration. Where disputes may raise sensitive cultural, social or public policy matters, or delicate constitutional or human rights questions, Governments may be bemused to realise that those disputes may not be subject to domestic laws, constitutions or courts, thanks to the terms of investment treaties concluded by predecessor regimes. Asian investment treaties run the gamut in terms of their exposing the host Governments to international arbitration. While recourse to external arbitration provided in Chinese treaties is tightly circumscribed, other treaties such as the Kazakh-Swiss BIT or the Sri Lanka-UK BIT place few obstacles in the path of foreign investors looking to exit the local judicial system in preference to international arbitration. v. Underlying Philosophies of Investment Treaties and Their Avowed Purpose Looking beyond those concerns that pertain to a given treaty obligation, broader concerns arise as to the underlying philosophy of investment treaties. Generally speaking, these treaties have been conceived as instruments for clarifying the level and terms of legal protection to apply to foreign investments. While certain treaties may evince broader Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 25 sensitivities, the touchstone for such instruments remains investor protection. Indeed, the spare preambles of many Asian treaties attest to this fact by laying their emphasis upon narrow goals such as economic cooperation and the maintenance of a favourable investment climate. India\u2019s 1999 BIT with Indonesia hails the desire to \u201ccreate conditions favourable for fostering greater investments\u201d and notes that encouragement and mutual protection of investment will contribute to \u201cprosperity\u201d and \u201cstimulation of individual business initiative.\u201d Japan\u2019s 1998 BIT with Bangladesh strikes the same notes, with emphasis laid upon \u201ceconomic cooperation,\u201d \u201cfavourable conditions for investors,\u201d and the view that the promotion of investment will \u201cstimulate the flow of capital and technology between the two countries\u201d. Malaysia\u2019s 1979 BIT with Sweden is even more succinct in its desire to \u201cmaintain fair and equitable treatment of investments.\u201d What is missing from these particular agreements, and from so many other investment treaties, is a statement of broader purpose. While some treaties go so far as to speculate that investment protection will give rise to \u201cprosperity,\u201d it appears that this will arise by virtue of some mechanistic process: The treaties will stimulate investment, enhanced flows of which will give rise, in an inexorable fashion, to prosperity. It is the rare treaty that notes what ought to be a truism of economic development: It will sometimes require Government intervention or regulation to bring about such an end. The danger is that treaties that are silent as to this need may be used more readily to undermine legitimate public welfare measures. It is surprisingly rare for treaties to set forth a broader series of political and social goals, to which foreign investment might need be harnessed, or at least reconciled in a mutually supportive manner. Here, agreements of a more recent vintage tend to provide some of the more favourable precedents. The 2003 Korea-Chile FTA, for example, sets forth a much broader range of goals in the treaty preamble, including that the agreement \u201cshould be implemented with a view toward raising the standard of living, creating new work opportunities, and promoting sustainable development in a manner consistent with environmental protection and conservation;\u201d as well as in a manner\u201d promoting the public welfare.\u201d58 IISD\u2019s Draft Model Investment Agreement also offers a useful guide for treaty negotiators looking to draft preambles that recognise goals beyond narrow investor protection or economic cooperation.59 One reason why early investment treaties may have failed to reference broader political and social ends is because these treaties were long viewed as something of a \u201cdead letter.\u201d Before the late 1980s, it was unknown for the treaties to have been invoked in formal dispute settlement and, as such, there had been no formal effort on the part of lawyers and arbitrators to interpret the treaty provisions. However, with the gradual \u2013 and later sharp \u2013 rise in litigation under these treaties, arbitration tribunals have looked to the treaties\u2019 preambles for guidance in interpreting the substantive provisions thereof.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ef6b09d-7dd8-4a27-85bb-990b269d2f28": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ef6b09d-7dd8-4a27-85bb-990b269d2f28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "731fb4609ba4a206933ffdec86261a9a1d9ff8aee6a96a3c6a315303af0671f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e816e66-cbe4-4cd8-8caf-a59ce9b5b7cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36eb3455deaa204d751d34e6fe36f205ea2b2df9c53c3bd1439e93cb8f5e070b"}}, "hash": "fef0e004ccfb7ce7b1db04431e362a3c9501a2705ab183a18fe658b2ae17f9cf", "text": "Perhaps not surprisingly, several tribunals have come to adopt readings that are coloured by the narrow \u201cforeign investor-centric\u201d purposes of these agreements.60 In one noteworthy instance, an arbitral tribunal", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a610ae35-c038-4e2a-bf56-da05b9d3e6e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "a610ae35-c038-4e2a-bf56-da05b9d3e6e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b78abf429fda8e7790bc4168db9418b8b740f0aa0b583bb6fd7676942f2198d1"}}, "hash": "b78abf429fda8e7790bc4168db9418b8b740f0aa0b583bb6fd7676942f2198d1", "text": "has interpreted the narrow preamble of a BIT as an invitation \u201cto resolve uncertainties in (the treaty\u2019s) interpretation so as to favour the protection of covered investments.\u201d61 Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 26 This should give pause to Governments, as investment treaties \u2013 and the disputes arising there under \u2013 are extremely broad in scope. Disputes may relate to any number of sensitive matters including natural resources investment; water, electricity or other utility management; health or environmental regulation; or the application of tax measures. A perennial concern is that treaties may have been couched in a manner that gives short shrift to important Government authorities and functions \u2013 especially its right to regulate in the public interest. vi. Intellectual Property Rights Provisions in Investment Agreements A concern that has been slower to crystallize in the investment treaty context is the recognition that these instruments may serve to enshrine heightened protections for intellectual property rights (IPRs) \u2013 and to extend the coveted investor-state dispute settlement mechanism to foreign-based IPR holders. The effect of the inclusion of IPR protections in investment treaties has yet to be analysed fully, primarily because litigation under the treaties has yet to address this question \u2013 or at least to do so publicly.62 Nevertheless, an interest is awakening amongst the intellectual property rights bar about the enhanced IPR protection that may be obtained from investment treaties.63 To begin with, the definition of investment in most investment treaties is couched in such broad terms that it covers property such as patents, trademarks, copyrights and plant varieties, either expressly or by inference. By extension, the substantive protections in the treaty will extend to IPRs which form part of a foreign investment; as such, the aforementioned strictures on fair and equitable treatment, expropriation, national treatment, and other provisions will apply. One practical concern is that foreign investors may be able to launch claims for expropriation of their patent rights in the event that they face either outright revocation of those rights by Government agencies, or a requirement that other actors may exploit such patent rights (by means of so-called compulsory licensing). The WTO\u2019s Declaration on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health has made clear that the issuance of compulsory licenses is permissible in certain instances of public health emergency or crisis. A decision to issue a compulsory license for an essential medicine could trigger a requirement that \u201cadequate remuneration\u201d be paid to the patent holder. One recent analysis of what constitutes \u201cadequate remuneration\u201d for the issuance of compulsory licenses in different national legal systems has found that royalties are set well below the \u201clost profits\u201d threshold.64 This seems logical, the author notes, because compulsory licensing is designed \u201cto increase competitive supply and reduce prices;\u201d to proffer full compensation then would undermine the purpose of issuing such licenses.65 One concern, however, is that investment treaty guarantees designed to provide \u201cprompt, adequate and effective\u201d compensation (read: full compensation) in the event of expropriation might be used by foreign investors to claim much higher levels of compensation than would be available otherwise, and thereby could undermine the policy ends being pursued through compulsory licensing. A second concern is that, where Governments move to revoke or limit intellectual property rights for estimable public policy reasons, such revocations or limitations might Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 27 also be challenged through the mechanism of investment treaty arbitration. For example in the mid-1990s lawyers acting on behalf of U.S. tobacco companies threatened Canada with an investment treaty suit \u2013 alleging expropriation of trademarks \u2013 in the event that Canada moved forward with a public health-inspired proposal for plain (generic) packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products.66 Likewise, Governments have threatened to revoke patent rights in the event that patent applicants failed to disclose the origins of genetic materials contained in those patents. Were such Government party to investment treaties, these treaties might furnish foreign investors with an opportunity to mount international suits alleging breach of the investment treaty guarantees. Alert to such possibilities, a few Governments have incorporated language into their investment treaties that has the effect of foreclosing efforts by foreign investors to use such agreements to extract higher levels of compensation for interference with their patents. The 2005 India-Singapore CECA provides in its expropriation article that \u201cthis Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27ebe1d2-c8e6-452f-9e94-6462c5aa1d89": {"__data__": {"id_": "27ebe1d2-c8e6-452f-9e94-6462c5aa1d89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "017743cf443dbd51183aa00db3f37ccf65a90faaf49e37fa16dee6d3e9ffe8a6"}}, "hash": "017743cf443dbd51183aa00db3f37ccf65a90faaf49e37fa16dee6d3e9ffe8a6", "text": "Intellectual Property Rights.\u201d67 The 2002 Japan-Republic of Korea BIT goes further in that it applies to all provisions of the investment treaty, noting that \u201cnothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to derogate from the rights and obligations under international agreements in respect of protection of intellectual property rights to which the Contracting Parties are parties (including the TRIPs Agreement).\u201d68 Moreover, a second article addresses a related concern: that the Most Favoured Nation provision of the BIT might be used by a foreign investor to claim entitlement to more favorable treatment found in a separate bilateral intellectual property rights agreement concluded by one of the two BIT signatory countries with some third-party country.69 Article 6.2 operates so as to foreclose such cherry-picking of more favorable IPR protections from other treaties. Worryingly, many Governments have neglected to enter safeguards such as these in their investment treaties, leaving open the question whether such agreements might be used in a successful effort to challenge health or public policy measures that impact upon IPRs. Indeed, a selective examination of treaties concluded by Asian Governments finds few instances where such safeguards appear; examples abound where they do not. In particular, it should be noted that such shortcomings are seen in agreements concluded well after the adoption of the 1994 TRIPs Agreement and the resulting controversy over compulsory licensing and public health at WTO, for example, in the 2002 U.K.-Viet Nam BIT. 8. Correcting the Present Imbalances i. Improving the Agreements With investment treaties having been concluded for nearly five decades, it should not be surprising that early agreements \u2013 and even those concluded much more recently \u2013 may not be state-of-the-art in terms of their provisions. Existing agreements need to be viewed through the lens of the growing number of disputes being arbitrated pursuant to these treaties. Where the disputes are visible to the public (and that issue is addressed squarely Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 28 in the next section), they will offer important lessons both for Governments bound by these treaties and for those contemplating more such treaties. Recently, IISD has attempted to incorporate such lessons into its own draft model investment agreement which serves both as a possible jumping-off point for a future, balanced multilateral agreement and a useful guide for negotiators of bilateral treaties. The agreement, and IISD\u2019s Southern Agenda on Investment project, have sought to identify and resolve some of the difficulties arising with respect to the interpretation and application of existing bilateral investment treaties by developing countries.70 Meanwhile, some individual Governments have shown considerable facility in revising their template for the negotiation of new investment treaties. In recent times, both Canada and the United States have adopted new model investment treaties for purposes of guiding future negotiations. These model BITs incorporate a number of innovations and improvements, including clarifications designed to narrow the reach of the expropriation provisions and to introduce various reforms to the procedural rules for investor-state arbitration. In a related vein, several Asian Governments have concluded new-generation investment agreements that are far more detailed than earlier BITs signed by those countries, and that close various loopholes found in earlier agreements. For example, India\u2019s CECA with Singapore addresses concerns related to the potentially broad obligation to provide \u201cfair and equitable treatment\u201d by omitting to include the provision altogether! By contrast, earlier Indian treaties with Kazakhstan, Indonesia and the Netherlands all contain this obligation to provide \u201cfair and equitable treatment.\u201d Additionally, the new India- Singapore CECA introduces a host of exceptions and safeguards not found in earlier BITs, and that are intended to limit the reach and application of investment treaty obligations in sensitive sectors or circumstances. For example, the agreement adopts language similar to that discussed in Section 7(i) so as to ensure that legitimate non-discriminatory public welfare measures will rarely be deemed to constitute expropriation under the treaty. Such language is missing from other Indian BITs. Finally, the new India-Singapore agreement also introduces a host of new general exceptions designed to preserve policy space for measures or regulations related to: public morals; public order; human, animal or plant life or health; safety; national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value; or conservation of exhaustible natural resources. Other recent Asian agreements exhibit the same general trend, with recent BITs and EPAs concluded by Japan with the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam endeavouring to close certain loopholes that can be seen in earlier-model Japanese treaties, such as those still in force with Turkey, Sri Lanka or Bangladesh.

Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 29 An in-depth analysis of the hundreds of BITs and EPAs concluded by Asian Governments is beyond the scope of this paper. Clearly, however, there is a need on a country-by- country basis for Governments to undertake a frank re-evaluation of their existing treaty commitments, as well as their plans for future negotiations. Governments should undertake retroactive impact assessments to assess the degree to which important development, health, human rights, cultural or other interests are safeguarded under these treaties. Indeed, the very fact that some Governments have moved to close loopholes, and to draft agreements with greater consideration for their policy impacts, sends a troubling signal about existing agreements that suffer from serious shortcomings and remain in force. Here, Governments need to adopt thoughtful and comprehensive strategies for dealing with these agreements before finding themselves in a political jam. It is customary for investment treaties to have built-in expiration dates, after which the treaty may stay in force only so long as a party does not move to terminate the agreement. Many early treaties may linger for lack of any political interest in supplementing them with more modern agreements. One obvious means by which Governments may provide for seamless levels of basic investor protection, while closing certain loopholes and shortcomings, is to overwrite earlier BITs with newer BITs or wider economic agreements. By this method, the Republic of Korea was able to update its late-1990s BIT with Chile when it negotiated a broader free trade pact in 2003. When the latter agreement came into force, the former agreement was automatically terminated. This had a number of effects, including the introduction of certain environmental safeguards, the addition of an exception for regulation of those public services provided \u201cin the exercise of governmental authority,\u201d and a requirement that any investor-state arbitrations under the agreement be publicly declared. What\u2019s more, the agreement eliminated a provision found in the earlier BIT between the two parties that might have permitted foreign investors to reach into other international agreements (for instance, bilateral intellectual property rights agreements) signed between the parties.71 Where negotiation of a new agreement is not a short-term prospect, some potential may exist for amending or issuing so-called interpretive statements for given treaty provisions so as to address concerns.72 Of course, renegotiation or amendments may be more difficult to achieve where asymmetry is notable in negotiating power between the two treaty signatories, or where foreign investment tends to flow in only one direction, meaning that vulnerability for one (host) Government may be viewed as an opportunity for the other (home) Government and its business interests. Still, renegotiation or amendment would seem more feasible where foreign investors have yet to exploit weaknesses in given treaties; once investors have come to lean upon the rights contained therein, it may be more difficult to bring about changes to the treaty text. Moreover, even capital-exporting countries may have an interest in clarifying provisions that could undermine legitimate Government regulation or policy-making, as has been seen in the NAFTA context, where the United States and Canada have pushed for clarification of key treaty provisions. Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 30 ii. Improving the Institutions In concert with the need to examine critically the substantive rights and protections proffered by investment treaties, there is also occasion for re-evaluating the procedures by which disputes are resolved under such treaties. As was noted earlier, no uniform requirement exists for disputes to be publicly registered or acknowledged; likewise, it is standard for such disputes to be arbitrated in-camera, with the public, the press and other interested Governments forbidden from attending the proceedings. Depending upon arbitral rules available under the given treaty, there may be no requirement that the final award (legal ruling) be made public. For all these reasons, it can be extremely difficult to develop a full picture of disputes arbitrated pursuant to investment agreements, and the interpretations that they bring to bear upon the investment treaty obligations. This is problematic given the binding nature of these treaties and the potential for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72d11296-a596-4287-9d2f-2aeab8fe9759": {"__data__": {"id_": "72d11296-a596-4287-9d2f-2aeab8fe9759", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investment-provisions-free-trade-agreements-and-investment-treaties", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00c7f21cfaca0652bee5063cd383d6db7da2242a894ff2c01d8cad91863848e3"}}, "hash": "00c7f21cfaca0652bee5063cd383d6db7da2242a894ff2c01d8cad91863848e3", "text": "them to give rise to money damages in cases where foreign investors\u2019 protections are infringed. While the overwhelming proportion of international investment treaties suffers from most, if not all, of the above-mentioned defects, trends are afoot that seek to bring greater transparency to the process. Following an extensive public outcry in North America, Canada and the United States were the first to promise that they would, of their own volition, disclose all arbitrations launched against them under the NAFTA\u2019s investment chapter. Although the Governments also were committed to pushing for open arbitral hearings in such disputes, they remained at the mercy of the investor bringing the claim. The Governments have since moved to take discretion on open hearings out of the hands of investors by dictating in new investment treaties and FTAs that all investor-state arbitration hearings will be open to the public. Other Governments have followed this lead. For example, the 2003 Republic of Korea- Chile FTA provides that all arbitrations must be disclosed, but the agreement does not go so far as to open the resulting hearings to the public. By contrast, the India-Singapore 2005 CECA provides neither public disclosure of arbitrations, nor public access to such hearings. As a general rule, instances where Asia-Pacific Governments have concluded agreements that bring greater transparency to bear on the dispute settlement process are quite exceptional. The result of this is that Governments \u2013 and their citizens \u2013 may be in the dark when it comes to glimpsing the full emerging policy implications of these important treaties. Another defect in the dispute settlement mechanism provided in investment treaties is that it is inherently an ad hoc process, susceptible to having multiple tribunals look at essentially the same facts, and reach contrary or even opposite conclusions. In the NAFTA context, IISD has warned that the one-off nature of arbitrations gives rise to concerns that \u201cthe absence of a consistent interpretation of Chapter 11 may lead to the loss of Government certainty and public understanding of the obligations Governments face\u201d.73 Already, two parallel claims pursued by a foreign firm, and its major shareholder, under two separate BITs with the Czech Republic, have served to highlight an Achilles\u2019 heel of this process. Separate tribunals reviewed the same facts and reached opposite conclusions as to the treaty liability of the Czech Republic.74 The fact that this may occur offers a sign of the potential ambiguity of these treaties; the scope for interpretive discretion by arbitrators; and a sense that the process of arbitration itself is problematic. This Investment Provisions in Free Trade Agreements and Investment Treaties 31 shortcoming has been much discussed by the investment arbitration community, and some Governments have moved to introduce into new treaties a procedure for the consolidation of arbitrations arising out of the same dispute or similar legal matters.75 For example, the 2003 Republic of Korea-Chile FTA introduces such provisions, but other recent Asia-Pacific treaties do not.76 Nor do earlier treaties evidence much concern for the consolidation of investor-state arbitrations. This could be because there have been comparatively few known treaty-based arbitrations against Asia-Pacific countries to date. While Sri Lanka was the first to face such arbitration, in the 1980s, most other Governments in the region have had little experience in formal disputes. For example, the authors are unaware of any investment treaty claims having been arbitrated against Malaysia, Thailand, China, Republic of Korea, or Singapore. What\u2019s more, it appears that Pakistan faced its first such case only in 2001 (although several have arisen since), India in 2003, and Indonesia and Mongolia in 2004. As such, many Asia-Pacific countries have yet to feel the bite of these agreements in the way that Governments in other regions have. Accordingly, less appetite may exist for reform of a template that has yet to generate problems. Indeed, the relative lack of arbitration in some countries may be due to the fact that their treaties provide for a more circumscribed right to initiate international arbitration in the first place. For instance, most Chinese BITs are notable for permitting arbitration to occur only where the parties are in dispute over the amount of compensation to be awarded in the event of an expropriation. The 2005 Thai-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership Agreement also provides only that parties may agree to submit disputes to investor-state arbitration, and offers recourse to arbitration \u201cprovided that the other Party does not withhold its consent.\u201d Apart from denying foreign investors the use of such a mechanism, reforms can be designed to improve the functioning of that mechanism.

Much discussion has been devoted to the creation of an appellate mechanism that would serve to review tribunal decisions and ensure their mutual consistency. Likewise, a standing court might be conceived so as to hear such arbitrations in the first instance. The current approach whereby litigators \u2013 who act on behalf of investor clients in select arbitrations \u2013 may be eligible to serve as arbitrators in other arbitrations also poses legitimacy problems. Strengthened guidelines for conflict of interest might serve to ensure that the functions of advocacy and adjudication are not merged. iii. Building Capacity Given the broad reach and scope of investment treaties, it will be imperative for all key Government agencies and departments to be cognisant of investment treaty negotiations and commitments, so as to ensure that these treaties do not expose sensitive policies or concerns to legal challenges. In turn, this requires dedicated monitoring of new developments. Governments, particularly in less wealthy developing countries, may Opportunities and Threats for Developing Countries 32 require assistance in monitoring developments under international investment treaty law and applying lessons learnt to future negotiations Recommendations include the creation of a regional investment forum to facilitate sharing of information related to investment treaty negotiation, interpretation and application. The OECD\u2019s Investment Committee provides much the same function for OECD member-states to exchange views and information on investment treaties. In addition, traditional capacity building provided by international organisations can benefit from a wider range of critical opinion and advice, given that a number of non- Government groups have undertaken significant \u2013 in some cases, groundbreaking \u2013 analysis of treaty usage (including investigations into secretive dispute settlement contexts). A multilaterally managed fund for technical assistance on investment also might ensure financing for these types of capacity building and consultative activities.

The report builds on preliminary analysis undertaken by the Republic Statistician in the Kiribati National Statistics Office, who guided the analysis and who provided strong support and technical inputs to the production of this report. Information on the survey methodology and data processing was provided by the Regional Statistics Programme of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). It was a pleasure to work with the staff of the Kiribati National Statistics Office and the analysis has benefited from their insights, technical support and dedication. Valuable inputs and comments have also been provided on working drafts of the paper by UN colleagues in Fiji and at the UNDP Pacific Centre, especially Carol Flore. However, none of those who have contributed their advice and insights are responsible for any errors in the analysis presented here. It is hoped that the analysis contained in this report will stimulate national policy makers in Kiribati and users in the international community to seek more detailed analysis to be conducted on specific issues relating, inter alia, to food consumption patterns, specific areas of expenditure including health and education, gender, children in poverty and the nature of poverty at the three sub-regional levels identified in the report. The further and more detailed analysis of broader socio-economic issues in Kiribati which can be done using the survey data will add policy substance to the key poverty indicators. It will also assist in developing the various conclusions and hypotheses relating to poverty in Kiribati which are covered in this report. This report was funded through contributions from the Government of Norway and the UNDP Pacific Centre in Fiji. It is part of a series of crisis response Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) initiatives aimed at generating policy responses to protect human development gains and to stimulate a broader policy dialogue. The Poverty Group at UNDP manages the PSIA initiative and provides technical guidance to country teams conducting the analysis. David Abbott Pacific Regional Macroeconomic and Poverty Reduction Advisor UNDP Pacific Centre March 2010 Acknowledgements iii Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence I am very pleased and honoured to present this National Report on Poverty and Hardship lndicators for Kiribati based on an analysis of the 2006 household income and expenditure survey. This is the first time that Kiribati has compiled a set of such indicators and it is very timely as the government and the economy struggle to overcome the challenges posed by the recent rapid increases in food and fuel prices, and the loss of employment and revenues that have occurred as a consequence of the global economic recession over the past two years. An estimation of National Food and Basic Needs Poverty Lines for Kiribati enables the government to gain a better understanding of the numbers, location and characteristics of those living below the national poverty line for Kiribati. The incidence of poverty as measured by national basic-needs poverty lines is a measure of hardship being experienced by households and families as they try to meet a minimum standard of living. This report includes discussions of poverty in Kiribati within the broader Pacific region, but its primary focus is to assess and define poverty within the context of the basic cost of a minimum standard of living in Kiribati and its designated sub-regions of South Tarawa (the urban centre), Rest of the Gilberts Group (the rural areas) and the Line and Phoenix lslands (Linnix). The analysis also makes an assessment of the impact of the recent global economic recession on the people of Kiribati. Our Kiribati National Development Plan 2008-11 recognises that poverty and hardship are now emerging issues and this report will assist us to address these issues more effectively.

The report and its findings are an important guide to government policy-makers and community leaders alike in planning and formulating appropriate policies that could improve the lives and well-being of our people, especially those living below the national poverty line. The challenge for Kiribati is to design and implement, with the support of our development partners, appropriate policy responses to dealwith the increasing levels of hardship and poverty that are now arising in the country and to ensure that the aspirations of the people of Kiribati for better standards of living are met. The Government of the Republic of Kiribati would like to thank the UNDP Pacific Centre for its support to the National Statistics Office in the production of this report and to the Secretariat of the Pacific Community for the conduct of the household survey. lt is our hope that this, the first full report on poverty in Kiribati, will be part of a continuing series of such reports to assess poverty and gauge the progress of Kiribati in addressing the needs of its people. To this end, the continued assistance of UNDP Pacific Centre and of other development partners will be essential. Te Mauri, Te Raoi ao Te Tabomoa.

Islands Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence Executive Summary Introduction 1. Poverty as measured by national poverty lines is a relative measure of hardship. It assesses the basic costs of a minimum standard of living, made up of food and non-food basic needs in a particular society. Using the poverty line as a benchmark the number of households and/or the proportion of the population that are deemed not to be able to meet these basic needs can be measured. The basket of goods that make up the basic-needs for individual households, and the costs associated with these, are likely to differ across the country between the urban and rural areas. It is therefore necessary to analyse the data from each part of the country to provide an understanding of the relative costs and standards of living of households and people living in different locations. 2. Poverty analysis is primarily concerned therefore with identifying within each society those households and individuals that are least well-off or most disadvantaged, where they live and what characteristics they might have that set them apart from those that are better-off. In order to be able to develop targeted pro-poor poverty reduction or poverty alleviation strategies it is necessary to try to understand why some are poor and others are not. Is the lack of education a common characteristic? Is the age, gender or employment status of the head of household a common factor? By analysing data from household income and expenditure surveys it is possible to begin to gain a better understanding of these poverty issues and the characteristics of both poor and non-poor households. Through better understanding, better policies can be developed in order to reduce hardship and poverty. Purpose of the Paper 3. The purpose of this paper is therefore to provide estimates of National Food and Basic Needs Poverty Lines for Kiribati based on an analysis of the household data from the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). For the purpose of the analysis the country has been divided into three sub-regions; South Tarawa (the urban centre), the Rest of the Gilbert Islands (the rural areas) and the Line and Phoenix Islands. National and sub- regional level poverty lines have been estimated and the incidence of poverty in each of the sub-regions has been measured. 4. The HIES contains a wealth of information. This paper analyses the expenditure data to estimate the incidence of poverty and the Head Count Index (HCI)1 by comparing food and basic needs poverty lines to recorded levels of expenditure. 5. It also provides an analysis of the broad characteristics of low-expenditure households in terms of their socio- economic status, demographics and level of household access to basic services. Together with the poverty indicators these provide a good indication of which households are the most disadvantaged in Kiribati, what common characteristics they might share and why they might be in this situation. Such information will be useful for government to define targeted policies and interventions to assist in alleviating their poverty and hardship. 6. Poverty, as measured by national and sub-regional basic-needs poverty lines, may be regarded as measures of hardship between households living in similar sub-regions. It assesses the basic costs of a minimum standard of living in a particular society, or a particular sub-region, and measures the number of households and proportion of the population that are deemed to be unable to meet these basic needs. Every country experiences some 1 1 The Head Count Ratio is not the same as the Poverty Indicator in Millennium Development Goal 1. The MDG 1 indicator, based on US$1 per day, is not yet available for Kiribati, or any other Pacific Islands Countries, as estimates of the Purchasing Power Parity exchange rates required to calculate the MDG indicator have not yet been finalised by SPC and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The MDG 1 indicator, when available, will enable direct comparisons of \u2018absolute\u201d poverty levels to be made between countries.

For example in the USA a household of six persons would be deemed below the national basic- needs poverty line if their annual HH income was less than about US$30,000. In Kiribati a HH with six persons would be deemed to be below the poverty line if the average HH income/expenditure was less than about A$6,000. 8. For the analysis of hardship and poverty in Kiribati the household income and expenditure data from the 2006 HIES has been used to estimate Food and Basic Needs Poverty Lines. These then provide the basis for estimating the poverty and hardship experienced by the poorest households across the three regions of the country. From these, incidence levels, depth and severity of poverty have also been measured. Estimates have also been made of Gini coefficients on levels of inequality in expenditure by households. An analysis of the characteristics of the poorest 30% (bottom three deciles, L3D) of households has also been assessed. 9. In this report a HH falling below the food poverty line is deemed to be in a state of \u201cabsolute\u201d poverty whereby the household\u2019s income/expenditure (including own food production) is insufficient to meet even the costs of a minimum level of nutrition. A household with income/expenditure at our below the basic needs poverty line is deemed to be in \u201crelative\u201d poverty compared to other HH in the country. The HH will not have sufficient income/ expenditure to meet an estimated minimum standard of living relative to the basic needs poverty line. 10. The measurement of the incidence of absolute poverty across a number of countries is usually done through the estimation of the \u201cUS$1 per day3\u201d purchasing power parity (PPP) value used in Goal 1 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Presently this measure of poverty cannot be estimated since PPP indices for Pacific Island countries are not yet available. Food and Basic Needs Poverty Lines 11. The Food Poverty Lines (FPL) for Kiribati and households/families in the three sub-regions have been estimated from the actual food expenditure patterns recorded in survey diaries for households in the lowest four-deciles of expenditure, measured in per-capita adult-equivalent terms. An FPL measures the cost of a minimally nutritious diet, based on an average adult daily food-energy intake of around 2100 calories4. 12. To estimate the cost of the FPL in Kiribati, CPI prices were used to measure the costs of purchased items. The actual values recorded in the diaries were used to estimate the notional costs of items that were produced for home consumption (subsistence production). This is important because in the rural areas and in the Linnix particularly, subsistence production accounts for around 43% and sixty-percent respectively of food consumed by the poorest households. In comparison, in South Tarawa subsistence production accounts for only about one- third of food consumed by those in the bottom thirty percent of households. 13. The weighted average household FPL in 2006 for the country as a whole is estimated to be A$63.54 (A$9.07 per capita adult equivalent (p.c.a.e.) per week. For South Tarawa, which had the highest food costs, the weekly household food poverty line was estimated to be A$104.42, (A$10.97 p.c.a.e. per week). In other parts of the 2 In developed countries, relative poverty is defined as a measure that is related to distributional issues. To estimate poverty, researchers will usually define a poverty line as a proportion of median (or mean) income. By this concept, whenever median (mean) incomes increase, relative poverty increases as well. It is a way to highlight inequality in the distribution of income. Absolute poverty on the contrary usually refers to the level of poverty obtained when the poverty line is defined in relation to a consumption basket. 3 The US1-per-day PPP in 1993 prices has recently been revised by the World Bank to be US$1.25 per day PPP in 2005 prices. The equivalent of this report\u2019s \u201crelative\u201d poverty is estimated at US$2.50 per day PPP in 2005 prices. 4 This is the minimum food-energy intake recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN, and the World Health Organisation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46b5044c-1ee2-4fd8-ba1e-c46b5bc1b2a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "46b5044c-1ee2-4fd8-ba1e-c46b5bc1b2a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c02e45f1b58af3684c9208427293a48a78144f688809ec04094db283629135cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce3ca71d-9756-4a45-8d59-583003d0985e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c088f95f4681c38498d865943387d74577304f12274ff950788d8a864927b198"}}, "hash": "02aabe802354fa027fa06bf71286d533e025df08b4f0a28a0df8c8dcb5ec80ee", "text": "3 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence country the corresponding figures were A$84.39 (A$10.99 p.c.a.e.) in the Line Islands and A$48.32 (A$7.74 p.c.a.e.) in the rural Gilberts. 14.

The BNPL for the rural Gilberts was considerably lower, at A$83.81 for an average low-income HH. The lower rural BNPL derives from the lower food costs, much of rural food is home grown, and the lower demand for non-food expenditure in remote communities where opportunities for such expenditure are limited. 15. The per capita adult equivalent costs of the BNPL are estimated at A$24.22 for South Tarawa, A$20.38 for the Line Islands and A$13.34 for the rural Gilberts. 16. The amounts actually reported by households as being spent on non-food essentials varies between the sub-regions. On South Tarawa poor households (bottom three deciles) reported spending just about as much on non-food items each week as they spent on food. In the Line islands food represented 60% of weekly expenditure, and non-food 40%. In the rest of the Gilberts poor households reported spending approximately 53% of weekly expenditure on food and 47% on non food items. These differences are common in other Pacific countries where non-food items feature much more prominently in the urban centres. Indeed in Kiribati the differences are in fact rather less than seen elsewhere in the sub-region and reflect the lack of availability of the wide range of personal services that are usually found in urban centres. 17. For the purposes of calculating the BNPL the average actual amount of expenditure incurred by households in the lowest three deciles was taken as the basis for non-food basic needs. Applying these actual expenditure amounts to the FPL gives the non-food basic-needs component as illustrated in Table ES1. This table also summarises the weekly per capita adult equivalent poverty lines and the average cost per bottom-three-decile household in adult equivalent terms. Incidence of Poverty 18. The Incidence of Poverty has been estimated by calculating: a) the proportion of households, and b) the proportion of population, which reported weekly adult equivalent per capita expenditure less than the relevant food or basic needs poverty lines, see Section 7.3 and Table ES2. 19. The average incidence of basic needs poverty, as measured by the Head Count Index (HCI) over all households nationally, is estimated at 17.0%, accounting for 21.8% of the population. Within the national average, South Tarawa recorded the highest incidence of basic needs poverty of 18.3% of households and 24.2% of the population. In contrast in the Line Islands the data indicates a very low level of basic needs poverty incidence affecting only 6.8% of households and 8.9% of the population. In the rural Gilberts an estimated 17.9% of households and 22.0% of the population fell below the level of the BNPL.

These relative levels of national basic needs poverty compare favourably with other countries around the region. 21. With the sharp rises in food and fuel prices that have occurred over the last eighteen months many households are becoming increasingly vulnerable to falling below the poverty lines. It is estimated that an additional 5.6% and 12.1% of the population would fall into poverty with increases in the BNPL of 10% and 20% respectively. This is discussed further in Section 7.4.

The Squared Poverty Gap Index (SPGI), which measures the severity of poverty6 being experienced, is estimated at 3.5 nationally. This is a lower poverty severity index than estimated in FSM 4.0, and is less than the recent estimate for Fiji, 5.1. In South Tarawa the SPGI is estimated at 3.4, with a higher index of 4.7 in the rural Gilberts. This suggests that Kiribati experiences a somewhat lower level of poverty severity than other regional countries; in other words the distribution of those households falling below the basic-needs poverty line is skewed (or biased) towards the poverty line itself rather than away from it. The PGI and SPGI indices reflect the fact that there is a significant variation in expenditure levels between the poor and non-poor households. Measured in per capita adult equivalent terms, the average weekly household expenditure for all HH was 7.5 times higher in those households in the highest decile compared to those in the lowest decile, see Section 7.5. In the rural Gilberts this ratio was even higher, at 8.1 times. This reflects the big differences that occur on the outer islands between those who are in formal employment (teachers, nurses, police etc) compared to those who are primarily engaged in the informal and subsistence sectors. Income Distribution and Inequality 24. The Gini Coefficient is a measure of income/expenditure inequality where a higher index, maximum 1.0, would signify total inequality, and an index of zero would indicate total equality. At the national level the Gini Coefficient in 2006 was estimated at 0.39, with South Tarawa and the Line Islands being slightly lower at 0.35 and 0.34 respectively and the rural Gilberts slightly higher, 0.42, see Section 8. These Gini coefficients are broadly in line with those estimated for other Pacific countries; in global terms they do however indicate that the levels of inequality being experienced in Pacific countries generally are much higher than many might have been expected. A \u201creasonable\u201d level of equality would be signified by a Gini of between 0.30 and 0.35, so therefore Kiribati is bordering on an unreasonable level of inequality. 5 PGI: An index of the percentage by which the average expenditure of poor households falls below the BNPL, thus in Kiribati the average expenditure of poor households is 7.2% below the BNPL. 6 SGI: An index based on the PGI which by \u201csquaring\u201d the amount that a household\u2019s expenditure is below the BNPL gives additional weight to the poorest households; the higher the index the greater the severity of poverty experienced. 5 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence Who are the Poor and What are Their Characteristics? Gender and Hardship 25. The gender of the head of household appears to play a small but important role in determining the likelihood of a household being in poverty in Kiribati. Nationally just under one-in-five HH was headed by a female, however on South Tarawa the proportion was one-in-four amongst those HH in the bottom three deciles. The HIES analysis therefore suggests that female-headed households are slightly over- represented in the lowest three expenditure deciles in both South Tarawa and in the rest of the Gilberts. Not however in the Line Islands where 10.8% of HH were female-headed but only 7.9% of HH in the lowest three deciles were headed by females. 26. At the other end of the scale female HH households accounted for 27.8% of all HH in the top quintile in South Tarawa, but only 18.3% in the top quintile in the rural Gilberts. The status of females is discussed further in Section 9.2. Children in Hardship 27. The survey indicated that there were a total of 32,791 children less than 15 years in the country, representing 38% of the total estimated population, with an average of 2.3 children per household. In the lowest three deciles the number of children per HH was significantly higher at 2.7 nationally and 3.6 on South Tarawa. 28.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c99a8d4-aa79-46f3-9634-3f98d2db3997": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c99a8d4-aa79-46f3-9634-3f98d2db3997", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd3b2dc470643b52a00b6a63eda20d69b27008306fc909eaf6055133c97a9e4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "8dc1103b-97e1-4249-ae96-55950a9d5b2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "557720204f404346611c8e2cff893335a0bc334a9adaf516bfc462666dddd2e2"}}, "hash": "50c3ee18555d9cce85fe3367a2ed66883c38ef36a9f6cf389a01671f177fc438", "text": "28.

Even amongst HH in the highest quintile the proportion of households with no education was 8.3%, similar to that found in the lowest deciles elsewhere. These are amongst the highest rates of no-schooling found in the whole Pacific region and are a clear cause for concern. 31. Amongst the adult population as a whole the situation was similar, 12.3% of all those of 15 years and over reported having completed no level of education. In the lowest three deciles the rate was 14.3% and in the bottom quintile 15.9%. The gross and net enrolment rates at primary school have been reported as being close to one-hundred percent for many years (2005 MDG Report); these HIES figures therefore suggest that many must have dropped-out during their schooling and thus never completed primary. 32. Those achieving only primary level accounted for 43.8% of all household heads, and accounted for 35.8% for the adult population as a whole. Amongst those in the lowest three deciles 57.8% had only primary education and of all those adults in the lowest three deciles 44.6% had only achieved primary level. Those completing senior secondary school or higher accounted for only 22% of those in the lowest three deciles but 44% of those 6 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence in the highest quintile, section 9.6. Thus there would appear therefore to be a clear link between the poorest households and the lack of educational achievement. Source of Energy for Cooking 33. Over three-quarters of households in the rural Gilberts and Line Islands rely on wood fires for cooking. This extends across and across all expenditure deciles. Only in the top quintile in the rural Gilberts and Line islands is kerosene an alternative cooking fuel where it is used by 22% and 37% of top quintile HH respectively. On South Tarawa however kerosene is the most widely used cooking fuel with approximately three-quarters of all HH across deciles using this source. Almost twenty-five percent of those HH in the bottom quintile still use wood as the primary cooking fuel. This is becoming increasingly difficult on South Tarawa as the tree cover is gradually being depleted; this then causes already poor HH to purchase kerosene to meet their cooking needs. Although power is widely available on South Tarawa virtually no HHs reported using electricity for cooking although about ninety-percent reported relying on electricity for lighting, Section 9.7. For many poor HH the cost of purchased power, either electricity or kerosene, is a deterrent to its use. For those in the outer islands firewood is generally easily accessible, but for those in Tarawa this is no longer the case. Access to Safe Water 34. Access to both safe water and sanitation facilities are important factors in ensuring good health for children. Access to these two is therefore a key issue in considering poverty and hardship alleviation. For low decile HH on South Tarawa access to water supplies is split between piped supplies and public/HH wells, approximately 40% each source, and public/HH water tanks, approximately 20%. For HH in the higher deciles the preferred source is a HH water tank which gives greater control over the source and its quality. Wells and piped supplies on Tarawa are generally regarded as not being entirely safe and there are therefore significant risks for many HH in the type of access available to them, Section 9.8. Access to Sanitation 35. Across the country approximately one-third of HH in the bottom three deciles have no HH sanitation system; a further quarter relies on traditional HH pits or over water closets. Thus less than half of all poor HH have access to a safe sanitation system. The use of these unsafe systems is especially problematic on South Tarawa where overcrowding and the use of the beach and lagoon beaches presents very significant health risks for all, but especially for children. Conclusions The estimate that around one-in-five households and almost one-in-four of the population of Kiribati may be living below the national minimum cost of living or basic needs poverty line may come as a surprise to many. 36.

It means rather that many households are struggling to meet their basic living expenses on a daily or weekly basis, particularly those expenses that require cash payments. Families constantly have to make choices on a daily or weekly basis between the competing demands for household expenditure and the limited availability of cash income to meet that expenditure; trade-offs are made between one bill and another, food or fees. Households deemed to be experiencing basic-needs poverty are therefore facing hardship on a daily basis. They struggle to pay bills and to purchase adequate and suitably nutritious food. They might need to borrow regularly from informal loan providers (\u201cloan-sharks\u201d) who charge very high interest rates for small unsecured loans to meet family commitments and community obligations. They are thus frequently, and occasionally constantly, in debt. 7 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 37. Drift of populations to the urban centre of South Tarawa, especially amongst young men, leads to higher levels of unemployment and growing numbers of people living in poor quality housing conditions and squatter-type settlements, without adequate access to safe water and sanitation. These all contribute to a deteriorating social environment and to increasing problems with poor health, especially for children. 38. Many of the poor live in low-quality housing without proper access to water, sanitation and other basic services. Poor housing conditions lead to poor health, poor employment prospects, and poor education attainment. Children may miss school due to ill-health or because school fees or associated costs have not been paid. Adults are frequently poorly educated and thus unable to get anything but the lowest paid and often casual employment, if such employment is even available. The cycle of poverty can therefore be perpetuated. 39. This analysis seeks to provide government with clearer, evidence-based indications of the extent and nature of poverty in Kiribati. It suggests policy issues and possible policy options to address these. Increased opportunities for employment or economic opportunity, not only in the urban centres but also in the rural areas, together with improved basic education are amongst the most critical. 40.

Introduction 2.1 Background 7. Kiribati is a small Pacific nation with a total population of around 90,000 (2005 Census). The country consists of 33 atolls and reef islands, of which twenty-one are permanently inhabited, spread across an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 3.5 million sq.km, the largest in the Pacific. Being coral atolls and reef islands the soil is generally very poor and infertile making agriculture difficult. The total land area is only 726 sq. km., of which over half (388 sq km) is on Kiritimati (Christmas Island) situated some 1200 km south of Hawai\u2019i and over 2,000 km. to the east of the capital on Tarawa. 8. The main subsistence tree-crops are coconuts and toddy, breadfruit, pandanus and bananas. In many islands the giant swamp taro, locally known as Babai is grown in large man-made pits that need to be carefully tended and mulched. Pumpkin, sweet potato and other hardy ground crops can also be grown. Small livestock, chickens and pigs are also kept as a source of food. There is little potential for any large scale agriculture. The marine environment of the islands provides the primary source of protein in reef and ocean fish, as well as shell fish and other crustaceans found on the reef flats.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f73c96e-65b4-471d-8457-f8d0fa2f2b86": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f73c96e-65b4-471d-8457-f8d0fa2f2b86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28300325cade2a5048a9aeae144e6639dfe907feed8297e6bc77081d854279d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "79d8669a-5f2e-4af1-8dbb-d4115555ccde", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04ef33d119c443adc71645da0ce51e633ef613cd4dee8c7fe1a46c26d3fec07c"}}, "hash": "971513eec6087a2d99b177361302e06e22ea49a9dfd21e02d36d75401f18c990", "text": "The atoll lagoons have provided opportunities for small businesses in harvesting aquarium fish, and there have been projects for seeding giant clams and the production of seaweed for the pharmaceutical industry.

The climate is tropical with a highly saline atmosphere from the close proximity of the ocean to every part of every island. This can cause severe damage to electrical and mechanical equipment and infrastructure and creates a very high-maintenance cost environment. For this reason traditional housing, rather than modern construction, is often preferred since this can be repaired easily and cheaply. Having only a small land area on each island, no high-ground and a very fragile eco-system the country is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, especially to rising sea-levels, and droughts. However being so close to the equator Kiribati is largely spared the affects of cyclones. Man-made pollution, lack of adequate waste management, unsustainable depletion of the underground water lens and coastal erosion (both natural and man-made) are other serious environmental concerns. 2.2 Population and Human Development 10. The population of Kiribati is almost entirely Micronesian with a small number of Tuvaluans, Nauruans and Europeans. The social system is based on the typical Pacific community and family structures seen elsewhere in the region. Most islands have three or more villages and these may be divided by religion and traditional, sometimes long-standing, inter-village rivalries. In general the northern islands of the main Gilberts Group are predominantly catholic, while the southern islands are predominantly protestant, but there is also a strong presence of many other religious groups and organisations throughout the country. 10 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 11. Between the two most recent census (2000 & 2005) the population growth rate was just under 2% per annum; population densities were generally quite low on the outer islands averaging about 270 persons p.sq.km in the northern Gilberts and about 130 p.sq.km in the central and southern islands. However on South Tarawa the capital, the population density is over 2500 p.sq.km. Overcrowding on Tarawa, a lack of adequate infrastructure and services, and a lack of proper urban planning therefore creates a very poor social environment for many families in the capital. 12. There has been a steady migration of population from the outer islands of the Gilberts group to Tarawa (north and south) and to the Line Islands, as well as, increasingly, to overseas destinations. The six most southerly of the Gilbert Islands and three in the north/central group have all seen absolute declines in their populations over the period since 1990. Until relatively recently overseas outmigration from Kiribati, other than for qualified seafarers, has been quite limited and has not provided as much of a \u201csafety-valve\u201d for young people as it has in many other Pacific countries. As a consequence unemployment and under-employment has become a major issue in the domestic economy. As noted in the following analysis \u201cunemployment\u201d as defined in the HIES was reported as being around 38% across the country. 13. The pattern of out-migration is changing however and the recently established Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme (RSE) in New Zealand and the similar scheme being established by Australia are providing new employment opportunities. Kiribati, like its neighbour Tuvalu, is recognised as a source of highly competent seafarers who are employed on foreign merchant vessels. However the current global economic downturn, the high cost of employing seafarers from remote Pacific locations, and concerns about the declining standards of education in Kiribati (and Tuvalu) threaten to undermine this very important source of employment. 14. The human development status of Kiribati is relatively weak and has showed little improvement; between 1998 and 2008 the Pacific Human Development Index9 (HDI) for Kiribati improved only slightly from 0.515 to 0.606, pushing the country down one position to 12th behind Vanuatu, with only Solomon Islands and PNG having a worse HDI. On the Pacific Human Poverty Index10 (HPI) Kiribati fared even worse with its position falling three places behind FSM, Marshall Islands and Vanuatu, again with only Solomon Islands and PNG below it in the rankings. Thus over recent years Kiribati has fallen behind in both the human development and human poverty indices. It remains on the list of least developed countries. 15.

According to the government\u2019s latest revised/preliminary estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)11 the Kiribati economy showed steady, if unspectacular, growth averaging 3.8% per annum in the decade to 2000, giving an increase in real per capita GDP of about 2.1% per annum. Over the period since, from 2001 to 2009, growth slowed to an average of only about 1.0% per annum, meaning that GDP per capita was declining slowly in real terms by approximately 0.8% per annum. Thus overall the performance of the Kiribati domestic economy has weakened in recent years. 9 A composite index of GDP per capita, life expectancy at birth, adult literacy and school enrolment levels 10 A composite index of the HDI plus indicators of access to safe water, access to health services, primary enrolment levels, the chance of not surviving past forty years and the proportion of underweight children. 11 Draft revised National Accounts Estimates, PTFAC & Kiribati National Statistics Office, 2010 11 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 17. The most recent estimates of GDP have for the first time attempted to fully capture the contribution of both monetary and non-monetary subsistence activities to the economy. These are now estimated to account for about 25% of total GDP and, together with other related adjustments, have resulted in an increase in the estimated current price GDP for 2009 from A$96.4 million to A$155.9 million. In the old estimates for 2008 the \u201cInformal Sector\u201d was estimated to be valued at A$5.6 million, while in the revised estimates, largely based on data from the HIES, the value of the Informal Sector has now been estimated at A$57.0 million. Current price GDP per capita for 2009 has been estimated at A$1622, and at A$1453 in constant 2006 prices. The public sector continues to dominate the domestic economy, however, providing almost two thirds of all paid employment and close to half the monetary GDP. 18. Kiribati has a very open economy with its trade in goods and services being almost equivalent to the value of GDP. The openness of the Kiribati economy and its integration with the global economy is also demonstrated by the fact that an average of about forty-percent of gross national income (GNI; estimated at A$211.7 million in 2007) comes from external sources; predominantly fishing licence fees, seafarers\u2019 remittances, development assistance, and revenue from the country\u2019s Revenue Equalisation Reserve Fund (RERF). This last is the country\u2019s stock of national wealth, a sovereign wealth fund originally built from the revenues of phosphate mining on Banaba Island during the British colonial period. The fund is invested globally and managed by investment professionals in London on behalf of the government. Revenues from the RERF provide around 25% of the recurrent budget. 19. The size of the recurrent budget has increased steadily in recent years and is currently equivalent to about 50% of GDP. Within the total budget wages and salaries have gradually captured a larger share of expenditure, increasing from an average of about 40% of total recurrent expenditure in 1999/2001 to over 50% in 2006/2008. 20. There are approximately thirty public enterprises in various states of operati
