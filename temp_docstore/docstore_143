 ecology stand-point but also improves the degree of confidence among participants in what they are trying to do. Monitoring of outcomes Monitoring is primarily used to help avoid repeated mistakes and to enable an adaptive approach to management. This is especially important where local conditions of the site may not have been extensively researched. Trial and error can be a practical way to design and manage a project in these situations and regular monitoring is particularly useful to identify undesirable trends sooner rather than later. It also helps gauge the level of success against longer term objectives. This applies to both biophysical and human dimensions of the project and can provide invaluable assistance for planning. 1 2 3 \u00a9 CHICOP \u00a9 Shane Orchard \u00a9 Shane Orchard \u00a9 Shane Orchard \u00a9 Shane Orchard Photo-points taken in December 2011 and May 2013 \u00a9 Shame Orchard 24 7 Gender Dimensions of Community- Based Management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Siquijor, Philippines Solution provider: Barbara Clabots, University of Washington Summary: Through interviews and focus group discussions with women and men in communities, this solution identified gender dimensions of MPA management in the villages of Maite, Bino- ongan, and Caticugan in Siquijor, Philippines. This helped to identify opportunities for gender mainstreaming in MPAs; inform organizations and agencies involved in coastal area funding and management of best practices, and empower women and recognize them for their important roles in MPA management. Location: Siquijor, Central Visayas, Philippines SOLUTION Impacts The interviews revealed opportunities in MPA management in the Philippines that provide several insights for MPA management policies to be more gender-responsive. The success of MPA management is dependent on community cooperation, male-dominated management obscures key women roles. Increasing women\u2019s empowerment should be accompanied with social acceptance of changing gender roles, since women can suffer from an initial increase in domestic violence. Mechanisms to ensure males do not usurp benefits of female-run MPAs are lacking and local fishermen benefit from increased catch without participating in MPA management. The impact of MPAs on women is often not measured, so effective implementation in MPA management should be promoted. MPA management objectives are not explicitly related to women\u2019s needs and limit the natural resources available.

PAs can be an effective tool to strengthen their resilience. This solution is therefore building resilient protected areas in Nosy Hara that can help to secure long-term use of ecosystem services by local communities in a changing climate, while improving protection of the area\u2019s rich marine life by considering climate change into its management. Location: Nosy Hara, Madagascar Impacts Improvement of MPA manager skills and understanding of climate change issues and their links with \u2018business as usual\u2019 work. Better knowledge of the status of conservation targets (species and ecosystems) and their level of vulnerability and resilience. Increased awareness of climate change and the relevance of marine protected areas in adaptation among practitioners and local communities; both in the project area and beyond, through the experiences and results of this initiative. 8 SOLUTION Organizations Involved: 27 Pioneering climate change adapted MPA management in Madagascar Building blocks Climate change capacity building for MPA managers The aim is to update management tools and strategies by enhancing knowledge on climate change key concepts and potential impacts for coastal and marine areas. Initiatives should start with capacity building to ensure a common understanding of concepts by MPA managers. Climate Witness Community Toolkit The documentation of local climate change impacts and a discussion allows for the identification of key problems with the main causes and adaptation options. The final outcome is a community action plan describing priority adaptation options. Vulnerability assessment to climate change Hotspots of climate change vulnerability and adaptation options that help maintain and/or strengthen the site\u2019s resilience can be identified. This allows an understanding of the status of biological and social targets with regards to climate change targets and the results guide the management plan. Identification and implementation of adaptation options Opportunities that enable the implementation of an adaptation option, required cost of its implementation, benefits of implementation and the risks at different levels are all criteria that can be used to prioritize a relevant adaptation option. Review of management plan to integrate climate change issues A revision can update conservation target status, identify some to be added, review and revise threats and adjust the MPA strategy and monitoring protocols. Having these climate-smart management tools will ensure a resilient MPA as well as long-term goods and services for local communities. 1 2 3 4 5 WWF pirogue in Nosy Hara \u00a9 WWF Community meeting in Nosy Hara \u00a9 WWF 28 9 Community-based Conservation at Scale Solution provider: Laure Katz, Conservation International Summary: The Bird\u2019s Head Seascape (BHS) addresses habitat destruction from overfishing and resource exploitation in West Papua, Indonesia, through a large-scale ecologically-connected and community-driven Marine Protected Area (MPA) network to preserve biodiversity and regenerate local fisheries. Ultimately, the goal is for local Papuan communities to have enhanced food security, livelihoods, cultural heritage and rights.

However, blocked access to marine resources, degraded and polluted habitats and declining fish stocks threaten livelihoods and increase local poverty. The artisanal fishermen\u2019s cooperative CoopeT\u00e1rcoles R.L, encouraged the community to use local marine resources sustainably, thus guaranteeing their economic future and cultural way of life. They led a dialogue with the semi-industrial fleet to reach agreements on the use of the marine territory. They have promoted a collaborative governance model for the management of the country\u00b4s marine territory where fishers and government work together towards responsible fishing and improvement of the quality of life of the communities.

This provided a base for collaborative management, conserving marine biodiversity and protecting cultural identity through dialogue and responsible fishing agreements, and for recognizing fishers\u2019 rights. Negotiation and legal recognition A participative process with artisanal fishers and government authorities was initiated for the development of the fishing management plan. With prior informed consent, an agreement was reached for shrimp semi- industrial trawlers to move out of the area 5 nautical miles from the coast to support sustainable shrimp populations. Participatory local governance A commission, composed of members of the fishing cooperative and governmental authorities, is responsible for further management of the area, based on the fishing management plan, which is strongly building on traditional knowledge and a rights-based approach to conservation.

Supporting medical aid and capacity building for teachers of a local school were the \u201cexchange currency\u201d for starting an LMMA on the island. After initial mistrust, fishermen were persuaded to cooperate: 6 years later, fisheries around Vamizi improved and became significantly better than those in surrounding waters. Vamizi Island is now famous for its LMMA, a place where taking turtles, mosquito net fishing and illegal scuba diving are banned. The LMMA has increased the fisher\u2019s catch rates and can count on the Fisheries Council to control illegal fishing around it. Location: Vamizi island, Palma, North Mozambique Impacts SOLUTION Impacts Overall Vamizi LMMA is a leading example of a successful cooperation between tourism, university and communities, but also an LMMA that is changing the lives of surrounding communities for the better: The clinic and school allowed the community to go to a consultation without leaving the island and their children could study without leaving their home. Grants for girls\u2019 education are supporting the best female students and changing mentalities about girls\u2019 education or at least making them discuss it. These first steps had a substantial impact on the village and made people more willing to accept tourism and the LMMA. Meanwhile, the Community Fishing Council (CCP) developed artisanal buoys to demarcate the LMMA, made of local materials to avoid theft. Now CCPs from the mainland come to see how they are built and are reproducing the system. Other lodges are following in the steps of the Vamizi experience, supporting not only the patrols of the LMMAs, but also providing better education and health in remote locations. The number of species and individual fishes found there has increased, and so has the size and quantity of fish caught locally. Organizations Involved: 33 Ensuring marine protection through Locally Managed Marine Area at Vamizi island in Mozambique Building blocks Developing basic education and health facilities In 2006, health care was a major issue for the population, as Vamizi island was more than 2 days away from the provincial hospital, and there was no school on the island. The tourism company raised funds for constructing a school, a health center was built, and the LMMA patrol boat used as an ambulance, providing the foundation for the community\u2019 support to the LMMA. Sustainable financing for LMMA operations through tourism fee The more famous the Vamizi LMMA was, the more pressure was increasing from people accessing the area, making it essential to uphold patrols and maintain the boat. The fee collected from the tourist users of the LMMA allows to do so, and provides an additional reward to those CCP members conducting the patrols. Locally-based organization providing sustainable technical support The active engagement of UniL\u00fario in all the phases of the process was essential to keep the community involved, considering the local people don\u2019t know reading or writing, and few know how to speak Portuguese.

Location: Choiseul Province, Lauru, Solomon Islands Impacts Local communities as drivers have full ownership in the establishment of the Lauru Ridges to Reefs Protected Area Network. LLCTC is covered by requests further to the 15 sites already set up. Conservation priorities improve stakeholders bargaining power when negotiating with mining companies and the national government about future mining operations. Mapping results in better knowledge of natural, but also cultural resources. Stocks of commercial species, e.g. trochus snails, have noticeably recovered. Alternative livelihood options (ecotourism), have generated revenues. 12 SOLUTION Organizations Involved: 35 Lauru Ridges to Reefs Protected Area Network (Lauru PAN) Building blocks Conservation plan built on local and scientific knowledge MPA planning software used by community and governmental stakeholders allows for cost effective networks of protected areas. This settles conflicts over land ownership and engages community groups as well as guiding the decision-making process. Consultative establishment of protected area sites A LLCTC\u2019s environmental officer decides whether a site should be included into the conservation plan through interactions with the community. A consistent management plan ensures accountable oversight and clear representation of resource regulations. Continued collaboration between all stakeholders An LLCTC environmental officer, the community committee and the contact point in the community establish monthly visits. Long term engagement with communities is essential to ensure long-term sustainability and commitment. Coordinated monitoring of protected areas Interested community members are trained in monitoring using standardized techniques. An active role of the management committee should be supported to establish self-sustaining management without external assistance. Overseeing implementation of the network A framework is implemented by an environmental and conservation committee, which meets twice a year. New requests to LLTCC are submitted following an exchange between communities. Support in developing alternative livelihoods Developing alternative incomes through integration of ecotourism and conservation helps offset adverse effects of resource use limitations.

Hoi An officially declared its vision to become an eco-city by 2030. The MPA allows Hoi An to regulate fishing activities and pollution. The MPA has also supported the development of eco-tourism models to diversify local income sources, proving that environmental protection can also be compatible with economic growth. Location: Cham Islands, Hoi An, Vietnam Impacts The MPA has supported opportunities to build and develop the community-based ecotourism home stay program. From 2002 to 2013, the number of tourists to the Cham Islands has increased from 1,000 tourists in 2002 to 150,000 tourists in 2013. The community-based land crab management program has demonstrated the power of thoughtful and sustained community participation in environmental decision-making. Prior to the work of the MPA, the land crab population has degraded gradually. 75% of the land crab population is now conserved, and the income of local participants is four times larger. 13 SOLUTION Organizations Involved: 37 MPAs as part of solution towards a resilient eco-city Building blocks 1 2 3 Conducting formal risk assessment Scientific information and community knowledge are necessary input data to produce a complete risk assessment.

Located in what is considered a priority conservation area for reef fishes, the region was previously threatened by compressor fishing and illegal intrusion of commercial fishing boats. To address these threats, PMMP established an innovative multi- stakeholder management scheme with a no-take zone, driving people and nature impacts. Location: Pilar Municipal Marine Park (PMMP) Ponson Island, Philippines Impacts Species conservation: Significant increase in the number of fish per 500m2 within the sanctuary\u2019s no-take zone: 372 in May 2005 to 640 in May 2009. Fish biomass within the zone also grew from 1.33 ton3/km2 in 2005 to almost four times as much in 2009. The zone also protects the surrounding mangroves, which provide habitat to fruit bats, reptiles and migratory birds. Livelihoods: Previously, fish catch averaged 2.6 kgs/fisher/day and 18% of school-aged children were malnourished. Six years later, fish catch has increased to 5.5 kgs/fisher/day and the number of malnourished school-aged children decreased to 10%. 16 SOLUTION Organizations Involved: 43 Ensuring fish and the lives of those who depend on them \u00a9 Palau International Coral Reef Center Building blocks Transparent co-management The management team is comprised of the Municipal Mayor, the Management Board, park officers and members of the working committees. The municipal and the two village government units make up the Management Board. The Management Board members hold quarterly meetings and a general assembly of all Management Team members is conducted annually. Fair enforcement If a violator from one village is apprehended, the case is resolved by members from a different village to reduce patronage politics. Hands-on leadership, team-building strategies and technical support harmonize the different interests of the multi-stakeholder organizational set-up. Regular meeting of the enforcement committees enables the monitoring of issues. Participatory monitoring of threats The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan is a guide in tracking and measuring the status of the marine habitat and its organisms, the threats and management efforts in the marine park. A logbook reflects guarding, patrolling and surveillance on site. The competences and skills of the members are improved through trainings, coaching and mentoring. Participatory governance The different ideas and opinions of involved individuals and groups are taken into consideration when setting up the management committee, drafting the management plan and coming up with solutions to arising problems. This results in more cooperation and partnership as well as a better articulation of the management plan.

The solution has been to revive the village dynamics around the protection of the park, and since 2014 to develop income generating activities for both local communities and the park\u2019s management. Location: The Parc Marin Moh\u00e9li, Comoros Impacts Re-addressing the institutional and governance framework for the Moh\u00e9li Marine Park has resulted in a more productive arrangement between local villages and protection authorities. Dialogue concerning impacts on local resources and livelihoods has moved from one of costs and claims to one of action and benefits. - Trade-offs between protection and exploitation have become possible, and resulted in reduced impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems. New areas of \u2018no-take\u2019 zones have both increased \u2018spill-over\u2019 and recovery of key commercial species (octopus, holothurians) and provided strict biodiversity havens within the Moh\u00e9li island ecosystem. - The active participation of villages in reducing watershed and coastal erosion are perceived as beneficial for their community, not just for the protected area. 17 SOLUTION Organizations Involved: 45 Community participation in PA management provides development benefits \u00a9 Palau International Coral Reef Center Building blocks Revitalizing community engagement in park management Ongoing and active participation of community members in implementation, with involvement and buy-in to projects developed to support management activities. Regular dialogue between protected area and village representatives provides information on the activities of the protected area; allows for presentations of results from research; and raises issues and challenges that need a management response. Community action for sustainable artisanal fisheries Establishment of a fisheries resources monitoring system, supporting diversification of fishing activities, implementing activities that maintain fishing as a livelihood activity, while combatting destructive practices, easing fishing pressure on the reef, protecting critical habitats. Establishing no-take zones in the areas of the park which have been identified as crucial for protection of fisheries resources. Sustainable agriculture in watersheds and vulnerable coasts Institutional support to producers in organizing themselves, promotion of more sustainable agricultural potential products, using more efficient technologies, developing market-gardens to supply tourist facilities.

With not a cent of outside support, the local fishermen govern, manage and provide much needed surveillance operations for their own Kawawana, which has dramatically recovered in quantity and quality of biodiversity (fish, dolphins, crocodiles, birds\u2026). Location: Mangagoulack, Casamance, Senegal Impacts The \u201cgood life\u201d is back in the villages: fish are available in good quality and quantity to households at an affordable price. The ingenious three zone management plan has fostered local food sovereignty (better diet and prosperity) and in part reversed the urban exodus. The practice of collective governance has consolidated local solidarity. The community has learned sophisticated methodologies and regularly monitors fishery and socio-economic results. Local interactive radio programmes allow to dialogue with all who need to know and respect the rules. Traditional anti-salt dikes were restored, allowing for the recovery of land for rice cultivation. The environment (spaces, species, ecosystems) has recovered and now better play its role as an ecosystem services provider. Local conflicts have diminished and attempts to exploit resources, which presented potential sources of conflict, were kept under control. For example, the burning of the Mangagoulack forest was avoided thanks to the influence of the initiators of the Kawawana ICCA, supported by the entire population of the 8 villages. In Senegal, 6 ICCAs are currently being set up and seeking legal recognition, following the example of Kawawana. 18 SOLUTION Organizations Involved: 47 Kawawana community heritage area: good life recovered through conservation \u00a9 Palau International Coral Reef Center Building blocks Community Organization The ICCA was created by the community itself, through the association of fishermen from the rural community of Mangagoulack (APCRM).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b72613e-252e-417b-b6dc-d55113afa777": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b72613e-252e-417b-b6dc-d55113afa777", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solutions in focus : community-led successes in marine conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15ba9960ffbc5c886e3f0730268afbe6cdebcf1eff0c2d47e9f8fb5bfd7b74d9"}, "2": {"node_id": "1faf21f3-3b48-4dd2-9383-d5f998bd2765", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc91ac59fd737bce0f57bee5198ff981390f09f945d381e3c7f09222bb311431"}}, "hash": "8fdeb049df72e767cec119c698812f88bd9a42e42d0bce8741b95dc6fee79dd4", "text": "Rehabilitation and strengthening of traditional rules Assertion of community collective rights and capacity to govern (decide and implement decisions) and manage (provide surveillance, monitor) its heritage territory.

SIKAT, a 28-year old NGO with significant experience in community-based coastal resource management, trained them on basic ecology and marine protected area management. Environmental management is now part of the mandate of the POs. The local government unit (LGU) declared the lagoon as no-fishing zone and intensified its enforcement of fisheries laws with help from POs and NGOs. It developed infrastructure and procedures, providing support and guidance. The communities are kept informed of policies and the importance of environment conservation through regular community consultations. Location: Siargao Island, Philippines Impacts The community-based social enterprise provided the communities with the opportunity to partake in the socio- economic benefits of tourism and to take ownership of their responsibility to conserve their environment. The income provided by the lagoon motivated them to strictly implement the \u201cno fishing policy\u201d in the lagoon. Through capacity building activities organized by government agencies and NGOs, the people\u2019s organizations (PO) acquired skills in tourism management such as customer service and souvenir packaging, and organizational management skills such as financial management, team management and project management. The knowledge and appreciation of the communities on the importance of environmental protection and conservation increased because of their training on basic ecology and protected area management, community consultations and information campaigns. As a result of their involvement, their training and their mandate to manage their environment, the PO members have become empowered members of their communities as well as protectors of environment. 19 SOLUTION Organizations Involved: \u2022 Sentro Para sa Ikauunlad ng Katutubong Agham at Teknolohiya (SIKAT) 49 Balancing Environment Conservation and Economic Gain Through Community-based Tourism \u00a9 Palau International Coral Reef Center Building blocks Organized community groups and participatory approaches The active participation of organized community groups including People\u2019s Organizations (PO) is crucial. The involved POs were registered with the Security and Exchange Commission, trained and mandated to ensure environmental management. Technical support from different sectors and infrastructure support from LGU Government, NGOs and private entities shared their expertise with the POs and provided technical support to empower them. This enabled them to manage their own organisations, practice community based management, lead tourism activities and manage the marine protected area. Continuous communication and education Through community consultations, the LGU and non-government organizations regularly update the communities on policies and reminded them of the possible impact if the lagoon is degraded. Dialogue on issues and discussions on solutions happen during these community consultations, and information materials are handed out. Strict implementation of fisheries law and ordinances The municipality of Del Carmen showed that it is serious in the implementation of fisheries law and ordinances when it organized the fish wardens and the People\u2019s Organizations (POs) in all its villages. The fish wardens, in partnership with law enforcers, are instrumental in the apprehension of illegal fishers and mangrove cutters and in significantly decreasing such illegal activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8c98ee3-52a5-470d-8040-1a5c6c69d866": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8c98ee3-52a5-470d-8040-1a5c6c69d866", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solutions in focus : community-led successes in marine conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34677e4a7d834960b3610ef41f9e8cf3e59b128670bba94c04cc85eb68372e8b"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d8cd429-c708-47c4-b4eb-46b04c3c00b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d26580550d896f4e54a2fce9439183cbb1d4499f19a85f039d44aa762dc4c9fb"}}, "hash": "598765d355237c176e7e8cc7c60fef21352e95f7f7cb8cb481d2e1432d47b3ad", "text": "1 2 3 4 A PO member arrives with tourists at the lagoon \u00a9 Cheryl Dugan Sugba Lagoon \u00a9 Cheryl Dugan 50 Micronesia Challenge: A Regional Commitment for Protected Area Management Solution provider: Rachael Nash, Micronesia Challenge Secretariat Summary: The Micronesia Challenge is a commitment by the five Micronesian countries and territories, and the partners of their regional support teams to preserve the natural resources", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02892c91-7fef-4e9a-89ad-cba8ed2cbe3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "02892c91-7fef-4e9a-89ad-cba8ed2cbe3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solutions in focus : community-led successes in marine conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce4a1d82faf5144dccfdb016ff4f8ad73c89e2c8a84727aa6c69c9cbfba9e9a8"}}, "hash": "ce4a1d82faf5144dccfdb016ff4f8ad73c89e2c8a84727aa6c69c9cbfba9e9a8", "text": "that are crucial to the survival of Pacific traditions, cultures and livelihoods.

Location: Palau, FSM, Marshall Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands Impacts The MC helped establish 150 conservation areas. Micronesia is on track for 2020 goals: 30% of marine and 20% of terrestrial resources. The MC Measures Working Group developed the Marine Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tool. Communities use it to improve their management by keeping track of MPA effectiveness based on data from monitoring programs. Effective conservation requires financing mechanisms, such as Green Fees, tourism fees or tuna licensing fees. An endowment of $56 million is being created to generate additional annual funds to support management activities, which has reached $17 million as of 2015. Since 2006, the Micronesia Challenge has proven to be a successful solution.

If CITES is to remain a credible instrument for conserving species affected by trade, the decisions of the Parties must be based on the best available scientific and technical information. Recognizing this, IUCN and TRAFFIC have undertaken technical reviews of the proposals to amend the CITES Appendices. The Analyses - as these technical reviews are known - aim to provide as objective an assessment as possible of each amendment proposal against the requirements of the Convention as laid", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94940814-ca96-47be-b746-6c4a19822ff2": {"__data__": {"id_": "94940814-ca96-47be-b746-6c4a19822ff2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee775654604b8432a44f67ad6544bf22b1463b3c6d97163a229fe365fd70e7eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "104bca05-c480-42c1-be24-47654c74cd38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a94d3011720a945c19df7ad1086ca8784f74be22fc467288709b6b0cbd373fe"}}, "hash": "00f10e8d65786b64449782f8a40772f16a6c0d3c2a6b311de71f767d461cf77c", "text": "out in the listing criteria elaborated in Resolution Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) and other relevant Resolutions and Decisions. Unfortunately, due to a challenging fundraising environment and the high number of proposals, the funds necessary to conduct the Analyses and present them in the same manner as for previous Conference of the Parties (CoPs), were not found. Therefore, instead of producing the highly-detailed summary section and accompanying table for each proposal as we have done in previous years, for CoP17 we have instead produced a summary section for every proposal. The time available to research and consult experts has been reduced compared with previous Analyses, and is therefore not as exhaustive. In addition, to ensure the Analyses were completed in time to assist Parties with their decision making, the summary documents were made available online 10 weeks from the deadline for the submission of proposals as opposed to 12 weeks as in past years, in response to requests by Parties. To ensure the Analyses are as accessible as possible to Parties, we have sought to improve online dissemination through the creation of a bespoke webpage where the Analyses can be downloaded individually or in full (see http://citesanalyses.iucn.org/). The Summary section presents a synthesis of available information taken from the Supporting Statement and other sources and, in a separate paragraph, a specific analysis of whether or not the proposal might be considered to meet the pertinent criteria in Resolution Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) or other relevant CITES Resolutions. Information on the status and biology of species has been collected from IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission Specialist Group network and the broader scientific community, and used to evaluate the proposals and the information proponents provided against the CITES listing criteria. TRAFFIC has drawn on its own information sources on trade and expert networks. The resulting document brings together a broad range of expertise, which we are confident will be of assistance in the discussions of the proposals. Following the deadline for Parties\u2019 submission of amendment proposals (27th April 2016), the Analyses team compiled available information to prepare a first draft of the summary section. Information compiled, together with a series of additional questions and clarifications were then sent to a variety of reviewers for comment if needed, particularly on the accuracy and reliability of information presented. Reviewers were not sent the \u201cAnalysis\u201d paragraphs, for which the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses Team takes full responsibly and which are only finalized at the end of the project. Reviewers do not see, or have responsibility for, the analysis against the relevant criteria. Those named as \u201cReviewers of summary information\u201d (previously listed as Reviewers) have only reviewed the information compiled by the Analyses team in the summary section for accuracy and gaps. The final text expressed in this publication does not necessarily reflect those of IUCN or TRAFFIC, nor the reviewers as a body. To satisfy the needs of the Parties for information well before the CoP, the Analyses were completed and made available on the web on 6th July 2016. The Summary and Analysis paragraphs will be translated into French and Spanish and made available online as soon as possible. Printed versions of the Summary and Analyses paragraphs in all three languages will be made available at CoP17 in Johannesburg, South Africa. 1 As of 20th June 2016 https://cites.org/eng/disc/parties/chronolo.php ii These analyses aim to highlight relevant information on which the Parties can base their decisions, and are not to be considered exhaustive. There may be omissions and differences of interpretation in a document compiled on a wide range of species, particularly with such high number of proposals to consider within the allotted timeframe and under a tight budget. We have nevertheless tried to ensure that the document is factual and objective and consistent in how we have interpreted and applied the criteria across the range of taxa and proposals A summary of the CITES listing criteria and the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria is provided as an annex to the document. It should be emphasized that the numerical guidelines for the listing criteria in Resolution Conf 9.24 (Rev. CoP16), Annex 5 are not thresholds and may not be appropriate for all species.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND CREDITS Many individuals and institutions contributed to the review of the CITES amendment proposals and compilation of the present Analyses. Those to whom we would first like to extend our thanks are the reviewers of these proposals, many of them members of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, as well as the many other scientists and experts from other institutions who, although not formally linked with SSC, have volunteered their time and expertise to this process. Dena Cator led on the fundraising, without which we would not have been able to undertake this work. We again acknowledge the generous support of all our funders in these economically difficult times. The staff members of TRAFFIC, who assisted in the review of proposals, deserve recognition for the contribution they have made to this document. We would also like to thank the French translation team of Daniele and Richard Devitre, and the Spanish translation team made up of Wendy Byrnes, Ana Bennett and Carlos Ibero. The Analyses team was made up of: Thomasina Oldfield, Willow Outhwaite, Dan Challender, Vicki Crook, Louisa Musing, Anastasiya Timoshyna, and Bryony Morgan and a number of consultants, including: Martin Jenkins, Emma Brooks, Janine Robinson, Sue Wells and Catherine Rutherford, Richard Jenkins, Steven Broad and Richard Thomas provided a great deal of support and valuable input into the Analyses, especially through the sign off process. Willow Outhwaite and Kim Lochen designed the cover. Those responsible for overseeing the project were Martin Jenkins and Thomasina Oldfield who accept responsibility for the contents of this document. iii Contents CoP 17 Prop. 1 Delete Wood Bison Bison

CoP17 Prop. 1 Delete Wood Bison Bison bison athabascae from Appendix II Proponent: Canada Summary: The Wood Bison Bison bison athabascae and the Plains Bison B. b. bison are the two recognised subspecies of the North American Bison Bison bison. B. b. athabascae is native to Canada and the USA where it has recently been reintroduced, having become extinct there. It has been introduced to the Russian Federation. Female bison typically give birth to one calf for the first time at three or four years; in some populations they reproduce annually. Generation time is estimated to be eight years. Bison bison athabascae was listed in Appendix I in 1975 and transferred to Appendix II in 1997. B. b. bison is not listed in the Appendices. Historically B. b. athabascae occurred over an estimated 2.5 million km2, of which 80% was in Canada and the remainder in Alaska, USA. The current occupied area has been calculated to be around 121,000km2 2. The geographic range is not considered to be reducing at present, but B. b. athabascae are generally prevented from expanding into areas where there may be increased risk of disease transmission, hybridization with B. b. bison, and conflict with other land uses (such as agricultural use). Over-harvest by European settlers drove numbers down from an estimated 168,000 in northwest Canada in 1800 to one remnant herd of about 250 individuals by the early twentieth century. Intensive protection and active recovery efforts have resulted in an increase with recent estimates of a total population of ca. 9000 animals, of which ca. 5200 to 7200 were mature individuals, this representing a 47% increase in population since 20002. This population is separated into nine (or possibly 101) isolated herds in Canada. Six of the nine herds have fewer than 500 individuals: populations are considered viable in the long term if they exceed 1000 individuals1. In recent years one population has suffered severe mortality from disease and another from starvation during a severe winter2. Further increases to the total population size in Canada, or the addition of new wild subpopulations there, are not likely2. B. b. athabascae was recently re-introduced to the wild in the USA (Alaska) where the population numbered around 130 individuals in 2015. It has been also been introduced to Russia from Canada. In 2014 there were ca. 135,000 farmed B. bison in Canada of which 3000 were B. b. athabascae and approximately 51,000 were B. b. athabascae x B. b. bison hybrids. Bison bison athabascae is currently listed on Schedule 1 of Canada\u2019s Species at Risk Act (SARA) as a Threatened species based on an assessment in 2000. However following a 2013 re-assessment, the subspecies may be downgraded to Special Concern. In Canada, B. b. athabascae is protected, meaning that hunting and other activities such as capture or harassment are controlled. Management and protection is independent of the listing in CITES. Individuals can be culled to limit the spread of disease, to prohibit hybridization or to manage human-bison conflict. In the USA, B. b. athabascae is listed as threatened throughout its range under the Endangered Species Act3. A federal rule from 2014 designates B. b. athabascae in Alaska as a nonessential experimental population. Hunting is not currently permitted but will likely occur in the future.

The CITES standard nomenclature recognises three subspecies (C. c. caucasica, C. c. cylindricornis, and C. c. severtzovi). However, C. c. severtzovi is generally recognised as a synonym of C. c. caucasica. This treatment is followed here. Capra caucasica mostly inhabits subalpine and alpine zones between altitudes of 800 and 4000m. Females mature at three to four years old and typically give birth to one kid annually, although some older females do not reproduce every year. The population is estimated at 43,000 to 46,000 animals, most (possibly ca. 32,000) are in the Russian Federation, with 7000 to 8000 animals in Azerbaijan and 3000 to 5000 in Georgia. Most of the population (recognised as C. c. cylindricornis) is in the Eastern Caucasus where it is reported to have increased from the 1940s to the 1960s, reaching 25,000 to 30,000 animals before declining subsequently to an estimated 18,000 to 20,000 animals by the late 1980s and then increasing again. The population in the Western Caucasus (recognised as C. c. caucasica) spans the border of Georgia and the Russian Federation, with a range likely to exceed 10,000km2. In the late 1980s this population was estimated at 12,000 but declined, ascribed chiefly to illegal hunting, to perhaps 6000 to 10,000 in 2001, and 5000 to 6000 in 2004. In 2008 it was suspected that the number of mature individuals numbered 4000 to 6000 (and be decreasing), comprising around 1000 in Georgia and the remainder in the Russian Federation. However, another estimate indicates that the population in Georgia may be much smaller, perhaps 100 to150 individuals1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fef57016-21a4-4243-94fc-09768f64231f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fef57016-21a4-4243-94fc-09768f64231f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7a6819db0b57ff4676278d37df0162e0b1e5fc46a8c5fa818bdd5e3adb0d282"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4ad14cf-586e-4794-a49c-dab6bc036fec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f0e9511d38a2d7aea2dfbbda4b97f6216bde999264d46b724f1f5e4c3720395"}}, "hash": "6ef9bf470d8abb429517c2ec781ed9e98440fcaa11d173686da6ab8a32f6f578", "text": "There is a zone of hybridisation between C. c. caucasica and C. c. cylindricornis in the central Caucasus.

Horns, meat and skin of harvested animals are either consumed or sold. The horns are typically made into drinking vessels for which there was reportedly high demand in Georgia and elsewhere in the 1960s to 1990s; there is apparently much less demand today3. Mounted heads and horns were also reportedly valued abroad in the 1990s3. There appears to be negligible international trade in C. caucasica3 and no evidence that such trade has an impact on the species3, 4. The species may be affected by loss and degradation of habitat, severe winters, livestock grazing and disturbance from tourism. Capra caucasica is found in several protected areas in its range States. C. caucasica was classified by IUCN as Endangered in 2008. Analysis: Capra caucasica has an extensive range, and a relatively large and increasing population. There appears to be negligible international trade in the species. It would not appear to meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II. Regarding the proposal for a zero quota for wild-taken C. c. caucasica exported for commercial purposes or as hunting trophies: there are no guidelines or criteria in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) for assessing such a 3 CoP17 Prop. 2 proposal but as its impact would be similar to that of an Appendix-I listing it may be appropriate to assess it against the criteria for such a listing. The population does not have a restricted range but it does have a relatively small population which is reported to be declining and may meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. No harvest of C. c. caucasica is permitted in either range State and there is no evidence that it is affected by trade. Furthermore, Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) indicates that split-listing should be avoided in general and that when it does occur, this should generally be on the basis of national or regional populations, rather than subspecies. This same recommendation could be taken to apply to this case, where different annotations with different effects are proposed for the same species. This proposal does not adhere to that recommendation. Reviewers of summary information only: S. Lovari, D. Mallon, P. Weinberg and K. Kecse-Nagy.

Current annotations vary marginally, allowing trade in wool sheared from live Vicu\u00f1as and items thereof under the condition that any cloth is marked with logo and indication of country of origin and that other items are labelled as artisanal products from the country of origin. It appears that the proposed amendment is intended to replace all the current annotations 1-5 with a single annotation that would result in the following: - For international trade in cloth or garments [from live Vicu\u00f1a] processed within or outside the country of origin, the product must be marked with the logo and the indication of country of origin on the selvadge (edge of woven fabric finished so as to prevent unravelling, often in a narrow tape effect, different from the body of the fabric). - Where processing has taken place outside the country of origin, a label must indicate the country where the transformation took place or the garment was made. 5 CoP17 Prop. 3 - For artisanal products, where these are produced outside the country of origin, as well as the label specifying \u201cVicu\u00f1a [country of origin] \u2013 artisanal\u201d, a label must indicate the country where the transformation took place or the garment was made. - Where the product is made of wool from more than one country, it should indicate all those countries and the percentage of wool from each. Currently, exported wool does not have to be marked; once processed outside countries of origin there is no labelling requirement for cloth or garments produced. It also appears that garments made from labelled cloth do not necessarily have to be labelled with the logo and the country of origin. Analysis: Under the proposal, all items processed outside the country of origin would be expected to carry the above labels. This presumably applies both to those sold in the processing country and those re-exported. It is not clear that it is possible to enforce under the Convention a requirement that products for a domestic market be labelled in a particular way. It may in theory be possible to apply a labelling restriction to re-exports, essentially as a mechanism for ensuring that wool used was legally obtained in the first place (Under Article IV of the Convention (specifically paragraph 5 a) re-export of any product from a species included in Appendix II requires a re-export certificate which the Management Authority of the re-exporting State should only grant if they are satisfied that the specimen was imported into that State in accordance with the provisions of the Convention). There is an analogy with labelling of crocodilian skins, (Res. Conf. 11.12 (Rev. CoP15): Universal tagging system for the identification of crocodilian skins), although the latter contains recommendations rather than prescriptions for allowing trade. Replacing the five separate annotations would remove any differences between the current annotations. 6 CoP17 Prop. 4 Transfer of African populations of African Lion Panthera leo from Appendix II to Appendix I Proponent: Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Togo Summary: The African Lion Panthera leo is the second-largest cat species, found in sub-Saharan Africa and India; it was formerly also present in North Africa and the Middle East. In Africa it is known to be extant in 25 (possibly 26) range States and has been recently reintroduced to a 27th (Rwanda). It is possibly extinct in five others. Current area of occupancy is estimated at around 1.7 million km2, this representing a small portion of its presumed historic range1. Panthera leo are absent from tropical moist forest and hyper-arid desert but otherwise have wide habitat tolerance; their optimum habitat is open woodland and thick bush, scrub and grass complexes. They are social, living in prides with an average size of four to six adults1. Population density is closely linked to seasonal prey availability and varies widely, from 1.5 adults per 100 km2 in semi-desert (in South Africa) to 55 adults per 100 km2 in prey-rich savannah (the Serengeti in East Africa)1. Generation time is estimated at seven years. Average litter size is 2.5, with an interbirth interval of around 20 months if some of the previous litter survive to maturity, four to five months if not2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "810b4121-4b7c-473b-9421-c7f612646f5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "810b4121-4b7c-473b-9421-c7f612646f5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48b9013883725d74d05e9f464ca5c8dd17d902824b056f79c3769037644a16ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "422dd4e7-8af8-40ff-9b36-4e3b20ee231e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdd4348c19943adbf5c4a3bb9fc3911ebea0952be2ef3fd0a9a0f164e7890b11"}}, "hash": "9c9522553db35968a2ae1396f50eccd02f7deef59c9d6165b660f556ee3ef3b8", "text": "The species is present in a large number of protected areas, both fenced and unfenced, operating under a range of management regimes.

Where not appropriately managed, trophy hunting may have an adverse effect on P. leo populations1. In 2013 a population of around 32,000 P. leo in Africa was suggested, based on a compilation of available data sources3. The status of P. leo was comprehensively reviewed for the IUCN Red List in 2015. The authors of the 2015 IUCN Red List Assessment (RLA) considered the 2013 figure to be an overestimate, as it did not take into account recent changes (mainly declines) that were believed to have taken place in some populations, and thought the number likely to be closer to 20,000 than over 30,000. IUCN categorised the species as Vulnerable in 2016. The RLA carried out a time trend analysis of census data for the period 1993 to 2014 (three P. leo generations) for 47 relatively well monitored P. leo subpopulations that together comprise a substantial portion of the total species population1. Because of significant differences in observed regional trends, the sample populations were grouped into three regions for analysis: eastern Africa; southern Africa; and western and central Africa. The assessment used a decline from 1118 to 0 for Katavi in Tanzania, although acknowledged that the data were imprecise, and that P. leo were still present there. It excluded as an outlier one large population (estimated at ca. 1300 in 2014) in Mozambique (Niassa) that was recorded as having increased in size by over 250% since 1993; the circumstances surrounding this increase were considered unusual, and unlikely to be sustained in the future1. Overall, a reduction of 43% in the P. leo population over the period 1993 to 2014 was inferred in the RLA, resulting in a classification of the species as Vulnerable. In four southern African countries (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) the population was assessed as having grown overall by 8% in the period; elsewhere in Africa the population was assessed as having declined by just over 60%. However, there were a number of stable or increasing P. leo populations in Africa outside southern Africa, and one large population in southern Africa (Okavango in Botswana) that was declining. On the basis of the RLA, the population in the four southern African countries was estimated to comprise around half the total African population of P. leo in 2014, compared with around one-quarter in 1993. Re-analysis of the survey data without the figures for Katavi reduces the inferred overall decline in P. leo in Africa between 1993 and 2014 to around 33%; inclusion of the Niassa population would reduce it still further. The authors of the RLA considered their estimate of the decline might be conservative because they believed that less well monitored populations for which data were not available would be more likely to be declining than well monitored populations. A 2015 paper noted that no reliable data were available on P. leo populations or population trends in Angola, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan and that systematic surveys were absent from large areas of potential P. leo habitat in other countries, such as Zambia and Tanzania4. 7 CoP17 Prop. 4 Panthera leo has been included in CITES Appendix II since 1975 under the general listing of the family Felidae. The Indian population has been included (as Panthera leo persica) in Appendix I since that time. P. leo products are in trade. The CITES Trade Database indicates that South Africa is by far the largest exporter; a significant portion of the trade is in trophies from captive-breeding operations. Very little trade from any other range State has been reported. Illegal trade has been reported but is believed currently to be at a relatively low level. Analysis: The African population of Panthera leo does not have a restricted range, nor does it have a small population. The population overall has been declining. Estimates of the rate of decline vary, from around 34% to 43% in the past 21 years (three P. leo generations). This is less than the guideline figure given in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) for a marked recent rate of decline. Moreover, the rate of decline has been slowing because stable or increasing P. leo populations, mainly in southern Africa, make up an increasing proportion of the overall population.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8f8fe10-9ac4-45d0-88b2-474aa651e124": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8f8fe10-9ac4-45d0-88b2-474aa651e124", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20e89a1f3297f602f54c9a87c11be8b9ff71a1a4b3d9b0fe446bb7f1035f6797"}, "2": {"node_id": "9eb83de7-84b4-4292-80e4-5ebc2131b7bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af720def345bdce3a68875b2c368f7f9a6a3f302824f48d702d20f1bc84a60d1"}}, "hash": "856502355c255bbcba5fd85ce74af7ac0165c239ffe39d83202c74c58567b05e", "text": "The African population of P. leo would not therefore appear to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 112: 14894-14899. 8 CoP17 Prop. 5 Transfer of North American endemic subspecies of cougar, Puma concolor coryi and Puma concolor couguar, from Appendix I to Appendix II Proponent: Canada Summary: The Cougar Puma concolor is a very widely distributed member of the family Felidae, occurring in 23 range States in the Americas. It is included in Appendix II under the general listing of the family Felidae. A number of subspecies have been recognised although the validity of many of these has been questioned. Three subspecies, P. c. coryi, P. c. costaricensis and P. c. couguar, are currently included in Appendix I. Two of these, both from North America, are proposed for transfer from Appendix I to Appendix II. The current standard taxonomic reference for the great majority of CITES-listed mammals (Wilson and Reeder, 2005)1 does not recognise these as separate subspecies, considering all North American cougars to belong to a single subspecies P. c. couguar. For this reason, the current CITES standard reference for Puma concolor is the 1993 edition of Wilson and Reeder. Puma concolor coryi The Florida Panther Puma concolor coryi exists in a small remnant population in the State of Florida, USA where it occupies less than 5% of its former range. It was reduced to 12-20 individuals in the early 1970s, but now numbers 100-160 following recovery actions. The population is closely monitored and managed in accordance with a recovery plan which aims to achieve long term viability. However there are indications that the population might be at or approaching carrying capacity due to limited availability of suitable habitat in the area. It is affected by habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, while lack of human tolerance negatively affects its recovery, and mortality due to collisions with vehicles affects population expansion. Puma concolor coryi is listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 and is on the State endangered lists for Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi. This prohibits (among other things) import, export, and shipment in foreign commerce without a permit. There is no national use of P. c. coryi. One instance of export to Germany in 2009 of two museum specimens (bone, wild sourced) for scientific research is recorded in the CITES Trade Database. Other records in the CITES Trade Database are either confirmed or likely reporting errors. Puma concolor couguar The Eastern Cougar, Puma concolor couguar is considered to have been extinct in eastern North America since the late nineteenth century. Sightings of cougars within its former range are thought to be misidentifications, escaped or released exotic pets, or cougars which have migrated in from other areas.

The transfer would place the two subspecies P. c. coryi and P. c. couguar in Appendix II under the listing of Felidae spp. If this proposal is adopted, it is suggested that CoP17 adopt Wilson and Reeder 2005 as the taxonomic reference for Puma concolor: Regardless of reclassification under CITES, the two subspecies will continue to be recognised and regulated by the US Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, as well as by regulations of the States of Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi. 9 CoP17 Prop. 5 Analysis: It would appear that the subspecies Puma concolor coryi still meets the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I, having a small and fragmented population and a restricted area of distribution. It is subject to intensive recovery actions that have led to increases in its population. There appears to be no demand in international trade for this subspecies, or reason to expect its transfer would stimulate such demand. Transfer of this subspecies to Appendix II would result in this taxon being included as Puma concolor under the general listing of the family Felidae in Appendix II. Trade in P. concolor is predominantly in trophies. The subspecies would remain federally protected with strict domestic trade restrictions; hunting and trade would remain unlawful. Assuming P. c. couguar were also transferred to Appendix II, the only remaining cougar subspecies in Appendix I would be the Costa Rican Cougar P. c. costaricensis, which is geographically isolated from P. c. coryi. There is no reason to expect that transfer of P. c. coryi to Appendix II would stimulate trade in, or cause enforcement problems for any other species in Appendix I. There is no risk to P. c. couguar from trade as this subspecies is considered extinct and has been since the late nineteenth century. In the unlikely event that the subspecies were it to be re-discovered, currently the subspecies would be protected from hunting and trade by the ESA. However, de-listing the subspecies from the ESA based upon extinction has been proposed. References: Information not referenced in the Summary section is from the Supporting Statement. 1 Wilson, D.

It is endemic to South Africa where it is found in the Western, Eastern and Northern Cape provinces. It has been in Appendix I since 1975. The second subspecies, Hartmann\u2019s Mountain Zebra Equus zebra hartmannae, occurs in Namibia and South Africa. It was included in Appendix II in 1979. Hunting of the Cape Mountain Zebra and habitat loss resulted in the population being reduced to around 80 individuals in the 1950s. Conservation measures since then involving reintroductions, almost all originating from Mountain Zebra National Park, have led to an increase in numbers and distribution. As of August 2015 the population was estimated to be at least 4791 individuals in at least 75 subpopulations well distributed over the historical range, which comprised around 180,000km2. It is estimated that 55-70% of the population was mature1. Many of the subpopulations are small (37% have 20 or fewer animals), only 11% have over 100 individuals. The population has increased steadily at 8-9% per year since the early 1990s and there are no records of any significant population declines since the 1950s.

Approximately 70% of the population occurs in secure state-owned protected areas, the remainder being privately-owned. The movement of the Cape Mountain Zebra is restricted by fences and it is dependent on translocation (e.g. by game farmers) for dispersal.

The utilization of the Cape Mountain Zebra is controlled under national and provincial legislation. This includes a permit system regulated by the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEMBA), and the Threatened or Protected Species (TOPS) Regulations. Permit holders are required to give annual feedback to the Issuing Authority on compliance with permit conditions, which provides a means of monitoring effectiveness. Illegal translocations and poaching of the Cape Mountain Zebra occur on a limited scale but there is reportedly no illegal offtake at present from any of the national parks where it occurs4,5. Cases of the Cape Mountain Zebra being hunted, sold or exported as Hartmann\u2019s Mountain Zebra have been reported4. There is currently limited reported (assumed legal) international trade. Trade reported by South Africa in 2000 to 2014 included nine trophies and seven skins. Conditional to the transfer of Cape Mountain Zebra from Appendix I to Appendix II, South Africa proposes to implement a combination of active adaptive harvest management and management strategy evaluation to set a hunting quota for the Cape Mountain Zebra. It is argued that introduction of a hunting quota will have a beneficial effect by providing incentives for private owners to invest in the Cape Mountain Zebras, increasing the possibility that new subpopulations will be established. Initial responses from the private sector indicate that this is the case. The quota will be determined through a population viability analysis that considers genetic diversity within the population. The implementation of the quota will be monitored through a research project. As safeguards, a national Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) for the species will be adopted and feedback will be required from permit holders in terms of TOPS. The BMP was being finalized6 at the time of writing with plans to make it available as a CITES CoP17 Information Document. An individual-based simulation tool has been developed to evaluate the impacts of life-stage and sex-specific hunting quotas and translocation strategies for populations over several years. An initial trial use of a population simulation model was applied using the available count data for eight protected populations7. The 11 CoP17 Prop. 6 simulation model will further be used to assess the viability of each hunting quota proposed by private sector owners of the Cape Mountain Zebra who had expressed interest in making use of a hunting quota. Some concerns have been expressed regarding the efficacy of TOPS reporting as a management tool. The Scientific Authority (SA) of South Africa noted in 20154 that the effects of harvest, which included both translocation and hunting, were not monitored and there was often a lack of knowledge of what happens on the ground. Furthermore, budgetary and human resource capacity gaps may limit the efficacy of the harvest management and permitting system. It is also unclear whether the simulation tool intended to be used in setting quotas integrates the Cape Mountain Zebra population viability assessment data, important for management in the context of the potential loss of genetic diversity. There is reported international trade in Hartman's Mountain Zebra. According to the CITES Trade Database, between 2000 and 2014, direct exports included 22,334 skins (96% from Namibia) and 9755 trophies (91% from Namibia and 8% from South Africa). The Cape Mountain Zebra is classified in the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable (2008). The Red List of Mammals of South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho1 assessed the Cape Mountain Zebra as Least Concern, and the update of the global assessment is underway8. Analysis: The Cape Mountain Zebra does not have a restricted distribution. Its population is still relatively small but is increasing and not regarded as under threat, although in the long term loss of genetic diversity may be a concern. The subspecies does not appear to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. For a transfer from Appendix I to Appendix II the precautionary measures in Annex 4 of the Resolution should be met. These can be met in various ways, including the Parties being satisfied with the range State\u2019s implementation of the Convention, particularly Article IV, and with its enforcement controls and compliance with the Convention, or if an integral part of the amendment proposal is an export quota or other special measure approved by the CoP, based on management measures described in the Supporting Statement, provided that effective enforcement controls are in place. In this case the use of a system to set hunting quotas may be considered as a special measure.

At a continental level reported poaching declined slightly in 20151. Having become extinct in Swaziland in the mid-20th century, the White Rhino was reintroduced from South Africa in 1965. The population in Swaziland reached a peak of around 120 in the late 1980s but was reduced by poaching to 24 in 1992. Improved protection led to population recovery.

At that time the population there numbered 60 individuals. There has been very limited trade of Southern White Rhinos between Swaziland and South Africa since 2005, almost all in live individuals with some scientific specimens. As well as exporting live individuals, Swaziland has imported some to enhance the genetic diversity of its rhino population. This proposal is to alter the existing annotation as it applies to Swaziland's population, so as to permit a limited and regulated trade in White Rhino horn which has been collected in the past from natural deaths, or recovered from poached Swazi rhino, as well as horn to be harvested in a non-lethal way from a limited number of individuals in the future in Swaziland. According to the Supporting Statement, Swaziland wishes to sell existing stocks of some 330kg to a small number of licensed retailers and to sell harvested horn, sourced from sustainable, non-lethal harvesting, at the rate of 20kg per year, to those retailers. Funds raised would be used to contribute to conservation of the White Rhino in Swaziland and maintenance of the protected areas where the species occurs there. Big Game Parks, the CITES Management Authority for Swaziland, would be the sole seller and buyers would be licensed and approved by CITES. The proponent states that the DNA profiles of all horn offered for sale would be recorded in a national register and made available to TRAFFIC. The trading operation would be open to inspection by the CITES Secretariat. It would be stopped if it were judged to be having a negative impact on the population of the species in Swaziland. Analysis: The Swaziland population of Southern White Rhino was transferred from Appendix I to Appendix II in 2004 under an annotation that can be interpreted as satisfying the precautionary safeguard set out in sub-paragraph A 2 a) iii) of Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16), in that it is a special measure approved by the CoP, based on management measures described in the Supporting Statement. This sub-paragraph also states that effective enforcement controls should be in place. In approving the transfer, CoP13 agreed 13 CoP17 Prop.7 that this was the case. The current proposal is to maintain the population in Appendix II under a different annotation which may also be considered a special measure under the same part of Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). It appears that the management measures currently in place (i.e. since the transfer of the population to Appendix II in 2004) are satisfactory as the population has increased overall in that time, despite a recent drought-induced decline; the very small amount of poaching recorded indicates that effective enforcement controls are in place as regards protection of living animals. Export of stockpiled horn would have no direct impact on the living population of Southern White Rhinoceros in Swaziland. Other than indicating that it will be non-lethal, the Supporting Statement does not provide details as to how horn would be collected from living individuals. Routine temporary immobilisation for dehorning is a standardised procedure in some South African White Rhino populations with no clear adverse effects on the population or their breeding performance1. Swaziland gives estimated average weights of horn per individual as 7.02kg, this presumably being derived from weights of horns in the current stockpile. This figure is slightly higher than an average of 5.8kg from a large sample. Swaziland proposes to harvest 20kg of horn per year, indicating an average annual offtake of 1kg per animal. This has been demonstrated to be sustainable production for male White Rhinos but a figure closer to 0.6kg is more realistic for females. Given existing numbers and expected age and sex structure of the population, sustainable harvest of 20kg per year should be achievable. Research of stress levels currently shows little impact of regular dehorning every 18 months in a South African White Rhino population that is breeding well1. Few details are provided as to how the proposed trade will be carried out and controlled; for example there is no indication of how appropriate purchasers would be selected and how and by whom these would be licensed. It is not clear exactly what role either TRAFFIC or the CITES Secretariat would be expected to play in oversight of any trade. Much of the detail needed to assess these aspects of the precautionary measures implied by the proposal is therefore not provided.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1e892ef-1628-46db-bcb8-068ff9ff1511": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1e892ef-1628-46db-bcb8-068ff9ff1511", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62d5bab5d04990cf47980b5822a5b944ef29e057f07b02842ac55cdf83545b1c"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a76497d-3a8e-47d9-bb1c-f4dc2872e92f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d065da5863336a2dfb1f25fe51d780620b636180000558503348cd6821c21775"}}, "hash": "4dfa0a9101752ba6ac62760d6fe09a10710e1af65d0c57bdeb60bca6fdd36765", "text": "Reviewers of summary information only: R.

Cambridge, UK. 14 CoP17 Pangolin overview Pangolins and CITES: An Overview Pangolins, or scaly anteaters, are mammals covered in overlapping, horny scales. There are eight species, all in the genus Manis following the CITES standard nomenclature for these species. Four are collectively distributed in South, East and Southeast Asia: Chinese Pangolin Manis pentadactyla, Sunda Pangolin M. javanica, Indian Pangolin M. crassicaudata, and Philippine Pangolin M. culionensis (only recently split from M. javanica). Four are native to sub-Saharan Africa: Black-bellied Pangolin M. tetradactyla, White-bellied Pangolin M. tricuspis, Giant Pangolin M. gigantea, and Temminck\u2019s Ground Pangolin M. temminckii. Pangolins occur in a wide variety of habitats from tropical, sub-tropical, moist lowland and swamp forests to savannah woodland, scrub and floodplain grasslands. They feed exclusively on ants and termites. Throughout their range in both Africa and Asia, pangolins have been exploited historically as a source of protein and traditional medicine1. In Asia, pangolin meat has been consumed historically at the local level in virtually every range State, as well as in urban centres. Scales have been used for a wide variety of applications, particularly as an ingredient in traditional medicines in China and Vietnam2. It is estimated that up to 160,000 pangolins were harvested annually in China between the 1960s and 1980s for domestic use3. Pangolin body parts, primarily meat, scales and skins, have also been traded internationally. Trade in commercial volumes of scales took place from Indonesia to China and Hong Kong as early as the 1920s; and an estimated 60,000 pangolins were harvested annually in Southeast Asia from the 1950s to 1970s for the Taiwanese leather industry2. Pangolins have a long history in CITES. In 1975 M. pentadactyla, M. javanica and M. crassicaudata were listed in Appendix II and M. temminckii in Appendix I. In 1994 M. temminckii was transferred from Appendix I to Appendix II, and all remaining species were included in Appendix II. In 2000 M. pentadactyla, M. javanica and M. crassicaudata were subject to a proposal to transfer them to Appendix I. However, the proposal was not accepted because the species were at that time still under the Review of Significant Trade process (see below); instead the Parties adopted zero export quotas for wild-caught Asian pangolins traded for primarily commercial purposes. This has remained in place since. African pangolins do not have a zero quota but the species are protected in many of their range States and little legal trade has been reported. The majority of trade reported in the CITES Trade Database from 1978 to 2000 involved the Asian species, almost all M. javanica (which at that time included M. culionensis) and was predominantly exports of skins for leather production; this trade involved around 10,000 skins per year. Reported volumes of scales in trade were much lower (less than 20,000kg in total for 1978-2000)4. Evidence from the Review of Significant Trade process (see below) suggests the volume of illegal trade, predominantly in scales and live animals, taking place at the time probably equalled, if not exceeded, reported trade volumes4. Since 2000, comparatively little trade in Asian (for which there is a zero quota) or African pangolins has been reported to CITES. However, large volumes of illicit trade have taken place, involving a minimum estimate of some 17,000 pangolins globally each year5. This has included large consignments of pangolins, their meat and scales within Asia, and an increasing number of confiscations of African pangolin derivatives, primarily scales, in Africa, Europe and Asia, with most seizures ultimately bound for Asia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a76497d-3a8e-47d9-bb1c-f4dc2872e92f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a76497d-3a8e-47d9-bb1c-f4dc2872e92f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62d5bab5d04990cf47980b5822a5b944ef29e057f07b02842ac55cdf83545b1c"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1e892ef-1628-46db-bcb8-068ff9ff1511", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4dfa0a9101752ba6ac62760d6fe09a10710e1af65d0c57bdeb60bca6fdd36765"}}, "hash": "d065da5863336a2dfb1f25fe51d780620b636180000558503348cd6821c21775", "text": "15 CoP17 Pangolin overview Concern over sustainability of trade reported to CITES, particularly in skins, led to the inclusion of Asian pangolins in various phases of the Review of Significant Trade process in 1988 (preliminary Phase), 1992 (Phase I) and 1999 (Phase IV).

Noting that zero export quotas were established for these species at CoP11, the Standing Committee, at SC45 (2001), agreed that if zero quotas were removed any range State wishing to trade in these species should satisfy the Secretariat that the 1999 recommendations had been implemented before any export took place.

One analysis is presented for the two. Summary: The Indian Pangolin Manis crassicaudata occurs in South Asia from northeast and southeast Pakistan south throughout the Indian sub-continent, including Sri Lanka, and east to southern Nepal. It was found throughout Bangladesh historically but there are no recent records and the species may be extinct there. There are historical records of this species from southwest China (Yunnan Province) where its presence is uncertain, and dubious records from Myanmar. Manis crassicaudata occurs in various types of tropical forest as well as grassland, open land and degraded habitat. Like other species of pangolin it is solitary and is considered to have low fecundity, giving birth to one young typically (though there are observations of twins), after a gestation period of approximately six months. Females typically give birth annually. There is a lack of quantitative population data for this species. Its status in India, which comprises by far the largest part of its range (very approximately three million km2), is not well known, though it was reported in the early 1980s that populations were greatly reduced by hunting, and it is currently listed as vulnerable nationally.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ca031da-4a9d-48c0-b988-546172b09e07": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ca031da-4a9d-48c0-b988-546172b09e07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d95cb3640349ec58d87ae4ca5e2bd1d32d8453ec4707fa75f6de5a2fd5d617c0"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f56c106-8b28-4f29-aa81-2880a2c48e1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e4e9e7b54814f08187b0a313752008de57eeee82f58ba0fb9eec2d426254aac"}}, "hash": "dfcd9d34989a4035ee0560e50e9aca5cb1dd904a6c01a9d65b1f08f5971a35be", "text": "This species is protected in India meaning hunting and trade are prohibited but seizures of pangolin derivatives have been made across India between 2009 and 2014 indicating some level of exploitation.

International demand for this and other species of Manis, especially for scales, is believed to be increasing as a result of significant declines in populations of M. pentadactyla and M. javanica. This species is also said to be heavily hunted for local consumption. This species is classified in the IUCN Red List as Endangered (2014). Analysis: Manis crassicaudata is affected by trade. There are few data on the population status of this species. It is believed to have been extirpated from some of its range, in Bangladesh and populations appear to have declined markedly due to poaching in parts of Pakistan.

Biological Conservation 187: 249-259. 17 CoP17 Prop. 10 Transfer of Philippine Pangolin Manis culionensis from Appendix II to Appendix I Proponents: Philippines and United States of America Summary: The Philippine Pangolin Manis culionensis is endemic to six islands in the Philippines: mainland Palawan and the much smaller adjacent islands of Coron, Culion, Balabac, Busuanga and Dumaran Island. It has also been introduced to Apulit Island adjacent to Palawan. Pangolin populations in the Philippines were previously considered part of the Sunda Pangolin Manis javanica, but were split from it in 2005. The species occurs in lowland primary and secondary forests, grasslands/secondary growth mosaics, mixed mosaics of agricultural lands and scrubland adjacent to secondary forests. It is solitary and typically gives birth annually to one young after a gestation period of approximately six months1. It is thought that breeding occurs in August and September. Generation time is taken as seven years. There is a lack of population data, mainly because the species is elusive, solitary and nocturnal. In 2004 it was described by local people as fairly common, though subject to moderately heavy hunting pressure2. There are relatively recent (2012) estimates of densities of 0.05 individuals per km2 in primary forest and 0.01 per km2 in mixed forest/brush land3. Higher estimates made in 2014 of 2.5 adult pangolins per km2 on Palawan and Dumaran Island are considered unreliable4. The species is thought still to be considerably more abundant in northern and central Palawan than in the south; it is reportedly abundant on Dumaran Island (435km2). Local hunters on Palawan report that populations are declining as a result of hunting. One study on Palawan in 2012 reported that increased effort is now needed to catch pangolins, potentially as a consequence of declining populations. The species is believed to be affected by habitat loss and degradation caused by shifting cultivation and conversion of forest to permanent agricultural crops and industrial tree plantations, particularly palm oil. Palawan, with an area of 15,000km2 and estimated tree cover in 2000 of 10,000km2, lost an estimated 770km2 of tree cover between 2001 and 20145. As noted above, observed densities in secondary habitats are much lower than those in primary forests. The CITES Trade Database records export of around 1200 pangolins per year from the Philippines between 1982 and 1989 (predominantly skins and live) reported as Manis javanica (before M. culionensis was split from it). Reported trade dropped to almost zero after 1989.

Assuming this is not due to reduced hunting effort (unlikely) or improved enforcement efforts, it might be indicative of a corresponding marked decline in the wild population.

Summary: The Sunda Pangolin Manis javanica is widely distributed geographically across mainland and island Southeast Asia; the Chinese Pangolin M. pentadactyla is found from the Himalayan foothills into southern China. Both species occur in tropical and subtropical forests, as well as cultivated landscapes including plantations. Both are solitary and typically give birth to one young after a gestation period of approximately six months, possibly on an annual basis. Research suggests that M. javanica may breed all year round1, but M. pentadactyla has a discrete breeding season2. Generation time is taken as seven years. There is generally a lack of information on population recruitment rates for these species. Manis javanica Manis javanica is native to Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China (based on a number of museum records)3, Indonesia, People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Lao (Lao PDR), Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. It is considered to now be extremely rare in the northern part of its range. Populations are generally considered to be declining, much of which is attributed to harvesting. The species occurs in both cultivated and uncultivated habitats; there is little information on relative population densities in different habitat types. Information on the status of populations of M. javanica is scarce.

In Cambodia, M. javanica is present but based on interviews with hunters is understood to be declining. In Indonesia there is very little information on status, but seizures in recent years, sometimes of several thousand animals, indicates that there is intense hunting pressure in the country. In Lao PDR, there have reportedly been huge declines in recent decades. Local communities in the late 1990s reported populations had declined, in some areas to as little is 1% of the level in the 1960s. Interviews with hunters in Peninsular Malaysia indicate the species is declining5. Populations appear to be stable in Singapore based on the frequency of sightings6. One study in 2005 and 2006 on Palau Tekong, a 25km2 island immediately adjacent to mainland Singapore, found pangolins reasonably common there, and estimated an average home range of some 45ha, with some overlap, based on telemetry of three individuals.

In interviews conducted with 99 households around this sanctuary, 80% of respondents reported a decrease in the population8. In Viet Nam, this species is reported to have declined severely, especially since the opening of export markets in the 1990s. Manis javanica has historically been exploited for consumptive use of its derivatives across its range, predominantly its meat and scales as a source of protein and for traditional medicine applications respectively. While domestic use continues, in many places this has been substituted for international trade. This species has been subject to significant levels of trade, both legal and illegal. The majority of trade in pangolins reported in the CITES Trade Database from 1978 to 2000 was reported as M. javanica (which at that time included M. culionensis) and was predominantly exports of skins for leather production; this trade involved around 11,000 skins per year, of which just under 9000 was of M. javanica in its current sense, rather than M. culionensis. Reported volumes of scales in trade were much lower (less than 20,000kg in total for 1978 to 2000). It is thought that the volume of illegal trade, predominantly in scales and live animals, taking place at the time probably equalled, if not exceeded, reported trade volumes. Since 2000, there has been virtually no legal trade in M. javanica reported, as there is a zero export quota for wild specimens of this and all other Asian species for commercial purposes. However, large volumes of illicit trade have taken place, involving a minimum estimate of some 17,000 pangolins globally each year9. It is believed that a large proportion of this trade involves M. javanica. Manis javanica was classified as Critically Endangered by IUCN (2014). 20 CoP17 Prop. 11 Manis pentadactyla Manis pentadactyla is native to Bhutan, China, India, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand and Viet Nam. In China the population was estimated at 50,000 to 100,000 animals in 2003. Populations in China are estimated to have declined by 88 to 94% since the 1960s to 2004. It is now very rare in Guangxi and Yunnan Provinces and considered to face a high risk of extinction in Hainan. It is considered rare in Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region). In Taiwan (Province of China) the species has reportedly recovered in some places from historical reductions, with estimated densities in some areas of 12 to 13 adult pangolins per km2 10. There is virtually no information on wild status in India; confiscations suggest the species is under heavy pressure there. Field sightings in Lao PDR are also now extremely rare. The population in Nepal was estimated at approximately 5000 individuals in 2011 and is believed to be in decline. In Viet Nam hunters report that it has declined severely in the past two decades; it is now regarded as extremely rare. Manis pentadactyla has historically been exploited for consumptive use of its derivatives across its range, predominantly its meat, as a protein source, and its scales for use in traditional medicines. In China, it is estimated that 160,000 animals were harvested annually for these reasons between the 1960s and 1980s11. Reported volumes of international trade are considerably lower than those for M. javanica. Before 2000, when the zero export quota for all Asian pangolin species was established, on average fewer than 1000 individuals were reported in trade each year, mostly skins imported by the USA and Mexico. As with M. javanica there is thought to have been a high volume of illegal trade at the time. Since 2000 seizures and records of trade (e.g., from court cases) indicate that a substantial illicit trade has taken place, potentially involving over 4000 individuals per year12. This species is classified as Critically Endangered by IUCN (2014). Although there is generally a lack of quantitative population data for these species, historical declines have been documented in places, and in others available evidence indicates that populations are in serious decline.

All are solitary and give birth to a single young. Gestation period is taken as five months except for M. temminckii, where it may be three to four months. This and M. gigantea may only breed every second year; in the other two species breeding is believed to be aseasonal and more or less continuous. Generation time is taken as seven years for M. tetradactyla and M. tricuspis, and nine years for M. gigantea and M. temminckii. Manis gigantea Manis gigantea is a terrestrial species discontinuously distributed in 18 range States in West and Central Africa from Senegal eastwards to South Sudan1, Uganda and Tanzania. It was previously considered extinct in Rwanda but recent evidence suggests it still persists there2. The CITES Management Authority of Uganda reported a national population estimate, based on camera trapping, of just over 2000 individuals, with densities of up to six individuals per km2. Based on observed population densities for M. temminckii, also a terrestrial species, this seems high. The species reportedly generally avoids areas of high human impact, but has been found in forest mosaics. It is classified in the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable (2014). Manis tricuspis Manis tricuspis is a semi-terrestrial species occurring in 22 range States from Guinea-Bissau through much of West and Central Africa to southwest Kenya and northwest Tanzania, south to northwestern Zambia and northern Angola.

It can reportedly be found at relatively high densities in suitable habitat. Research in Benin has suggested an average density of 0.84 individuals per km2 during the dry season in both plantations and natural forest. This species is classified in the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable (2014). Manis tetradactyla Manis tetradactyla has been recorded in 11 range States from Sierra Leone eastward through West Africa to the Congo Basin. It may also occur in Angola and Uganda. It is the most arboreal of African pangolins and may therefore be expected to be the most forest-dependent, although has also been recorded in altered forests and farmland3. It is classified in the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable (2014). Manis temminckii Manis temminckii is recorded in 14 range States and is possibly extinct in a 15th (Swaziland). It is the most widespread African pangolin species occurring from southeast Chad and extreme northeast Central African Republic through much of East and southern Africa as far south as South Africa. It mainly inhabits savannah woodland with dense scrub as well as floodplain grasslands and sandveld, and occurs on well-managed livestock farms. Limited information is available on population densities. Research in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa showed average densities of 0.24-0.3 individuals per km2. In the Gokwe district of Zimbabwe they have been estimated at 0.1 individuals per km2. Manis temminckii is classified in the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable (2014). The main factors believed to be affecting African pangolins are exploitation and, in the case of the three forest-dwelling species, habitat loss and degradation. African pangolins continue to be hunted locally for their meat and use of their body parts and derivatives in traditional medicines. As well as local use there is evidence of (growing) international trade most of which is illicit, and involves pangolin derivatives, mainly scales, to Asian markets. Recent research suggests that the proportion of pangolins hunted has increased significantly compared to other vertebrates in sub-Saharan Africa, with a 9-fold increase from 2005 to 2014. Prices for pangolins in Nigeria (where all three forest-dwelling species occur) have reportedly increased 10-fold over the last five years. In Zimbabwe (where only M. temminckii occurs) the number of poaching cases has been shown to be increasing rapidly, and as of 2015, poachers and traffickers from neighbouring 23 CoP17 Prop. 12 countries have reportedly become involved in pangolin poaching in Zimbabwe4. Seizures of African pangolin derivatives in trade have been made with increasing frequency in recent years. These have mainly involved scales destined for Asian markets; some shipments have been detected in Europe en route to Asia5. According to the Supporting Statement, almost 15,000kg of scales from African pangolins were seized between 2013 and 2015, representing between 4,000 and 25,000 animals, depending on the species involved. The apparently growing international trade is believed to have two causes: declining availability of Asiatic pangolin derivatives, and increasing trade globally between African nations and East Asia, which facilitates trafficking of these species6. The scale or proportion of the illegal trade in the different species is difficult to determine from seizure data given the difficultly in differentiating between pangolin species on the basis of the products in trade (chiefly scales). Conversion of forest is believed to have an impact on M. gigantea, M. tricuspis and M. tetradactyla. Overall loss of tree cover in West and Central Africa, where these species occur, has been estimated at just under 4% in the period 2000 to 2014, or roughly 0.25% p.a.7. Rates of loss in Central Africa, where roughly 80% of the total forest cover in this area is found, are lower (ca. 0.2%) than they are in West Africa. All three species are found in modified habitats, but there is little information on their ability to persist in areas of entirely modified habitat. As well as affecting habitat for the species, the opening up of areas for activities such as logging also improves access for hunting. Manis temminckii is likely to be less affected by loss of tree cover but may be affected by other land-use changes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84530cd4-1ebb-49ae-b80c-4cad43939f6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "84530cd4-1ebb-49ae-b80c-4cad43939f6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b12b946f375e727114f491d812067f42ec334adc4464ca3d867cb8ef89fa8c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "56a4a4e5-c990-4aa9-84b5-09b16477b4b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a4beda751a7ec99d563eced0016e44fbe0ea45438a4dfe0bd83c39a3c5c8479"}}, "hash": "a886375143b24719f36580d9af93ac8d06b27c6694d5083789a592505047bf57", "text": "There is mortality from electrocution on electric fences, especially in South Africa.

Annual averages of round 150kg of scales and 12 skins per year of M. gigantea were also recorded. Recorded trade in the other two species has been negligible. A number of range States have prohibited hunting and trade in native pangolin species. Analysis: Information on population status of all four African species of pangolins is scarce. None of them have a restricted range and, although they may occur at low densities (less than one individual per square kilometre in the case of the only two, Manis tricuspis and M. temminckii, for which reliable information is available), none is likely to have a small population. There is no population trend information. Changes in population have been inferred from the presumed impacts of habitat alteration and hunting. Rates of conversion of habitat for the three forest-dwelling species (M. gigantea, M. tetradactyla and M. tricuspis) are relatively low (roughly 0.25% p.a.) and would not in themselves lead to reductions in line with the guidelines in Annex 1 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16), particularly as all species are known to occur in modified habitats. Given their low productivity, hunting is very likely to have an impact on populations of all species. There is evidence that hunting intensity for pangolins in general in Africa has increased markedly in recent years. However, there is insufficient information to determine whether this has led to declines in line with the guidelines in the Resolution. There is therefore insufficient information to determine whether any of the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. Reviewers: D. Pietersen, C. Waterman and C. Shepherd.

Its estimated population (8000 to 11,200) is larger than the guideline figure given for a small population in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). The population is agreed to have been declining; the best available information indicates that the decline has been of the order of 30% in the past three generations (24 years), which is below the guideline figure for a marked decline in the Resolution.

It was included in Appendix II in 1977 and transferred to Appendix I in 1989. The populations of Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe were transferred to Appendix II in 1997, and the population of South Africa in 2000. These transfers were subject to detailed conditions that were further modified during subsequent meetings of the Conference of the Parties and are at present expressed in annotation 6, agreed at CoP14. The annotation allows for trade in various non-ivory African Elephant specimens and products under a range of conditions, somewhat different for each of the four range States in question. With regard to trade in ivory, it allows for trade in individually marked and certified ekipas incorporated in finished jewellery for non-commercial purposes for Namibia and ivory carvings for non-commercial purposes for Zimbabwe. It also allowed for these four range States to dispose of agreed quantities of stockpiled raw ivory in a one-off sale, under a series of restrictions. One of these is that no further proposals to allow trade in elephant ivory from populations already in Appendix II should be submitted until at least nine years after the date of the single sale of ivory. It also specifies that such further proposals should be dealt with in accordance with Decisions 14.77 and 14.78 (currently as revised at the Sixteenth Conference of the Parties (CoP16)). The sale of ivory in question took place in November 2008; nine years from that time is November 2017.

Conf. 10.10 (Rev. CoP16) and the African Elephant action plan, developed as directed in Decision 14.75 and adopted by the African Elephant range States in 2010. Decision 14.78 was substantively revised at CoP15 and CoP16, the revisions shifting responsibility for action from the Standing Committee to other actors, principally the Secretariat. Under the current Decision 14.78 (Rev. CoP16), in preparation for the 65th and 66th meetings of the Standing Committee the Secretariat is instructed, pending the necessary external funding, to: produce an updated analysis of MIKE data, pending the availability of adequate new MIKE data; invite TRAFFIC to submit an updated analysis of ETIS data and UNEP-WCMC to provide an overview of the latest elephant trade data; invite the IUCN/SSC African and Asian Elephant Specialist Groups to submit any new and relevant information on the conservation status of elephants, and on pertinent conservation actions and management strategies; invite the African elephant range States to provide information on progress made in the implementation of the African elephant action plan; on the basis of the information specified above, recommend actions for consideration by the Standing Committee. Three proposals concerning the African Elephant have been proposed for consideration at CoP17. Proposal 14, submitted by Namibia, is to remove any reference to Namibia in annotation 6 so that the African Elephant population of Namibia would be included in Appendix II with no annotation. Proposal 15, submitted by Namibia and Zimbabwe, would have the same effect on Zimbabwe\u2019s African Elephant population. Proposal 27 CoP17 Elephant Overview 16, submitted by 13 Parties, is to transfer from Appendix II to Appendix I the African Elephant populations of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. 28 CoP17 Prop. 14 To delete the Annotation to the listing of the Namibian African Elephant Loxodonta africana population in Appendix II by deleting any reference to Namibia in that Annotation Proponent: Namibia Note: See Background to the African Elephant proposals for a history of the African Elephant under CITES. Summary: The Namibian population of the African Elephant was transferred from Appendix I to Appendix II in 1997; it is currently covered by annotation 6. The proponent (Namibia) wishes to delete reference to Namibia in that annotation so that the African Elephant population of Namibia will be in Appendix II with no annotation. Namibia aims to establish a regular form of controlled trade in all elephant specimens from Namibia, including ivory, in support of elephant conservation, including community-based conservation and the maintenance of elephant habitat. The Supporting Statement indicates that revenue from regulated trade will be managed through a trust fund and used exclusively for elephant conservation and community conservation and development programmes within the elephant range. The most comprehensive and reliable information on African Elephant distribution and population is contained in the African Elephant Database (AED), maintained by the IUCN/SSC African Elephant Specialist Group1. The 2013 version gives the range in Namibia as just under 150,000km2 (the Supporting Statement indicates that African Elephants have a dispersed, wet season range in Namibia of over 100,000km2)1. The most recent population data available in the AED are from the end of 2013. These along with figures from 2002 and 2006 are presented here divided into \u2018definite\u2019, \u2018probable\u2019, \u2018possible\u2019. The database is being updated with the most recent data available, and a full version will be available at CoP17. Permission has been granted to use in the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals the most recent figures from Namibia.

The Supporting Statement outlines management measures for African Elephants in Namibia and enforcement controls and compliance with CITES. It indicates that no elephants have been, or will be, killed specifically to obtain ivory or other products for commercial trade. Ivory is recovered from all recorded natural mortalities as well as elephants destroyed as problem animals, and strict national legislation makes it obligatory for the public to hand in any ivory found. It indicates that the level of sport hunting is largely determined by a guideline of 0.5% of the standing population. A national export of 90 trophy hunted specimens per year has been established, to allow for the possibility that the tusks of elephants hunted in one year may be exported the following year. On average 49 trophies (98 tusks) have been exported each year in 2000 to 2015. 29 CoP17 Prop. 14 The Supporting Statement notes that a computer database of all specimens in storage is maintained with source documentation, and all specimens are marked so as to make them individually recognisable. The annex to CoP17 Doc. 57.6 (Report on the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS)) notes that Namibia is one of only five CITES Parties (along with Chad, Congo, Thailand and Zimbabwe) to have submitted ivory stock reports with inventory figures in 2015. Information on the number of elephants recorded as illegally killed in Namibia, and on ivory seizures, is included as annexes to the Supporting Statement. CoP17 Doc. 57.5 (Report on Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE)) contains the most up-to-date synthesised information on illegal killing of elephants, based on information from 2003 until the end of 2015. It reports on the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) at 58 sites in 30 countries in Africa and 27 sites in 13 countries in Asia. A PIKE level of 0.5 or lower is generally considered sustainable. In its analysis of sub-regional trends in Africa, the report observes (para 14) that the southern African sub-region (Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe) is the only one of the four African sub-regions where the estimated PIKE has not exceeded the 0.5 level in the period 2003 to 2015. It is difficult to estimate poaching impact at the site level, especially in sites that do not report sufficiently large numbers of carcasses, or where there may be indications of bias in reported PIKE levels3. The annex to CoP17 Doc, 57.6 presents an analysis of illegal ivory trade, based on data in ETIS. Part of this is a cluster analysis of 55 countries or territories divided into 13 groups with similar characteristics. Namibia forms part of group eight, along with Botswana and Zimbabwe. The report\u2019s analysis of this group is as follows: \u201cAs in the CoP16 analysis, three of the four African Elephant range States whose elephant populations were transferred to Appendix II in 1997 fall in the same group. These countries regularly report data to ETIS. In terms of all data which implicate these countries in an ivory seizure, this southern African grouping reflects middle range values in terms of mean number of seizures and the mean weight of ivory seized. The measure for assessing the presence of organised crime stands at zero which is indisputably a good sign. Governance indicators are mixed, however, with the rule of law score problematic and suggesting the presence of corruption, but the relatively high law enforcement ratio partially mitigates that concern. Indeed, as before, Zimbabwe is the country that pulls the rule of law score down, indicating far greater governance challenges exist in that country, but it is worth noting that Namibia\u2019s scores have also dropped too. The domestic ivory market score is low, reflecting the complete absence of a market in Botswana and a very low level of trade in Namibia. Again, Zimbabwe is the exception with the tenth largest ivory market of any country in this analysis.\u201d The Supporting Statement draws attention to the failure to implement Decision 14.77, concerning a decision-making mechanism for a process of trade in ivory, which is an integral part of annotation 6 covering the Appendix II African Elephant populations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "940d0cb8-144f-4d47-8bfa-549edd37bda1": {"__data__": {"id_": "940d0cb8-144f-4d47-8bfa-549edd37bda1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6abcfa0b0b9d0e3a46ef5bd9ee2089cc409d40e0a6e27a4f4079faaeca5d3a62"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3be3ea0-32a8-48eb-a455-f7f242642c31", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f7fa893a48b37bc42b39c4e0bcdaeba4e1bc344320df6cc3c5f9db2181bc68d"}}, "hash": "7e6d906a79b42d0a27a3a002295ce90ec2f237f40fc1d091185ba825adc59a29", "text": "It states that if such a mechanism is not approved at CoP17, Namibia will regard current annotation 6 as invalid.

Acceptance of the current proposal would delete this annotation as it refers to Namibia. There are no explicit guidelines in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) as to how to deal with a proposal to amend or delete an annotation for an Appendix-II listed species. However, these constraints can be interpreted as special measures under the terms of the precautionary measures in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). It would be appropriate to examine whether these precautionary measures are still met under the proposed change. The Namibian African Elephant population does not have a restricted range, is not small, and is not undergoing a marked decline. It does not therefore appear to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I set out in Annex 1 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). Regarding the further precautionary measures in Annex 4, the proposal should include a special measure (as envisaged in para A 2 a) iii)) set out in the Supporting Statement. The Supporting Statement indicates that no African Elephants will be harvested for commercial trade. This may be interpreted as a special 30 CoP17 Prop. 14 measure. The Parties would also need to be satisfied that appropriate enforcement controls and compliance with the requirements of the Convention are in place. Details of enforcement controls are set out in the Supporting Statement.

The Supporting Statement indicates that Zimbabwe adopts an experimental, rather than programmatic, adaptive management approach towards its elephants, involving a devolutionary policy that allows its primary stakeholders (those with wildlife on their land) to experiment with elephant management. It alludes to a method of quota setting for elephants based on monitoring of mean tusk weight of trophies which takes into account the long response time of elephant populations to any change in their management regime. The Supporting Statement includes an analysis of legal ivory trade from Zimbabwe for 1980 to 2014, as reported in the CITES Trade Database, noting discrepancies between import and export data and showing that recorded annual exports for 2012 and 2013 exceeded 20t, the first time this has occurred since 1990. 32 CoP17 Prop. 15 The Supporting Statement indicates that the average mortality due to illegal hunting is 4.5% of the total population noting that the populations in two of the main areas of elephant distribution in the country are increasing while in two others they are declining rapidly towards extinction. CoP17 Doc. 57.5 (Report on Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE)) contains the most up-to-date synthesised information on illegal killing of elephants, based on information from 2003 until the end of 2015. It reports on the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) at 58 sites in 30 countries in Africa and 27 sites in 13 countries in Asia. A PIKE level of 0.5 or lower is generally considered sustainable. In its analysis of sub-regional trends in Africa, the report observes (para 14) that the southern African sub-region (Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe) is the only one of the four African sub-regions where the estimated PIKE has not exceeded the 0.5 level in the period 2003 to 2015. It is difficult to estimate poaching impact at the site level, especially in sites that do not report sufficiently large numbers of carcasses, or where there may be indications of bias in reported PIKE levels2. The Supporting Statement cites an estimate of 439t of ivory illegally traded in the period 2002 to 2014 in Zimbabwe, compared with legal ivory production of 180t and trophy hunting of 74t in the same period. The annex to CoP17 Doc. 57.6 presents an analysis of illegal ivory trade, based on data in ETIS. Part of this is a cluster analysis of 55 countries or territories divided into 13 groups with similar characteristics. Zimbabwe forms part of group eight, along with Botswana and Namibia. The report\u2019s analysis of this group is as follows: \u201cAs in the CoP16 analysis, three of the four African Elephant range States whose elephant populations were transferred to Appendix II in 1997 fall in the same group. These countries regularly report data to ETIS. In terms of all data which implicate these countries in an ivory seizure, this southern African grouping reflects middle range values in terms of mean number of seizures and the mean weight of ivory seized. The measure for assessing the presence of organised crime stands at zero which is indisputably a good sign. Governance indicators are mixed, however, with the rule of law score problematic and suggesting the presence of corruption, but the relatively high law enforcement ratio partially mitigates that concern. Indeed, as before, Zimbabwe is the country that pulls the rule of law score down, indicating far greater governance challenges exist in that country, but it is worth noting that Namibia\u2019s scores have also dropped too.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "224d5bcb-57f2-4db8-8abd-1edb854c22ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "224d5bcb-57f2-4db8-8abd-1edb854c22ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5beb2b446a4f0f772a97ca0f7e9f120bb2856bce5581e246dbaef4a3fd2f73e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "3395ee6e-9b45-4e9f-a4ee-71e744a4b463", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9e7893e3ae441f4cc46b511cd93c2f32b0a7ff2a1fecb4375eea77b1f634bd1"}}, "hash": "d7ef0e15fa5061e0b854f9754ac2d3116ce145a4c930c60402be0b44f097dd5c", "text": "The domestic ivory market score is low, reflecting the complete absence of a market in Botswana and a very low level of trade in Namibia.

Analysis: The Zimbabwean population of African Elephant was transferred from Appendix I to Appendix II, under a series of constraints set out in an annotation (6). Acceptance of the current proposal would delete this annotation as it refers to Zimbabwe. There are no explicit guidelines in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) as to how to deal with a proposal to amend or delete an annotation for an Appendix-II listed species. However, these constraints can be interpreted as special measures under the terms of the precautionary measures in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). It would be appropriate to examine whether these precautionary measures are still met under the proposed change. The Zimbabwean African Elephant population does not have a restricted range, is not small, and is not undergoing a marked decline. It does not therefore appear to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I set out in Annex 1 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). Although reference is made to a possible quota-setting method, no specific export quota or other special measure is proposed in the Supporting Statement. Under the precautionary measures set out in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16), Parties would therefore need to be satisfied that Zimbabwe is implementing the requirements of the Convention, particularly Article IV, and that appropriate enforcement controls and compliance with the requirements of the Convention are in place. 33 CoP17 Prop. 15 The Supporting Statement indicates that Zimbabwe adopts an experimental, adaptive approach to management of its African Elephants. It is not possible to determine a priori if such an approach would be effective in implementing Article IV if this proposal were accepted. Regarding enforcement controls and compliance, the Supporting statement itself, as well as analysis from ETIS in the annex to CoP17 Doc. 57.6 indicates that this may be problematic in some areas. It is likely that in this case the precautionary measures may not be met. Sources for population estimates: Dunham, K. C. (2015).

It is difficult to estimate poaching impact at the site level, especially in sites that do not report sufficiently large numbers of carcasses, or where there may be indications of bias in reported PIKE levels2. 36 CoP17 Prop. 16 The Supporting Statement of the proposal deals extensively with the wider African Elephant population, which is not the subject of the amendment proposal. It draws attention to the high levels of illegal killing of elephants that have been recorded (chiefly through the MIKE programme) in many parts of the range since 2006 (see Doc. CoP17 57.5), associated with elevated levels of illegal trade in ivory recorded from 2008 onwards, as indicated by seizure data contained in the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) (see CoP17 Doc. 57.6). The proponents argue that transferring the Appendix-II African Elephant population to Appendix I will indicate that the CITES Parties do not intend to allow commercial trade in ivory in the future, and that this will serve as a disincentive for the illegal killing of elephants, thereby enhancing the conservation status of this species in its range as a whole, and also benefitting the Appendix-I listed Asian Elephant Elephas maximus. Analysis: Regarding the impact of this proposal on elephant populations elsewhere, there is no provision to address this question in any guidelines or criteria under the Convention and it will therefore not be considered further here. The African Elephant population of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe does not appear to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I set out in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). It does not have a restricted range, nor is its population small or undergoing a marked decline. Annex 3 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) states that listing of a species in more than one Appendix should be avoided in general in view of the enforcement problems it creates. It adds that if split-listing does occur, this should generally be on the basis of national or regional populations, rather than subspecies.

It was included in Appendix I in 1977. Currently all Falconiformes other than those in Appendix I are in Appendix II. The extent of occurrence is now estimated to be nearly 40 million km2, and a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 230,000 to 440,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed, and previous estimates placed it closer to 90,000 mature individuals1. The population overall is said to be stable, having undergone an increase in North America and increasing in Europe. There are some regional exceptions to the general global trend of stable or increasing populations. In Turkey, populations decreased over the decade from 1990 to 2000 while in central Europe some small sub-populations have not recovered from earlier declines. The global population was classified by BirdLife for the IUCN Red List as being of Least Concern (2015). Falco peregrinus underwent severe declines in the mid-20th century owing to the widespread use at that time of pesticides containing dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) which reduced the reproductive success, leading to a significant reduction in its distribution and extirpations of some populations2. Re-introduction programmes and restrictions on pesticide use in some areas of its range have allowed the species to recover2, although significant further efforts are needed to fully restore the species across its former range1. Current factors impacting F. peregrinus populations are likely to include environmental toxins, habitat destruction and alteration, illegal killing and take from the wild.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c87c2d57-1cfe-4b68-88e1-1cf8f1e0eae8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c87c2d57-1cfe-4b68-88e1-1cf8f1e0eae8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d092ef424738a603650937418b74cb817eac014fe8228c31e8b76c619e0d333"}, "2": {"node_id": "6baf4c92-afba-411f-a09f-815d124bc732", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "679eaf6e51970a591542f5dcc9b696ca0fbbf955ab0b782f84d902d40dc7217f"}}, "hash": "1ed5e5ee67d61b2b4596cb914fdfc0a7b408ef11a596b58c5eada4fac5dee6cd", "text": "The species is traded internationally for falconry, and also for re-introduction purposes. According to the CITES Trade Database, between 2000 and 2014 a total of 4674 live F. peregrinus were traded, the majority declared as captive-bred (source code C/D = 3667 birds). During the same time period, 665 wild birds were exported, mainly for the purpose of re-introduction or introduction into the wild, with a smaller number for personal use. Illegal trade of wild F. peregrinus does occur, but is not significant in relation to the population size3. The commercial captive-breeding of raptors in general is of growing economic importance. Much of this growth has come from producers in the United Kingdom, Germany, and other European countries supplying Middle Eastern consumers who are driving both the demand and prices worldwide; some Middle Eastern countries are becoming major producers in addition to being large centres of demand4. Currently the global commercial demand for F. peregrinus is very largely met by captive-bred birds although some are reportedly taken from the wild for domestic use in consumer countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates4. Such take is often illegal. A survey of 21 current key trading countries found that all (with the possible exception of Mongolia) had controls on wild-take of F. peregrinus and falconry either through specific regulation or more general wildlife", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21ed8e4d-0ef7-4a4a-904a-b19a0e7f56bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "21ed8e4d-0ef7-4a4a-904a-b19a0e7f56bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31d2109179611e7c74bddd383cdf8c93e630f52e463a7b1f1185ef3f1dc0752a"}, "3": {"node_id": "65086a3e-ac9a-4856-9d71-d062f0e0041b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12bb31b4f59cb826828be4859fe051f1725c297104d55589378baa81ba6a8d2c"}}, "hash": "2aed82e0ed60da0bc69d38f1e3e9b599237f687d4c2720448a922053a5c82ccf", "text": "regulations. The Supporting Statement and Information Document submitted by Canada contain more detailed information on national regulation. At least 13 of the countries do not currently permit wild-harvest. Most of the key trading countries indicated that national-level controls would not change as a result of a transfer of F. peregrinus to Appendix II5. However, responses were not received from some countries which are large exporters/importers (e.g. Kazakhstan, Japan). There may be some demand in international trade for wild birds following a transfer to Appendix II, as breeders look for new bloodlines and falconers become interested in obtaining them because they were previously unavailable in trade3,6. However, all major consuming countries are also range States where it appears in general that domestic regulations concerning take from the wild would be unlikely to change following a transfer to Appendix II. Analysis: The available information indicates that Falco peregrinus does not meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I: it has an extremely wide distribution and a large and stable population. Regarding the precautionary measures outlined in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16), it is likely that a transfer will stimulate trade in wild F. peregrinus. However, the impact on the wild population as a whole will 39 CoP17 Prop. 17 likely be minimal, as there is already a well-established captive-breeding trade which is able to largely satisfy current market demands. Given the species is present in over 200 countries it is hard to determine whether management and appropriate enforcement and compliance controls in each is such that Parties can be satisfied with implementation by the range States of Article IV. However, the majority of current key trading countries indicated that national-level controls would not change as a result of a transfer of F. peregrinus to Appendix II. The species is unlikely to enter commercial trade from the great majority of range States. It seems likely, therefore, that precautionary measures are met in the greater part of the range and would be proportionate to the anticipated risks to the species.

There have been no reports of illegal trade. The species was included in the Periodic Review. Analysis: The Helmeted Honeyeater Lichenostomus melanops cassidix has a restricted range and a population, which although increasing is very small. On this basis it would appear still to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I in Annex 1 of Res. Conf 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). However, the only reported trade has been in specimens for scientific purposes and there are no indications of illegal trade of any commercial demand. It is highly unlikely that its transfer to Appendix II would stimulate trade in it or any Appendix-I listed species. In the event of a transfer to Appendix II, no commercial trade would be permitted under Australian legislation. The anticipated risks to the taxon of such a transfer would appear to be negligible. 41 CoP17 Prop. 19 Transfer of African Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus from Appendix II to Appendix I Proponents: Angola, Chad, European Union, Gabon, Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo and United States of America Summary: The African Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus is a medium-sized frugivorous parrot from forested parts of Western and Central Africa. It occurs in 22 or 23 range States and has a range estimated at around three million km2, of which nearly 90% is in Central Africa (from eastern Nigeria and Cameroon eastwards), around half of this in Democratic Republic of the Congo. It has been included in Appendix II under the general listing of Psittaciformes since 1981. Typically inhabiting dense, moist lowland forest, it may also occur in or at forest edges, clearings, gallery forest, mangroves, wooded savannah, cultivated areas and gardens. The species often forms large communal roosts of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of birds and may also congregate in large numbers at mineral licks1. Breeding is dispersed or loosely colonial2. The nest is in a tree cavity usually between 10 and 30m above the ground. In captivity birds have a mean lifespan of around 45 years and first breed at about five years of age; from this generation time is estimated at just over 15 years. It is estimated that in the wild 15 to 30% of the population breeds in any one year. Clutches comprise three to five eggs; wild productivity has been estimated at around 0.4 chicks/nest per year1, or one to 1.8 fledglings per year. Population density is very variable: estimates in different areas and different habitats range from 0.15 birds per km2 to two breeding pairs per km2. Combining these figures with estimates of habitat extent, a very rough estimation of between ca. 700,000 and 13 million birds in total was derived in 2008, with 160,000 to 360,000 in West Africa and the remainder in Central Africa2. Information on changes in population is patchy, not well quantified and often anecdotal. There are indications of local declines, some of them marked, over the past two to three decades in countries including Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, and more widespread marked declines in Ghana3 and Guinea1, 4. A recent country-wide estimate in Cameroon of around 200,000 is lower than one made in the mid-1990s (300,000 to 500,000); however the basis of both these estimates has been questioned and the two are not comparable4. The 2013 BirdLife assessment for the IUCN Red List noted that the rate of decline was hard to quantify, but that a rate of 30 to 49% over three generations might be a conservative estimate. The species was classified in the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable (2013) on this basis. There is essentially no information on population status or trends for a very large proportion of the range in Central Africa. Population declines here have been inferred from habitat loss and harvest for international trade. Loss and fragmentation of forest cover is generally agreed to have affected African Grey Parrot populations although quantitative data linking the two are lacking. FAO figures indicate that, as a very rough estimation, some 8% of forest cover has been lost in countries within the range of the species between 1990 and 2010.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d71c771-0265-4795-a5cc-1d4400bb3184": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d71c771-0265-4795-a5cc-1d4400bb3184", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30307f0d06ee33ad015cc3927b3bf3cd2cab56bff25c6513f217664f19144cf5"}, "2": {"node_id": "14ebdfb8-7bd7-4e9b-b6e4-77acebd17881", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99dfa38dc45f11ff550f2a98c81f3759b6b3a70c2496bb63fa3cf10cea438a91"}}, "hash": "bf0961b87244f82819f9210d8a061ea5447ba7477f66aa62ce26da2dd4d71579", "text": "However, forest loss has been considerably lower in the Central African basin, where the bulk of the population is believed to occur, with 4% loss from 1990 to 2010, or roughly 0.2% per year in Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Declared trade in wild-caught birds since then has been lower, averaging around 11,000 birds per year according to importers' records (about half this according to exporters). There are numerous reports of unauthorised or illegal capture and trade, including from Central African parts of the range, but these are not well-quantified. Estimates of post-capture pre-export mortality of wild birds vary, but average 30 to 40%1. The CITES Trade Database shows that in recent years South Africa has been reporting the export of large and rapidly increasing numbers of captive-bred African Grey Parrots as captive-bred, rising from some 8000 in 2007 to ca. 29,000 in 2010 to ca. 76,000 in 2014. A recent assessment indicated that there were over 1600 separate breeding facilities for the species in South Africa with, collectively, around 50,000 breeding pairs5. The species is vulnerable to trapping at roosts and mineral licks where it tends to congregate, and there are 42 CoP17 Prop. 19 reports of population declines at such sites where these have been targeted5. However there is very little information on the intensity of trapping or its impact in large parts of the range. Legal status varies across the range. In some countries it is completely protected, in others partially. The species has been included in the Review of Significant Trade three times (in the 1980s, in 2004 and 2011) resulting in recommendations for various exporting range States. Currently Cameroon and Democratic Republic of the Congo have published annual export quotas (3000 and 5000 respectively)5 . In 2015 the CITES Standing Committee recommended that all Parties suspend imports of African Grey Parrots from Democratic Republic of the Congo, the major exporter in recent years, because of persistent irregularities in the trade (Notification 2016/021). Analysis: The African Grey Parrot has a very extensive range. Total population is unknown, but it is clearly not small, and may be very large (several million). There is evidence of severe widespread declines in two range States in West Africa and declines have been observed elsewhere, particularly in areas where the species is known to be collected. Population trends are unknown in a very large proportion of its range although declines have been inferred from loss of habitat and over-collection. Given the relatively low rate of forest conversion in major parts of the range (notably Central Africa), and the ability of the species to survive in some modified habitats, habitat loss alone is highly unlikely to have led to a decline in line with the guidelines in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16), in this case a reduction of 50% in 45 years (three generations). Given the relatively low productivity of the species, and taking into account estimates of post-capture mortality, it is likely that much collection has led to population declines in areas where it takes place or has taken place. Overall, however, there is insufficient information to determine whether these declines have been widespread and severe enough for the entire population to have undergone a marked decline in the sense of the Resolution (the Red List Assessment note that the rate of decline is uncertain and may be between 30% and 49%). It is unclear, therefore whether the species meets the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I or not. Much reported trade is now in captive-bred birds originating outside of range States.

Extensive conversion of the native forest for agriculture has made the habitat unsuitable for the owl, leading to precipitous population decline. The last known genetically pure female of the subspecies was recorded in 1996. Surveys in 2005 found no birds of the subspecies on either Norfolk Island or Philip Island1. The parent species, Ninox novaeseelandiae (as recognised under CITES taxonomy) occurs in Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste. Individuals of Ninox novaeseelandiae novaeseelandiae were introduced to Norfolk Island in 1987. Cross-breeding with the remaining female N. n. undulata resulted in a small hybrid population which is managed and subject to intensive monitoring. Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata was included in Appendix I in 1977. In 1979 all owls (order Strigiformes) other than those included in Appendix I were included in Appendix II. No trade in the subspecies has been recorded in the CITES Trade Database. Extremely limited trade in Ninox novaeseelandiae has been recorded since the listing of Strigiformes; since 2002, Australia has exported 18 scientific specimens according to the CITES Trade Database. Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata is listed as endangered in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999), which regulates trade in CITES-listed and Australian native wildlife and their products. Export of a live Australian native mammal, bird, reptile or amphibian is strictly prohibited for commercial purposes but they may be exported for specific non-commercial purposes (e.g. for research, education, exhibition or a pet bird). Analysis: The genetically pure subspecies Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata is evidently extinct. It was never recorded in trade; trade in its parent species N. novaeseelandiae has been extremely limited, with no commercial trade reported from a range State. The remaining hybrid population (N. n. novaeseelandiae x N. n. undulata) is managed and intensively monitored. In the unlikely event of N. n. undulata being rediscovered, Australian national legislation would prohibit its export for commercial purposes. All trade in N. novaeseelandiae (and its hybrids) will come under the provisions of CITES Appendix II and Australian national legislation, which prohibits export of live specimens for commercial purposes. It would appear that the precautionary measures in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP 16) have been met.

The area can act as a replicable model. ii) all products (including live specimens) must be adequately identified Details on marking of eggs through to hatchlings and skins are provided. Skin marking will follow the CITES universal marking system and will include a label \u201cACUTUS CISPATA COLOMBIA\u201d, which will distinguish skins from those originating in the 7 registered captive breeding facilities for the species in Colombia. iii) the programme must have in place appropriate inventories, harvest controls and population monitoring mechanisms The Cispata Bay population, including nests, has been monitored using standardized methods since 2003, led by the local competent environmental authority (CVS).No detail is provided on harvest controls except that only authorized ASOCAIMAN members will be permitted to harvest eggs. A management plan under development will include guidelines for egg collection from a sampled area (this management plan is not currently available). Trade quotas will be established and adaptively managed based on monitoring, as will the populations of individuals to be reintroduced to the wild. iv) adequate numbers of animals must be returned to the wild Progeny from 10% of all eggs collected will be returned to the wild after reaching approximately 100cm size in controlled conditions.

The intention is for these to be exported with an experimental quota of 200 skins per year until the stocks are exhausted. d) i) off-take should not be detrimental Details of the proposed offtake have not been provided however, the local community has been collecting eggs (with replacement) for over 10 years and the population appears to be stable or increasing. Management will be adapted on the basis of monitoring. ii) the likely of biological and economic success of the operation The DMI-BC has demonstrated the potential biological success over the past 10 years with the recovery and stabilisation of the population. Sustainable use will allow costs to be internalised for long tem economic success. Income will also be generated through ecotourism, research and education. iii) there should be an assurance of no cruelty The proponent states that humane methods will be used that guarantee no cruelty and comply with national legislation. iv) there should be documentary evidence that the programme is beneficial to the wild population The community conservation project that has been running for over 10 years has reintroduced animals and also built artificial nests, many of which are being used by female crocodiles on the a regular basis. The community group ASCOCAIMAN is predominantly composed of ex-hunters, who are now conserving instead of hunting the crocodiles. It is believed the area may serve as a replicable model. v) there should be assurance that the above conditions will continue to be met The programme has been running successfully over the past 10 years and a management plan is in development. Overall, the IUCN/SSC Crocodile Specialist Group considers the proposed management measures to be sound2. Regarding implementation of Res .Conf. 11.16 (Rev CoP15): recent problems with the management of Caiman crocodilus fuscus farming in Colombia have been identified, in particular the export of ranched and wild-harvested specimens declared illegally as captive-bred. At the 66th Meeting of the CITES Standing Committee Colombia and the EU made a joint declaration in which Colombia undertook to take action to ensure the legal origin of the traded specimens, to be implemented by 31 May 20163. It is not clear to what extent these actions have been implemented. Analysis: The Crocodylus acutus population of Cispata Bay, Colombia, remains small (<2500 individuals), with a restricted range; however the population appears to be increasing or stable, and possibly at carrying capacity and does not appear to be threatened at present.

It was included in Appendix I in 1975. In 2010 the populations of Mexico and Belize were transferred to Appendix II with a zero quota for wild specimens for commercial purposes. The population of Guatemala remains in Appendix I. Surveys indicate that Mexico\u2019s population has continued to increase since its transfer to Appendix II, from an estimated 54,000 (of which almost 13,500 were adults) in 2010 to ca. 100,000 (of which some 19,000 were adults) in 2015. The population structure is pyramidal, generally accepted as reflecting a healthy population. The species is present throughout its natural range in Mexico of around 400,000km2 of which 25,277km2 is considered optimal habitat. Management is based around Wildlife Management Units known as UMAs which must have seven basic elements: registration with the CITES Management Authority; an approved management plan; management and conservation of habitat; monitoring of the harvested wild populations; submission of regular reports and inventories; technical supervision visits; and marking or labelling (in line with the universal tagging system in Res. Conf. 11.12 (Rev. CoP15)). The Supporting Statement indicates that Mexico\u2019s population of C. moreletii may have the potential to be harvested in all size classes. However, the current intention is that wild harvest will be restricted to eggs with the resulting hatchlings raised in UMAs. No quotas or harvest limits are mentioned in the proposal, although the Supporting Statement notes that many programmes in use around the world for different species of crocodilians suggest that 50-80% annual removal of eggs can be sustainable1. The Mexican Government is developing a pilot project on sustainability, production systems and traceability for C. moreletii skins in collaboration with RESP (Responsible Ecosystem Sourcing Platform). The programme aims to involve local communities in the conservation of the species and its habitat through ranching. The CITES Scientific Authority of Mexico (CONABIO) is funding the development of a ranching protocol in conjunction with experts to support the implementation of the pilot project. This protocol will include aspects of population monitoring and nests; monitoring and habitat management; estimation of sustainable harvest rates for ranching; management of nests, extraction and transfer of eggs; incubation (including details on the infrastructure, equipment and materials); and care of offspring from birth to sale. This will be available as an Information Document at CoP17. Because the population of C. moreletii was not transferred to Appendix II for ranching in accordance with Res. Conf. 11.16 (Rev.

Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) for assessing removal of a zero quota for wild specimens from an Appendix-II listed species. However, such removal may be seen as analogous to a transfer from Appendix I to Appendix II.

The populations of 13 range States, including Madagascar, are included in Appendix II, some under particular restrictions; all other populations are in Appendix I. This proposal only affects the Madagascar population. The Malagasy population of C. niloticus was originally transferred in 1985 from Appendix I to Appendix II under Res. Conf. 5.21 on special criteria for the transfer of taxa from Appendix I to Appendix II (no longer in effect), and subject to an annual export quota to allow limited trade in wild skins from nuisance animals. At the Tenth Conference of the Parties (CoP10) in 1997 a proposal was accepted to include the species in Appendix II pursuant to Res. Conf. 3.15 [now Res. Conf. 11.16 (Rev. CoP15)] on ranching rather than Res. Conf. 5.21. Between 1985 and 1997 the CoP agreed on varying export quotas for wild specimens, ranched species or wild nuisance specimens. From then on the CoP did not set quotas; instead, Madagascar authorized exports in accordance with its ranching programme1. Concerns regarding Madagascar\u2019s compliance with Res. Conf. 11.16 were raised at the Animals Committee (AC) in 2006 and transmitted to the Standing Committee (SC). The Secretariat visited Madagascar in 2006 and confirmed that Madagascar was not fully complying with the Resolution and that controls of farming operations had been insufficient to prevent abuses. The SC developed a series of recommendations for Madagascar (Annex 1 to SC55 Doc. 132). At SC60 the SC recommended, in view of persistent concerns about the management of ranching operations in the country, that trade in this species with Madagascar be suspended; this recommendation came into effect in June 2010. At SC65 (July 2014) the SC decided, in view of the progress that Madagascar had made, that the suspension could be withdrawn, conditional on evidence that specific Decrees and Ministerial Orders, complying with the SC\u2019s recommendations, had entered into force. Parties were notified that the recommendation to suspend trade was withdrawn in December 20143.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85d8f4eb-4771-42b9-b513-e9f3e2eb70ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "85d8f4eb-4771-42b9-b513-e9f3e2eb70ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "989cd6c80e9e57c8d8158348233d0c20172adda126a6f5661697daf05ad0bfe6"}, "2": {"node_id": "3002faaf-1573-485c-9768-2015426643b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04988868d815ca40089d70878cc2d7e96a28d29ffce57216c8b737ea2f133f4f"}}, "hash": "e771bbb3709667c2d1d41a5baaaa3d0b2b11b1455a6ac0aceddeb812ec6edc0d", "text": "Parties were notified that the recommendation to suspend trade was withdrawn in December 20143.

Crocodylus niloticus is widely distributed in Madagascar in a variety of freshwater habitats below 1500m. It is most abundant in northwest and western area and in the northeast. The wild population has been estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 non-hatchlings although the basis of this is questionable. In 2015, surveys indicated a high proportion of juvenile and sub-adult individuals in the population (36% of sightings); and based on various indices the adult population was estimated at 1500 to 2000 individuals. However, many wetlands remain unsurveyed, and extrapolating from available relative density estimates in these to an estimate of the total or absolute population size in Madagascar is problematic5. Survey results conducted since 2000 suggest that in many areas surveyed the population is increasing or stable. Hunters and local communities are also said to consider that crocodile abundance has increased over the last few years, attributed to a 49 CoP17 Prop. 23 reduction in wild harvest since 2010. The species is affected by habitat degradation, including loss or alteration of nesting areas. Expansion of the human population has resulted in the local extinction of C. niloticus due mainly to habitat loss and public safety concerns. Crocodylus niloticus was categorised by IUCN as being globally of Lower Risk/least concern in 1996 (needs updating). Past annual export quotas for wild skins have been 100 to 200 for 1992 to 1997, 500 to 750 wild skins for 1998 to 2007 and 200 wild skins for 2008 to 2011. In addition to the export quotas, a much larger (annual average of ca. 5000 for 1987 to 2009 and ca. 2500 for 2010 to 2015) wild harvest of skins has been permitted for the artisanal industry for the production of finished leather goods and taxidermy specimens (75% of which are said to be sold and used domestically). Export during 2010 and 2015 may have accounted for ca. 625 wild crocodiles per year. Artisanal products purchased by tourists and taken with them as personal effects (pursuant to Res. Conf 13.7 (Rev. CoP16) have continued to be exported from the country. Specimens are considered exempt and they are not accounted for in Madagascar\u2019s trade data. Madagascar wishes to maintain its population of C. niloticus in Appendix II under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) Annex 2(a), paragraph B) rather than to Res. Conf. 11.16 (Rev. CoP15). The Supporting Statement notes that the proposal reflects the rebuilding of a revised management paradigm for Madagascar\u2019s C. niloticus, established in 2014 and aimed primarily at sustaining and rebuilding the wild population, and consolidating and better regulating the wild harvest associated with the artisanal industry. The new approach entails moving towards export of products of wild harvested crocodiles that have been processed through the artisan industry. Details of the proposed system are supplied in the Supporting Statement. Some of these are included in the proposed annotation. These are as follows: 1) Harvest size limits (skins must be over1 m and less than 2.5m in total length) All wild skins must pass through registered artisanal tanneries, of which there are currently 14. Each tannery is obliged to register information on each skin which is tagged on arrival; this information is submitted to the relevant Government department on a quarterly basis. Random inspections are carried out on tanneries by Government officials. Morphometric relationships predicting the size of crocodiles from which finished products were derived have been developed and are used to verify compliance with skin size limits. The Supporting Statement notes these limits may need to be adjusted (up or down) over time, as more information becomes available on the population size, structure and trends5. 2) Wild harvest limited to 3000 animals per year for the first three years (2017-2019) A wild harvest of ca. 5000 per year occurred between 1987 and 2009 and ca .2500 between 2010 and 2015. The harvest ceiling will be reviewed in 2019. Egg collection will continue to be the main source of stock for ranches in tandem to the wild harvest. Quotas are not specified. Improvements in the egg collection system (in place since 1980s) have been proposed and a \u201cdesire to implement these has been expressed\u201d.

Skins of problem crocodiles larger than 2.5m total length are currently not allowed to enter the domestic or international markets, and remain the property of the Government. However, options are being examined for the legal disposal of such skins. - Population monitoring. Standard surveys will be undertaken inside and outside harvesting areas. - Compliance with Article IV, particularly the non-detriment provisions, will be assessed annually based on indices from population surveys and the industry. Management and levels of harvest will be assessed annually, in collaboration with international experts in at least the first three years of the program (2017-2019), and harvest levels may be adjusted up or down after three years, on the basis of these independent assessments. Analysis: The Malagasy population of the Crocodylus niloticus was originally in Appendix I and is now in Appendix II under the conditions of Res. Conf. 11.16 (Rev. CoP16). The current proposal entails a detailed, substantive annotation that could be counted as a special measure under Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) (sub-para. A 2 a) iii)) to be approved by the CoP based on management measures described in the Supporting Statement, provided that effective enforcement controls are in place. If successfully implemented, it appears that management measures specified in the annotation and in the Supporting Statement would ensure compliance with the Convention, particularly Article IV. As noted above, there have been problems in compliance with the Convention in Madagascar with respect to export of C. niloticus, resulting in a recommendation from the Standing Committee to suspend trade with Madagascar in the species in 2010. In 2014 the Standing Committee (SC) agreed that these problems had largely been resolved, but that some final steps were needed. These have taken place, and the suspension was withdrawn in December 2014. Madagascar indicated to the SC in 2014 that it did not intend to export wild skins at any time in the future. The current annotation indicates that this restriction would only apply for three years from the date of its adoption. The proposed annotation contains substantive management measures and is not in conformity with recommendations on the use of annotations in Appendices I and II in Res. Conf. 11.21 (Rev. CoP16), which states that substantive annotations should be confined to designation of types of specimens or export quotas, or inclusion or exclusion of geographically separate populations. Any change to the substantive provisions in it would need an amendment proposal to be approved by the CoP.

It is widely distributed in Malaysia\u2019s three states of Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. The species is currently included in Appendix I, except for the populations of Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, which are included in Appendix II. By the late 1980s Malaysia\u2019s population of C. porosus was seriously depleted owing to overexploitation, primarily for hides and meat1. Initiation of conservation programmes at that time has resulted in significant increase in the populations of Sarawak and Sabah. This proposal would entail harvest for export only of the population of Sarawak. Little is known about the size of the population in Peninsular Malaysia but it is thought to be small. In Sabah surveys in 2002 indicated that in some areas C. porosus numbers had increased by about 10 fold since the 1980s, with nearly four crocodiles per km of river bank in some rivers. Sarawak covers an area of 12 million hectares with 22 major river basins; C. porosus is reported to occur in all these. Two separate recent surveys which covered just over 2000km in essentially the same wetlands came up with very similar estimates of ca. 12,000 individuals and 13,507 non-hatchlings. These estimates are considered conservative as heavily vegetated swamps were not surveyed. The population structure in Sarawak appears to be consistent with a population that has recovered and is both viable and healthy. Suitable habitat reportedly remains abundant. There has been increased incidence of human-crocodile conflict, including fatal and non-fatal attacks on humans. The Supporting Statement states that the maximum sustainable yield for wild C. porosus populations is not known precisely, but notes that a 5% annual harvest rate for alligators did not interfere with continued population growth. It considers a 5% annual harvest rate for the non-hatchling population in the surveyable rivers of Sarawak to have a high probability of being sustainable. Harvesting is proposed of 500 non-hatchlings and 2500 eggs or their equivalent based on average survival rates i.e. 750 hatchlings or 375 yearlings. The figure of 500 is derived from 5% of the higher of the two population estimates above reduced to be more precautionary (5% of 13,507 is 675). If all the additional harvest is of yearlings, the total non-hatchling offtake could be 875, which represents around 6.5% of the higher population estimate. Harvest of 2500 eggs is equivalent to around 50 nests per year. Based on offtake of the species in Australia this harvest is thought unlikely to have any impact on the population because density-dependent factors will increase the survival rate of hatchlings in non-harvested nests2. A Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak has been put in place, providing recommendations and guidelines for wildlife and its habitats. A crocodile Management Plan has been drawn up to address the use of crocodiles in Sarawak. Funding has been provided for necessary monitoring. Based on population monitoring and assessment of the impact of harvesting on the non-hatchling wild population, the offtake will be adaptively managed, with harvesting in successive years reduced proportionately if the wild population is seen to be declining. Movement within the state of Malaysia may require export and/or import license or permit to be issued by the Controller of Wild Life. Malaysia currently has seven registered captive-breeding facilities for C. porosus, two of which are in Sarawak, which primarily produce skins for export. The species is in trade from other range States where populations are already in Appendix II (Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea) as well as from captive-breeding facilities. Trade from different states in Malaysia would not be differentiated in the CITES Trade Database. 52 CoP17 Prop. 24 Analysis: Malaysia\u2019s population of the Saltwater or Estuarine Crocodile C. porosus is neither small nor does it have a restricted range.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "606dfb0d-b894-4195-a1da-4c1320db9ed9": {"__data__": {"id_": "606dfb0d-b894-4195-a1da-4c1320db9ed9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbe98b33efe70889e445867c3f45bc60fad5cd8543ad0bcf166dee6b4d1b074d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3c59af9-45ee-44e2-86b6-85ff586fc549", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "300578c797aba1c166c29b810c7fa6272fb9190c55c00f195c63b0480b5253f9"}}, "hash": "685ab062affc9b0c208c95ef6853e7bf662d598324be6a388fdcae82808612e4", "text": "Conservation action over the past 30 years has resulted in a marked population increase in Sarawak and Sabah, two of the three Malaysian States.

In the case of Sarawak the intent is to harvest a limited number of non-hatchlings and eggs, or the equivalent of those eggs in hatchlings or non-hatchlings, with initial harvest level set on the basis of current population estimates and future harvest adjusted adaptively based on results from annual population monitoring. This could be interpreted as a special measure under the terms of Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). Relatively few details are provided on management measures to control harvest and trade. If all initial harvest is in non-hatchlings, the proposed offtake may exceed the reference level of an annual sustainable harvest suggested in the Supporting Statement (ca. 6.5% vs 5% of the population). No mention is made of intention to comply with the universal tagging system for the identification of skins in Res. Conf. 11.12 (Rev. CoP15). No details are given of how specimens would be differentiated from those from the captive-breeding facilities, particularly as the marking provisions in Res. Conf. 10.16 (Specimens of animal species bred in captivity) would no longer be applicable if the population were transferred to Appendix II. The proposal includes zero quotas for [wild] specimens from Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah. It is not clear whether measures detailed would be adequate to ensure that specimens from Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah do not enter the trade chain through Sarawak. The Crocodile Management Plan that has been drawn up may provide further information to verify whether precautionary safeguards are met.

Reported trade of this species in Czech Republic and United Kingdom and advertised for sale online. Classified in the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable (2013). Abronia species are in trade for the exotic pet market. This trade is reviewed in the analysis of Proposal 26. The great majority of recorded trade is in the Mexican A. graminea and most of the remainder in unspecified Abronia spp9. Trade data records a small number of specimens imported with origin Guatemala, all for scientific purposes9. There is no authorised collection for trade or commercial export of Abronia species native to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. However there is reported commercial trade or evidence online of the sale of A. anzuetoi, A. campbelli, A. fimbriata, A. aurita, A. gaiophantasma and A. vasconcelosii. The range of all of these species overlaps with protected areas, although often only partially. There are ongoing monitoring programmes in Guatemala, plus local education and awareness programmes. A captive breeding program has begun for A. campbelli, A. frosti and A. meledona with some successful re-releases.

The proposal includes a zero quota for captive-bred specimens from non-range States. This is intended to reflect that no legal export for commercial purposes has been permitted for these species and therefore any 55 CoP17 Prop. 25 founding stock of commercial captive breeding facilities is believed to have been imported illegally. There is no other example of such a restriction on trade in captive-bred specimens of Appendix-II listed species in the Appendices.

One study of A. taeniata (MX) found it to occur at much lower density than A. graminea, although it has also been described as common in suitable habitat. Of the other species, A. anzuetoi, A. campbelli and A. frosti are known from small patches of forest (0.7 to 24km2) in Guatemala. The population of A. campbelli was estimated at 500 adults in 2010, based on the number of mature trees within its range and an estimate of the average occupancy of each tree. A. fimbriata (GT), A. gaiophantasma (GT), A. martindelcampoi (MX), A. meledona (GT) and A. vasconcelosii (GT) are also reported to have limited distributions. The remainder are known from few specimens, sometimes only from single collections. These are: A. aurita (GT), A. bogerti (MX), A. chiszari (MX), A. cuetzpali (MX), A. fuscolabialis (MX), A. leurolepis (MX), A. matudai (GT, MX), A. mitchelli (MX), A. montecristoi, A. ochoterenai (GT, MX) (recently rediscovered2), A. ornelasi (MX), A. ramirezi (MX), A. reidi (MX) and A. salvadorensis (HN). Abronia species are in trade for the exotic pet market. Trade has reportedly increased since the 1990s but recorded trade remains at a low level. Animals command high prices (several hundred USD or more per individual). Available trade information comes from USA trade data3 and Mexican export records. USA data report that the USA imported just over 230 Abronia in the period 2004 to 2013. Most of these (131) were A. graminea (MX), virtually all reported as captive-bred, the majority (110) from Mexico. Mexican records show legal export in the period 2005 to 2015 of just under 100 A. graminea, of which 55 were declared as captive-bred. The species is advertised for sale online in Europe and USA. Very small numbers of A. deppii, A. lythrochila, A. oaxacae and A. taeniata were also recorded as imported by the USA, none from a range State. Remaining USA imports were not identified to species level; virtually all are of animals reported as captive-bred in non-range States. Mexican records show legal export in the period 2005 to 2015 of small quantities (fewer than ten each) of A. taeniata, A. oaxacae and A. ornelasi, all reported as of wild origin. Internet searches and observations at trade fairs indicate that some 16 species in addition to A. graminea (MX) have been offered for sale, including some that do not have legal authorization for exploitation or export from their native country. Around 130 Abronia specimens were confiscated within Mexico in 2005 to 2015. There is evidence of demand online for A. ochoterenai, which has recently been re-discovered4. A known trader has been seen in the Guatemala asking locals about A. campbelli, A. frosti and A. meledona. This is 57 CoP17 Prop. 26 thought to be part of an established connection that is used for the illicit trade of reptiles out of Mesoamerica5. The greatest demand is reportedly from European countries and the USA. Collection for the pet trade has been said to be a cause of concern for a number of species, including A. campbelli, A. deppii, A. graminea, A. martindelcampoi, A. mixteca and A. taeniata, but there is no information on the impact of collection for international trade on any of the species. There is no authorised collection for trade or exportation of Abronia species native to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. In Mexico, trade is regulated for most species, including A. graminea.

Classified in the IUCN Red List as Least Concern (2014). Rieppeleon kerstenii occurs widely in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Tanzania. It is reported to be common, although there are no quantitative population data. US trade data indicate an average of ca. 8200 imported annually between 2004 and 2013 into the USA, all from Tanzania6. The species is also found in offers for sale in Europe. Some shipments labelled as Ri. kerstenii are reportedly in reality to comprise Ri. brevicaudatus and Rh. temporalis. Classified in the IUCN Red List as Least Concern (2014). Rhampholeon spectrum occurs in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea (including Bioko), Gabon and Nigeria. It has been reported as common in montane areas of Cameroon and in parts of southern Nigeria but is believed to be rarer in the lowlands and degraded habitats; in southern Nigeria suitable habitat for the species is believed only to represent 5% of its original extent. According to US trade data, it is the most commonly traded Rhampholeon spp. with ca. 555 specimens per year imported into the USA between 2004 and 2013, mainly from Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon6. Rh. spectrum is apparently widely available for sale in Europe. Classified in the IUCN Red List as Least Concern (2010). US trade data also shows import of an average of ca. 350 live specimens of Rhampholeon spp. per year between 2004 and 2013, the majority of which were from Tanzania6. Information on the remaining species is as follows: Rieppeleon brachyurus occurs widely in Tanzania, northern Mozambique and Malawi. The species is believed likely to be common although there are no population estimates. US trade data report a small number of imports (ca. 33 per year for 2004-2013) into the USA6. Classified in the IUCN Red List as Least Concern (2014). Rhampholeon acuminatus is currently only known from a single locality in the Nguru South Catchment Forest Reserve in Tanzania, where there is an estimated 28km2 of suitable habitat remaining3. The population is likely to be small, due to its limited range. Around 70 specimens were imported in total into the USA between 2004 and 2013 with the majority of imports in 2013; two additional shipments totalling 107 individuals were refused in 2010 and 20136. The species is considered desirable in the pet trade. It is 59 CoP17 Prop. 27 and 28 regularly found in offers for sale in Europe and the USA. The species is also believed to be particularly at risk from loss of habitat owing to its limited range. Classified in the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered (2014). Rhampholeon nchisiensis is mainly confined to Malawi, with peripheral occurrence in Tanzania and Zambia4. Its overall range extends over some 12,600km2; only 10% of this is suitable forest habitat5. There is no quantitative information on abundance. It is reportedly imported into the pet trade in limited quantities every few years, and can be found in offers for sale in Europe and the USA, although five live imports to the USA have been recorded between 2004 and 20136. Classified in the IUCN Red List as Least Concern (2014). Rhampholeon temporalis is endemic to the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania where there is believed to be less than 300km2 of suitable habitat remaining, some of which may be of low quality. In the East Usambara Mountains, average population density is reported to be just over 30 per ha- with lower densities towards forest edges. Not recorded in US import data, but the species can be found in offers for sale in Europe and the USA. Shipments of Rh. temporalis are apparently frequently mislabelled as other species of Rhampholeon and Rieppeleon in the international trade. Classified in the IUCN Red List as Endangered (2014).

Rh. platyceps (IUCN Endangered, 2014), occurs in forest fragments in Malawi totalling 61km2, Rh. maspictus (IUCN Near Threatened, 2014) is limited to intact forest patch of 79km2. Rh. gorongosae has an area of occupancy of around 100km2 (IUCN Least Concern, 2014). Rh. marshalli (IUCN Vulnerable, 2014) inhabits a severely fragmented area of ca. 540km2 which is subjected to ongoing forest transformation. None of these species are known to be in trade. At least eight species of Rhampholeon and almost certainly all species of Rieppeleon occur in protected areas. Available information indicates that national protection is limited. In Cameroon, capture of Rhampholeon spp. requires a permit although this rule is reportedly often disregarded. In Kenya, all chameleon species are protected. In May 2016, it was reported that Tanzania had banned the export of live reptiles until proper procedures to control trade were implemented7. One species in the genus Bradypodion (B. spinosum, endemic to Tanzania) which was included in Appendix II in 1977 is now widely regarded as a species of Rhampholeon, (Rh. spinosus) but is still recognised as Bradypodion under CITES taxonomy. Very little trade in this species is reported in the CITES 60 CoP17 Prop. 27 and 28 Trade Database: a total of 147 live specimens reported in trade between and 1993 and 2011, 93 of which were reported as born in captivity. Rhampholeon and Rieppeleon spp. are reported to be subject to ongoing misidentification in trade, both between species within each genus and between genera, due to their similar morphological characteristics, particularly colouration and physical size. Shipments labelled \"assorted pygmy chameleons\" containing wild- caught Rhampholeon spp. have included the CITES-listed B. spinosum (Rh. spinosus). Analysis: Of the three species in the proposal that are known to be in trade in any number, Ri. kerstenii and Rh. spectrum are both widespread species which are not known to be under threat. It is very likely that the populations of both are large. Ri. kerstenii is known to have been exported in some numbers from one (of four) range States, Rh. spectrum in considerably smaller numbers from two (of four) range States. It does not appear that either meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2 a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16).

It is known from the island of Hon Khoai off the southern tip of Viet Nam, which has a total area of 8km2, and has recently been reported as occurring on the smaller island of Hon Sao nearby to the southeast; its presence on other smaller neighbouring islands is unconfirmed. On Hon Khoai it is found on granite boulder outcrops in the shade of the surrounding dense vegetation. It has much brighter colouration than other species of Cnemaspis (of which there around 75), with both sexes having orange forelimbs and a blue-grey body. Females are reported to lay a single clutch of two eggs once a year, incubated in communal clutches on the underside of overhanging boulders. The species has been described as very common and abundant in suitable habitat.

Within these forests it exclusively occurs on a species of screwpine Pandanus rabaiensis. It has an estimated area of occurrence of 20km\u00b2 and area of occupancy of 8km\u00b2. The species exhibits distinct sexual dichromatism; males have a striking turquoise-blue back while females and immature males are a greenish-bronze. Reproduction is reported to occur throughout the year with a relatively high output of offspring. Generation time is not known. The only available quantified information on population status is for that in the Kimboza Forest Reserve, estimated in 2009 at around 150,000 adults based on visual encounter surveys and mean number of specimens found per P. rabaiensis. Populations elsewhere have not been quantified; those in the Mbagalala and Muhalama forest patches are believed to be small due to the small number of P. rabaiensis trees. The estimated population in Kimboza forest in 2009 was believed to be around one-third smaller than the carrying capacity, based on the number of P. rabaiensis trees. If this represents an actual decline, this may be a result of collection pressure for international trade, which has reportedly been high since 2004. Reports suggest that some 22,000 were collected in 2005 and some 8000 per year in 2006 and 2007. Despite legal protection (see below), the forests in which the species occurs are also reported to be affected by logging, collection of firewood, conversion to agricultural land and mining of the limestone substrate on which P. rabaiensis grows. There have also been reports that P. rabaiensis trees are cut down to collect the geckos. It has been offered for sale online in the recent past in the USA and in Europe, at prices of ca. USD 30-250 per individual. The species has been reported as relatively easy to breed in captivity and specimens reported as captive-bred are offered for sale on the internet1,2.It has been reported that males can lose their striking coloration in captivity, which may result in continuing demand for wild-caught individuals. Kimboza and Ruvu are both Forest Reserves, protected under the 2002 Forest Act and managed by the Tanzania Forest Service. Collection of wild specimens within these areas requires a license. According to officials from the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute, collection and export of L. williamsi has never been licensed, indicating that all trade in it is illegal1,2. It has been reported that wild-caught specimens of L. williamsi are frequently deliberately mislabelled and exported as Lygodactylus spp. or as L. capensis to facilitate trade.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b96ff0e4-3177-4eeb-aeac-6df1213f944c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b96ff0e4-3177-4eeb-aeac-6df1213f944c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "289fe07d0cdcfe0c0c5ba9e605db063de9a4f3ddd0aaf1d6ea13ce65e6389e5c"}, "2": {"node_id": "54eecce9-e0d0-4d25-97c3-2def1924deb6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac8d66e4197dd40152d36c0b646c6895f665736819d89d10cd960c76713e0325"}}, "hash": "578fde0c7bb05a8c7a034a99643ca57240b35da4334c345f5b36cbaeb4c964dd", "text": "or as L. capensis to facilitate trade.

All viewed on 23rd May 2016. 64 CoP17 Prop. 31 Inclusion of Masobe Gecko Paroedura masobe in Appendix II Proponents: Madagascar and European Union Summary: The Masobe Gecko Paroedura masobe is one of 15 species of Malagasy Ground Geckos in the genus Paroedura. It is endemic to Madagascar with a limited range in low elevation humid forest, typically between 300 and 600m above sea level in the east of the country in the province of Toamasina. In 2011 it was assessed as having an extent of occurrence of no more than 410km2, with ca. 100km2 of suitable habitat remaining. The species is believed unlikely to occur more widely than its currently known distribution1. Remaining habitat is fragmented and the population is suspected to be declining, although no quantitative information is available1. It has been reported that there is a relatively stable population in the Betampona Natural Reserve2. Surveys conducted over a period of seven months in the reserve in 2007 and 2010 found just two male specimens. However, in 2013 surveys in an area where the species was known to be present found 23 individuals in three weeks2. As well as Betampona Natural Reserve, the species is also known to occur in Zahamena National Park and the newly established protected area of Ambohidray. Continuing declines in the quality and extent of habitat are believed to be the most important factors affecting the species. Concern has also been expressed about the possible impact of harvest for the international pet trade. The species is highly attractive, and local collectors have indicated that it is one of the most profitable reptile species to collect in the area. There are reports of illegal collection in Betampona Reserve and Zahamena National Park. There is no reported domestic use of the species. A report (currently in preparation) from two regional administration centers of Analamanga and Antsiranana recorded exports of just under 2500 individuals between 2000 and 2005, before controls on exports were put in place in 2006 (see below). Import data from the USA recorded just under 300 wild-caught individuals imported from Madagascar between 2011 and 2015, most (ca. 250) in 2014 and 20153. Additional imports of 53 captive-bred individuals from Canada, Germany and the United Arab Emirates were reported between 2011 and 2015. Online surveys between 2011 and 2016 also reveal the presence of the species in the international pet trade with traders in Europe and the USA offering specimens for ca. USD 380-9504,5. There is also evidence of it being kept as a pet in Japan6 Since 2006, P. masobe has been listed under Category I, Class I of the National Decree 2006-400, which strictly prohibits the hunting, capture, possession and commercial trade of the species except under license for scientific purposes, breeding or exhibitions7. It has been reported that there is an annual quota of ten individuals that can be legally exported1. Trade data above indicate that this figure has been routinely exceeded.

The assessment noted that if further research into the distribution of P. masobe revealed that it has a true extent of occurrence is less than 100km\u00b2, it would merit reclassification as Critically Endangered. Analysis: Paroedura masobe has a restricted distribution in an area where habitat is fragmented and declining. It is sought after in the international pet trade with a few hundred specimens having been exported annually in recent years since 2006, exceeding the apparent quota. There is no information on population densities, overall population size or population trends, although the species has reportedly only infrequently been encountered in one of the protected areas within its range in recent years. The species may meet the criteria in Annex 2 aA of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) in that regulation of trade is necessary to avoid it becoming eligible for inclusion in Appendix I in the near future.

It is burrowing, semi-aquatic and nocturnal, being generally recorded from damp soil along river banks. It is oviparous, producing clutches of ca. 2 to 6 eggs1, 2, 3. There are only a few occurrence records in the wild; many of these have come from incidental encounters posted on social media. Records are from the coastal lowlands of Sarawak, Malaysia, and from northwest Kalimantan, Indonesia in Landak and Sanggau Districts. There is also a single record of the species from East Kalimantan. Its presence has not been confirmed in Brunei Darussalam. It is generally regarded as rare, but is known by local residents, some of whom considered it to be common, at several sites in West Kalimantan4. It has been suggested that it may have a wider distribution than generally thought, with its scarcity in scientific collections due to its nocturnal and secretive life habits4. However, extensive state-wide herpetofauna surveys are reported to have failed to find it. All sites where it is known are from below ca. 300 m altitude5.

This indicates that the species can survive in at least partially modified habitats. An individual was found in 2008 by a survey team in West Kalimantan in a tembawang forest within a recently developed oil palm plantation4 . There has been a rapid emergence of illegal trade in this species since 2013. Intelligence reports suggest that more than 40 individuals were collected in spring 20146 and at least 95 individuals were offered for sale on the internet during a 17 month period7. There have been seizures of at least 35 L. borneensis from Indonesia between October 2015 and March 20168, 9, 10. Specimens advertised as captive-bred are recorded in trade. This species is highly desirable, reported to be reaching prices of USD 7500 to 9000 on the illegal market. This species has been fully protected throughout its range in Malaysia since 1971, Indonesia since 1980, and Brunei Darussalam since 1978, and it has never been legally exported. Therefore all specimens in trade appear to have been illegally obtained, or are the progeny of specimens illegally obtained. Analysis: Lanthanotus borneensis is a rarely observed species known from relatively few locations, a number of which have only recently been discovered. It may be more widespread than current records indicate. There are no population estimates although there are indications that it may be at least locally not uncommon. It is believed likely to be declining owing to habitat loss and alteration, although there are indications that it can survive in modified habitats. Overall, there is insufficient information to determine whether it meets the criteria for listing in Appendix I. The species is in demand for, and potentially affected by, trade.

It is a semi-aquatic lizard ca. 40cm in length that occurs in undisturbed and densely vegetated rocky streams in tropical evergreen broadleaf forests in southern China and northern Viet Nam. Adults have a territory of around 10m2. In the wild maturity is reached at two to four years of age. Pregnancy lasts between nine and 11 months and between two and 12 fully developed young are born into the water. The species was included in Appendix II in 1990. The current population is estimated at 950 individuals in China and fewer than 100 in Viet Nam. In 1978 China\u2019s total population was estimated at about 6000 individuals decreasing to about 2500 individuals in 1990. Sub-populations are fragmented due to loss of habitat, with 19 known in China (of 10-350 individuals) in an area of ca. 460km2 and three in Viet Nam (of 17-22 mature individuals) spread over an area of about 1500km2. The Chinese sub-populations are the most studied, and show significant population declines over the last 30 years, ascribed to collection for the pet trade and local consumption and use in traditional medicine. Five sub-populations appear to have been extirpated completely, and the remaining 19 have recorded declines of up to 90%. At some streams in Viet Nam, this species was reported to have declined or disappeared between 2013-2014, due to increased accessibility to the area, and electrofishing2. Three of the eight Chinese sub-populations fall within protected areas, although only one of these is considered not under threat. The sites of the other Chinese populations are believed to be affected by agricultural conversion, logging and water pollution. All three Vietnamese sites fall within protected areas but are surrounded by cultivated lands, preventing migration between sites.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ae6ceb9-59c6-4ccf-ac51-0e6d09a7506a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ae6ceb9-59c6-4ccf-ac51-0e6d09a7506a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa524d073a8ec838c3ae325527f1d07b78c0081ae6954b677a7a52679ed3f746"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4bed823-3c17-4aa9-8343-90c26d7a9648", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b4cf553f75d65eb3f15831a6a9c0b52c246cd54ac47cdd1abe7f8d3af20dda8"}}, "hash": "6b67d894b32ea0cda64fca8d222acd0f8e27b6f683c9bb469e528aa98f8d71c3", "text": "At least one site is affected by coal mining, and ongoing developments such as new roads and tourist and religious sites have increased accessibility to the habitat. Collection for the international pet trade and domestically for food and traditional medicine is regarded as the major cause of the recent population decline. Anecdotal evidence suggests locals caught as many as 50 per day to sell at markets, until the numbers became too few to collect. There is demand for this species for the pet trade, and it is available for sale at local and international reptile markets; there is also apparently considerable trade on internet platforms. The CITES Trade Database records an average of about 23 live individuals in trade each year for the period 2004-2014, except for 2005 when 400 live individuals were recorded as exported from Lebanon and originating in Kazakhstan (although no corresponding export has been reported from Kazakhstan).3 Other than this the largest recorded exporter is Germany. The largest importers are Germany, Japan, Thailand and USA. Virtually all this trade has been recorded as in captive-bred animals. This is believed to be implausible, as the species has been reported to be challenging to keep and to suffer high levels of mortality in captivity2. Multiple dealers have reported that wild-caught specimens from China have been labelled as captive-bred. Several dealers in Viet Nam advertise specimens for sale from \"farms\" but there is no evidence of breeding facilities sufficient to support this, and one Vietnamese hobbyist reported that \"farmed\" specimens were in fact wild-caught2. Although captive-breeding techniques for this species are improving there is concern that the level of demand is much greater than captive production could supply.

These areas total less than 10km2 between them. However, the species is secretive and may be more widespread than records indicate1. Population data are limited, but a rapid field assessment of the species in 2010 yielded only 12 individuals in Chuka, whilst searches around Igembe and Ngaya forests were unfruitful. Local snake collectors reported that numbers had declined remarkably over the years. Females bear 10 to 13 live young per brood. Ngaya forest is a government protected community forest. The species is believed to be affected by habitat loss and degradation, the forests in which it occurs being under high pressure from livestock grazing, fuel- wood collection, logging and agricultural expansion. It has been suggested that collection for illegal trade may also have had an impact on the species. Atheris desaixi has been protected in Kenya since 1982. Current legislation prohibits both collection from the wild and export. In 1999/2000, 27 individuals were reportedly illegally exported by one trader2, and US trade data records the import into the USA of 16 wild individuals in 2007 to 2008. Three snakes were rescued from a local snake collector during the rapid assessment survey in 2010. The species has been reported to fetch values of up to USD 4500 in Europe. However, there are no data to indicate whether this trade is increasing or not. The species appears to be relatively rare in captivity and the size of the market (specialist collectors) is almost certainly small3. Hobbyists report some captive breeding success. Analysis: Available information indicates that Atheris desaixi has a very restricted range where it is subject to habitat loss and degradation. A 2010 survey found it rare, with reports of a decline in population at one site. There is evidence of demand on international markets. However, the market (specialist collectors) is almost certainly small.

Cambridge, UK. 71 CoP17 Prop. 35 Inclusion of Kenya Horned Viper Bitis worthingtoni in Appendix II Proponent: Kenya Summary: The Kenya Horned Viper Bitis worthingtoni is a small venomous snake endemic to Kenya, occurring in high altitude areas of grassland and scrub. The range is limited, the species having been recorded patchily within an area of some 10,000km2. The main population occurs within the Rift Valley plateau in areas adjacent to Lake Naivasha. There may be additional populations in Hells Gate and Lake Nakuru National Parks and in the areas south of Naivasha towards Mt. Longonot and Kedong valley and north through Gilgil and Elmenteita into Nakuru. There are no recent records from Uasin and Kinangop plateaus, where it has been recorded in the past. There are no population or density estimates, although the species has been described as relatively rare. Population depletions have been inferred based on degradation and loss of suitable habitat. It has also been suggested that populations are depleted in areas where it has been collected in the past, but the basis for this is not clear. Females bear between seven and 12 live young per brood. At least part of the range is within national protected areas and private wildlife sanctuaries. Bitis worthingtoni has been protected in Kenya since 1989. Current legislation prohibits both collection from the wild and export. In 1999/2000, 37 individuals were reported to have been illegally exported from Kenya by one trader1. In 2013 a British man was charged with possession of five specimens2 and one individual was recently offered for approximately USD 1100 on the European market. Analysis: Bitis worthingtoni has a moderately extensive range in Kenya, although is patchily distributed within it. The species has been described as relatively rare, although suitable habitat probably remains extensive within its range. There is evidence of demand in international markets. However, the market (specialist collectors) is almost certainly small3. All current trade from the range State is illegal. Recorded instances of such trade are at a very low level. Given observed volumes of trade and likely limited demand, it seems unlikely that the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16).

Cambridge, UK. 72 CoP17 Prop. 36 Inclusion of the following six species of the Family Trionychidae in Appendix II: Cyclanorbis elegans, Cyclanorbis senegalensis, Cycloderma aubryi, Cycloderma frenatum, Trionyx triunguis, and Rafetus euphraticus Proponents: Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, Togo, and United States of America Summary: Softshell turtles belonging to the Family of Trionychidae are highly aquatic species that generally prefer slow-moving water with muddy or sandy bottoms. Currently some 33 species in 13 genera are recognised. Three species occur in North America, six in Africa, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, and the remainder in more eastern parts of Asia. With the exception of the widely farmed Pelodiscus sinensis, the eastern Asian species are all variously included in either Appendix I or Appendix II.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aac34704-c5ee-4520-b727-e6bbb15a5c56": {"__data__": {"id_": "aac34704-c5ee-4520-b727-e6bbb15a5c56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc0d8900037cbdbd11afdbb45567ec76ba354c239b509efdbc217520d48884be"}, "2": {"node_id": "eabde623-a64a-4dd3-99ec-79bbbc077148", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a3364b011ea113e5f2a147de2c081d1759d856ccae9a0b564850a513a41bdba"}}, "hash": "5ef738ceb192c202372b45a114836100382d31d62bb823f6a23f3fef4d99d3b0", "text": "One North American subspecies, Apalone spinifera atra, is included in Appendix I. This proposal seeks to add all Trionychidae native to Africa, the Mediterranean and the Middle East to Appendix II.

They may lay several clutches a year of 10 to 100 eggs (depending on the species) but few reach maturity. Softshell turtles are in generally very difficult to survey and there is virtually no quantitative information on overall populations, population densities or trends for any of the species.

Cyclanorbis senegalensis is widespread in West Africa and found in a range of aquatic habitats3. Some populations are reported as harvested, with an inference that this is leading to declines; other, unharvested populations reportedly remain abundant. Known international trade, presumed for the international pet trade, is at a very low level. Trade data indicate 70 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2005 and 2013, 54 of which were recorded as wild-sourced4. More than 50 live specimens were reported as exported from Togo in 20135. In the past, this species has been exported under the name of Trionyx triunguis from Togo5. Classified by IUCN as Lower Risk/near threatened (1996 \u2013 needs updating)6. Cycloderma aubryi occurs in waterways in rainforests in central Africa. Reported to be collected extensively for local consumption which is inferred as having led to declines. Trade data records the import of negligible numbers (20 between 2007 and 2013) into the USA4. Cycloderma frenatum occurs chiefly in Malawi but extends into Mozambique, United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe. It is reportedly common in the shallow southern waters of Lake Malawi, rare in the deeper northern waters. Historically this species has been collected for consumption across much of its range, but in some areas only eggs are consumed. Until recently the level of harvest was not thought to have a significant impact on the population. In 2013 an illegal butchery said to be processing 50 adults per day was shut down in Malawi7. This was reportedly in an area where it has not traditionally been consumed and was apparently to meet demand from Asian nationals in Malawi, although it has been suggested that the processed meat and shell were for export to East Asia8. Trade data records imports into the USA of 52 live specimens between 2008 and 2013, 50 of which were in 20134. The species was observed in a pet trade market in Hong Kong between 2000 and 2003 (quantity unknown)9. Classified by IUCN as Lower risk/near threatened (1996 \u2013 needs updating)10. Trionyx triunguis inhabits fresh and brackish waters across Africa, and around the eastern Mediterranean. It is a large species, growing up to 80cm carapace length. It is best known from its Mediterranean populations which are generally believed to be declining. Populations in Africa are less well known; there is anecdotal evidence of major decline in catch per unit effort in parts of West Africa. Populations in central 73 CoP17 Prop. 36 Africa are suspected to be declining at a low rate because of harvest. In Egypt, there have been no recent records from the Nile below Lake Nasser but is reportedly considered abundant upstream of the dam. The species is believed to be affected by habitat alteration and incidental catch in nets. It is consumed for subsistence in parts of its range; its shells are sold in fetish markets in Togo and Benin11. In Israel the species is regarded as highly threatened, with the largest subpopulation believed to comprise some 50 individuals. Illegal harvest for local consumption has been identified as a threat. Trade data show a very small number imported as live specimens into the USA (ca. 100 declared as wild in 2004-2013 in total4). Rafetus euphraticus is a little known species from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. It is reported to now be rare in Turkey, but has been reported as very abundant in marshes in Iraq. Habitat in Iraq had been reduced by draining but some has now been restored. Habitat degradation, pollution and killing by fishermen have been identified as factors affecting the species. It is not harvested for meat but parts of it are reportedly consumed for medicinal purposes in some of its range. There is no evidence of international trade.

The species has a relatively wide distribution in the east and northeast of Madagascar. The precise limits of the range are uncertain, in part because of possible confusion with the very similar D. guineti. Although there is no overall population estimate, one expert has noted that based on a mark-recapture study in part of the range, and the life history characteristics of the species, it is reasonable to presume that populations may reach hundreds of thousands individuals1. In 2008 it was said to be locally abundant, especially in and around Maroantsetra2 and in the Ambatovaky Special Reserve region. Urban expansion is taking place in parts of the range, notably around Maroantsetra and this may be leading to some reduction in population3. However, the species is said to be adaptable, and has been recorded in urban areas and other altered habitats. It breeds several times per year after rainfalls, and lays 1000-15,000 eggs. Dyscophus antongilii was included in CITES Appendix I in 1987 as it was harvested for the international pet trade and believed at the time to have a restricted range4. The CITES Trade Database includes a small amount of exports from Madagascar between 2000 and 2007, including 75 live frogs, and 400 specimens for scientific purposes.

However, a seizure in Malaysia in 2010 of 47 D. antongilii of Madagascan origin indicates demand for the species continues5. The similar species D. guineti and D. insularis are traded in some volume (see analysis for Prop. 38). Dyscophus antongilii is currently listed as a protected species in Madagascar (Category I Class I Decree 2006-400) which means harvest is only allowed for scientific purposes6. Under domestic legislation, a transfer to Class II, which would allow for some harvest for commercial purposes outside of protected areas, would necessitate additional studies including population inventories6. Current the population is not actively monitored nor is it the subject of specific management measures. The Supporting Statement notes that the Madagascar Scientific Authority will recommend conservative quotas for commercial collecting, but does not provide any detail on any proposed export quota. All Madagascan amphibian species currently included in Appendix II are subject to conservative export quotas7. Dyscophus antongilii is classified in the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened (2008). Analysis: Dyscophus antongilii does not have a restricted range nor a small population. There are no indications that the population is undergoing a marked decline. The species does not therefore appear to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. The precautionary measures in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) should be met. A conservative collection quota is proposed, only to be permitted once population inventories have taken place. Currently other Appendix-II listed Madagascan amphibian species are exported under similar measures. Export of these other species has been closely scrutinised by Parties, and has been agreed to demonstrate compliance with Article IV of the Convention8 and therefore one would expect trade of this species, if transferred to Appendix II to comply with Article IV as well. Inclusion in Appendix II of the similar Dyscophus guineti and D. insularis, as proposed by Madagascar in Prop. 38, would help ensure enforcement controls for this species were effective.

The third species, D. antongilii was included in Appendix I in 1987. It is subject to a separate proposal to be transferred from Appendix I to Appendix II (Proposal 37). All three are attractive red-orange coloured frogs. Dyscophus are known to breed explosively with the availability of water during the rainy season (typically January-March) and during that time they can be found in abundance at breeding sites. Hundreds of eggs are laid in water following mating. Dyscophus guineti The known distribution of D. guineti includes a number of patches in the remnant central eastern rainforest of Madagascar. The species is secretive and believed likely to be more widespread than records indicate1. Overall population is unknown; locally the species can vary from extremely common to very rare1. Sexual maturity is attained between two and four years, comparatively earlier in males than in females2. The habitat of the species is affected by conversion of forest to agriculture, timber extraction, charcoal production and potentially small-scale mining activities. The species reportedly does not tolerate severe degredation1. There is not known to be local use of the species. As a consequence of the Appendix-I listing in 1987 of the similar Dyscophus antongilii, collectors interested in \"red Dyscophus\" have shifted their attention to D. guineti which is now collected for export3.

Madagascan export data indicate an increase in numbers exported and number of importing countries in recent years, from ca. 150 exported to three countries in 2013 to 2400 exported to 11 countries in in 2015. In recent years the USA has reported the export of significant numbers of captive-bred individuals5. There is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of harvest for trade on D. guineti. The species is reported mainly to be harvested in one area (around Fierenana). Populations there have been said to have been affected by harvest3, although the view has also been expressed that levels of harvest, at least in 2008, were too low to have a serious impact on populations1. The species is classified in the IUCN Red List as Least Concern (2016). Dyscophus insularis This species has a wide distribution throughout western Madagascar, from Ambanja to south of Toliara. It has been suggested that this species could in fact be multiple species based on the wide range of habitats it occupies and the obvious geographic variation in morphology and colour4. No quantitative information on the population size in the wild could be found, but it is reported to be a common species4 and is said to be quite locally abundant3. The species is likely to be affected by loss of habitat, although quantitative data are lacking. According to data from Madagascar, exports of D. insularis have increased in recent years, as is the number of importing countries. In 2012, Madagascar did not record any exports, whereas in 2015 this had increased to 720 frogs exported to six countries. The USA reported importing 4,503 wild D. insularis from Madagascar between 2004 and 2013; exports were generally higher at the beginning of this period but have risen again somewhat in recent years5. As with D. guineti, the USA has been reporting the export of significant numbers of captive-bred individuals in recent years. International trade levels are not thought to constitute a major factor affecting the species4. The species is classified in the IUCN Red List as Least Concern (2016). 77 CoP17 Prop. 38 Both species are protected under national legislation (Decree 2006-400) which allows harvest outside of protected areas with authorisation. Both species, particularly Dyscophus guineti, resemble D. antongili3, 6. Analysis: Dyscophus guineti Dyscophus guineti has a wide distribution, and although the population size and trend are not known, it is reported to be at least locally abundant. Recorded levels of trade for the international pet market are relatively low, although have been reported as increasing recently. Individuals captive-bred outside the range State appear to meet at least some of the demand for the species. A possible decline has been reported from the main collection site but this is likely to represent only a small part of the range of the species. It seems unlikely that the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2 a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). Dyscophus insularis Dyscophus insularis has a wide distribution and although the population size is not known, it is said to be common. As with D. guineti recorded levels of trade for the international pet market are relatively low, although have been reported as increasing recently. Individuals captive-bred outside the range State appear to meet at least some of the demand for the species. It seems unlikely that the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2 a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). Both species, particularly D. guineti, resemble D. antongilii which is already listed in the Appendices, and therefore both species meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II under Annex 2 b of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) (lookalike criteria).

One species, S. gottlebei, was listed in Appendix II in 2003. All three now proposed are green-brown in colour with attractive patterning. All species of the genus are assumed to be explosive breeders that only reproduce once per rainy season after the first heavy rains1. They spend much of their time underground. Because of their attractive colouration there is some demand in the international pet trade for these species. However, their burrowing habits likely limit the extent of this demand, their appeal being confined mainly to specialist hobbyists2. There is no known local use for any of the species. Scaphiophryne boribory was described in 2003 from the Fierenana region of eastern Madagascar. Its distribution is more extensive than had previously been thought, the species currently also being known from Bemanevika forest and Marotondrano Special Reserve3. It has been reported to be locally common but is presumed to be in decline because of loss and degradation of habitat through conversion of land to agriculture and, locally, mining activities. The species was classified in the IUCN Red List as Endangered (2008), in part due to its limited known distribution at the time4. There is very limited known trade in the species, which is reported to be collected for export around Fierenana and Marotondrano. No imports into the USA are recorded in USA trade data for 2004 to 2013. Madagascan export data for the period 2014 to 2015 record export of 40 to Japan in 2015. Scaphiophryne marmorata occurs in east central Madagascar from Zahamena south to the region of Andasibe. It has an extent of occurrence of around 15,000km2. Population size is unknown. The species has been reported to be locally abundant, but the overall population is presumed to be declining as a result of loss and degradation of habitat. The species was classified in the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable (2016). Reported trade is limited, though higher than that for the other two species in the proposal. The USA reported importing 2387 live S. marmorata from Madagascar between 2004 and 2013 all of which were wild. Annual imports at the beginning of this time period were higher (ca.740 between 2004 and 2005, compared with ca. 115 between 2006 and 2013). Madagascan export data indicate export of 245 in 2015 to five different countries. Scaphiophryne spinosa has a wide distribution in eastern Madagascar from Masoala south to the Chaines Anosyennes in the far south5. There are no population estimates. The species can reportedly tolerate some habitat modification and it is not regarded as under threat at present. It was classified in the IUCN Red List as Least Concern (2016). Very limited trade has been reported in this species. USA trade data for 2004 to 2013 indicate that the USA imported 41 live individuals from Madagascar in 2008. Madagascan export data for 2012 to 2015 records export of 180 to five countries in 2015. Scaphiophryne spinosa was split from S. marmorata in 2002; the ranges of the two species overlap and they are reportedly still sometimes confused in trade6.

Local estimates of population density have also varied greatly. One estimate in a sampled area in one part of Lake Titicaca calculated 0.57 adults and 1.63 frogs per m2 2. Most frogs were encountered at two to three metres depth, but the study did not assess occurrence below five metres. Another study3 found densities on the Bolivian side of the lake of 1.14 individuals per 100 m2 in the Minor Lake and 2.05 in 100 m2 in the Major Lake.

It was concluded that T. culeus was no longer present over an area of 500km2 following one such event in April and May 20155. \u201cChytrid fungus\u201d and ranavirus have been detected in the population, but there is no information on their impact. Virtually all information on potential impacts on the species comes from the Minor Lake. The largest city in the lake\u2019s catchment (El Alto, Bolivia) is in this part of the Lake, which is believed to be most affected by anthropogenic influences. The majority of the lake\u2019s water, notably in the Major Lake, is still clean.6 Despite harvest being prohibited, the species is known to be used nationally in both Bolivia and Peru; it is often made into a soup or blended into a juice believed to have medicinal and aphrodisiac properties. Frogs legs are served as an exotic dish, mainly for tourists. It appears that the bulk of harvest (estimated at around 55,000 a year) is for local consumption although there have been reports that harvest on the Bolivian side of the lake is occurring for use in the markets in Lima, Peru4, 7. Evidence for international trade other than the possible transboundary trade mentioned above is extremely limited. There have reportedly been two instances, in 2009 and 2016, of very small numbers of live individuals intercepted in Ecuador, reportedly en route to Europe. In Germany, one of the major countries in Europe where amphibians are kept, it is not known to be held in any private collections, nor is it held in any European zoo8, 9. Evidence for export of the species for food in inconclusive. Data from the UN Comtrade Database reported one record of an import of 33,700kg of frogs\u2019 legs (HS code 020802) from Peru into France in 2002 but it is not possible to determine the species involved; and there is no indication that it was T. culeus. This species is classified in the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered (2004; needs updating). Analysis: Telmatobius culeus does not have a restricted range. Estimates of its overall population vary widely, but the species clearly does not have a small population. There are indications of declines, some marked, in parts of Lake Titicaca, the lake which comprises the great majority of its range. All such information relates to the Minor Lake, which comprises around one quarter of the area of Lake Titicaca. There is no information on population trends in the Major Lake or the other water bodies where the species occurs, although anthropogenic impacts are lower in the Major Lake than in the Minor Lake. There are indications of some transboundary trade between Bolivia and Peru, but indication of any other international trade is extremely limited. There is, overall, insufficient information to determine whether the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. 81 CoP17 Prop. 40 Reviewers of summary information only: R. Melisch.

Breeding is seasonal, females producing ca. 120 eggs per year. Maturity is reached in three to five years. Available information suggests that the species may be relatively abundant in at least parts of its range. Monitoring at seven breeding pools in Hong Kong (SAR) between 2007 and 2014 indicated the population in these was generally stable. Much of the population in Hong Kong (SAR) is within protected areas and it is considered that these populations are generally stable1. Populations in Hong Kong (SAR) are believed likely to be larger than those in mainland China2. The species is reported to be affected by habitat alteration, stream channelization and water pollution. It has also been collected for both domestic use and export, in both cases as a pet and in research institutions. Paramesotriton species were frequently recorded in a pet market survey in Guangdong Province in 2006 to 2008 and there were reports of large numbers appearing at interior pet markets in large cities in mainland China in the early 1990s. However, it is likely that these reports represent other as then-undescribed species of Paramesotriton1. Trade data indicate that an average of around 40,000 P. hongkongensis per year were imported into the USA between 2004 and 20133. Imports increased from 2006 to 2010, before dropping considerably in 2013. Import of all Asian Caudata (newts and salamanders) into the USA has now been suspended because of concerns over disease4, 5. There are no European Union trade records of this species despite it having been listed in Annex D of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2009. It is likely that the species has been confused with other Paramesotriton species or with species of Cynops, Hyselotriton or Pachytriton in trade. It has been imported into the USA under the generic names Paramesotriton, Triturus and Trituroides. The species has been included in legislation in Hong Kong (SAR) since 1997 and in China since 2000; collection in both requires approval from competent departments and is not permitted in protected areas. An increasing proportion of the trade into the USA has been reported as in captive-bred individuals3; however large scale captive-breeding for commercial purposes in Hong Kong (SAR) is not known and is believed unlikely to be economically viable as the species is of relatively low value2. The species has been successfully bred in captivity by hobbyists in Hong Kong (SAR)2, in Europe and the USA. Whilst it does appear possible to distinguish P. hongkongensis from other similar species based on morphological characteristics, non-professional identification may be difficult. This species was classified in the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened (2004 \u2013 in need of updating). Analysis: Paramesotriton hongkongensis has a reasonably large area of distribution, within which much of the population is reported to be in protected areas and apparently stable, at least in Hong Kong (SAR). It has been collected in the past in some numbers for domestic use and export as a pet and laboratory animal; the impact of such collection is unclear. The only country known to have imported significant numbers is the USA, which has currently suspended import of all Asian Caudata, therefore it seems unlikely that the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II.

Their productivity is generally assessed as low. Overall population size is unknown and nearly all estimates of changes in population size are derived from fisheries data. Interpretation of such data is difficult, as landings are rarely reported at individual species level, there is a general lack of information on sizes, weights and numbers of individuals caught, and changes in management and reporting make analyses of time series data, particularly those covering long periods, challenging. Where declines are observed these are ascribed to fisheries-induced mortality. The Silky Shark is taken in very large numbers mainly as incidental catch from longline tuna fisheries but also in purse seine fisheries and in some targeted shark fisheries. There are not known to be any major unexploited populations. Catch and landings of Silky Shark are believed to be underreported. According to FAO data, Iran, Sri Lanka, Taiwan (Province of China), Ecuador and Costa Rica have been the main harvesters of Silky Sharks in recent years with total catch reported by those at around 7500t in 2010 declining to just under 5000t in 2014. Silky Sharks may be used for meat, particularly in Oman and Taiwan (POC), and to a lesser extent for skin, liver oil, cartilage and teeth. The principal part in trade is the fin, in demand in East Asia, particularly China. An assessment based on 2000 data estimated that at that time a minimum of 500,000 to 1.5 million Silky Sharks were used annually for their fins; this being an estimated 5% or so of shark fins in trade at that time3. An assessment in 2014 using different methods found the species to be the second most important (by weight) in the world\u2019s largest shark fin market in Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region), accounting for ca. 5% of the total weight in the sample; absolute amounts in trade were not assessed4. Numerous declines in catches and in stocks, some widespread, have been reported. In the western and central Pacific, according to one estimate made in 2013, stocks had declined to 30% of theoretical equilibrium unexploited biomass; exploitation at that time was estimated at 4.5 times greater than a sustainable level. Recent analysis of Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE) data for the region found high fluctuations from which it was not possible to determine a trend5. Analysis of the most recent available information from the Eastern Pacific indicates a decline in CPUE of 77% in the southern stock based on comparison of 1994 to 1996 data with that for 2004 to 2013; data for 2014 to 2015 showed a slight increase in CPUE. Data for the northern stock indicated an overall 37% decline in catch rates in floating object sets for the period 1994 to 20155. Data from the Indian Ocean are sparse. The reported annual catch in Sri Lanka declined from an average of ca. 20,000t in 1997 to 2000, to below 5000t from 2005 onwards, and ca. 3500t in 2012 to 2014. Changes in fishing effort are not reported. Fishers in the Maldives report declines of 50 to 90% in landings of the species over the past 20 years. In the North Atlantic, one study in 2007 found a 50% decline in CPUE in longline fisheries between 1986 and 2005; the same study reported a 46% decline between 1992 and 2005 in longline fisheries based on observer data. Analysis of catches in the Gulf of Mexico from the 1950s to the 2000s shows a decrease in average size of Silky Sharks landed from ca. 100kg to 23kg. Declines in mean size and increasing proportion of juveniles have also been reported in Costa Rica and the southeast USA. Total fishery-induced shark mortality caught in Indian Ocean purse seines was ca. 80% in 2011 to 2012, with about half of live discards from purse seines suffering delayed mortality. Pelagic longline fisheries off the 85 CoP17 Prop. 42 southeast coast of the USA reported 26% of Silky Sharks caught were released alive (with 44% discarded dead and 30% retained), although post release survival is not known. Silky Sharks are protected under national legislation in over 10 countries and shark finning bans are implemented by 21 countries, the European Union (EU), and nine Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), which could help reduce Silky Shark mortality, if they cause a larger proportion of the catch to be released alive.

Fisheries management for this species on the high seas falls under the remit of the tuna RFMOs. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) prohibit retaining on board, trans-shipping, or landing any part or whole carcass of Silky Shark in the fisheries covered by these Conventions. However, there are concerns that there is little or no compliance monitoring of these measures in place. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) recognises the depleting stock status of Silky Sharks in the Indian Ocean, however it has not adopted a management measure to date. The species was classified by IUCN as Near Threatened in 2009. In the shark fin trade, Silky Sharks are labelled as Wu Yang. A 2006 study found that 80% of samples labelled Wu Yang came from Silky Sharks, the remainder were from a variety of other species, including some that could not be identified6. Analysis: The Silky Shark is a low productivity species with a global distribution in coastal and oceanic water. It is widely caught, chiefly as incidental take in longline tuna fisheries. Retention of catch is chiefly to supply the trade in shark fins, particularly in East Asia. There is evidence of declines, some marked, in much of the range. Such declines are attributed to overharvest. Information is sparse for the Indian Ocean, although there are localised reports of declines in catches here. Longline tuna fisheries are widespread in the Indian Ocean and there is no reason to believe that these do not have a similar impact on the Silky Shark population here as observed elsewhere in its range. There are not known to be any major unexploited populations. It would appear therefore that the Silky Shark meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2 a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16), in that regulation of harvest for trade is required to ensure that the species is not reducing the population to a level at which it becomes threatened.

They are characterised by very long upper lobes of their caudal (tail) fins. There are three species: the Bigeye Thresher Alopias superciliosus, Common Thresher A. vulpinus and Pelagic Thresher A. pelagicus. They occur in surface temperatures of 16 to 25\u00b0C, but have been tracked as deep as 723m where temperatures are around 5\u00b0C1. They have overlapping distributions. Common Threshers are recorded circumglobally and have a noted tolerance for cold waters; highest concentrations tend to occur in coastal temperate waters. The Bigeye Thresher is also circumglobal but is generally found at low latitudes and, in the Pacific at least, in pelagic rather than onshore areas. The Pelagic Thresher is the least known of the three species.

The Bigeye Thresher reaches a maximum length of ca. 4.6m. Age at maturity is estimated at eight to 15 years for females and seven to 13 years for males. Lifespan is estimated at 20 to 21 years. Litters are small (two). Gestation is estimated at 12 months2. The species has extremely low productivity. The Common Thresher is the largest species, reaching nearly six metres in total length (including the tail). Historical and recent unconfirmed records indicate even greater total length. A recent study indicates longevity may be greater than previously thought, reaching at least 38 years3. Average age at maturity is estimated at five years. Litter sizes are typically small (two to seven) and may vary geographically3. Gestation is around nine months. The Pelagic Thresher may reach nearly four metres in length. Maximum reported age is 29 years. Maturity is reached at 2.6-2.9m in length; litter size is two4. The species is reported to have lower productivity than the Common Thresher.8 Overall population size of any of the species is unknown and nearly all estimates of changes in population size are derived from fisheries data. Interpretation of such data is difficult, as landings are rarely reported at individual species level, there is a general lack of information on sizes, weights and numbers of individuals caught, and changes in management and reporting make analyses of time series data, particularly those covering long periods, challenging. Where declines are observed these are ascribed to fisheries-induced mortality. Bigeye and Common Thresher have recently been the subject of a detailed review undertaken by the US National Marine Fisheries Service (US NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Service3. This contains information and analysis that in many cases supersedes information, particularly on estimated declines, that is included in the Supporting Statement of the proposal. Much of the information in this analysis is drawn from the US NMFS review. Thresher sharks are taken as incidental and target species in many coastal and oceanic pelagic fisheries where they occur. They are primarily caught in longline fisheries, but are also caught with anchored bottom and surface gill nets, and accidently caught in bottom trawls and fish traps. Directed fisheries and retention of incidental catch are driven by demand for meat (in the case of Common and Pelagic Threshers) and fins. Meat is generally consumed locally (although any catch from international waters would be considered trade, as introduction from the sea, under CITES) while fins enter international trade, being chiefly destined for East Asia, particularly China. Bigeye Thresher meat is reported not to be widely eaten3. Thresher shark catches in general are considered underreported globally3. FAO catch data indicate harvest of 183,000t of threshers between 1999 and 2014. Total reported catches increased greatly from 3400mt in 2004 to ca. 12,000mt to 2005 (most likely due to changes in reporting practices5), and peaked in 2011 at ca. 22,000mt decreasing marginally to ca. 19,000mt in 2014. Indonesia, Ecuador, Sri Lanka and the USA have reported the highest level of catch. Almost all (ca. 85%) catch data are reported as Alopias spp although some have been reported at the species level: ca. 3000mt as Bigeye Thresher, ca. 6000mt as Common Threshers and ca. 20,000mt as Pelagic Threshers, this last all reported by Ecuador for the Southeast Pacific6. The majority of reported catch has been in the Pacific (68%) followed by the Indian Ocean (29%); reported catches in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea are negligible in comparison. 87 CoP17 Prop. 43 Information for the Indian Ocean is patchy. Data from the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) database record an increase in catch in Common Thresher in the late 1990s, reaching a peak of just under 1000mt in 1999 and then declining. Reported catches of Bigeye Thresher have increased recently from negligible levels to ca. 200mt in 2002. Most catch is reported in thresher shark complex; this has risen from ca. 1000mt in 1990 to ca. 5000mt in 20123.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74cf9bed-0106-48e1-9a83-e697233c9a5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "74cf9bed-0106-48e1-9a83-e697233c9a5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1410e7b2ad9e790caf6e1d5316ea6ae649d32b9e08389975940128081de2e4b"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c662f35-6745-47c7-bdfc-953e9e404863", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5a704de1baadbfff6cb3785a41050806a551b02a262370702d7d3a0b9a26c13"}}, "hash": "4e2a03a0aba037b263ac992c5f0a5ac4a826667386c6e560ccdedde0f6db6c07", "text": "1000mt in 1990 to ca. 5000mt in 20123.

In the southern part of the Eastern Pacific, reported catch from Ecuador is of Pelagic Threshers (see above). Catch in the largest shark fishery (Peru) also appears to comprise very largely of Pelagic Threshers. Shark landings in Peru have declined by roughly 3% per year for 2000 to 2010 despite an increase in the size of the fishery but trends in catch in threshers are unclear3. Bigeye Thresher are known to be taken as incidental catch in purse-seine and longline fisheries in the Eastern Pacific but generally comprise a small proportion of overall shark catch. There is no information on CPUE trends for the species in this fishery3. In the Western and Central Pacific there is generally a paucity of species-specific information, although the Bigeye Thresher is believed to be the predominant thresher species in offshore areas here. Species-specific observer information indicates that the Bigeye Thresher may be stable or possibly increasing in the area in which the Hawaiian longline fishery operates. A 2015 analysis of standardised CPUE in the wider Western and Central Pacific (which did not include data from the Hawaiian fishery) using aggregated data for all three species indicated a relatively shallow decline between 2003 and 2011 and a much steeper decline from 2011 to 2014, although information for 2014 was based on few data points3. Pelagic Thresher are caught in Taiwan POC longline fisheries. An analysis of spawner per recruit for the species in eastern Taiwanese waters for 1990-2004 suggested that the stock was slightly overexploited at that time.8 In the South Atlantic most thresher catch is of the Bigeye Thresher. CPUE of the species in the Uruguayan longline fishery is low, although data available only cover a short time period from which it is not possible to discern trends. In the Brazilian longline fishery, slight declines in CPUE were observed up to 2006, at which point the species disappeared from the fishery, although this is believed likely a result of the fishery moving to more temperate latitudes not favoured by the species rather than reflecting actual population changes3. In the Northwest and Central Atlantic abundance trend estimates derived from standardized catch rate indices of the USA pelagic longline fishery suggest that both Common and Bigeye Threshers have likely undergone historical declines in abundance. Standardised abundance indices derived from observer data indicate that populations of both these species may have stabilised since 19903. In the Mediterranean, Bigeye Thresher are considered scarce. Very severe declines in stocks of Common Thresher here (perhaps as much as 99%) have been documented, ascribed to fishing mortality3. The proportion of threshers landed live globally is not known. One study in the Pacific Islands Countries and Territories in the Western and Central Pacific found that roughly half of landed Bigeye Threshers landed were dead or judged unlikely to survive after release. The quantity of thresher shark fins identified in Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region) fin markets in the early 2000s equated to between 350,000 and 3.9 million individual thresher sharks, or a biomass of 12,000 to 85,000mt being killed and traded per year. This comprised roughly 2.3% of the estimated global shark fin trade. Much of this trade goes through Hong Kong (SAR), where thresher shark fins are traded as \u201cwu gu\u201d ; the majority of fins in this category are from threshers although some mixing with Longfin Mako Isurus paucus has been documented9. In a 2014 study, threshers made up a very small proportion (0.1%) of shark fin samples analysed10. Although there has been a reported decline in shark fin trade and consumption generally in recent years11 debate remains regarding the causes, which may include increased regulation of catches, declining stocks and catch per unit effort or falling consumer demand. 88 CoP17 Prop. 43 All three species of Thresher Shark were classified in the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable (2009).

Where population declines have been identified, these are invariably ascribed to fishing pressure. The Bigeye Thresher has extremely low productivity. There are indications of historic declines in the Northwest Atlantic, where populations may have stabilised at a low level. Reported catch rates in the South Atlantic are low. In the West and Central Pacific, where the species occurs widely, there are indications from 2003 onward of decline in threshers in general, which may be accelerating; however, information from one extensive fishery (the Hawaiian longline fishery) indicated stability of the Bigeye Thresher population in the region covered by the fishery. Reported catch of threshers in the Indian Ocean has increased and it is believed that unreported catch (of all threshers) may be many times that of reported catch but there are no stock assessments or analyses of changes in CPUE. The Common Thresher has low productivity. There are indications of extremely marked declines in the Mediterranean that are believed to be of this species, and of historic declines in the Northwest Atlantic, where populations may have stabilised at a low level. In the Northeast Pacific, Common Threshers underwent a decline in the 1980s and 1990s but populations appear to have recovered here because of improved management. The Pelagic Thresher has very low productivity. It is known to be taken in large numbers in the Eastern Pacific and to be harvested in the Indian Ocean and West and Central Pacific but there is very little species- specific information on stocks or changes in CPUE. Given known intensity of fishing pressure in much of the range of all three species and their low productivity (particularly the Bigeye Thresher) it is likely fisheries in a number of areas are unsustainable. In others, thresher stocks may be relatively stable, but in at least some of these populations are very likely to be at significantly lower than historic levels. Overall it is unclear for any of the species whether this level of decline would satisfy the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2 a Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). If any of the species were listed in Appendix II, the others in the genus would meet the criteria in Annex 2 b (lookalike criteria). Reviewers of summary information only: S. Clarke, G. Sant, T.

The genus is widely distributed in temperate and tropical seas. Different species may be confused with each other and precise distributions in most cases are poorly known. All are believed to have very low productivity. Females give birth to a single live young following a gestation period of around one year and are thought often to undergo protracted periods, perhaps two or three years, between pregnancies. All species are believed to be largely epipelagic (i.e. occur mainly in surface waters) although some also dive deep1. The three largest species are Mobula japanica, M. mobular and M. tarapacana; of these, M. japanica and M. tarapacana are the most widespread and feature most prominently in fisheries. Mobula japanica is circumglobal in temperate and tropical seas, but its distribution is not completely defined. The species is usually encountered as solitary individuals but has also been recorded travelling in schools and tagged individuals have been monitored travelling long distances. In parts of the range populations appear to make regular migratory movements and form seasonal aggregations. Elsewhere the species is recorded year-round. M. japanica grows to a maximum of 310cm DW, and age at maturity has been estimated at five to six years (ca. 210cm DW). Generation time has been estimated at approximately 10 years. Pupping may take place offshore, around seamounts or islands. Population size and structure are unknown. The species was classified by IUCN as Near Threatened in 2006. Mobula tarapacana has a circumglobal range in temperate, subtropical and tropical waters of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, however is patchily distributed within this range. It is primarily oceanic but is also found in coastal waters1. As with M. japanica, individuals are known to migrate long-distances and at least some populations make seasonal movements and form regular aggregations. Maximum verified size is 314cm DW. Estimated age of maturity is five to six years, minimum life span is 14 years, and generation length has been inferred at approximately 10 year1. Population size and structure are unknown. The species was classified as Vulnerable by IUCN in 2016. Mobula mobular is confined to the Mediterranean and possibly adjacent North Atlantic, although it is believed that records here may be of M. japanica with which it is easily confused. It appears to occur at low densities, generally as solitary individuals or in groups of two to four, although larger seasonal aggregations are known. The species may reach over 5m DW and generation time has been estimated at 20 years. Recent aerial surveys estimated a population in the south central Adriatic of ca. 1600 individuals (coefficient of variation, CV, 25%), and of >12,700 individuals in the north western Mediterranean (CV 53%)2. The species was classified as Endangered by IUCN in 2015, and a Mediterranean regional assessment classified this population as Endangered in 2016. Mobula thurstoni is probably circumglobal in all temperate and tropical seas, but its distribution is not completely defined. It is usually found in pelagic, but shallow waters (<100m), reaches a maximum DW of 180cm and maturity at 150cm DW. The species was classified as Near Threatened in 2016 by IUCN. Mobula eregoodootenkee is locally common within its wide tropical Indo-west Pacific and northern Indian Ocean distribution, with a DW up to 100cm3. The species was classified in 2003 as Near Threatened. Mobula hypostoma is endemic to the western Atlantic, found from North Carolina (USA) to northern Argentina, including the Gulf of Mexico, and Greater and Lesser Antilles. It has a DW up to 120cm and occurs primarily in coastal waters, although it occasionally enters oceanic waters4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0b5e929-074d-4bdf-ae64-2e34804ab204": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0b5e929-074d-4bdf-ae64-2e34804ab204", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d071e3350c489252a43932f3c23d89f46ba2ac3860bbf5a5c66c20ff2029fbc9"}, "2": {"node_id": "291a314d-3c72-4634-8212-63a179df5492", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df505a9b2595a6099c7cabfebcf3559b0cdc47979c46193028c15de90f122744"}}, "hash": "c3168af80bb9fbd367f95916eab4b6cd1a1c75fdc8339e7cbd17d240dca1e4bc", "text": "The species was classified as Data Deficient in 2009 by IUCN.

It reaches 110cm DW; females mature at 97cm DW and males at ~87cm DW. It is known to form large aggregations6. The species was assessed as Near Threatened in 2006 by IUCN. Mobula rochebrunei has a status that is still uncertain7, although from currently available information is believed to be found in the eastern Atlantic from Mauritania to Angola and from two possible records off Brazil in the Southwest Atlantic, where it is probably rare. It is known to form large aggregations; maximum size is 133cm DW8. IUCN classified M. rochebrunei as Vulnerable in 2009. Mobula species are closely related and similar to, though generally smaller than, Manta Rays Manta species which were included in CITES Appendix II at CoP16 (2013). Collectively the two genera are often referred to as mobulids. Most catch and trade data do not distinguish the two. Mobula species may be affected by various factors such as climate change, pollution and ingestion of marine debris but by far the most important impact on populations is believed to come from targeted and incidental catch in both artisanal and large-scale fisheries. Studies of the small-scale artisanal Mexican fishery (which ceased in 2007) concluded that fishing rates were twice as high as their estimate of maximum intrinsic rate of population increase9. The meat is generally not highly sought after although some artisanal fisheries do target Mobula species for food and local products. In the past individuals caught incidentally were often discarded or released. The principal driver for directed fisheries and retention of incidental catch is the international market for gill plates, demand for which has increased greatly in recent years in Asia. This has led to Mobula species being increasingly targeted and retained. A 2015 review identified 13 fisheries (mostly artisanal) in 12 countries that specifically targeted Mobula species and 30 fisheries in 23 countries that incidentally caught them. They were reported as incidental catch in nine large-scale fisheries in 11 countries using driftnets, trawls and purse seines, and in 21 small-scale fisheries in 15 countries using driftnets, gillnets, traps, trawls and longlines10. Five countries - Sri Lanka, India, Peru, Indonesia and China (the latter fishing in international waters) \u2013 are between them believed to account for the great majority, perhaps as much as 95%, of worldwide Mobula catch. There are examples of evolving/new Mobula fisheries in response to demands for gill plates for East Asian markets such as a new mechanized gillnet \ufb01shery formed in India in 2005 and offshore gillnet fishing in Myanmar, which started in 2014. Individual fisheries generally catch more than one Mobula species, complicating analysis. There is a single-species targeted fishery for M. mobular in the eastern Mediterranean - these are used for meat; gill plate export from the region is not confirmed11. FAO catch data do not distinguish between catch of Manta and Mobula, and are apparently incomplete. FAO fisheries data reported in the \u201cmanta/devil ray\u201d category, is restricted mainly to Indonesia (24,059t reported between 2004 and 2013) and Liberia (3651t between 1998 and 2006, with no reported landings since then). Other countries report very small quantities in this specific category, but they may be reporting large quantities under \u201crays, stingrays, manta nei (not elsewhere included)\u201d. There is, however no way of establishing the proportion of Mobula species within these more general categories. Total reported catches of \u201cmanta/devil rays\u201d increased from 342t in 1998 to 931t in 2000, decreasing to around 100t per year between 2001 and 2003, and increasing again to over 4000t in 2008 and 6000t in 2013. Mobula japanica and M. tarapacana are both known to be targeted and landed in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, and previously Mexico. M. japanica is also landed in China, Taiwan (Province of China), India, Myanmar and Oman and M. tarapacana in Senegal.

M. rochebrunei is said to be the predominant species in mobulid catches in Guinean catches at three survey sites. Population trend information for all Mobula species is restricted to population declines inferred from landing data/observations, market surveys and community interviews from a few specific fishing areas, and gill plate markets in East Asia. At Cocos Island (eastern Pacific, Costa Rica), a 78% decline in Mobula species was 92 CoP17 Prop. 44 estimated from diver surveys (who reported that M. tarapacana is generally the species sighted in the area) over 21 years13. In Sri Lanka, the overall decline in catch landings of Mobula species was 51% over three years14. Despite an increase in fishing effort, recent declines in M. japanica and M. tarapacana landings between 2001/2002 and 2014 of between 50 and 99% have been reported in three different regions of Indonesia. Reported landings of Mobula species in Guinea declined by 60% between 2004 and 2008 despite reported increase in fishing effort; landings of Mobula species at Tumbes, Peru, declined by 90% between 1999 and 2013; landings would have included both M. japanica and M. thurstoni and to a lesser extent M. tarapacana. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) catch and bycatch data for Mobula from purse seine fisheries in the eastern Pacific between 1998 and 2009 show a significant increase from <1t in 1998 to >80t in 2006, and a subsequent decline over three years until 2009, when the reported catch was 40t15. Mobulid gill plates, used medicinally, are commonly sold under the trade names \u201cPeng Yu Sai\u201d (translated as \u201cFish Gills\u201d). Three types of gill plates have been identified; 1) Manta species 2) M. tarapacana specifically referred to as \u201cFlower Gills\u201d (white or bi-coloured gills) and 3) smaller gill plates of M. japanica (black gill plates), M. thurstoni and possibly other mobula species. Based on gill plate market surveys, the total estimated global market for Mobulids tripled between 2011 and 2013, from ca. 48,000 individuals to ca. 130,000 individuals. Of this around 4500 per year were Manta species and the remainder Mobula. In 2013 the global mobulid market was estimated to comprise 110,000 (83%) M. japanica and other \u2018black gill\u2019 Mobula species, 17,000 (13%) M. tarapacana, and 5,000 (4%) Manta species. Plates of M. tarapacana and M. japanica are said to be the most important Mobula products in international trade, with the largest plates selling for a few hundred USD per kilo16. It can be difficult to distinguish visually between the dried gill plates of small Manta and large M. japanica, and dried gill plates from M. japanica are very similar in size and appearance to M. thurstoni, and M. kuhlii. Gill plates of M. tarapacana are bi-coloured and resemble those of some M. thurstoni and M. hypostoma. Several countries prohibit harvest of all Mobula species, but globally there is little or no protection for most coastal and high seas habitats. There have been no stock assessments, monitoring, or management of Mobula fisheries in the range States with the largest fisheries. All species of Mobula were recently listed in Appendices I and II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and in July 2015 the IATTC passed a resolution to prohibit retention, unless accidentally captured on purse seine vessels, and mandate safe release of all Mobula species in the RFMO fisheries in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) has also passed a resolution to regulate catch of Mobula species. Publication of a field guide for Mobula and Manta species and increased awareness of the vulnerability of this group of species has reportedly improved data collection in industrial tuna fisheries.

It has a wide distribution in Argentina, Plurinational State of Bolivia (Bolivia), Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Venezuela). There are a number of taxonomic uncertainties surrounding Potamotrygonidae; it is possible that P. motoro may comprise a cluster of different species1, 2, 3. There are also reports of hybridisation between P. motoro and P. falkneri in the wild4. There is limited biological or population information available, but the species is believed to exhibit low fertility (with only the left ovary normally being present and functioning), long gestation periods (six months) and slow growth.

Age at maturity has been estimated at between 18 months and four years2. Information on population size is sparse. P. motoro was the predominant fish species around Maraj\u00f3 Island in the Amazon River in Brazil in 2005 to 2007, making up 50% of all catches; a 2009 study reported that artisanal fishers in Soure, Brazil, indicated that they frequently caught the species1. A 2016 study reported it was the most abundant Potamotrygon species found in a census of the Tomo River in Colombia, with a reported density of 0.3 individuals per 1000m2 5. It was found at low densities in fisheries captures in the Rio Negro of the Orinoco in Colombia6. Only 79 specimens of P. motoro (52 males and 27 females) were found during night-time visual surveys in the dry season in 2010 to 2011 in the Estrella Fluvial de In\u00edrida region in Venezuela and Colombia, where P. motoro was reportedly historically abundant7. Detection rates, however are dependent on a number of factors, including water levels and temperature, and time of the year and day8. Encounter rates by fishers in the Amazon in Peru have reportedly declined in more accessible areas9. The main impacts negatively affecting P. motoro are believed to be commercial and artisanal fisheries for the ornamental fish trade, particularly targeting juveniles. P. motoro is also caught for local consumption/use of its meat, oil and spines and it also may be affected by habitat modification. Catch and trade data for P. motoro exist for Peru, Colombia and Brazil, however there are many uncertainties over the quality of the data, due to identification issues and specimens being traded using their common names, and concerns that numbers may be overestimates3. There are inadequate catch data available in most of the key exporting countries to determine the proportion of total catch destined for domestic and international markets, although in Iquitos, Peru, a high proportion of all rays caught were exported9. From 2000 to 2014 recorded annual exports from Peru averaged 25,000 specimens, with a peak in 2008 of ca. 45,000 specimens, after which annual exports declined again to similar levels as 2000 to 2002 (fewer than 20,000 individuals)10. Between 1999 and 2011 Colombia reported the export of an annual average of ca. 6500, increasing steadily from 1999, with a peak of 20,200 in 20082, after which quantities declined again to below 10,000 specimens in 2010 to 2011. Brazil exported ca. 6000 per year in 2003 to 2005, after which their exports declined greatly, although data are not available for recent years3. Based on USA trade data for 2004 to 2013, imports of Potamotrygon species were reported only from Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Most trade is reported at genus level. This has shown an increase from negligible levels in 2004 to 2008 to over 1500 per year in 2012 to 201311. Some export of freshwater rays in general has been reported from Argentina but at a very low level (ca. 75 per year for 2004 to 2013); no export has been reported from Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay or Venezuela. There is reported to be transborder movement of Potamotrygon species, including P. motoro from Venezuela to Colombia via Puerto Carre\u00f1o and Puerto In\u00edrida3. The principal destinations for exports are Europe, the USA and increasingly East Asia2. The species is offered for sale on the internet12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and appears readily available in the aquarium trade, however the provenance of many of these specimens is unknown. This species is reported to breed easily in captivity, and captive-breeding is known to be occurring in Europe, Southeast Asia and the USA.

Potamotrygon motoro can supposedly be differentiated from other Potamotrygon species by their colour patterns/markings, however these taxonomic uncertainties are problematic for monitoring use and trade in this species. Potamotrygon motoro is classified by IUCN as Data Deficient (2005 \u2013 needs updating), although there may be some confusion with taxonomy in that assessment as a much more limited range is reported8. Analysis: Potamotrygon motoro has a very wide distribution in South America. Information on population status and trends is sparse and variable. It has been reported as abundant in some places and as occurring at low densities in others. There are some indications of declines in some locations. The species is taken in fisheries for local consumption of its meat and export of live specimens for the ornamental fish trade. Three out of eleven range States (Brazil, Colombia and Peru) are known to export the species. Reported export has been of the order of a few tens of thousands of specimens annually. These exporting countries comprise a reasonably large proportion of the overall range of the species, although it is not known how extensive harvest for export in any of the three known exporting range States is, or in general what proportion of the catch in these States is destined for export rather than for local consumption, although it may be significant in Peru. There is overall insufficient information to determine whether this species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II. Reviewers of summary information only: J. Gonz\u00e1lez Sanz, H.

There are also a few introduced populations in a restricted area outside the species natural area of occurrence, which account for a very small proportion of the total1. P. kauderni is a benthic, site-attached species with a generation time estimated at about two years. It exhibits relatively low fecundity, often with reduced fertility, direct development and extended parental care. There is no planktonic phase so dispersal and potential to colonise or re-colonise areas are very limited. Harvesting for international trade is considered by most experts to be the principal factor affecting the species; it is believed to have led to substantial population declines and local extinctions within its natural range. The species is also adversely affected by habitat loss and deterioration through loss of coral cover, primarily as a result of destructive fishing methods, and declines in abundance through harvest of sea urchins, anemones and anemone-like corals on which it is dependent. The extent, if any, to which the species can adapt to severely altered habitats is unknown, but believed likely to be limited. Live individuals for the aquarium market are the only product in trade. The majority are exported to the USA, Europe and Asia. The export fishery started in the mid-1990s, and by 2007 the annual harvest was estimated at some 900,000 fish. There is an estimated mortality rate of 25 to 50% between actual harvest and compilation of trade/import figures. In 2015, holding nets containing thousands of P. kauderni were recorded on several islands, indicating that collection pressure may not have decreased. A new shipping method, with increased use of \u201cpublic\u201d transportation (small and medium size boats, and speed boats) for shipping P. kauderni directly out of the Archipelago, has meant that captures are not being reported to the local (Banggai) fisheries/quarantine office, and assessment of trade volumes and shipping mortality has become more challenging. There have been many studies of this species by different authors, and some areas and populations have been tracked over 15 years with data available for 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2015. The overall consensus is that the population is declining. Information on population levels before exploitation started is lacking. Studies in 2002 and 2004 of a population that was not then exploited estimated it to have a density of ca. 0.6 individuals per m2. Censuses conducted between 2001 and 2004 covering the entire range produced mean densities of between 0.07 to 0.08 fish per m2 and an overall population estimate of 2.4 million fishes, based on 34km2 of suitable habitat. A more restricted survey in 2011 to 2012 found a mean density of 0.05 fishes per m2 indicating overall abundance of around 1.7 million fishes. Seven of the major sites surveyed in 2001 to 2004 and in 2011 to 2012 showed declines in mean density and overall abundance, presumed to be due to over-exploitation. In 2015, no population was found with a density near to 0.6 individuals per m2. At sites where fishing intensity is high, the mean number of groups per census site declined by 27% from 2007, and the mean group size of censused populations in 2015 showed a ca. 40% reduction from the mean size group of 2007. Extirpation of local populations ascribed to exploitation has been documented in several islands. Research suggests that once population densities decline to ca. 0.02 individuals per m2, they may be unable to recover. Temporary local recovery of populations has been recorded at sites where fishing has been stopped, although in two documented cases these populations subsequently collapsed. In Indonesia, a Banggai Cardinalfish Action Plan (BCF-AP) was drawn up for the period 2007 to 2012, and included the establishment of the Banggai Cardinalfish Centre (BCFC) to coordinate conservation and management actions. Trade quotas were proposed by local stakeholders in 2010 but were not continued, mainly due to a lack of legal support. By 2012, there was reportedly still no effective long-term conservation, management or monitoring system in place.

Analysis: Pterapogon kauderni is a marine species with a very restricted range whose biological characteristics make it vulnerable to overexploitation. It has been harvested in large numbers since the mid- 1990s for the international aquarium fish trade, with exploitation continuing. Available evidence indicates that this has led to significant and continuing reductions in population density and overall population size. The species is also affected by habitat loss and degradation. There appears to be no effective long-term management in place. It would appear that the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2 a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) in that regulation of harvest is required to ensure that the wild population does not become threatened through continued harvesting or other influences.

Viewed on 1st July 2016. 99 CoP17 Prop. 47 Inclusion of Clarion Angelfish Holacanthus clarionensis in Appendix II Proponent: Mexico Summary: The Clarion Angelfish Holacanthus clarionensis occurs in the Pacific territorial waters of Mexico, in the Revillagigedo Archipelago and off Baja California Sur, and Clipperton Island (France). It is demersal and is found associated with coral reefs and rocky areas, including drop-offs, to a depth of 30m. It is commonest at around three to five metres depth, particularly around the cleaning stations of mantas (Manta birostris). Maturity is believed to be reached at between 18 and 30 months and life expectancy to be around 10 years. Observed population densities at sites vary seasonally, which may be associated with spawning migrations. A low frequency of juveniles in reef populations indicates that recruitment may take place elsewhere, in shallower or deeper waters. The maximum potential area of occupancy for this species is probably ca. 4000km2 1; the amount of suitable reef within this is smaller, so that actual area of occupancy is probably considerably less than 2000km2. The majority of the population reportedly occurs within less than 50km2 in the Revillagigedo Archipelago, where average population density has been estimated at around one individual per 200m2 in suitable habitat, compared with fewer than one per hectare (10,000m2) found in surveys off Baja California Sur. The population at Revillagigedo has been reported as apparently stable2. Report of a decline in the late 2000s at Cabo Pulmo, Baja California, where the species is generally extremely scarce, is not considered reliable3. In 1997 it was reported as rare at Clipperton Island4. Loss of habitat, and particularly damage to coral reefs, may affect the species, although its range in the Revillagigedo Islands is within a protected area. There is speculation that an increase in duration and frequency of El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events associated with climate change might have an impact on the species2. Clarion Angelfish are very brightly coloured and have appeal in the ornamental fish trade. However, they are aggressive fish which are not suitable for community reef tanks; demand for them has therefore always been limited5. They do, however, command high prices in trade. Domestic trade in Mexico is regarded as negligible. The majority of exports reportedly go to California, USA, although exports to Japan are also known5.

Two genera are recognised Allonautilus and Nautilus. The genus Allonautilus is generally considered to have two species: A. perforatus (known from Indonesia and possibly Papua New Guinea1) and A. scrobiculatus (known from Papua New Guinea and possibly the Solomon Islands1). The number of species in the genus Nautilus ranges from two to 12 according to different authors; the most recent taxonomic work considers that there are two species, Nautilus pompilius and N. macromphalus1. N. pompilius has a wide range, being known from 11 range States and possibly occurring in five others, from India in the west to American Samoa in the east. The Supporting Statement lists four other species: N. macromphalus endemic to New Caledonia and also N. belauensis, N. repertus and N. stenomphalus which are from Palau and Australia and are now considered to be part of N. pompilius. It is thought there may also be other as yet unrecognized but separate species existing as genetically distinct, geographically-and reproductively-isolated populations. Chambered Nautiluses are extreme habitat specialists living in close association with steep-sloped fore reefs and associated silty, muddy or sandy-bottomed substrates, in preferred depths of 150 to 300m and rarely down to 700m. Distribution is patchy and erratic and they may be absent from apparently suitable habitats. They have a relatively narrow temperature range tolerance. Geographic barriers to movement include shallow areas where water temperatures exceed 25\u00b0C and open water areas which Chambered Nautiluses avoid, presumably because they are vulnerable to predation there.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17c2d273-0e14-4d6d-b7f0-3d07c68e85df": {"__data__": {"id_": "17c2d273-0e14-4d6d-b7f0-3d07c68e85df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a054a4dddddbf85d714ce3f5a9fcc82170723d0f37f88a3f90cdd104bc4054a0"}, "2": {"node_id": "babffe85-ddb5-4973-9be1-f6266fa97838", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "479e383027d616be31334c0eca4d5cb5ba2438e556952f957fb39b857a4a1789"}}, "hash": "07b5756327e8fad36d373034517d53f0e85f93fc413b667c0117c2cfcdf7be04", "text": "They are slow-growing, late-maturing (10 to 15 years) and long-lived (at least 20 years), producing one large egg at a time1 that requires a lengthy incubation period (about one year) and lacking a mobile larval stage.

Chambered Nautiluses are the object of targeted fisheries and may also be caught incidentally in other fisheries. Commercial harvesters use fish traps baited with meat dropped to depths of 130 to 250m. The largest commercial fisheries are in the Philippines and Indonesia. The shells and the meat are both used, although the latter is thought to be essentially a by-product, with the shell the primary product in trade. Shells are sold whole as decorative objects or collectors\u2019 items and also in pieces, for example in inlay. There is both domestic use and international trade. Much of the domestic sale of shells is to tourists; a proportion of this is likely to be destined for export as personal effects. Some, though probably only a small proportion, of the supply of Chambered Nautilus shells is provided by beach-drift specimens. There is a small amount of use of live specimens for display in aquaria and research. The Philippines and Indonesia have the largest commercial fisheries. In the Philippines harvest and trade of Chambered Nautiluses has occurred at least since the 1970s. A catch survey in 2001/2002 in Panay estimated an annual harvest of some 12,200 N. pompilius; in Palawan, about 9000 animals were reported harvested in 2013 and 37,000 in 2014. More than 18,500 whole shells were found in a recent survey of 162 shops across the Philippines. Commercial harvested reportedly occurs widely in Indonesia with products sold locally and exported. Export in recent years has been notable. According to USA trade data, between 2004 and 2013, some 3700 shells, were exported from Indonesia to the USA, the majority (2630) in 20072. In addition between 2007 and 2010 up to 25,000 specimens were reportedly exported for their meat from Indonesia to China. Overall, however, there is little information on the relative importance of harvest for export compared with that for domestic use in Indonesia. 102 CoP17 Prop. 48 Targeted fisheries are reported to have taken place in the past in New Caledonia (France), Palau and Vanuatu. Harvests are also thought to take place in China (notably Hainan) and Papua New Guinea, but the extent and impact of these and the proportion, if any, of the harvest that enters international trade is unknown. There are numerous importing countries but data are available for the USA only. In the period 2005 to 2014, an annual average of around 12,000 whole individuals and over 85,000 parts was imported into the USA, almost all from the Philippines (85%) and Indonesia (12%)2. Virtually all imports were reported as N. pompilius, but all other species except A. scrobiculatus and N. stenomphalus were reported in trade albeit in very small numbers (some in under 10 specimens). Total annual imports to the USA declined over this period. Imports from the Philippines to the USA declined markedly after 2009, and a shift to imports from Indonesia suggests there may have been a switch from Philippine suppliers to Indonesian suppliers. Most information on population changes comes from the Philippines. Abundance estimates on a reef in Bohol that is subject to commercial harvest were one to three orders of magnitude lower than those of unfished populations. Trap yields from Ta\u00f1on Strait reportedly declined by 97% between the 1970s when a fishery started and the 1980s when the fishery ceased as the species was considered commercially extinct; Chambered Nautiluses now appear to be completely absent here1. Anecdotal reports and results of surveys of harvesters and traders indicate declines, some severe, elsewhere (Palawan, the Visayan Regions and Tawi-Tawi Province). It has been suggested that N. pompilius populations in the Philippines are being serially depleted and that trade may be shifting to Indonesia and elsewhere.

Experts are generally able to distinguish between different species but non-experts have difficulty doing so, and species are usually not differentiated in international trade. Analysis: Chambered Nautiluses are believed generally to occur in small, scattered populations. They are highly vulnerable to overexploitation and are known to be targeted in fisheries, with the products, chiefly shells, known to enter international trade. The main species in trade, Nautilus pompilius has an extensive range in the Indo-Pacific. In one range State \u2013 the Philippines \u2013 harvest has been associated with severe local population declines; the country has exported large quantities of Chambered Nautiluses and it seems that international trade is a significant driver of the harvest. There are indications that harvest for trade has now shifted elsewhere. There are reports of historic and ongoing declines associated with harvest in other parts of the range. It is unclear how extensive such declines are or how important international trade is as a driver of harvest relative to domestic consumption. However, given the extreme vulnerability of Chambered Nautiluses to overharvest, any additional fishing pressure as a result of harvest for export is likely to lead to depletion or local extirpation of populations. Given this and the absence of management plans for the species, it is likely that N. pompilius at least meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). Chambered Nautilus species resemble each other in the major form in which they appear in trade (shells) so given that N. pompilius appears to meet the criteria, all other species in the Family Nautilidae would therefore appear to meet the criteria in Annex 2b (lookalike criteria).

All are endemic to Cuba. They are arboreal and adapted to live on a variety of plants including coffee trees and coconut palms. Shell size is 2 to 3cm. In the wild, Polymita are estimated to live between 12 and 19 months, reaching sexual maturity at between nine and ten months. Clutch size varies, but is generally from 30 to 100 or more. Individuals (which are hermaphrodite) breed only once. The shells of Polymita are beautiful with a wide range of colours, and are sold as handicrafts (such as necklaces) or to shell collectors. Potential distribution maps (provided in the Supporting Statement) for each species have been calculated based on known distribution maps that have had suitable habitat that no longer exists and extirpated sub-populations removed; these provide the basis for the estimated of area of distribution provided below. Polymita brocheri has a current distribution estimated at just over 50km2 of fragmented habitat; original distribution is estimated at ca. 70km2 (ca. 30% reduction).

Local extinctions of populations have been reported1. The species is not present within any protected areas3 and it is impacted by habitat modification and fragmentation, as well as pesticide use in coffee plantations which is known to have caused a mass die-off in one plantation1. Polymita sulphurosa is believed to have an extremely limited distribution, potential habitat within its range comprising patches totalling a few square kilometres (there are differing estimates of 1.3 to 2.5km2 and ca. 7km2)2, 3. Original range has been estimated at ca. 200 km2 (98% reduction). Remaining habitat suffers a severe level of fragmentation. Studies conducted from 1995 to 2004 at different times of year found populations at only 25% of localities reported in the literature. Reported densities are low (estimates of 0.08 to 0.4 and 0.001 to 0.1 individuals per m2 1). An expedition in 2015 located only one individual in one patch of 1.31km2. Habitat is impacted by intense land use for sugarcane agriculture, livestock grazing and subsistence crops. Depleted populations are believed to be at risk from over-harvest, continuous habitat fragmentation and incidental killings4. The species is not present in any protected areas3. Polymita venusta has a current distribution estimated at ca. 8000km2 and the habitat is fragmented; original distribution is estimated at ca. 20,000km2 (ca. 60% decrease). Studies at three sites found population density to fluctuate greatly over time. In some areas only relict populations are found, in areas of low agricultural interest. Known to occur in at least one protected area3. Polymita versicolor has a current distribution estimated at ca. 100km2 and the habitat is fragmented; original distribution is estimated at ca. 130km2 (ca. 25% decrease). Average population density at four locations has been estimated at 0.02 individuals per m2 1. Local extinctions have been reported, ascribed to changes in land use for agriculture, gypsum mining, grazing and housing development and, in one case, possibly to over-collection. Known to occur in at least one protected area3. International exports were reported in the 1940s to be high (estimated at 0.5 million per year), and although an export ban (domestic and international trade prohibited without licenses) was introduced in 1943, trade 105 CoP17 Prop. 49 continued to the USA and Canada until the 1960s. In the last 20 years, only two legal exports have been recorded (55 shells and 35 live specimens). Between 2012 and 2016, Cuban Customs made 15 seizures totalling more than 23,400 shells being exported to the USA. One expert noted that the bulk of the trade goes to Europe and from there to Asia4. Species that are illegally traded in the greatest numbers are said to be P. picta, P. sulphurosa, P. versicolor and P. venusta, although all species can be found in international trade, and the most attractive and varied morphs are selected for harvest1. Most international trade is in fresh shells taken from the wild, rather than recycled from old collections1,4, and the main demand now is said to be from tourists1. Collectors will gather live snails and empty shells when harvesting1: it is not clear what proportion of shells is from live snails. The majority of live snails are collected before they reach maturity1, 5. Polymita brocheri has a distinctive shape to its shell, which differs from that of the other species. Some of the other species have distinctive patterning and colouration, making them relatively easy to identify, but in some species (e.g. P. venusta and P. picta) there is considerable intraspecific variation, so that enforcement agents may have difficulty identifying specimens to species level with confidence5, 6. Photographs to facilitate their identification are available. Analysis: Polymita sulphurosa has a very limited and fragmented range in which it appears to be rare, with evidence of marked historic decline in area of distribution.

According to the Kew Plant Checklist there are nine accepted species: Beaucarnea compacta, B. goldmanii, B. gracilis, B. guatemalensis, B. hiriartiae, B. pliabilis, B. recurvata, B. sanctomariana and B. stricta. Two other species listed as synonyms (B. inermis, B. purpusii) are sometimes recognised as separate species1 Beaucarnea species feature in the horticultural plant trade, with B. recurvata the main species in trade. It is still frequently traded under the synonym Nolina recurvata. Beaucarnea recurvata can reach almost 15m in height and is endemic to the low deciduous forests in rocky and mountainous areas of Veracruz and Oaxaca, Mexico. Regeneration is reportedly limited. Individuals do not flower every year, and establishment rates are apparently low, owing to a lack of water, herbivory grazing, extraction and other causes. Adult plants may live for hundreds of years, and are reported to start flowering when they reach three metres tall after around 30 years (artificially propagated plants reportedly flower sooner)1. There is no accurate estimate of the number or size of wild populations. Maximum recorded density is of 135 individuals per ha (calculated from an area of 1.2ha in Veracruz). A study currently underway in central Veracruz has found few populations with more than 30 adult individuals, although it is believed that such populations exist in inaccessible areas, and that isolated individuals are still relatively abundant in the range1. Observed population structure apparently varies according to site accessibility, with relatively few seedlings and juveniles observed along flat roads near areas of human population.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e668c4d-5125-459e-b9a2-be8088b364a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e668c4d-5125-459e-b9a2-be8088b364a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "610513d9b0b0406d59ad57f222ff9d35ec75e630eb692cfb4fb1020b0ae64a15"}, "2": {"node_id": "ace9247f-e3ef-4c4e-9059-243964cc219f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "311ee822d9db81deded66d8a83309b15ddbbdbd9dfc3d6c66478fd6472d7ead6"}}, "hash": "6ea15288f9fde27e749a8b4900b68b6ff3b80b3be1a14f14ad6d1194db34e239", "text": "There are nurseries in Mexico (registered under the Unidades de Manejo para la Conservaci\u00f3n de la Vida Silvestre (UMA) or Predios Intensivos de Manejo y Vida Silvestre (PIMVS) systems) that legally propagate Beaucarnea species; it is reported that volume of production and sizes of available specimens do not satisfy the demand and that seeds, seedlings, juveniles and adults are consequently harvested from the wild to supplement artificial propagation. The main B. recurvata mass producers are reported to depend entirely on seeds from the wild. Flowering specimens produce an average of approximately seven inflorescences, with each inflorescence typically producing more than 2000 seeds. Only one nursery is known to have a closed cycle of production, and it is very small compared to mass producers in the main region of production of B. recurvata in Mexico1. While examples of sustainable management with scientifically-based harvest limits for seed are in place, such production is reportedly undercut by cultivation of specimens illegally harvested from the wild2. Mexican seizure data indicate that over 2000 specimens were confiscated from nurseries in the period 2004 to 2014.

The origin of parent material of live plants offered outside Mexico is unknown, although the species has been widely in cultivation since the first half of the nineteenth century3. There is virtually no information on export from Mexico. Trade data from the USA do not report any imports from Mexico in the period 2004 to 20134. It has been stated that wild-collected plants are exported after acclimatisation in nurseries in Mexico although there does not appear to be clear evidence for this. Other Beaucarnea species that are known to be in cultivation are B. inermis, B. goldmanii, B. pliabilis, B. hiriartiae and B. guatemalensis. Limited trade in seeds of B. gracilis, B. stricta and B. sanctomariana has also been recorded. Juvenile and adult Beaucarnea specimens resemble each other to varying degrees. They can be distinguished to species level with some training, with information on identification published in a number of manuals5, 6, 7. However, seeds and seedlings cannot be easily identified to species level by non-specialists. There are a number of synonyms used for species in this genus, including species falling under four other genera (Dasylirion, Dracaena, Nolina and Pincenectitia). B. inermis is considered a synonym of B. recurvata8 (however it is included as an accepted species in this proposal) and B. recurvata var. stricta is considered a synonym for B. stricta. 107 CoP17 Prop. 50 The species has not been assessed by IUCN, but the Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 (the Mexican National Red List) classifies B. recurvata as threatened (A) although more recent consideration by experts, indicated that it could instead be classified at risk of extinction. Analysis: Beaucarnea recurvata is an extremely widely grown ornamental plant, cultivated both within its range State (Mexico) and elsewhere. Wild populations are scattered over a relatively wide area; there is no information on total numbers or trends. There are reports of wild-collection of seeds as source material for nursery propagation in Mexico, and of collection of plants of varying sizes for the horticultural plant trade. It has been stated that some of the trade in wild-collected plants is destined for export although there appears to be no clear evidence for this. There are indications of fewer young plants in accessible populations than in less accessible ones, but no other information on the possible impact of harvest on wild populations. The species has been in cultivation outside the range State for many years; it is likely that established cultivated stock can provide both large plants for sale and source material (seeds) for propagation in adequate quantities to meet market demands. The species seems likely not to meet the criteria for inclusion in Annex 2 a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). Evidence for trade in wild-collected plants of other Beaucarnea species is extremely limited and there is no indication that any of them meets the criteria in Annex 2 a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). Species of Beaucarnea resemble each other to varying degrees. If any species were to be included in Appendix II, the others would meet the criteria in Annex 2 b of the Resolution (lookalike criteria). Reviewers of summary information only: L.

It has a limited range in Hidalgo State where it occurs on the vertical faces of limestone cliffs that are difficult to access. Surveys have located 31 populations of this species but, due to site inaccessibility, it has only been possible to evaluate abundance and population density in 9 of these. These contained between 3 and 304 individuals. Only a small proportion of the population at each site reproduces each year and the overall population may be decreasing1. Its range is located mainly in the Metztitl\u00e1n Gully Biosphere Reserve, an area affected by rock mining, road building and urban development. The area\u2019s management programme contains specific actions for the protection of the species. There are around 540 species of Tillandsia ranging from the southern USA to Argentina and Chile. A few species are widely distributed, but most have limited ranges. Tillandsia species in general feature in the horticultural plant trade. Some forms are artificially propagated in very large numbers and widely sold as ornamental plants. Others are grown largely by enthusiasts. T. mauryana was included in Appendix II in 1992 owing to concerns regarding the possible impact on it of wild-collection for international trade. The original listing proposal at CoP8 covered all Tillandsia spp. At the CoP it was agreed to include only seven species, including two from Mexico: T. mauryana and T. xerographica (the latter also found in Guatemala). Since the species was listed, around 190 plants have been recorded in trade, mainly between Hungary and Switzerland, and all reported as artificially propagated. No trade in this species has been recorded from Mexico, no exports of wild specimens have been reported and there is no evidence of ongoing wild collection or illegal trade. The CITES Trade Database records a very small number of specimens of unidentified Tillandsia spp. as confiscated by the USA (90 specimens between 1993 and 2014); some 175 Tillandsia spp. occur in Mexico. Artificial propagation of this species from seed is known to occur in nurseries in Germany and Hungary, and artificially propagated plants are offered for sale on the internet in a number of other countries, including the Czech Republic, Switzerland and the USA. Demand for this species by enthusiasts appears to be low and seems to be fully supplied by artificially propagated specimens. Tillandsia mauryana is not similar to other CITES-listed Tillandsia species but does resemble other species that are not listed in the Appendices. This proposal has resulted from the Plants Committee\u2019s Periodic Review process. Analysis: It would appear that Tillandsia mauryana does not fulfil the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II as regulation of trade is not required to prevent harvesting of specimens from the wild from threatening the survival of the species. No export of wild harvested plants has been recorded since the species was listed in Appendix II and it seems that the limited demand for specimens is met entirely with artificially propagated plants. The species has not been subject to a recommendation under the provisions of the Review of Significant Trade within the last two intervals between meetings of the Conference of the Parties. It seems unlikely that its removal from the Appendices would stimulate trade in wild specimens such that it would meet the criteria for listing in Appendix II in the near future, as outlined in the precautionary measures in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16), nor is its retention required to ensure that trade in any other Appendix-II listed species is effectively controlled.

Sclerocactus blainei (S. s. blainei) has a narrow distribution and is known from three occurrences in Nevada and Utah. Its population size is unknown. No information is available on population trends, but declining rainfall and prolonged drought conditions are believed to have impacted seedling recruitment and adult survivorship of Sclerocactus species in general. No trade in this taxon has ever been reported in the CITES Trade Database; a very small amount of trade in what is regarded as the parent taxon under current CITES taxonomy (S. spinosior) has been reported, in plants declared as artificially propagated and none from the USA. Seeds advertised as of S. s. blainei can be found for sale online outside the USA2. Sclerocactus cloverae (S. parviflorus) is known from 21 to 80 occurrences in Colorado and New Mexico. The estimated range is approximately 25,900km2; individuals are generally scattered in suitable habitat but it may be locally abundant3; individual populations may be relatively short-lived4. A population estimate of ca. 10,000 has been made, but some of these may have been S. parviflorus (as currently recognised) or S. whipplei which are similar in appearance. Only a very small amount of trade in S. parviflorus has ever been recorded in the CITES Trade Database, all reported as of artificially propagated origin. It is not known if any of this trade was in the taxon regarded in this proposal as S. cloverae. Grafted (artificially propagated) plants advertised as S. cloverae are offered for sale in Europe5. Sclerocactus sileri is known from 10 to 12 occurrences in Arizona, and has a distribution there of approximately 1000km2. According to recent work this species is also found in Utah. The species has reportedly suffered declines caused by fire, and is now uncommon6. Most of the populations are said to be very small (two to ten plants)3. The species has a generation length of four years (to first flower)6. No trade in this taxon has ever been reported in the CITES Trade Database and no evidence could be found of plants or seeds offered for sale. It was classified by the IUCN Red List in 2013 as Vulnerable. Sclerocactus species are reported to be impacted by oil and gas exploration and extraction activities, recreational off-road vehicle (ORV) use, livestock trampling, collection of specimens, loss of habitat, and insect parasitism. Oil and gas development and ORV may increase access to plants by collectors. There are concerns that Sclerocactus populations could be adversely affected by unauthorized and illegal harvest of plants and seeds. It is suggested that the harvest of even a small number of seeds or plants could adversely affect the species\u2019 reproductive potential and perhaps their long-term survival. As Sclerocactus species can be challenging to cultivate they may be of interest to a limited number of specialist collectors in the USA and elsewhere, but in general demand for them is likely to be low or very low. All Sclerocactus species are protected by the U.S. Lacey Act, meaning, amongst other things, it is unlawful to import, export, transport, sell or receive any wild plant (including roots, seeds, and other parts) taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any State law or regulation. In Arizona collectors must obtain a harvest permit and plants may not be moved from private property without contacting the Arizona Department of Agriculture. Collectors must obtain a permit to harvest and transport plants in Nevada. On land in Arizona and Nevada managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), collection of Sclerocactus may be permitted only for scientific or educational purposes, or conservation or propagation of the species. Utah requires proof of ownership of the plant to collect and transport native plants within the State.

It is in demand internationally for its wood. It is included in the Chinese \u201cHongmu\u201d standard of high-quality hardwoods used for furniture and cabinet-making. At CoP16 it was listed in Appendix II with annotation #5 to restrict the listing to logs, sawn wood and veneer sheets. Harvesting of this species is either restricted (Viet Nam) or banned (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand) within its range. A recent review of the trade in D. cochinchinensis indicates that a significant portion of the trade in this and similar species is currently in the form of secondary processed products, particularly furniture.

The intention of using this annotation is in order to regulate the products in trade that are of conservation concern. Analysis: International trade in Dalbergia cochinchinensis appears to include products not included in the current annotation to the listing. This has been demonstrated by the interception of shipments of crudely processed timber exported as furniture. Annotation #4 would include all timber-related products including finished furniture, which are those of evident conservation concern. Prop. 55 seeks to include all species of Dalbergia, except those in Appendix I, in Appendix II with no annotation. Depending on the order in which proposals are taken, if Proposal 53 is considered before Proposal 55, D. cochinchinensis would be included in the genus-level listing with no annotation if Proposal 55 were to be accepted, meaning that all readily recognisable parts and derivatives would be covered by the listing.

Discussion of the genus as a whole is included in the analysis of that proposal. Summary: There are 20 Dalbergia species found in Mexico, six of which are endemic. Of the total, 15 produce high quality timber; two are already listed in Appendix II (D. retusa and D. stevensonii), the remainder are proposed here for listing in Appendix II. Timber produced by many species of Dalbergia, often known as \u2018rosewood\u2019, is valued for the beauty, durability and physical properties of the wood; it is consequently in demand in international trade (see analysis for Proposal 55). None of the 13 species currently proposed for listing is named in the National Hongmu Standard of 33 species1, or in the Chinese Industrial Hardwood Standard2. There is little information on the populations and trade in most of the species. Regeneration of many Dalbergia species is considered slow3. Mexico has now carried out risk assessments for the populations of Mexico. Dalbergia calderonii occurs in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. This species is rare and slow growing, and occurs in a region with high deforestation. Mexico considers its population endangered and El Salvador has assessed it as threatened. Dalbergia calycina occurs in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Nicaragua. No data are available on the volume of trade; exports from Guatemala (which listed its population in Appendix III) were reported in 20144. Known to occur in a number of protected areas, there are no specific data relating to the population size of this taxon, however, it is considered to be rare in Nicaragua and assessed as threatened by Mexico. In 2012 IUCN classified the species as of Least Concern. Dalbergia congestiflora is distributed in Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, it is currently considered endangered in Mexico, but according to the most recent assessment it now qualifies as subject to special protection. Dalbergia cubilquitzensis occurs in Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua. Mexico considers this species endangered. No data are available on the volume of trade; exports from Guatemala (which has listed the species in Appendix III) were reported in 20144. Dalbergia glomerata is reported to occur in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, although Mexico considers that it is endemic and the populations elsewhere are D. congestiflora. It was listed in Appendix III by Guatemala in 2015 and, according to the CITES Trade Database, since then 42m3 of sawn wood have been reported as exported from Honduras to Taiwan (Province of China). The species is harvested for timber; populations are believed to be declining as a result. Also believed to be affected by decline in area and quality of habitat as a result of conversion to agriculture. Road construction is making areas more accessible for logging5. Classified as in need of special protection in Mexico and as Vulnerable by IUCN (2012). Dalbergia longepedunculata occurs in Honduras and Mexico; considered endangered by Mexico. Dalbergia luteola occurs in Guatemala and Mexico; considered endangered in Mexico. Dalbergia melanocardium occurs in El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico; considered endangered in Mexico. Dalbergia modesta endemic to Mexico where it is considered threatened. 113 CoP17 Prop. 54 Dalbergia palo-escrito is endemic to Mexico where it is considered threatened, this species is in high demand for the manufacture of classical guitars and is subject to selective logging6. Dalbergia rhachiflexa is endemic to Mexico where it is considered threatened. Dalbergia ruddae occurs in Costa Rica and Mexico; considered threatened in Mexico. Dalbergia tucurensis naturally occurs in Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua; introduced into Costa Rica. Nicaragua listed the species in Appendix III in 2014 and Guatemala added its population in 2015; the CITES Trade Database records just over 29,000m3 in trade, mainly from Nicaragua to East Asia.

However Proposal 53 notes that in a review of the trade in D. cochinchinensis a large portion of the trade in \"rosewood\" species from eastern Asia is currently in the form of secondary processed products, particularly furniture. The traders can crudely process the timber in the source country and then export it as furniture to circumvent the control. That proposal is to expand the scope of the listing by switching to annotation #4. Analysis: The species of Dalbergia proposed here are timber-producing species that share range States with two Dalbergia species that are already included in Appendix II. There is insufficient information to determine whether any of the species proposed here meets the criteria in Annex 2a of the Resolution. At least some of the species are known to be in trade and have timber that is difficult to distinguish from the Appendix-II listed species. Trade in timber from Dalbergia species may be reported at genus level. This creates problems in the implementation of the existing Appendix-II listing. It would appear therefore that these species meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2b of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16) (lookalike criteria). With no annotation proposed, all parts and derivatives, live or dead, would be regulated; under the current Appendix-II listings for D. retusa and D. stevensonii the only products included are logs, sawn wood and veneer sheets and plywood.

There are currently around 300 accepted names according to the Plant List but there is still substantial taxonomic uncertainty within the genus. Currently one species Dalbergia nigra from Brazil is in Appendix I, D. cochinchinensis from Southeast Asia, D. granadillo, D. retusa, and D. stevensonii, from Mexico and Central America, and all Malagasy species in the genus (ca. 70) are included in Appendix II. A number of Central American populations of various species are in Appendix III. Thirteen Mexican and Central American species are subject to a separate proposal (Proposal 54) for inclusion in Appendix II. Some species produce high quality timber, often known as \u201crosewood\u201d, which commands high prices in trade and is used in construction, cabinet work, marquetry, inlay, furniture construction, musical instrument manufacture, tools and carvings. The term rosewood is imprecise, and used differently in different contexts. Not all timbers characterised as rosewood are Dalbergia (the name is also variously applied to species in the genera Jacaranda, Guibourtia (the subject of Proposal 56) and Machaerium), and not all Dalbergia species produce rosewood.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88bf5a97-3be4-4cf6-92cc-04733b6d5c34": {"__data__": {"id_": "88bf5a97-3be4-4cf6-92cc-04733b6d5c34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35990ff3adc73e917f17d57c68c63bb9a94637e5f4c60910066a15c127203d3c"}, "2": {"node_id": "59e40668-b17f-45df-8bbc-cfef3b1794fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9329ddf5b76b1968d3b3fb215160b7078ce7065b09464010a6b275b14edc8bb0"}}, "hash": "fe140ac4d68f78182e06835512f071eb8eb5d60914fb2a8ed324285cc3225b13", "text": "Some valued Dalbergia timber is known as ebony or \u201cblackwood\u201d.

There is also an Industrial Standard of Precious Dark Color Hardwood Furniture in China. This classifies an additional species of Dalbergia (D. greveana (Appendix II2)) as \u201cRosewood\u201d. Other Dalbergia species are also used for their hard wood. These include (but are not restricted to): Africa: some Dalbergia species from Madagascar; Latin America: D. brasiliensis, D. cearensis, D. cubilquitzensis, D. cuscatlanica, D. decipularis, D. foliolosa, D. funera, D. glomerata, D. hortensis, D. miscolobium, D. spruceana, D. villosa, D. tucurensis, D. glabra, D. calycina. Asia: D. annamensis, D. cambodiana, D. mammosa, D. sissoo3, D. tonkinensis. Various lists of commercial timber species exist that include Dalbergias (see \u201cA Working List of Commercial Timber Tree Species\u201d4 although note that some species mentioned in the SS and here are not included in this); not all these species necessarily produce timber that resembles that of species already listed in the CITES Appendices. Some Dalbergia species are used for making musical instruments. In particular the African Blackwood D. melanoxylon is the most highly-favoured wood for clarinets and oboes. Other species known for their musical qualities include D. cochinchinensis (Appendix II), D. glomerata, D. granadillo (Appendix II), D. palo-escrito, D. retusa (Appendix II), D. stevensonii (Appendix II)5, D. tucurensis and a number of Madagascan species (Appendix II)6. Recorded export of D. melanoxylon, a species widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, takes place almost entirely from Mozambique and Tanzania. Demand for musical instrument manufacture has been estimated at 255m3 per year of semi-processed billets, equivalent to perhaps 1500m3 of roundwood. Harvest of different species of Dalbergia and similar timbers appears to follow a distinctive pattern in which as the most favoured and accessible timber stocks in a particular area are depleted, attention turns to others. As an example, with the commercial extinction of D. odorifera in China and Pterocarpus santalinus in India, the trade in D. cochinchinensis reportedly grew rapidly and it became the most sought-after Hongmu species globally. As D. cochinchinensis has subsequently been depleted the main species now dominating the Hongmu trade in Southeast Asia are reported to be D. oliveri, D. bariensis, P. macrocarpus and P. pedatus7. 115 CoP17 Prop. 55 There is generally very little quantitative information on the impact of logging on populations of Dalbergia species. Knowledge of the status of many of them is very limited and often out-of-date. In the 1998 IUCN Threatened Trees of the World, the following species were identified as under threat from overexploitation: D. annamensis, D. bariensis, D. cambodiana, D. mammosa, D. oliveri, D. latifolia, D. odorifera, D. tonkinensis. Of these D. bariensis, D. latifolia, D. odorifera and D. oliveri are classified as Hongmu species. Dalbergia bariensis is native to Cambodia; Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR); Thailand; Viet Nam where it is said to be widely distributed and scattered.

However, in combination with chemical methods, such as mass spectrometry, DNA sequencing and profiling, near infrared spectroscopy and stable isotope analysis identification can consistently identify and distinguish between species15, 16, 17. Inexpensive and accessible tools are not available to enforcement officers at this time. The intention of the proposal is to include all parts and derivatives of the species, live or dead and therefore no annotation is proposed for inclusion with the listing. Analysis: The genus Dalbergia is a large and widespread one, comprising plants of many different forms. Some species produce high quality and sought-after timber, some of which is traded as \u201crosewood\u201d. There is little available information on the status of, or impacts of harvest for trade on, non-CITES listed species of Dalbergia that produce rosewood, although there are indications of decline in some species, notably in Asia and Central and South America. There is insufficient readily available information to determine whether any of these meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). However, given the difficulty in distinguishing between different rosewood-producing species of Dalbergia in the principal form in which they are traded (timber) it would appear that such species would meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2b (lookalike criteria) owing to the resemblance of their timber in trade to that of species already listed in the Appendices. Determining which species should be treated as lookalikes may require some additional work; various lists of Dalbergia species timber in trade exist but these would need to be analysed as to which rosewoods resemble each other. One species of African Dalbergia African Blackwood (D. melanoxylon) produces timber that is in trade principally in a form (semi-processed billets for the production of musical instruments) that is reasonably easily distinguished from other Dalbergia spp. in trade and other timber species included in the Appendices. There is insufficient information to determine whether this species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). It does not appear to meet the criteria in Annex 2b. No mainland African species of Dalbergia is known to produce rosewood that is in trade. 116 CoP17 Prop. 55 Many Dalbergia species are not known to be in trade, nor do they resemble species that are in trade. These do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II. No annotation is proposed with this listing which would result in all parts and derivatives being included, if adopted. Current listings are annotated to include \u201cLogs, sawn wood and veneer sheets\u201d (#5) and plywood for those with annotation (#6). Some of those species which are currently listed are used for the manufacture of musical instruments, although musical instruments are excluded from the listings. Species that would be listed were this proposal adopted would include musical instruments where they are used for this purpose. A proposal to amend the annotation for D. cochinchinensis (Proposal 53) intends to widen the scope of products covered to include secondary processed products, particularly furniture as it appears that traders are crudely processing timber in the source country and then exporting it as furniture to circumvent the control. A genus level listing with no annotation would include un-processed, semi-processed and finished furniture.

All three species in the current proposal are African forest trees. Guibourtia tessmannii grows to 65m with a trunk that can exceptionally reach 2m in diameter at breast height (DBH) but is generally smaller. It is found at very low population density on firm ground in evergreen forest in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. It is also believed likely to occur in southeast Nigeria, the Republic of Congo and extreme southwest Central African Republic, being present in logging concessions in Cameroon near these countries. It has not been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo3. Guibourtia pellegriniana grows to 30m, with a trunk typically around 40cm DBH. It also occurs at very low population density. Its known distribution is considerably smaller than that of G. tessmannii.

Guibourtia demeusei grows 25 to 40m tall with a trunk up to one metre DBH. It occurs in periodically flooded and swampy forest and gallery forest, often in pure stands4. It has a much larger range than the other two species, extending into the central Congo basin. It occurs in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo5. There is a general lack of biological data for these species, which are all from closed forest and have historically been problematic to study6. G. tessmannii and G. pellegriniana are said to be difficult to distinguish from each other in the field. Increment rate (increase in trunk diameter) of ca. 0.35cm per year has been estimated for G. tessmannii in Gabon and of ca. 0.4cm per year for managed populations of G. demeusei in the Republic of Congo7. Frugivorous animals are thought to play an important part in seed dispersal. Some inventory data are available. Historic estimates for Gabon (of a probable stock of three to seven million m3 of G. tessmannii and G. pellegriniana combined made in 1975 and of seven to 13 million m3 made in 1995) are not considered reliable. More recent assessment in forestry concessions in Gabon found extremely low stocks of the two species combined that could be harvested on a sustainable basis (annual harvests from effectively zero to 0.0045m3 per ha). Inventories in Cameroon have found similarly low stocking densities, between 0.002 and 0.06 trees with DBH >20cm per ha. A considerably higher density of G. demeusei, of 0.4 stems per ha, has been reported in the Central African Republic5.

All three species are traded internationally as Bubinga but are also known under other names, such as Kevazingo. G. tessmannii and G. pellegriniana are commonly referred to as Rose Bubinga and are reportedly indistinguishable in trade. G. demeusei, or Red Bubinga, can be distinguished and is generally considered of inferior quality, but reportedly may be easily confused with or substituted for that of the other two on the international market. Historically most exports were to Europe; more recently China has become the main market as the timber is used for the making of Hongmu-type (rosewood and blackwood or ebony) furniture, demand for which has increased greatly in the past decade. Guibourtia species are not a part of the recognised Hongmu standard in China, but their timber is a category A2 hardwood that is used as a substitute for Hongmu timbers9. Trade data, often reported under trade (i.e. non-scientific) names, may refer to one or other of the three species, or some combination of them. Reported exports of G. tessmannii and G. pellegriniana combined from Gabon have increased over time. Until 2009 all recorded export was of roundwood (logs), rising from an average annual export of ca. 25,000m3 in 1987 to 1992, to ca. 60,000m3 in 1993 to 1999 and just under 70,000m3 in 2000 to 2009. From 2011 onwards, only sawnwood has been officially recorded as exported. 118 CoP17 Prop. 56 Using a conversion factor from sawnwood to roundwood of three, on average the equivalent of 65,000m3 roundwood was exported annually in 2011 to 2014. Recorded exports from Cameroon do not distinguish between the three species. Exports are at a much lower level than those for Gabon, amounting for ca. 13,000m3 roundwood per year in 1995 to 1998 and roundwood equivalent of around 6000m3 in sawnwood per year for 1999 to 2014 with little discernible overall trend. Data from logging requests submitted by forest management units indicates that during the period 2008 to 2012, around 75% of logged volume of Guibourtia in Cameroon was of G. demeusei, with volumes requested for this species for 2011 to 2013 considerably higher than those requested in previous years. At the same time requested volume of G. tessmannii (probably including G. pellegriniana) halved. Recorded exports of Bubinga from Equatorial Guinea are at a low level, although have risen from virtually zero in 2007 to ca. 400 m3 in 20115. The species involved are not identified, nor is it clear if the volume is for roundwood or sawnwood. Bubinga exported from Democratic Republic of the Congo is G. demeusei (the other two species do not occur there); it is likely that all Bubinga exported from Central African Republic (where G. demeusei is known to occur and the other two have not been confirmed) is also G. demeusei. Reported exports from the Central African Republic rose sharply from zero or nearly zero in 2005 to 2009 to ca. 600m3 in 2010 and 1700m3 in 2011 (again, it is unclear if this is roundwood or sawnwood). Recorded exports from the Democratic Republic of the Congo also increased, from very low levels in 2005 to 2008 to ca. 700m3 in 2009 and 2000m3 in each of 2010 and 2011. Roundwood of G. tessmannii and G. pellegriniana is advertised on the internet, indicating that it is available on the international market despite the fact that the two countries known to export these species prohibit export of roundwood. It is suspected that declared exports represent only a proportion of the actual volume exported, although exactly what proportion remains unknown. There are narrative accounts of extensive illegal and unauthorised logging of these species in Cameroon5.

There is very little information on recruitment rates or age and size at maturity. The species, particularly G. tessmannii and G. pellegriniana, are known to be in demand internationally for their rosewood-type timber, the market for which has grown very rapidly in Asia, particularly China, in recent years. Populations of G. tessmannii and G. pellegriniana are of low density, although it is not known if this is a natural state or a result of past exploitation. Where there is information on trade in these species it appears to be at a low level. There are indications of illegal offtake and trade, the volume of which is not quantified but which may be relatively high. Given the evident scarcity of harvestable-sized G. tessmannii and G. pellegriniana it is likely that current harvest, including illegal offtake, for export is exceeding the rate at which such trees are entering the population, leading to probable commercial extinction of these species. It is unclear, however, whether this will lead to the species themselves becoming threatened by harvest or other influences, or becoming eligible for inclusion in Appendix I in the near future G. demeusei is a widespread species that can be locally abundant. Reported harvest and export in a number of its range States increased around 2009 and 2010, which may be associated both with increasing demand for rosewoods in general at that time, and declining availability of G. tessmannii and G. pellegriniana. However, recorded harvest and export remain at a relatively low level, indicating that the species is unlikely to meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Annex 2 a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). 119 CoP17 Prop. 56 Given the difficulties in distinguishing between G. tessmannii and G. pellegriniana, if either were to be included in Appendix II, then the other would meet the criteria in Annex 2b A of the Resolution (lookalike criteria). Information regarding the similarity of these two species to G. demeusei is conflicting. By some accounts the principal part in trade (timber) is relatively straightforward to distinguish, although all three may be traded under the same generic trade name. It is unclear, therefore, whether G. demeusei does meet the criteria in Annex 2b A of the Resolution. Reviewers of summary information only: D. Mahonghol and T. Osborn.

Population studies undertaken show that average tree density varies widely: in Burkina Faso, Niger and Togo it ranges from 1.17 \u00b1 0.75 trees/ha to 110.9 \u00b1 1.15 trees/ha2 3, with average stem diameter ranging from ca. 25cm to ca. 50cm. It has been observed that many mature trees remain in Sierra Leone: in the 100km2 around Lake Sonfon in Sierra Leone there are an estimated total of 500,000 - 1 million individual trees1, and trees here are of a larger average size than those observed in Burkina Faso4. The species is of high socio-cultural importance in the region and is widely used locally in construction and furniture making, as medicine, for musical instruments, charcoal, dyes and fodder for livestock. The species has been heavily exploited for international trade in recent years with nearly all recorded trade going to China. It is amongst the species classified under China\u2019s Hongmu Standard, a list of 33 species, including Pterocarpus spp., Dalbergia spp., Diospyros spp., Millettia spp. and Cassia spp., whose density, texture and colour match the requirements for the manufacture of luxury Hongmu furniture. Recorded Chinese imports of logs increased from ca. 3000 m3 in 2009 to 700,000m3 in 20145. A typical yield of 0.8m3 is estimated for a relatively large (50cm dbh) tree6, so that reported imports to China in 2014 would have required the harvesting of nearly 900,000 large trees. The species has been protected under forest law in most range States, in some cases since 1996, due to concerns about failing population management and unsustainable use. There are total export bans in at least seven range States. Recommended average felling diameter ranges from 35-65cm. However, there is little evidence of forest management plans in place for this species, or of effective controls regulating national use or international trade. In some countries only specimens of ca. 30 cm stem diameter or over are being logged, but in others, for instance Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire trees of a smaller stem diameter are also targeted7. Logs of this species are widely available on the internet, in any quantity requested, and shipped from ports in countries with export bans in place. In order to ensure the listing covers those parts of the species that first enter or dominate the international market (and as listings with annotations may be circumvented, for instance #5 by minimal working of the wood prior to export) the proposal is without annotation. Analysis: Pterocarpus erinaceus is a tree species which it is harvested for timber and has a number of other local uses. There is evidence of rapid increase in export of timber from range States in the past six years largely to meet demand in China for Hongmu timber used in furniture-making. A proportion of this export, possibly the majority, appears to be unauthorised or illegal. The species is widespread and adaptable and may be at least locally abundant. It may also mature at a size considerably smaller than that at which it is harvested for timber. The current level of harvest for timber is likely to be unsustainable, in that it almost certainly exceeds the rate at which harvestable-sized trees are being replenished in the population, but it seems unlikely that regulation of trade is required to prevent the species from becoming eligible for inclusion in Appendix I in the near future, or that regulation of trade is required to ensure that harvest of specimens is not reducing the population to a level at which its survival might be threatened.

Recent studies based on analysis of satellite images and field observations1,2, have found it to have a relatively extensive distribution (26,000 to 32,000 km2) along the Mangoky River and in the western part of the Menabe region. Populations of the tree are scattered through this area. The satellite image study estimated its population at over one million individuals, many more than has previously been suggested. Regeneration levels of A. grandidieri appear to be low, with few young trees in the population. A number of potential causes have been proposed, including reductions or loss of populations of natural seed dispersal agents (wild animals that eat the fruit without digesting the seeds), an increase in the population of feral pigs and cattle, increasing human harvesting of fruits and bark and changing land use through the conversion to agricultural land and pasture. Forest cover has declined considerably in the region in the past few decades and deforestation rates are said to have increased markedly in the past decade. The species has established local uses for fruit, seed oil, tree bark, bark fibre and wood. Local demand for juice preparation in hotels in Morondava (one of the main towns in the region) is roughly estimated at 3000kg of fruits per year. Local harvest of trees for fibres in Morondava market is estimated at the equivalent of 50 trees harvested6. The amount of national level trade is not known but seed mounds (equivalent to ca. 2500kg) have been observed in the market in Antananarivo (the capital, not in the area of distribution of the baobab) during the fruiting season6. In Madagascar, several companies promote the commercialization and sustainable use of A. grandidieri, including through the production and marketing of baobab powder and baobab oil derived from fruit and seed3. The actual extent of this trade is unclear. A collection permit was granted to a company in Madagascar for 4000kg of A. grandidieri fruit for use in food and cosmetics; the full amount was reported as harvested in 20154. Harvested fruit did not appear to be intended for international trade. There is very little evidence of international trade in any products of A. grandidieri. Records from the Government of Madagascar indicate export of 150ml of seed oil (equivalent to 15 fruits) in 2014 and 35kg, apparently of seed oil (possibly seed), in 2015. Health products are advertised on online platforms as containing A. grandidieri5, but it is not known if these do in fact contain A. grandidieri extract.

Analysis: Adansonia grandidieri is an endemic species to Madagascar where its population is reportedly still numerous, although affected by a range of factors including low regeneration rates and conversion of its habitat. There is harvest for domestic use. Some of this (principally for fibres) is destructive, but the major products harvested are fruit and seeds, harvested non-destructively. Such harvest might conceivably have some impact on regeneration rates in areas where it takes place, although there are no data to support this. Recorded levels of international trade (in seeds and seed products) compared with observed levels of domestic use are very small and appear highly unlikely to have an impact on the wild population. The species would not appear to meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). The proposed annotation is to include seeds, fruits, oils and live plants. Both oils and products containing oils have been recorded in trade.

It is native to Algeria where it occurs only at 1800-2000m elevation on Djebel Babor, part of the Petite Kabylie Mountain Range. The total extent of forests containing the species is estimated at less than 30km2 with the fir only occupying a small portion of this. Access to the area is highly restricted because of security problems and there are no recent population estimates. A 2011 report stated that the number of trees had halved since the 1950s, although the basis of this is not known2.

However it is sensitive to low temperatures and to air pollution in urban environments3. It is mostly cultivated in countries around the Mediterranean Sea, where it is sometimes planted in hedges as it takes trimming well3. Few cultivars are known. The species hybridises readily with other Abies spp., so that seed collected from cultivated trees is often hybrid3.

The CITES Checklist currently recognises some 25 species of Aquilaria and eight of Gyrinops. In some trees, a still imprecisely understood combination of wounding, vectors of infection (bacterial infection, fungus) and resinous response induces the formation of a resinous heartwood (agarwood) that is fragrant and highly valued. The primary source of agarwood in reported trade is Aquilaria malaccensis. Agarwood is used in perfumes, incense and traditional medicines, and as an essential oil, distilled from the wood. Carvings and beads, including prayer beads, are also produced from the wood. So-called exhausted wood powder \u2013 the residue left after the distillation process \u2013 is often compressed to make incense sticks and small statues. All agarwood-producing taxa are currently included in Appendix II; Aquilaria malaccensis was listed in 1994, and the rest of the genus Aquilaria and all Gyrinops spp. in 2004. They are currently covered by annotation #14, agreed at CoP16 (Bangkok, 2013), including all parts and derivatives except: a) seeds and pollen; b) seedling or tissue cultures obtained in vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers; c) fruits; d) leaves; e) exhausted agarwood powder, including compressed powder in all shapes; and f) finished products packaged and ready for retail trade, this exemption does not apply to beads, prayer beads and carvings.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "076f7749-ba34-4a41-bff0-c721b549be07": {"__data__": {"id_": "076f7749-ba34-4a41-bff0-c721b549be07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN/TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f988bc90a632888575050496a6a78072375d2cbe3ca01d691fea766b69f55492"}, "2": {"node_id": "c693140e-ef2d-4301-9f34-659c9de3e992", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucntraffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-17th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60db706b0058f3ea330d93c991330a4e3cd74b0400b838385c8df908cd3c977d"}}, "hash": "321506071ca3e5a152d49c102defa0c214d63fbcaa0ba73502d44d0e49983ba6", "text": "International agarwood trade is complex, as it is traded in a variety of forms and at various stages of processing, from raw whole pieces to finished products such as perfumes, which may contain only small amounts of agarwood oil. Some processing of agarwood to produce end-products takes place in range States; some takes place elsewhere with resulting products, either sold domestically or re-exported to other consumer countries. One of the major products in trade is wood chips, which may be traded for burning as \u2018incense wood\u2019, or for further processing to produce products such as beads, prayer beads, medicines, incense sticks, perfumes and tea.

Information from the CITES Trade Database confirms the importance of wood chips as a product in trade (ca. 7000mt of Aquilaria reported as exported and 10,000mt reported as imported between 2005 and 2015; ca. 180mt of Gyrinops reported as exported and 230mt reported as imported in the same period), and also indicates numerous transactions of less than 5kg, reported as grammes or kilogrammes. Reported small transactions such as these account for only a very small proportion of overall trade in wood chips (ca. 500kg in total, or 0.01% by weight of trade in Aquilaria as reported by exporters, and just 5kg of Gyrinops in total for the period 2005 to 2105). The amount of trade in wood chips packaged and ready for retail trade currently unregulated by CITES is unknown. Analysis: Wood chips are a major trade item for agarwood, included in Appendix II as Aquilaria spp. and Gyrinops spp. The current annotation for agarwood exempts wood chips that are packaged and ready for retail trade from CITES controls. This exemption is reported to be inconsistently applied. Removal of the exemption, as proposed here, would ensure that all agarwood chips, however packaged, were subject to CITES controls (apart from those exempt under personal effects as specified in Res. Conf. 13.7 (Rev CoP16)), thereby bringing more of the agarwood trade under CITES control and, in theory, simplifying implementation. 127 CoP17 Prop. 61 Inclusion of Natal Ginger Siphonochilus aethiopicus (populations of Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe) in Appendix II Proponent: South Africa Summary: Siphonochilus aethiopicus, the Natal Ginger or Wild Ginger, is a long-lived plant that grows in seasonally dry woodlands with a perennial rhizome and annual above-ground parts that die off during the dry season. It is widespread in tropical and sub-tropical Africa, occurring in 24 range States. The proposal only concerns populations of Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Although believed to be affected by habitat loss, large-scale commercial harvesting to supply the herbal medicine trade in southern Africa is considered to be the most important factor affecting the species, which is one of the most popular ingredients in traditional medicines, particularly in South Africa. Harvest for local medicinal use has been implicated in declines in South Africa, where it is now extinct over much of its former range, its extent of occurrence having reportedly declined by more than 90% over the last 100 years, now standing at just over 8000km2 1. Thirty-nine known historical subpopulations were identified in South Africa in 2000, of which only 17 were still extant. More than half had fewer than 100 individuals, although some had up to 4000 plants. The species is now extinct in KwaZulu-Natal and has declined drastically in Limpopo and Mpumalanga Provinces. The majority of the remaining populations are reportedly not secure. Two-thirds occur outside formal conservation areas and three of the six populations that are theoretically protected are reportedly still being heavily exploited. Historically South Africa exported the plant (e.g. to Lesotho in the early 20th century). The direction of trade appears to have reversed. Demand is South Africa is apparently too high to be met by current production from cultivated sources or locally sourced wild plants2. Wild plants are reportedly being imported in increasing quantities from neighbouring countries. One reported market observation in 2011 revealed thousands of plants said to have been harvested in Zimbabwe and there are accounts of people travelling to Zimbabwe from South Africa to harvest.

There is also some evidence of international trade through international online trade platforms, including from South Africa and from Australia (of S. aethiopicus of South African origin). In South Africa, S. aethiopicus is listed as an endangered species in the Threatened or Protected Species (TOPS) Regulation list. Permits are required for harvesting, possession and trade. In 2015, South Africa has published (in draft)3 its intention to revise the TOPS listing of S. aethiopicus to a critically endangered species of medicinal plants, which will restrict, through permitting, the import into South Africa of wild- sourced material of the species, as well as domestic trade within the country. Under the listing, all artificially propagated plants and their export would be exempt from controls3. In Swaziland, the Flora Protection Act lists S. aethiopicus as a specially protected flora species requiring permits for harvest or export4. Siphonochilus aethiopicus has not been assessed against the IUCN Red List criteria, but was assessed as critically endangered in South Africa, as endangered in Swaziland, and was reported to be endangered in Benin. Analysis: This proposal is limited to Siphonochilus aethiopicus populations in Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. The populations in South Africa have evidently been seriously depleted by harvesting for domestic demand, and there are indications that harvesting for import into South Africa has spread to the other three range States in the proposal. Import is believed to take place through informal 128 CoP17 Prop. 61 channels. Populations have been described as \u2018remnant\u2019 in Swaziland. Healthy populations reportedly exist in northern Mozambique; there are suspicions of depletion in the south of the country. There is no information available on its status in Zimbabwe. On this basis there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the species meets the criteria in Annex 2 a of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP16). Reviewers of summary information only: D. Newton, V.

Finished products containing such extracts as ingredients, including fragrances, are not considered to be covered by this annotation Proponent: United States of America Summary: Bulnesia sarmientoi is a tree species occurring in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and a small part of Brazil. It was included in Appendix II in 2010. The wood of B. sarmientoi is heavy, very strong and decay-resistant, even underground, because of its resin content, which also gives it aromatic properties. It has a wide range of uses including furniture, flooring, lathe work, manufacture of propeller shaft bearings for ships, and fence poles. The essential oil derived from B. sarmientoi wood, known as \u201cGuayacol\u201d, \u201cGuajol\u201d or \u201cGuayaco\u201d, is used in the perfume cosmetics industry and in mosquito repellents.

CoP16) annotations should concentrate on those commodities that first appear in international trade as exports from range States and include only those commodities that dominate the trade and the demand for the wild resource. Extracts (including oil) are clearly significant commodities in trade from range States. Although information is sparse, there is little indication that finished products are a major commodity exported by them. The proposed amendment would closely align the annotation for this species to that for Aniba rosaeodora (annotation #12), which is similar in trade. The only difference is a reference to powders in the annotation for Bulnesia. This reference appears technically redundant, as powders are covered by the current definition of extracts (as solid \u2013 fine or coarse particles)2.

La probl\u00e9matique des ressources en eau dans le bassin de la Mano telle que d\u00e9crite dans le rapport diagnostic et d\u00e9battue lors des rencontres des plateformes nationales, laisse entrevoir un besoin de dialogue du fait des usages sp\u00e9cifiques qui se d\u00e9veloppent dans certaines portions du bassin, de la d\u00e9gradation des ressources, des conflits ouverts ou latents entre les populations riveraines, etc. De ce fait, la prise en consid\u00e9ration des diff\u00e9rents usages de l'eau et du r\u00f4le des cat\u00e9gories d\u2019acteurs passe par la concertation et la participation des usagers, ainsi que leur responsabilisation dans la conception et la mise en \u0153uvre des actions.

Ainsi, les plateformes de dialogue ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en place au niveau local dans les portions nationales du bassin de la Mano, comme base de concertation des acteurs pour l\u2019\u00e9chelle transfrontali\u00e8re. Bien que la composition de chaque plateforme tienne compte des acteurs en pr\u00e9sence, la composition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est la suivante : services techniques, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile, usagers de l\u2019eau, groupes sp\u00e9cifiques des femmes, autorit\u00e9s religieuses, etc. Cela r\u00e9pondait au souci de prendre en compte les probl\u00e9matiques locales et de garantir la participation effective des acteurs locaux dans la gestion transfrontali\u00e8re de l\u2019eau. Le processus a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduit par les Minist\u00e8res techniques en charge de la gestion des ressources en eau de la Guin\u00e9e, du Liberia et de la Sierra Leone pour garantir la conformit\u00e9 avec les orientations nationales.

Cette limitation naturelle de la comp\u00e9tence des instances nationales est valable pour la gestion des conflits li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019eau.

Building dialogue to enhance governance of shared water resources in the Mano and Moa/Makona transboundary basins Multiple use of water in the Moa/Makona river Building dialogue to enhance governance of shared water resources in the Mano and Moa/Makona transboundary basins 1 The International Union for Conservation of Nature and of its resources (IUCN) is the largest organization in knowledge development and understanding effective actions aimed at nature conservation. To contribute to the enhancement of cooperation among riparian countries by applying water diplomacy at multiple levels, actions are initiated through projects to assist in the governance of natural resources including water. Thus, IUCN through its BRIDGE (Building River Dialogue and Governance) project supports the countries that share a river basin or lake basin for the implementation of effective water management approaches. In Africa, through its Central and West African Programme, the BRIDGE project is financed by the Swiss Development and Cooperation Agency. The Mano River Union region is one of the intervention zones of the BRIDGE project. 1 INtRoDuCtIoN Cross-border Mano Moa/Makona basins Figure 1 : Map delineating the transboundary Mano and Moa/Makona basins (Source: SG UFM-UICN/BRIDGE, 2015) Building dialogue to enhance governance of shared water resources in the Mano and Moa/Makona transboundary basins 11 Water management context Established in 1973 with the vision of \u00ab ensuring the promotion of an integrated, peaceful and prosperous sub-region, making it the flagship of genuine integration in West Africa\u00bb, Mano River Union is an inter-governmental organization bringing together four West African countries, namely Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. This space is endowed with a large potential of natural resources and many shared water courses that flow across 2 or 3 member countries of the Union into the Ocean. The Mano and Moa rivers (referred to as Makona in Guinea) are part of this region. The regional scope of the Mano River Union is different from the transboundary Basin of Mano River which is one of the multiple transboundary basins in this area, just like those of Moa/Makona, Cavally, Cestos, etc. In fact, the transboundary Mano and Moa/Makona basins that partially cover the national portions located in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, extend respectively over 8 000 km2 and 20 000 km2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c156350-8893-4ab6-94ad-09f31eaea9cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c156350-8893-4ab6-94ad-09f31eaea9cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-dialogue-enhance-governance-shared-water-resources-mano-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Building dialogue to enhance governance of shared water resources in the Mano and Moa/Makona transboundary basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-dialogue-enhance-governance-shared-water-resources-mano-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "325fa5672ef8b4124b1793ec6c476d6d66ead710098a2b7a0264d8486b4f8a09"}, "2": {"node_id": "22a38874-6f28-4b6a-9d0f-4514a922fc4b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-dialogue-enhance-governance-shared-water-resources-mano-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a228e5caaec9c875a60375d6a528d32db844487cffaa5a38f6939615d70110d0"}}, "hash": "cc6c9913b6085a4fc1b58227f5ced5f7855994f55d6e2483aa58342c8039f3fc", "text": "In these basins, IUCN through its BRIDGE project is working in partnership with the MRU General Secretariat to establish appropriate management frameworks at the local and transboundary scales in order to make of water a development and cooperation factor for the well-being of the people that depend on these basins.

This Vision which stems from baseline studies in the three States, based on a participatory approach, will make it possible in the longer run, to adopt reliable and sound cooperation instruments in view of sharing water-related benefits. As a matter of fact, to fill the legal and institutional gaps in water management in the cross-border context of Mano and Moa/Makona, MRU with the support of IUCN through the BRIDGE project, has initiated a shared vision development process for the said basins that cover national portions. The strategic analysis that was drafted on the development issues and priority actions in each national portion of both basins as well as the regional synthesis (Regional Synthesis Report of Current situation in the Mano River and Makona / Moa River Basin, April 2015) have helped the local and national actors to define by consensus a Shared Vision by year 2035.
