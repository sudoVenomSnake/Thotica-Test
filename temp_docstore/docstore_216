This vision is extremely relevant for the Pacific, as reflected in the key findings of a regional report, produced by unDp and other un agencies, and launched at the siDs conference in Apia, samoa, in September 2014. The findings of this report, which are highlighted in more detail in other sections of this annual report, are also in line with the findings of other reports published by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and UNESCAP during 2014. the three main thematic areas of work of the new regional programme are: i) sustainable development and inclusive growth (including poverty reduction and MDGs); ii) democratic governance and peacebuilding; and iii) climate and disaster resilience. They build on the thematic work of the previous Strategic Plan (2008-2013). During 2014 the Centre made efforts to align its existing (and future) programming with the thematic priorities of the new regional programme. Highlights of our work during 2014 included: \u2022 The Centre\u2019s regional parliamentary project initiated a new project with the Fiji Parliament with financial support from Australia, the European Union, Japan and New Zealand. The project has provided much-needed technical assistance to the new parliamentary secretariat, and helped re-establish the legal framework, systems and infrastructure of the new Fiji Parliament. The regional parliamentary project, in partnership with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, continued to support Mock/ Practice Parliaments in various Pacific countries to encourage the political participation of women. \u2022 The Centre\u2019s Regional Anti-Corruption project (a joint project between UNDP and UNODC with funding from Australia) continued to make a signification contribution to the implementation of the united nations convention against corruption (uncAc) in the Pacific during 2014. Ten Pacific countries have already ratified the convention, and Tuvalu is now actively considering accession to the convention. U N D P P a c i f i c c e N t r e A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 4 6 the project also provided technical assistance for the development of new policies and laws on freedom of information (FOI) in Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu. \u2022 A feasibility study on media self-regulation in the Pacific was launched in Samoa in December 2014 in partnership with UNESCO and the Pacific Freedom Forum (PFF). The study provides options for setting up a regional media self-regulatory mechanism. \u2022 The Centre, in partnership with ESCAP, UNICEF, UNFPA and ILO, launched a new report on the State of Human Development in the Pacific at the SIDS Conference in Apia, Samoa. \u2022 The Centre continued its work on Health and Development in the Pacific. It helped establish with WHo a new un inter-Agency task force on the prevention and control of NCDs in the Pacific, provided support to the MDG Acceleration Framework (MAF) project on NCDs in Tonga, and co-hosted a national dialogue on NCDs and the Law in Fiji. \u2022 The Centre produced and launched a joint report (with WHO and OHCHR) on Pacific Trade and Human Rights. the report highlighted the challenges and opportunities posed by trade policy for human rights, including the right to health, in the Pacific. \u2022 The Centre was a key partner with the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organisation (PIPSO) in the organisation of the 2nd Trade Pasifika regional trade exhibition, held in Suva, Fiji. \u2022 The Centre designed and implemented a joint ILO/UNDP Youth Employment Project (Yep) for the siDs conference in samoa, in which samoan youth actively participated in the siDs conference venue in arts and crafts and serving organic food in collaboration with Women in Business, and the Small Business Enterprise Centre. \u2022 The Centre launched Phase 2 of the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme (joint programme with UNCDF) at the SIDS Conference. The programme has gathered significant financial support from Australia, the European Union and New Zealand, and also established a new us$5 million grant funding facility to encourage innovation on inclusive financial services amongst private sector partners. \u2022 The Centre provided technical support to the mid-term review of the Implementation Plan for the Regional Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific, and the formulation of the new Strategy for Climate and Disaster Resilient Development in the Pacific.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd7df230-8d3e-468b-8075-8337ea71498c": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd7df230-8d3e-468b-8075-8337ea71498c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bf6250d569756a4a427eaf0e6bf7ad4819cd16fbfda12a390f1214b7970d455"}, "2": {"node_id": "1975385a-8fad-4e44-8c63-1fff7eef10d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "739a0a9c10d28d99839139d26496198d9caeb44862ed3b17231025500616167f"}}, "hash": "36533d2662c4f5a6b2b57e418a46c6162a6bf9d686292cde4f8819e2407151c1", "text": "\u2022 The Centre provided technical assistance on climate finance issues to Fiji, RMI and vanuatu, including support for climate public expenditure and institutional Reviews (CPEIRs), and the Green Climate Fund Readiness Programme. \u2022 The Centre\u2019s", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a03fa97-c893-4841-ba9f-d66ea931e436": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a03fa97-c893-4841-ba9f-d66ea931e436", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac8d673ed2577a2a79482a35e5f9eb4e46f7bcc5f5d4eb943ea5cc8473280ca6"}}, "hash": "ac8d673ed2577a2a79482a35e5f9eb4e46f7bcc5f5d4eb943ea5cc8473280ca6", "text": "Pacific Risk Resilience Programme (funded by Australia) supported the governments of fiji, solomon islands, tonga and vanuatu to integrate climate change and disaster risk into national and sub-national and sectoral development planning processes. 2014 proved to be a very significant year for the Pacific. In July 2014, Pacific Island leaders endorsed the new Framework for Pacific Regionalism, which replaces the Pacific Plan for Strengthening Regional Cooperation and Integration (adopted in 2005). The framework is intended to support \u2018focused political conversations and settlements that address key strategic issues, including shared sovereignty, pooling resources and delegated decision making\u2019 (forum Leaders Special Retreat, Cook Islands, May 2014). Rather than providing a list of regional priorities, it sets out a robust process and mechanism through which regional priorities will be identified and implemented. The election of Dame Meg Taylor as the new Secretary-General for the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat at the Forum Leaders Meeting in Palau in July 2014 has given fresh impetus to the implementation of the new framework. A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 4 U N D P P a c i f i c c e N t r e 7 the small islands Developing states (siDs) conference was held in Apia, samoa in september 2014, and was the largest inter-governmental conference ever held in the Pacific with more than 4000 delegates. The SAMOA Pathway outcome document which was adopted by the conference identifies many of the development priorities of Pacific countries (e.g. oceans, climate change, NCDs), and will be an important Pacific input into the post-2015 development agenda. Both the framework for Pacific Regionalism, and the Samoa Pathway will be important in helping to guide the work of UNDP and the Pacific Centre in the Pacific region in the coming years. The last year has been a time of significant uncertainty for the Centre, both internally and externally, due to severe cuts in core funding from unDp during 2013, together with a global restructuring of UNDP. Despite these challenges, the centre has continued to provide high quality support to unDp\u2019s programme activities in the Pacific. We have strengthened our collaboration with UNDP country offices (often through joint programmes), and with other partners, and continued to pursue new partnerships with un agencies, regional organisations, development partners, nGos and the private sector. The support of these partners has contributed to the relevance, impact and sustainability of our efforts. The Centre has also continued to benefit from the very generous support of our donor partners, particularly Australia, the european union, new Zealand and Japan. Looking forward, 2015 will be a very important year for the Pacific with the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, and the new sustainable Development Goals (sDGs), and the conclusion of the UNFCCC negotiations on climate change. UNDP and the Pacific Centre, will clearly continue to have a key role to play in helping to support Pacific countries to localise, contextualise and implement the new post-2015 development agenda. Finally let me thank the senior management of UNDP\u2019s Regional Bureau for Asia-Pacific, the members of the centre\u2019s Management team (the three unDp Resident coordinators in fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa) and the staff of the Centre for their support during 2014. The dedication, professionalism and enthusiasm of the centre\u2019s staff, despite very uncertain times, was quite outstanding, and it has been a pleasure to work with all colleagues during the last year. I hope that you will find this report useful and informative, and thank you to all those individuals and partners who have worked with us to support the achievement of sustainable human development in the Pacific during 2014.

Indeed, the common symptoms and images of poverty seen in the poorest developing countries worldwide (such as starving children and landless peasants) do not immediately spring to mind in relation to most of the Pacific region. Typically subsistence production in pic economies acts as a cushion against absolute poverty.

The transition to market economy, typically associated with rapid monetization and urbanization, increases the demand for monetary income (to pay for goods and services offered only through markets such electricity and mobile services) at much faster rate than the increase in the supply of monetary income through income generating opportunities (e.g. formal and informal employment and self-employment). Consequently vulnerability and inequality are rapidly increasing throughout the region, while basic needs poverty is increasing in some pics and declining in others. While lower than most other developing regions, the incidence of food/extreme poverty in the populations of pics is estimated to be very high in pnG (26 percent in 2010); nauru (25 percent in 2006, and, to a lesser extent, fsM and solomon islands (around 11 percent in 2005 and 2006, respectively). The incidence of food poverty declined over the last decade in Vanuatu, Samoa and Tuvalu. This was achieved largely as a consequence of increases in subsistence production as a coping strategy in the face of the food and energy crisis. However these coping mechanisms appear to have failed in tonga where an increase in food poverty was recorded from 1.7 percent (in 2001) to three percent of the population in 2009. Progress towards the achievement of the MDGs in the region has been mixed (PIFS, 2014). Only two Pacific countries \u2013 Cook Islands and Niue, are on track to achieve all the MDGs while some Pacific countries, such as Papua New Guinea, are off track on all the MDGs. 2015 is the last year of the MDGs before the transition to the new post-2015 development framework, and the new Sustainable Development Goals.

Very few PICs have experienced a decline in the incidence of basic-needs poverty in recent years. In Fiji, with its broader-based economy, the incidence of basic-needs poverty declined from 39 percent in 2002-2003 to an estimated 35 percent in 2008-2009. Vanuatu also achieved a slight decrease in basic-needs poverty, with a decline in incidence from 13 percent in 2006, to 12.7 percent in 2010. Meanwhile, the incidence of basic-needs poverty has increased in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and PNG over the last 10 years. There is a significant concentration of vulnerable households marginally above the basic-needs poverty line (one percent to five percent above bnpl) that are susceptible to slip into poverty in the face of economic shocks and/or natural disasters, which are highly frequent in the Pacific. there is no general trend that geographically associates poverty with rural or urban areas throughout the Pacific. While the incidence of basic needs poverty is significantly higher in urban (compared to rural) areas in vanuatu, pnG, solomon islands, and, to a lesser extent, tuvalu; it is higher in rural areas in palau, samoa and Tonga. There are also pockets of persistently high basic-needs poverty incidence, such as in luganville in vanuatu, Rural Momase and the Highlands in pnG and the northern urban and rural parts of Fiji. In line with the increase in basic-needs poverty, the depth and the severity of poverty have increased in samoa and tonga and declined in Fiji and Vanuatu.

Inequality is rising in the Pacific and reaching alarming levels in some countries. Human (multi-dimensional) poverty is significantly higher than income poverty, particularly in rural areas and remote islands, due to weak local governance and, consequently, a lack of capacity to deliver basic services, such as water and sanitation.

Moreover, basic-needs poverty rates are significantly higher in households with more children. As children constitute a high share of the population across the region (43 percent on average), and fertility rates remain relatively high in most pics, large numbers of children will continue to grow up in poverty. Across a sample of four countries (Fiji, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Tuvalu), the poverty rate among households with three or more children was found to be 27 to 63 percent higher than the national average. At the household and community level, evidence from sentinel- site monitoring conducted by unicef and government partners shows a decline in food security at the household level. This despite the fact that in some PICs the proportion of own production in food consumption appears to have increased. This is a reflection of coping strategies by households in the face of declining real incomes. The research also suggests that many households have been decreasing their savings and others have experienced more difficulties in meeting daily expenditures, including education related expenses (even where school fees have been made free) and transport costs to attend health services. These were felt most sharply in urban squatter settlements. the demand for cash incomes is increasing with the growing urbanisation and transition of Pacific economies to market-led cash-based systems. Yet, in recent years PICs have generally recorded low and volatile growth and have been unable to create adequate wage employment opportunities. For many people, especially those in rural areas, the opportunities to earn cash remain limited. Many PICs struggle to deliver basic services, particularly in rural and remote areas, including outer islands. A large proportion of Pacific Islanders lack access to safe drinking water, sanitation and reliable sources of energy. They lack adequate education, health and other opportunities. Thus, multi-dimensional human poverty (hardship) is significantly higher than income poverty throughout many PICs. Most Pacific countries are on track to reduce child mortality. Malaria is endemic to only PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. While Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have made significant progress in reducing the burden of malaria, underpinned by widespread use of bed-nets and strong support by development partners, malaria in PNG remains a cause for concern. Six countries (Kiribati, Marshall Is, PNG, Tuvalu, FSM and Solomon Is) are identified as having a high burden of TB. However, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Solomon Is are on track to reverse the incidence of TB. Drug-resistant TB in the Marshall Is and FSM are making it more difficult for these countries to combat TB. For PNG, as with malaria, TB remains a major public health problem, especially given the HIV/AIDS epidemic the country is facing. Measeles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) is low in PNG and Solomon Islands. Pacific Islands are facing an NCD crisis of considerable magnitude with over 40 percent of the population being diagnosed with a ncD and a world record for diabetes and obesity prevalence. Pacific countries have low life expectancy with NCDs being the major cause of death. The evidence that tobacco, alcohol and ultra-processed foods and drinks are major drivers of epidemics of Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) is well established. The rapid lifestyle (dietary) changes and consequently exploding rates of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancers have enormous social and economic costs. A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 4 U N D P P a c i f i c c e N t r e 1 1 Literacy rates in the Pacific are among the highest in developing countries, above 90 percent. Most PICs are on track to achieve MDG 2 targets, with the exception of PNG and Nauru. Quality of education, however, is a major concern. Enrolment ratios are off-track in several Pacific countries including PNG, Solomon Islands, RMI and Tonga to a lesser extent. Net enrolment ratios drop significantly for secondary and higher education in nearly all PICs. In addition to capacity issues and geographical remoteness progress on MDGs 4, 5 and 6 are closely related to the multidimensional determinants of health such as poverty, food insecurity and the low status of women in some societies. the un state of Human Development Report identifies a number of drivers of vulnerability and exclusion including low, unstable and non- inclusive economic growth, a heavier reliance on external aid, migration, external shocks and the profound economic and social transition underway across the region today, mainly linked to monetisation and commercialization of economic activities, rapid urbanization and the collapse of traditional social protection systems.

External economic shocks are felt through volatility in remittances and tourism revenues, export revenues and resource rents and royalties, and consequently in reduced domestic demand and low economic growth rates. These factors have exacerbated the vulnerabilities of pics and the recent global financial crises have taken their toll on many Pacific Island countries. PICs\u2019 capacities to attract foreign investments also vary considerably within and across countries. This, in turn, influences the rate of, and the beneficiaries from, employment creation. Moreover, the bulk of foreign investment received by pics is extractive in nature and has few linkages with the rest of the economy and stimulates minimal job creation. Thus with little development emphasis on livelihoods/informal economies, the increasing trend of rural to urban migration of young people further exacerbates the issue of youth unemployment and poverty in the Pacific. there is evidence in the recent poverty studies in several pics suggesting that there is rising income inequality even in countries where there has been a relatively significant reduction in basic needs poverty over the last 10 year (e.g. Fiji). Understanding the main causes of the current income inequality trends across countries will require further in-depth analytic studies, particularly to link trends to policies. Notwithstanding data limitations and the need for in- depth studies, it is, however, plausible to conclude that the pace of urbanization, monetization, resources boom and internal migrations are highly correlated with changes in income inequality. While gender parity in terms of education is impressive, women\u2019s economic and political empowerment remains a major challenge. Non-agriculture employment participation rates range between 30 to 50 percent for all women throughout the Pacific region. Gender discrimination in terms of wage and work conditions is still prevalent. While Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, niue, tonga, tuvalu and vanuatu have shown progress in expanding female employment, in Fiji the rate has declined, partially due to the reduction in employment in the garment industry.

The average number of seats in Parliament held by women, based on latest reports for all PICs is merely 5.7 percent.1 Tahiti, Vanuatu, Tonga and FSM have no women in Parliament. Violence against women is widespread across the Pacific and remains an issue of concern. Cook Islands is currently in the process of drafting a new Family Law Bill that will help ensure national commitments to gender equality and the full implementation of CEDAW are met. economic trenDs in tHe pacific The Pacific region has experienced low and volatile economic growth over the last few years. economic growth rates (excluding resource-rich pnG) have been generally low, averaging only 1.5 -2 percent per annum between 2007 and 2014, barely above the average population growth rate (see Table 1). Although high commodity prices and other external conditions have impacted negatively on the economies of the pics (pnG being the main exception), economic growth has, in large part, also been constrained by domestic factors. These have included political instability, poor macroeconomic management, corruption, poor governance, and a lack of will to implement much needed public sector and public enterprise reforms. The remoteness and geographic isolation of the majority of PICs has made it difficult to develop economically. Other key constraints, such as vulnerability to natural disasters, susceptibility to adverse global economic conditions, narrow production base, and limited export variety exacerbate the challenges PICs face. Pacific countries are heavily exposed to commodity price fluctuations and are, therefore, very vulnerable to food insecurity and the impacts of a volatile international food and energy market. Many of the economic challenges facing PICs are determined by the structure, rate, stability and sustainability of economic growth (e.g. high cost of doing business, low levels of productivity, reliance on foreign aid and remittances and narrow economic base).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c18288e8-4886-428b-83bb-974cf4a5f594": {"__data__": {"id_": "c18288e8-4886-428b-83bb-974cf4a5f594", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17efe16d23c5c8ea58d9c209fa8c840296308683a65237d43e20ba0206f3e9ee"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b7d56ee-dba6-44b4-8b5b-c0b12bb11585", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1aae35267cc87d1cbb680571b3f55062a9f54b4d83cf16190b02bf7117fb60c"}}, "hash": "63b64d7dab74c70d4f90a91df95e0c6fd4fb7389006c0dcfc5465ac64178784f", "text": "table 1: real growth rate of gDP (% per year) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Papua New Guinea (1998 constant) 7.2 6.6 6.0 7.4 11.1 9.8 5.5 6.0 fiji (2005 constant) -0.9 1.1 -1.3 0.1 1.9 2.2 2.8 2.4 vanuatu (2006 constant) 5.2 6.5 3.3 1.6 1.4 2.0 3.2 3.4 Solomon Islands (1985 factor cost) 10.7 7.2 -1.0 6.9 10.6 4.8 2.5 4.0 Melanesian regional average 5.5 5.3 1.7 4.0 6.3 4.7 3.5 4.0 fsM (2004 constant) -2.0 -2.5 0.9 2.5", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2d02b9d-606a-4510-b75d-054db9aad12f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2d02b9d-606a-4510-b75d-054db9aad12f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14c43a9de8bc4dbffeff100ef19a59fc64383170123eb58042d9980d6f99717d"}, "3": {"node_id": "55ff394d-3ba4-4544-a4ea-f893c5483818", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fdb50ff80e66c346cb8e6925e16fbe70d273b0ca931b00026caf475611b3c28f"}}, "hash": "0f4bfca5b6341af2ecb29963c9f930d004b99244818b557cde60913f3239f50e", "text": "2.1 1.4 1.0 1.5 Nauru (2007 constant) -10.8 - -18.6 -11.3 3.8 4.9 4.5 6.0 Kiribati (2006 constant) 7.5 2.8 -0.7 -0.5 3.3 2.5 2.0 2.3 palau (2005 constant) 0.7 -6.1 -4.6 -0.4 6.9 6.3 3.0 3.0 Marshall island (2004 constant) 3.2 -1.9 -1.5 5.6 0.8 1.9 2.3 1.5 Micronesian regional average -0.3 -1.9 -4.9 -0.8 3.4 3.4 2.6 2.9 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 cook islands (2006 constant) -0.2 -3.5 1.0 -2.9 1.0 4.6 3.2 3.5 samoa (2002 constant) 5.8 4.3 -5.1 0.1 2.3 1.2 0.9 2.0 tonga (2010/2011 constant) -4.5 1.9 3.2 3.3 2.9 0.8 0.5 0.3 tuvalu (2005 constant) 6.4 11.6 -2.3 -1.4 -0.6 1.2 1.3 1.5 Polynesian regional average 1.9 3.6 -0.8 -0.2 1.4 2.0 1.5 1.8 Pacific Islands Regional Average 2.2 2.3 -1.6 0.8 3.7 3.4 2.5 2.9 Source: The State of Human Development in the Pacific 2014. 1 This average uses the 2006 pre-coup figures for Fiji Islands. A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 4 U N D P P a c i f i c c e N t r e 1 3 it is clear that in the recent past economic policies and growth strategies in pics have not yielded the desired levels of economic growth. Nor have they addressed issues of hardship, vulnerability or exclusion. Many countries are having difficulty in balancing competing national priorities with severe resource constraints. Countries are struggling to enhance the effectiveness of limited, and in some cases diminishing aid resources towards the achievement of better development outcomes. Therefore a much stronger pro-poor policy focus and commitment is required if progress is to be achieved towards reducing the level of hardship and the extent of vulnerability. Weak fiscal situations and poorly defined budget priorities compound the problems. Budget allocations are not necessarily responsive to the needs of the poorest and most disadvantaged; they are not focused, for example, on the need to achieve the MDG targets at the aggregate level. Rarely are budgets directly linked even to existing national development strategies. Many of the needed economic reforms, particularly in making the investment and regulatory environment more transparent for private sector growth and investment and thus broadly pro- poor, would yield significant economic growth and poverty reducing gains at a minimum cost to the governments in terms of foregone revenues or up-front financial costs. Indeed governments would ultimately gain significantly from greater tax revenues from new investments and employment creation. The precarious and volatile state of government finances is illustrated in Table 2. In 2012, 10 of the PICs had budget deficits and four of these were more than 2.5 percent of GDP. For many PICs some of their primary sources of revenue are beyond their immediate policy influence or control. Fish licence revenues and income from investments are both uncertain and volatile. Low rates of economic growth are often the result, in part, of declines in foreign exchange income from remittances and tourism. If domestic consumption expenditure is weak then revenues from consumption taxes will also be weak. If business profitability declines then corporate taxes will also fall, as well as employment, thus reducing income taxes. it has been argued2 that declining governance standards are also contributing to poor economic performance in the Pacific. Increasing health and education costs are also putting pressure on government budgets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55ff394d-3ba4-4544-a4ea-f893c5483818": {"__data__": {"id_": "55ff394d-3ba4-4544-a4ea-f893c5483818", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14c43a9de8bc4dbffeff100ef19a59fc64383170123eb58042d9980d6f99717d"}, "2": {"node_id": "b2d02b9d-606a-4510-b75d-054db9aad12f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f4bfca5b6341af2ecb29963c9f930d004b99244818b557cde60913f3239f50e"}}, "hash": "fdb50ff80e66c346cb8e6925e16fbe70d273b0ca931b00026caf475611b3c28f", "text": "Increasing health and education costs are also putting pressure on government budgets. 2 For example in Hardship and Poverty in the Pacific, ADB, Nov 2004; & Governance in the Pacific : Focus for Action 2005 - 09, ADB 2005 U N D P P a c i f i c c e N t r e A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 4 1 4 table 2: fiscal Balance of Pic governments (% of gDP) country 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 cook islands 3.3 -2.2 0.2 0.7 -2.2 fiji 0.5 -4.0 -2.1 -1.4 -1.6 Kiribati -19.6 -12.8 -10.6 -14.2 -20.0 Marshall islands 3.4 1.3 4.5 3.7 -1.1 Micronesia, federated states of -1.7 1.6 0.5 0.6 1.2 nauru -10.1 0.3 6.0 0.6 -1.2 palau -3.7 -6.1 -1.4 -3.5 -3.2 papua new Guinea -2.2 0.6 0.7 2.3 -1.2 samoa -1.5 -3.1 -6.6 -5.3 -4.5 solomon islands -6.1 -16.1 1.4 5.1 -1.9 tonga 3.0 -0.9 -5.3 -7.4 -2.9 tuvalu -0.7 -3.1 -30.0 -4.6 7.6 vanuatu 2.1 1.0 -2.0 -2.3 \u2026 Source: ADB Asian Development Outlook 2013 Update lack of domestic employment opportunities and increasing youth unemployment particularly in Melanesia and in some Micronesian countries, together with the growing numbers of people engaged in temporary labour mobility, both domestically and internationally are becoming critical", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea6bd670-3985-47b1-a04f-b2e0728ea608": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea6bd670-3985-47b1-a04f-b2e0728ea608", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92e64147c2ee2156747643fb4d15234dd46e79e0833b67085ff76407ec3a1673"}}, "hash": "92e64147c2ee2156747643fb4d15234dd46e79e0833b67085ff76407ec3a1673", "text": "human development policy issues for many PICs.

However, financial inclusion efforts in the Pacific region retained the support and commitment of donors and both public and private stakeholders during 2014. Stakeholders continued to invest in financial inclusion initiatives though increased scrutiny of the sustainability of expansion of the financial sector is expected. Central banks in the region renewed their efforts to meet their financial inclusion goals and commitments, including the 2020 MoneypAcific Goals3, their Maya Declaration4 commitments and National Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy Strategies. Regional central banks reported again on their progress against the 2020 MoneypAcific goals to the forum economic Ministers\u2019 Meeting (FEMM) in Honiara, Solomon Islands in July 2014; and the South Pacific central bank Governors Meeting again held sessions on financial inclusion at its December 2014 meeting in Suva, Fiji. The Alliance for Financial Inclusion\u2019s Pacific Island Working Group held two regional meetings during the year and converted to a more permanent Pacific Island Regional Initiative. In addition to the six previous members,5 the national Reserve bank of tonga joined the group in September, agreeing to attend the group regularly. Both Fiji and Solomon Islands achieved their national financial inclusion strategy objectives in 2014, reaching 150,000 and 70,000 unbanked people ahead of schedule \u2013 effectively halving the number of people with no access to basic financial services. Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu continued to make advances towards achieving their financial inclusion goals. 3 The Pacific region\u2019s Central Banks and Finance Ministries adopted the MoneyPACIFIC goals, a set of four regional goals, to guide national level actions and to monitor progress. These 2020 MoneyPACIFIC Goals are supported and endorsed by the Forum Economic Ministers\u2019 Meeting (FEMM) and South Pacific Central Bank Governors. 4 The Maya Declaration is the first global and measurable set of commitments by developing and emerging country governments to unlock the economic and social potential of the 2.5 billion \u2018unbanked\u2019 people through greater financial inclusion. The Maya Declaration is an initiative of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. 5 Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste and Vanuatu. A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 4 U N D P P a c i f i c c e N t r e 1 5 Donors also showed support for expanding financial inclusion in 2014 despite cuts in aid budgets in other areas, affirming the belief that the private sector can play a key role in developing and delivering inclusive and sustainable financial services, which in turn supports inclusive economic growth. Regional donors joined world leaders and development organizations (G-20, IMF, World Bank, UN, to name a few) in acknowledging that financial inclusion is an important ingredient for social and economic progress, particularly for developing countries. In particular, the Governments of Australia, new Zealand and the european union provided vocal as well as financial support for financial inclusion in the region during the year. In addition, the Pacific Donors\u2019 Access to finance Working Group met twice in 2014 in an effort to maintain and improve collaboration of efforts within the sector. In addition to Australia\u2019s DFAT, the ADB, EIB, IFC, New Zealand\u2019s MFAT and the United Nations, the IMF, through its Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC), became a regular attendee in 2014. the region\u2019s private sector, led by commercial banks, continued to invest in expanding digital financial services in the Pacific in 2014. ANZ\u2019s mobile phone linked bank account product, goMoneytM , was expanded in 2014 and now operates in pnG, samoa, solomon islands and Vanuatu. Westpac increased in-store operations across the Pacific, and BSP expanded its merchant-banking network and merchant support throughout pnG, fiji, and solomon islands, increasing the points of sale for financial services significantly. Insurance companies continued to explore the expansion of services in Fiji and PNG.

One concern for financial inclusion in the region concerns the increased focus on Anti-Money laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism (AMl-cft) regulations in Australia, the UK, and in the USA. These regulations can have severe consequences for banks, who would be held responsible for infractions made by their account holders, which are impacting banks and money transfer operators (MTOs.) Regional banks began rapidly closing MTO bank accounts, with two major banks, the commonwealth bank and the national Australia bank, closing all their MTO accounts in Australia during 2014. Westpac announced that it would follow suit. It is feared that these developments will increase remittance prices, reduce competition and encourage the use of informal channels in the region. In October 2014, the World Bank reported that the cost of sending remittances from Australia to the Pacific Islands is increasing \u2013 this in a region where the cost of sending money is already high (above 10 percent), and several countries (e.g. Tonga) are heavily dependent on remittances. In addition to reducing the money that remittance receivers get, it is widely acknowledged that closing of these bank accounts will encourage the use of informal channels, which will reduce both financial inclusion and transparency in the region. PFTAC, PFIP, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) and the World Bank Group (WBG) jointly prepared and submitted a paper on the topic to the FEMM in 2014.

Challenges persist ranging from political instability and corruption, financial and human capacity limitations in governance institutions, weak policy and regulatory frameworks, and limited access to services for remote communities. In addition, women\u2019s participation in politics (including presence in the executive and legislative branches of government) remains limited. In terms of political developments, 2014 was a significant year for the Pacific with elections held in five Pacific Island countries. Vanuatu had its first municipal (local government) elections under the amended Municipalities Act which now provides for five reserved seats for women from the 17 seats on municipal councils for Port Vila. Tonga had their second ever democratic elections in november and a record number of tongans registered and voted, with 105 candidates contesting the election including 16 women. Solomon Islands had their first elections since the withdrawal of the Regional Assistance Mission to solomon islands (RAMsi) and under their new political parties Integrity Act 2014. Fiji had their first democratic elections since the military takeover in December 2006, and the fijifirst political party won the majority of the seats in the new 50-member parliament. Cook Islands also had elections in 2014, however an electoral petition was filed calling for a recount which resulted in the ruling party losing its one seat and a by-election has been ruled for next year in another electorate. Regionally, the number of women in Parliament has increased from 4.7 percent to 5.7 percent but in some countries there were setbacks with no women being elected. The four countries currently with no women in parliament are FSM, Tokelau, Tonga and Vanuatu. Niue has the highest percentage of women in Parliament at 15 percent, followed by Fiji at 14 percent. In July 2014, Pacific leaders, at their annual leaders meeting in Koror, Palau, endorsed the new Framework for Pacific Regionalism, which now replaces the Pacific Plan. The new guiding document for Pacific regionalism outlines key values and development objectives of sustainable development, economic growth, strengthened governance, and human security. The framework is intended to support \u2018focused political conversations and settlements that address key strategic issues, including shared sovereignty, pooling resources and delegated decision making\u2019 (Forum Leaders Special Retreat, Cook Islands, May 2014). Rather than providing a list of regional priorities, it sets out a robust process and mechanism through which regional priorities will be identified and implemented. The largest international conference held in the Pacific, the UN Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) was held in Apia, Samoa in September 2014.

Five of its countries are among the top 15 most \u2018at risk of disasters\u2019 globally, and eight out of 20 countries in the world with the highest average annual disaster losses by GDP are Pacific countries (World Bank, 2012). At the same time, the science of climate change has become clearer as indicated in the release of the 2013 Working Group i contribution to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) on the Physical Science Basis. It notes that warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia.6 In the Pacific, 2014 was marked by numerous disasters including flash floods in Solomon Islands, Cyclone Ian in Tonga, Cyclone Lusi in Vanuatu and drought in Fiji. These recurring events have led to severe impacts on the livelihoods of communities affecting both economic assets (such as agriculture) as well as leading to social impacts mainly through the loss of housing and livelihoods. For instance, in the aftermath of the flash floods in Solomon Islands there were an estimated 12,000 internally displaced persons seeking refuge in 27 evacuation centres, mainly in Honiara. Overall more than 50,000 people, or a tenth of the total population, were affected by the disaster. in 2014, several pics approved new and/or updated disaster, energy, environment or climate change-related policy instruments. This includes the Papua New Guinea National Climate compatible Development Management policy, the Kiribati Joint implementation plan on climate change and Disaster Risk Management and the Republic of nauru framework for climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction (RONAdapt) and the FSM Climate Change Act. To note, the FSM Climate Change Act creates legal obligations for departments and offices in the implementation of the integrated Disaster Risk Management and climate change policy promulgated in December 2009 and further strengthens the mainstreaming of activities and policies in implementing climate change and disaster management framework of actions. These instruments will help guide sustainable development in these countries in relation to climate, energy, environment and climate change. At the regional level, the draft strategy for Disaster and climate Resilient Development in the Pacific (SRDP) was developed through an extensive consultation process led by Pacific Island countries and territories and guided by the principles of inclusion, leadership, and ownership. It is expected that the SRDP (which will be submitted for approval by Pacific leaders in 2015) will facilitate the Pacific to combine and harness the expertise of specialists in working both the disaster risk management (DRM) and climate change fields. This initiative follows the leadership of pics, who have already developed Joint national Action plans (JnAps) and other mechanisms for embedding disaster and climate resilience into development processes. 2014 marked significant milestones for the climate change, disaster risk management and development communities both in the Pacific and globally. In June, the Pacific held the Pacific platform meeting which brought together members of disaster, climate change and finance communities. In September 2014, the Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) conference was held in Apia, samoa were issues of climate change, disaster, energy and environment were top of the agenda. Later that month, the United Nations Secretary General held a Climate change summit in new York which raised global ambitions for the united nations framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. Following this, in Lima, Peru, in December 2014 the cop20 of the unfccc met and produced a draft for the 2015 climate deal to be struck in Paris (COP21). 6 ipcc WGi AR5 spM U N D P P a c i f i c c e N t r e A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 4 1 8 Looking forward, 2015 will be a pivotal year for the Pacific in terms of climate change and other related issues.

The current UNDP Strategic Plan was approved in September 2013 by the UNDP executive board, a steering and oversight body consisting of 36 un member countries elected on a rotating basis. In January 2014 the Executive Board approved the new UNDP Regional Programme for Asia-Pacific 2014-2017, to replace the previous regional programme which ran from 2008-2013. This new regional programme is fully aligned with the UNDP Strategic Plan, and will guide the work of the Pacific Centre, and the Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (APRC) in Bangkok. During 2014 the Pacific Centre developed a new project document to provide details of how the new regional programme would be implemented in the Pacific region. This project document, which runs for the period 2014-2017, was developed through an extensive consultation process with key stakeholders \u2013 Pacific governments, donors, development partners, regional organizations, nGos and other un agencies, and was approved by the unDp Directorate in December 2014. In support of the new regional programmme the Centre is now implementing three major Pacific regional projects \u2013 Effective Governance, Inclusive Growth (including Sustainable and Resilient Development) and Financial Inclusion. Governance arranGements The Pacific Centre is part of the regional architecture of UNDP\u2019s Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, with the Manager of the Centre reporting directly to the Deputy Regional Director, who was based at the Regional Bureau in New York until September 2014. This position now sits in the bangkok Regional Hub (bRH), which replaced the previous ApRc as a result of the UNDP global restructuring process. The Centre\u2019s work is reviewed annually by a Management Committee that is chaired by the Deputy Regional Director and includes the three Pacific Resident Representatives. Guidance on the annual work plan for the Centre is also provided by a Projects Steering Committee that includes country and regional organization representatives. The Pacific Centre also participates in the Board of the UNDP Joint Operations Centre (JOC) which was established in April 2011. JOC operates as a service centre hub, providing operational services to the UNDP Fiji Multi-Country Office, Pacific Centre, Solomon Islands Sub-Office and other UN agencies. our partnersHips During 2014, the Pacific Centre maintained a focus on strengthening partnerships with regional and national stakeholders. In this context, the region\u2019s intergovernmental organizations are key Centre partners, including PIFS, SPC, the University of the South Pacific (USP) and the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organisation (PIPSO). The Centre also partners with Pacific parliaments, national Reserve/central banks, private sector organizations, nGos, un agencies and other donors/development partners.

Journalists from the four Melanesian countries (fiji, pnG, solomon islands and vanuatu) were invited to participate in a regional workshop. Following the sub-regional awareness raising workshop, the journalists were invited to submit proposals for small grants to develop a more in-depth feature story focusing on informal settlements in their communities with a view to highlighting the human rights elements. through the small grants, the journalists were able to develop strong media products using print, web, radio, and video highlighting the entitlements of the informal settlement dwellers in their case study, and the obligations of their national government as the duty bearer in terms of their right to adequate housing. supportinG uncac ratification anD implementation In 2014, the Pacific Centre continued progressing its work on the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) through the framework of the joint UNDP-UNODC Pacific Regional Anti- Corruption Project funded by Australia/DFAT.

Spearheaded by the peace and unity committee of tonga, this national strategy recognizes that a more concerted effort is needed to ensure that peacebuilding efforts going forward have better impact so that the country can avoid the costly waste of scarce resources, time and effort. the strategy, developed through a national consultation held in september 2014, lays out a very broad approach for advancing the overarching goal of peace, unity, and development in Tonga. It advocates for on-going dialogue on the challenges to peace and unity in Tonga and defines five priority areas and some practical actions that \u2013 if implemented - will help bolster peace in Tonga. It provides guidance for the development of collaborative action. It seeks to build some important platforms for coordination, collaboration and monitoring so that future initiatives undertaken on behalf of peace have the desired \u201cadd up\u201d effect. Finally, it identifies some key capacity gaps that - if filled \u2013 could have sustainable impacts. the strategy is meant to be practical and cost effective; many of the actions can be undertaken if people would do what is in the scope of their current responsibilities. It also recognizes that the task of building peace is the prerogative of no one and the responsibility of all. It is meant to encourage the engagement of every Tongan, individually and collectively, as well as visitors to the islands, in the noble enterprise of building a violence-free, tolerant, united and happy nation. everyone can contribute to peace by looking introspectively at their own attitudes, behaviours, and beliefs and by seeking to live in ways that give expression to positive social values. Participating in skill building workshops, praying about peace, organizing friends and family to advocate on peace related issues or engaging in community activities that promotes peace and non-violence are all ways that individuals can make a difference. in this way, the strategy outlines a path to a more resilient, united, prosperous and peaceful Tonga.

The initiative is designed to provide civil society organisations, communities and local government officials with information, skills, tools and platforms to advance human rights, foster equitable services delivery, strengthen decision-making, enable voice, promote non-discrimination and enhance transformative leadership as it relates to supporting Fiji\u2019s democratic transition. During 2014 SCEFI had a number of significant achievements \u2022 SCEFI has developed methodologies and provided capacity building especially among youth organizations in collaborative advocacy. The methodology has emphasized the use of art and theatre in the development of advocacy campaigns. As a result, numerous youth organizations, including provincial and national Youth councils of fiji have greater skills and confidence in designing and implementing youth empowerment advocacy campaigns at both the local and national level. \u2022 The project has provided a unique catalyst for increasing engagement among CSOs working on similar issues to work together to address various issues at the national level, in particular issues around mental health and suicide prevention, access for people with disabilities, and youth and women\u2019s empowerment. These efforts are enabling increased participation of young people and women in decision-making, especially at the local level and helping reduce discriminatory attitudes and behaviours. \u2022 The project provided 43 small grants for civil society initiatives to advance democracy from the bottom up. A total of US$610,425.08 in grant funds was disbursed in three rounds to primarily small, informal, marginalized and/or vulnerable civil society organisations. Through these grants, these organizations gained skills in proposal writing; financial acquitting; project management and communication; problem solving; monitoring and evaluation; coalition building and advocacy skills as well as information on core democratic principles and values. Grantees were also given on-going support and mentoring for the implementation of their efforts. The projects are in one way or another emblematic experiences that afford many important lessons for the building of a culture of peace and democracy across Fiji. \u2022 SCEFI\u2019s partnerships with the Fijian Government including the i-Taukei Affairs Board and its 14 provincial councils, the Ministry of Youth and sports, Rural and Maritime Development are helping make governmental bodies more receptive and open to citizen engagement and action.

Furthermore, SCEFI engagement has helped build greater receptiveness and broader donor engagement in governance strengthening efforts. A multi-donor Governance Analysis mission took place in Fiji in November 2014. The Pacific Centre contributed significantly to this exercise both in providing insights on local level governance from scefi\u2019s experience as well as on the status of national security in fiji as it relates to democratic governance of the security sector.

At each of the six forums, approximately 50 youth representatives came together to discuss key challenges facing fiji\u2019s young people and potential strategies to promote youth engagement during Fiji\u2019s transition to democracy. comprising 45 percent of the population, fiji\u2019s young people claim a strong stake in Fiji\u2019s economic, social and political development. Today, many Fijians are shifting away from traditional lifestyles centred on small rural communities that once provided secure livelihoods and a strong sense of identity. As a consequence, the country is now facing new levels of inequality and increased urbanization, marked in particular by a migration to peri-urban, informal settlements. Worrying trends in public health, education, housing and employment are also having a visible impact on youth. to confront these and other challenges, fiji\u2019s youth leaders must be equipped with the kinds of skills that will enable them to effectively participate in decision-making processes at all levels and to do so using non-violent, problem-solving methods. The elections in september 2014 and the establishment of the new fijian parliament thereafter, provided a highly anticipated opportunity for youth engagement at the national level. Capitalizing on the momentum that followed the elections, the Pacific Centre, through the european union funded scefi project, co-developed the Youth voices for transition forums with the nYcf to build relevant capacities among youth leaders and provide opportunities for dialogue on youth-focused, development priorities. Through panel presentations and small-groups discussions, youth leaders gained a better appreciation of the relationship between peace and democracy and the role of fiji\u2019s governance institutions. At the end of the six-city/town tour, personal messages from nearly 300 young people were written on a peace scroll highlighting their concerns and their commitment to building a peaceful Fiji. In addition, Fiji youth leaders crafted a message that will be delivered to the Fiji Parliament during the 2015 session. the six-city/town dialogue events also included the participation of the prime Minister\u2019s Office, Fiji\u2019s Security Services, the i-Taukei Affairs Board as well as Fiji\u2019s main peacebuilding NGOs. The diversity of participants in this initiative indicated wide support of youth engagement and voice in building a more democratic Fiji.

The Trade Pasifika 2014 was coordinated and guided by a steering committee and secretariat, and boasted a total of 28 sponsors, suppliers and development partners as well as 96 exhibitors. The Pacific Centre was a key partner, and sponsor of Trade Pasifika 2014. An added feature of Trade Pasifika 2014 was that it distinctly featured Pacific women and youth entrepreneurs. The event also provided an opportunity for businesses to establish contact and develop business leads, collect market related information, and to meet and network with Pacific Island businesses, including business enablers (investors, government representatives, etc.). The tradeshow featured individual PICs showcasing the best of their markets distinctively portraying their country\u2019s export potential, investment opportunities and tourism opportunities. For buyers, it was an opportunity to meet suppliers and producers of highly valued Pacific products, destined for niche markets. Fifteen small and micro enterprises (SME) businesses across the Pacific region are being supported with financial and technical assistance for labelling and packaging, quality assurance and standards including hazard analysis, critical control point (HACCP), and ISO certification. This is a joint initiative of PIPSO, Fair Trade NZ and Pacific Cooperation Foundation NZ, with support from the Pacific Centre. The Pacific Centre has been actively engaged with the private sector in the Pacific to ensure their contribution to the Post-2015 Development Agenda and the proposed SDGs. In 2014, two regional consultations were held in Fiji and in Vanuatu. These consultations clearly demonstrated a critical role for the private sector in: \u2022 Establishing a framework towards green economy and businesses through financial incentives and alignment with international standards and norms. \u2022 Creating and strengthening green businesses and industries especially SMEs based on innovation, technology adaptation and transfer, regional knowledge networks and sustainability in operations. \u2022 Fostering a continuous and effective public-private dialogue.

The State of Human Development in the Pacific: A Report on Vulnerability and Exclusion presents specific policy options on how to foster more inclusive and sustainable human development during a time of profound change in the Pacific region. It also offers concrete recommendations to reverse a rising trend of poverty, vulnerability and exclusion in Pacific Island countries. in a time of rapid change, the Report examines the stark realities of a region in which one in four people are now living below their national basic-needs poverty line; and also have limited access to essential services such as education and health services. Obesity, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases are on the rise throughout the region. the Report presents a picture of a changing social and economic landscape in the region, based on the latest available data and new analysis. Economies are shifting from traditional systems built on the exchange of products to market-led cash-based ones; young people are migrating from their villages to find jobs in cities and abroad, leaving women, the very old and the very young behind; traditional family and social protection systems are in decline; climate change is threatening agricultural production and traditional livelihoods and intensifying the impact of natural disasters. \u201cYouth and women deserve particular attention,\u201d said Haoliang Xu, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director, Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific. \u201cLow and volatile growth has made job creation increasingly difficult. Women have lower access to employment and often work in the informal sector with no labour rights, social security or welfare. For youth, the unemployment rate is 23 percent, on average, or twice the global average.\u201d the Report provides a useful analysis of poverty and exclusion data and offers recommendations on how to strategically address exclusion, inequality and vulnerabilities in the Pacific.

Concerted campaigns to promote better nutrition and physical exercise and discourage smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can help address the early onset of non-communicable diseases. target poverty reduction programmes \u2013 If interventions to reduce poverty are to be effective and financially feasible, they must be based on approaches that allocate resources and assistance directly to poor households. Resources should be channelled to benefit those most in need. Better use of data from household income and expenditure surveys can help to inform and target poverty reduction initiatives.

In the Solomon Islands, PFIP assisted CBSI to organize the country\u2019s first mobile banking forum, bringing together three commercial banks and mobile network operators (Mnos) to take stock of the roll out of mobile banking in the country, discuss challenges and early lessons learnt on digital financial services. In addition, PFIP supported the first National Financial Inclusion Expo in the Solomon Islands and helped coordinate the Pacific Donors Private Sector Development meeting as well as the Access to finance meetings in sydney, Australia and Auckland, new Zealand. PFIP also played a key role in the SIDS Private Sector Partnership Forum in Apia, Samoa in September 2014, presenting on financial inclusion and launching a new grants facility to support product innovation development. DeepeninG financial services After starting pfip\u2019s second phase in July 2014, pfip launched a call for expressions of interest (eoi) under the new pfip Grants facility at the siDs conference in samoa in september 2014. This new round of funding makes available US$5 million, which will continue supporting innovative products and channels to bring appropriate financial services to low-income clients through continuing with existing private sector partnerships and developing new ones. As of December 2014, 10 potential partners have submitted proposals, some of which will be funded in 2015. In Solomon Islands, the PFIP partnership with Bank of the South Pacific (BSP) picked up in 2014, expanding branchless banking across the country. BSP trains local agents, equipping them with efpos machines, to host access points in community shops which offer basic cash-in, cash-out, and savings accounts \u2013 almost exclusively to clients who are new to banking. During 2014, the Agent network grew to 26 agents and monthly transactions grew significantly. Westpac Bank also successfully launched its mobile banking services, complementing their branchless banking work. PFIP also investigated new innovations in 2014 through conducting a feasibility study on informal savings groups in solomon islands and assisting the department of community Development in looking at Government to person (G2P) transfers in New Ireland, PNG. financial competency PFIP\u2019s activities in Financial Competency also grew in 2014. Most notably in Fiji, the PFIP FinEd programme is capitalizing on years of curriculum development, teacher trainings, pilots, and phased roll outs to launch a full country-wide scale-up next year. The Ministry of Education fully integrated the pfip-developed fined curriculum into all national primary education syllabi in 2014, to be rolled out in the 2015 school year. An additional 472 teachers in seven school centres were trained in the curriculum in 2014, with more planned for 2015. With the fiji fined programme now in a mature state, pfip explored more avenues for adult- level financial literacy activities during 2014. PFIP collaborated with the Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GsMA) and mWomen in conducting a training-of-trainers workshop for 27 representatives of key stakeholders in Fiji. A Mobile Skills Training manual, together with posters and pamphlets on how to use sMs, mobile banking and bill payment were produced and distributed to stakeholders. In partnership with GSMA and UN Women in PNG, PFIP contributed to the development of a Mobile Financial Literacy Training toolkit targeting women.

However, since the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme (pfip) began supporting the central bank of solomon islands (cbsi) efforts to build a more inclusive financial sector, large numbers of Solomon Islanders are gaining access to banking and payment services. New bank accounts have more than doubled from 2010 to 2014 and the latest quarterly financial inclusion data indicates that over 50 percent of the adult population is now \u2018banked\u2019. In 2010, PFIP assisted the CBSI to facilitate a national level workshop on financial inclusion that ultimately led to the formation of the National Financial Inclusion Task Force (NFIT). In February 2011, the Task Force had its first meeting, officially approving the National Action Agenda, and a terms of reference for its operations. The Task Force includes representatives from ministries, women\u2019s organisations, commercial banks, donors, credit unions, and the Chamber of Commerce. PFIP sits on the Task Force and has remained an active member. In 2012, the CBSI amended the Central Bank Act to include financial inclusion and financial literacy as a core mandate.

New or just recognized HIV epidemics amongst MSM and transgender people are identified in various low and middle income countries, with high and rapidly rising rates of HIV transmission reported in Asia and the Pacific. Projections of the Asian epidemic indicate that close to 50 percent of all new HIV infections occurring annually in Asia will be identified among MSM by 2020, unless intensified HIV prevention measures are scaled-up, an increase from 13 percent in 2008. Sex between men accounts for approximately a third of known HIV transmission in Asia and the Pacific, although this is likely to be underreported. Many of these infections are occurring and will continue to occur among young men and young transgender people as well, with most clustering in urban areas of the Region. Experts now recognize that in order to stop the spread of HIV among MSM and transgender people, the blocking of access to health care and prevention services, and the failure to fully recognize other basic individual rights, must stop. Access to adequate health services and social support is recognized as a fundamental human right. Yet stigma and discrimination in health care settings, including homophobia, sexism and transphobic policies and practices, prevent open and welcoming access for MSM and transgender people. The cause is often the negative attitudes of clinicians and support staff together with incomplete or inaccurate knowledge about sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). In 2011, WHO issued guidelines identifying that significant barriers to the uptake of services included insensitive communication and counselling with MSM and transgender clients and insufficient skills related to male sexual health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88f8ffda-645b-419f-84cc-d9a707132143": {"__data__": {"id_": "88f8ffda-645b-419f-84cc-d9a707132143", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ab1a4e2e7f6f3f39b35cd1e827a62dc6045b4e4b5d100c64155a13a7080b110"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc457d94-02b2-4810-bf3e-a0ff9114ae57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bbf556ce1c594f361d9c187e472b97b7990132f59a8f11e35341af0d859a51c"}}, "hash": "16069576de0be195157d477a66cbdb6c84fa96ec6e238be059130765944feef1", "text": "Following recommendations in the existing regional and recently launched WHO global guidance (2011), the Global Commission on HIV and the Law report HIV and the Law: Risks, Rights & Health (2012)1 and the UNESCAP Resolution 66/10: Regional call", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d2da6aa-d1e2-418d-a85c-515ce20ae7de": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d2da6aa-d1e2-418d-a85c-515ce20ae7de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "867188d2429d3076bd0775657f727624472714c1dac54f3f3e0ab5620106f2c0"}}, "hash": "867188d2429d3076bd0775657f727624472714c1dac54f3f3e0ab5620106f2c0", "text": "for action to achieve universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support in Asia and the Pacific (2010) and meeting report of the Asia-Pacific High- level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Assessment of Progress Against Commitments in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS and the Millennium Development Goals (2012), UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (APRC) and WHO (SEARO and WPRO) jointly developed a training package focusing on skills training of health care providers for HIV/STI related services to MSM and transgender people, and the reduction of stigma in health care settings. This training package is being supported by UNDP under the ISEAN-Hivos Multi-country Global Fund Round 10 Programme in four countries; Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste. The development process involved input and guidance from a number of people experienced in the delivery of health care services for MSM and transgender people. The consultation brought together 36 informal experts from nine countries [China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand and Timor Leste], representing public, private and community-based sectors. The general objective of the consultation was to strengthen HIV/STI prevention, care and treatment response for MSM and transgender people. A major focus of the Joint WHO/UNDP informal expert group consultation was to undertake a review of a draft training package, tentatively entitled \u201c\u2019The Time Has Come\u2019 \u2013 Enhancing HIV, STI and other Sexual Health Services for MSM and Transgender People in Asia and the Pacific: A Training Package for Health Providers and for Reduction of Stigma in Healthcare Settings.\u201d The training package was adapted from several sources including one recently developed for Research Triange Institute International (RTI) and piloted in the Middle East/North Africa and Central Asia regions. An initial pilot of the newly adapted training package was also conducted in the Philippines in July 2012. Additionally, pilot training courses will be conducted in Indonesia, Malaysia and Timor-Leste. 1 Accessible at http://www.hivlawcommission.org/index.php/report 6 Key recommendations: 1. Localization \u2013 The training package is written broadly and generically, and may provide new challenges for the local context. Therefore, it is essential that the package be localized for each presentation, per country and sometimes per locality. 2. Impact of religion, religious groups and leaders \u2013 There is a need to engage faith-based groups and religious leaders, who often act as gatekeepers, can positively influence others, and can also provide care and support. The need for personal testimonies has proven to be a very effective advocacy strategy in the HIV field, because it puts a human face on the suffering, risks and vulnerabilities of MSM and transgender women and men. 3. Language and translations \u2013 The issue of language and local translations must be addressed, as not all trainees will be fluent in English. Not all concepts in the training package will be easy to translate, as many of the ideas are taken from Western cultures. 4. Scaling Up \u2013 Barriers to scale up were discussed throughout the consultation, but some very specific challenges were flagged, such as demand generation, which might require structural reforms to be put in place, such as adding a third restroom for transgender people. 5. Accessing young people and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) \u2013 In the few places where HIV incidence is reported, new data show an alarming rate of incidence occurring amongst young MSM and transgender women. Innovative approaches need to be discussed and implemented, including ICT interventions. 6. Issues of identity of transgender people \u2013 It is necessary to recognize that transgender women and men have issues distinct from men who have sex with men, such as gender identity, gender reassignment considerations and unique medical requirements beyond HIV and STI, e.g. physical enhancements such as cosmetic surgery. 7. Human rights approach vs. health rights \u2013 The focus and approach for the training package must be on health rights, while recognizing the importance of understanding and respecting the human rights of MSM and transgender people. Next steps: 1. Revision and peer review of the training package \u2013 The revision of the package based on this meeting should be followed by a final peer review by a small group of three or four people from this consultation. Volunteers from among the informal experts at the consultation were solicited to be a part of the final peer review. 2. Translation/localization of the training package and trainers \u2013 A standard template of key areas, concepts and terms describing how best to prepare translations for consistency across the region must be created. For each country, the facilitators should be local ideally, one representing medical profession and one from the community. 3. Additional pilot projects \u2013 Three additional pilots will be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ef36be2-1722-401f-a93d-bdc9932d5ba0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ef36be2-1722-401f-a93d-bdc9932d5ba0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e503891c3e882e81827b9b751ea665f416ba932d405e0e6604733d34e809ef7a"}}, "hash": "e503891c3e882e81827b9b751ea665f416ba932d405e0e6604733d34e809ef7a", "text": "conducted to better inform the training package development. In countries in Asia and the Pacific, many public health facilities are presently unwelcoming to men who have sex with men and transgender people. Given the rising epidemics of HIV and STI among these populations, it is urgent that sustainable changes be made. This requires the coming together of key stakeholders such as the UNDP partnerships with WHO SEARO and WPRO, and representatives of government health services and community organizations attending as participants. Clearly, the time has come. 7 1. Background From the start of the epidemic until today, HIV has affected men who have sex with men and transgender people in much greater proportions than the general population. New or just recognized epidemics amongst MSM and transgender people are identified in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and South America, with high and rapidly rising rates of HIV transmission reported in Asia and the Pacific.2 Projections of the Asian epidemic indicate that close to 50 percent of all new HIV infections occurring annually in Asia will be identified among MSM by 2020, unless intensified HIV prevention measures are scaled-up; an increase from 13 percent in 2008.3 Sex between men accounts for approximately a third of known HIV transmissions in Asia and the Pacific, although this is likely to be underreported.4 Among MSM in Asia, the odds of being infected with HIV are 18.7 times higher than that of the general population.5 Many of these infections are occurring and will continue to occur among young men and young transgender people as well, with most clustering in urban areas of the region. Recent HIV prevalence rates among MSM are reported in South and South-East Asia at 14.7 percent; East Asia at 5.2; Oceania at 4.4 percent; however, in specific urban areas, these rates are much higher, e.g., in Bangkok at 30.8 percent. HIV incidence rates among MSM in Thailand and China, also reveal rapidly rising rates of HIV infection.6 Due to the lack of protective laws, insufficient skills, incomplete knowledge about male sexuality and sexual health, and high level of stigma and discrimination, currently, access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and community support services is limited compared with the share of the HIV burden faced by these populations. Experts now recognize that in order to halt the ongoing transmission of HIV in MSM and transgender people, the blocking of access to health care and prevention services, and the failure to fully recognize other basic individual rights, must stop. Access to adequate health services and social support is recognized as a fundamental human right. Yet stigma in health care settings, including homophobia, sexism and transphobic policies and practices, prevent open and welcoming access for MSM and transgender people. The cause is often the negative attitudes of clinicians and support staff together with incomplete or inaccurate knowledge about sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI).7,8 In 2011, WHO issued guidelines identifying that significant barriers to the uptake of services included insensitive communication and counselling with MSM and transgender clients and insufficient skills related to male sexual health (particularly lack of knowledge about pharyngeal and ano-rectal).9 UNDP and WHO, in partnership with USAID, UNAIDS and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM), have been working together to better understand the legal and human rights aspects and other social determinants of the HIV epidemic, identify priority health sector interventions and propose approaches to address stigma and discrimination issues. Following recommendations in the existing regional and recently launched WHO global guidance (2011), UNDP and WHO (SEARO and WPRO) have developed a training package focusing on skills training of health care providers providing HIV/STI related services to MSM and transgender people, and the reduction of stigma in health care settings. 2 Beyrer MD, C, et al.

Bangkok, 17 February 2011. UNDP. 9 WHO (2011). Prevention and Treatment of HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections among Men who have sex with men and Transgender people 8 UNDP is supporting this regional initiative under the ISEAN-Hivos Multi-country Global Fund Round 10 grant in four countries; Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste. Citing the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently proclaimed that the United Nations would speak out in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, (LGBT) including men who have sex with men. Calling the recent documentation of violence and discrimination directed at LGBT people \u201cdisturbing\u201d \u2013 because lives are at stake \u2013 he ended his talk before the Human Rights Council of the UN in Geneva on 7 March, 2012 with a simple but powerful statement: \u201cThe time has come.\u201d This was the call to action, via video presentation, that opened the regional meeting of informal experts in Bangkok, Thailand. UNDP is the technical assistance provider for the ISEAN-Hivos Multi-country Global Fund Round 10 Programme, which includes a health sector component, focusing on the four countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste. UNDP have partnered with WHO (SEARO and WPRO) to support the implementation of this component, starting with the development of the training package and referencing the existing regional and newly launched global guidance, \u201cMen who have sex with men and transgender people: Prevention and treatment of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections: Recommendations for a public health approach\u201d, which was jointly developed by WHO, UNDP, UNAIDS, MSMGF, GIZ and the Global Commission on HIV and the Law in 2011. In line with supporting the implementation of the global guidance mentioned above, the training package is intended to focus on improving the skills of health care providers and other key personnel, and to reduce stigma in health care settings. The training package has been adapted from several training packages including one first developed under funding by the RTI International\u2019s Asia HIV Programme. This package was based on practical work in Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines and Thailand, which was piloted in the Middle East/North Africa and Central Asia regions. The package development also closely follows recommendations contained in the bi-regional report from WHO, Priority HIV and sexual health interventions in the health sector for men who have sex with men and transgender people in the Asia-Pacific Region (2010), and the UNDP Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender Populations in Asia and the Pacific (2009). The development process involved input and guidance from a number of people experienced in the delivery of health services to MSM and transgender people. A regional consultation with 36 informal experts from nine countries in Asia was convened in Bangkok, Thailand on 17-19 July 2012, with support from UNDP, WHO (SEARO and WPRO ), KHANA/Alliance Technical Support Hub, and the Global Fund ISEAN/Hivos. The group of informal experts was drawn from both SEARO and WPRO regions and all have been directly involved in providing and supporting HIV/STI prevention, care and treatment for men who have sex with men and transgender people in a variety of settings, including HIV care and STI clinics, public and private, community-based organizations and ministries of health and social services. The training package had also been initially piloted from 10-12 July 2012 in the Philippines. 9 2. Global and regional overview 2.1 WHO Guidelines (global and regional) Dr Zhao Pengfei, Technical Officer [Key Populations], HIV/AIDS and STI, WHO WPRO, provided an overview of the WHO Global Guidelines on the Prevention and Treatment of HIV and STI for MSM and transgender people. The purpose of the guidelines is to recommend a set of interventions for the prevention and treatment of HIV and other STI for MSM and transgender people.

Specific recommendations are provided for four broad areas and give a clear and concise overview of the challenges being faced by those involved in this work. Key recommendations include: Good practice: \u2022\ufffd Human rights and inclusive environments \u2013 Promotion of a legal and social environment that protects human rights. \u2022\ufffd Non-discrimination in the health care setting: Access to prevention, treatment, care and support without discrimination. Prevention: \u2022\ufffd Using condoms consistently. \u2022\ufffd Using condoms, over serosorting. \u2022\ufffd Male circumcision is not recommended. \u2022\ufffd Implementing individual and community level behavioural interventions. \u2022\ufffd Internet-based targeted interventions. \u2022\ufffd Social marketing strategies. \u2022\ufffd Implementing sex venue-based outreach strategies. \u2022\ufffd Alcohol or other substance abusers should have access to brief evidence-based psychological interventions involving assessment, specific feedback and advice. \u2022\ufffd People who inject drugs (PWID) should have access to needle and syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy. \u2022\ufffd Transgender women who inject substances for gender enhancement \u2013 should have sterile injecting equipment and practice safe injecting behaviours. \u2022\ufffd In settings where infant immunization has not reached full coverage \u2013 catch-up hepatitis B immunization strategies. \u2022\ufffd Prevention of blood-borne infections \u2022\ufffd HIV testing and counselling: \u2022\ufffd Community-level programme for HTC linked to care and treatment. 10 Care/treatment: \u2022\ufffd ART, the same as for other populations. \u2022\ufffd Essential interventions to prevent illness and HIV transmission for people living with HIV. \u2022\ufffd Syndromic management and treatment (including anal infections). \u2022\ufffd Periodic testing for asymptotic STI. \u2022\ufffd Prevention and care of other STI. 2.2 Asia Pacific progress Edmund Settle, Policy Specialist, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre, posed the question, \u201cWhy is this such an important area to address at this time?\u201d It is because criminalization of same sex behaviour and other forms of stigma and discrimination facing MSM and transgender people in the Asia Pacific Region have caused these population groups to be largely ignored in the HIV response. This is particularly evident in the health sector, which means MSM and transgender people usually do not have access to the health services they need in terms of prevention, care and support. Conversely, most of the funding to reach these sub-populations has come from foreign donors and not national or local sources, because of stigma and institutional discrimination. It should be noted that all countries in this region have committed to UNESCAP (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific) resolutions 66/9 and 67/10, and have made a political declaration to take action to curb the HIV epidemic, including the delivery of prevention, treatment and care for MSM and transgender populations. In 2009, UNDP and UNAIDS developed the Global Framework for MSM and TG, which was used to develop a framework for this region. However, this framework has rarely has been localized and translated into programmes on the ground. To support implementation and ensure sustainability, WHO will continue to work with national ministries and departments of health. UNDP will work with national partners and community based organizations to support the development of an enabling environment to effectively implement this training. Working in partnership is the key to implementing this training package. 11 3. Objectives The general objective of this consultation is to strengthen HIV/STI prevention, care and treatment response for MSM and transgender people. The specific objectives are: 1. To review the WHO global guidelines and adapt the same for addressing HIV/STI in the context of the Asia-Pacific Region; 2. To review and discuss the draft regional training package; 3. To share country experiences and provide inputs for finalization of the training package; 4. To develop recommendations for implementation at the country level; and 5. To help improve the capacity of health sector practitioners to provide appropriate care to men who have sex with men and transgender persons. 12 4. Role of participation of the experts Working through both WHO and UNDP country offices, WHO had nominated informal experts from both SEARO and WPRO regions who had provided HIV/STI prevention, care and treatment for men who have sex with men and transgender persons including community professionals that UNDP had nominated. Those present had extensive experience in key areas including health care delivery \u2013 public, private and community-based, community social services, and law and policy development, as well as with specific issues, such as living with HIV as an MSM, HIV programme management and service coordination and donor support. Many participants were in positions that are able to influence gatekeepers, policy makers and other decision makers.

The community of informal experts added a vital dimension to the discussions and helped the final recommendations of the meeting to be based in reality. A range of expertise was needed to help assure that the training package could reach the goal of ensuring access to quality health services for MSM and transgender people. 13 5. Training package: \u2018The time has come\u2019 - Enhancing HIV, STI and other sexual health services for MSM and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific: A training package for health and for reduction of stigma in health care settings 5.1 Purpose and goals The central aim of this training package is to ultimately improve both access to and the quality of services for men who have sex with men and transgender people in the Region. The training package builds on several global and regional initiatives. The training package under review comprises five modules: Module 1: Context Building Module 2: MSM and Transgender People Programming Module 3: Enabling Environments Module 4: Strategic Information Module 5: Managing Programmes The training package targets the clinical staff of health services, both governmental and NGO, and support staff and other stakeholders in the delivery of health services. In addition, it should be of use to national and provincial government officials and staff and stakeholders of Global Fund grants and its recipients. The comprehensive package of programmes and services to support HIV prevention, treatment and care for gay men, MSM and transgender people is a spectrum or framework of inter-connected services, interventions and programmes tailored to engage and maintain ongoing contact with MSM and transgender people. A graphic illustration of the comprehensive package is outlined as shown in Figure 1.

The package was then modelled on a similar training programme that had been developed by AIDS Project Management Group (APMG), with input by the Asia Pacific Male Coalition on Male Sexual Health, and supported through Research Triangle Institute International\u2019s Asia HIV Programme. The first draft was piloted in the Philippines with additional pilot training planned for Indonesia, Timor- Leste and Malaysia. The initial RTI/APMG training package10 was part of efforts to develop educational training on the management of interventions for key-affected populations, particularly for the topics of harm reduction (for drug use), sex work and MSM, to help develop technical expertise around the theoretical knowledge available. The packages were informed by the practical work that was being done in various countries in this Region including Indonesia, Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Thailand. The idea for a training package for MSM and transgender people came about at an RTI workshop at which community people from around the Region identified the need for such training. The original APMG training package was presented in Egypt with participants from the Middle East/North African Region, followed by trainings in Central Asia. The pilot training clearly demonstrated the need for the work to follow a public health approach, rather than a rights-based focus. Another lesson learnt was that this training should follow a middle ground in looking at areas where both government and community practitioners could improve the health sector response towards MSM and transgender people. It will be necessary to gauge the knowledge, values and moral perspectives of the participants to better understand just how changes to a positive view towards MSM and transgender people can be made. Finally, the training package is not intended to be one size fits all, but rather to be used as an educational toolkit for guidance and decisions made on how to best utilize it at the country level and contextualize it to create a plan of action locally. 5.3 Overview of desk review of resources A review of key resources and reference materials was undertaken to better inform the development of the regional training package. The review provided a synopsis of some of the key resources available globally to support training on improving HIV, STI and other sexual services for MSM and transgender people.

In addition to a brief summary of each of the materials and their key elements, guidance on the likely usefulness of relevant training courses to participants was included. Soft copies of each document were included in the package, as well as links to places on the Internet where they could be accessed, when appropriate. 10 Management of effective programs addressing HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support for gay men and other MSM and transgender people: programme overview can be accessed at http://www.aidsprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ Management-of-Effective-Programs_Gay-Men-and-other-MSM-and-TG.pdf 15 6. Reflections for rollout \u2013 key issues As the consultation progressed, key, crosscutting issues emerged. Most pertained to over-arching principles or potential problems that could hamper the successful rollout of training in the large variety of settings that are planned. 6.1 Participants \u2013 targets for training The informal experts agreed that a participant profile was needed that clearly established the intended primary target of anyone responsible for or involved in service delivery in a public health setting, whether based in government or community clinics. With the need for service linkages and partnerships to be both explored and established, training might also involve private health providers, policy makers and advocates, and MSM and transgender community-based programme managers and caregivers. The need for personal testimonials was identified as essential to helping trainees understand firsthand the concepts that some may be hearing of for the first time, such as what it is like to suffer discrimination because of gender identity or stigma when seeking everyday services like eating out. A solution for this would be to have full engagement with the community for the training, or at least, find relevant and local case studies to serve as personal testimonials. 6.2 Localization The training package was written broadly and generically, using data, concepts and ideas that are in common usage in the MSM and transgender services sector. However, the information in the package might be new in local contexts. Therefore, it is essential that the package be localized for each presentation, per country and sometimes per locality. Things to consider include: \u2022\ufffd Data - HIV prevalence, incidence of STI and HIV among key populations, estimates of the size of the local MSM and transgender populations, and so forth. It was recommended to use the UNAIDS HIV and AIDS Data Hub11 for Asia-Pacific to find much of the needed information. \u2022\ufffd Terminology \u2013 such as knowing just how local MSM and transgender people identify themselves and their sex partners or sexual preferences, like the use of kathoey for transgender women in Thailand and waria in Indonesia, or the use of bakla to refer to MSM in the Philippines and kothi in India. \u2022\ufffd Hidden populations in the area such as MSM who use the Internet and social marketing methods to \u201cmeet up\u201d and who rarely or never access venues where outreach or medical services might occur. 6.3 Impact of faith-based, religious groups and leaders There is a need to engage faith-based groups as partners in a number of localities across the region. Those groups and leaders often act as gatekeepers, can positively influence others, and can also provide care and support. There exist good practices examples in places like India (Humsafar Trust), Indonesia and the Philippines. The use of personal testimonies has proven to be an effective advocacy strategy in the HIV field, because it puts a human face on the suffering, risks and vulnerabilities of MSM and transgender women and men. 6.4 Language and translations The issue of language and local translations must be addressed, as not all trainees would be fluent in English. In the training not all concepts would be easy to translate, as many of the ideas are taken from Western cultures. 11 HIV and AIDS Data Hub can be accessed at http://www.aidsdatahub.org. 16 6.5 Scaling up \u2013 problems and challenges Barriers to scale up were discussed throughout the consultation, but some very specific challenges were flagged. Demand generation, that is, increasing demand for services, is the intent of the training, along with improving the quality of services being provided for MSM and transgender people. But are clinics ready and willing to increase demands for service? Will demand increase if the services are not adequately sensitive or not offered at hours and in places easily accessible to the targeted populations?

Experts\u2019 review and recommendations To best utilize the expertise present at the consultation, the informal experts were divided into five groups, after hearing brief presentations on each of the first four modules. The groups were asked to discuss and decide responses to three questions about each module: \u2022\ufffd What changes and corrections need to be made? \u2022\ufffd What should be added (what was omitted or overlooked) for this topic? \u2022\ufffd What are general recommendations you might make about this topic? More specific responses to these questions can be found in Annex 3. General recommendations are reported, with summary statements about each module, except for Module 5, which was discussed in the plenary only. 7.1 Module 1. Context building This module helps build contextual understanding of the terms and definitions needed to better comprehend the issues faced by MSM and transgender people and reviews key documents, such as the WHO Guidelines and the Comprehensive Package of Services. Core issues are explored in depth, such as sexuality and gender. General comments and recommendations included: \u2022\ufffd Allocating more time for discussing sexuality, gender and SOGI issues that are complex to comprehend; \u2022\ufffd Referencing and cross-indexing of information to aid facilitation, including giving the facilitator the flexibility to decide on different exercises or activities to achieve the required output, and \u2022\ufffd Including a facilitator profile best equipped to conduct such training. 7.2 Module 2. Engaging MSM and transgender people in health programming Module 2 is built upon Module 1 by reviewing elements of the WHO Guidelines and the Comprehensive Package of Services to help illustrate a desired continuum of care, from prevention and testing, to treatment and care for STI, sexual health and well being as well as for HIV. Models of integration and partnership between health providers and community-based services were also covered, including in- depth reviews of preventions programming and innovative models for delivery of HIV treatment, care and support services. Some key recommendations and comments include: 1. The training should focus the package and information based on where the epidemic is centred. 2. Increased access to services was one of the objectives of the training that would lead to increased demand for such services. This should be a part of the discussion and should include: \u2022\ufffd Need to improve service delivery; \u2022\ufffd Reasons for not accessing services; \u2022\ufffd Impact of gender of clinicians on service utilization; \u2022\ufffd Other barriers to health seeking services in a public health setting; \u2022\ufffd MSM and transgender health needs beyond only STI or HIV, and \u2022\ufffd The need to provide youth-friendly services, since most new infections are among youth. 18 7.3 Module 3. Environments and interventions supporting HIV and sexual health programme for MSM and transgender people In order to better understand how MSM and transgender people access health services, it is necessary to examine the barriers they face, what supportive interventions might be undertaken to help overcome these barriers, including an understanding of how law and legal environments affect MSM and transgender people, and also how rights-based frameworks might be applied. Comments and recommendations include: 1. Advocacy should be within the health sector much more than externally; for example, helping to change hours of operation to make the services better available to working MSM. 2. Role-plays should be included to help make suggested interventions more easily understood. 3. The Stigma Index should be used as a tool for understanding stigma, particularly of MSM+ (MSM PLHIV).13 4. The goal is to create an enabling environment at the micro level, to help make the service and service providers acceptable to the target client communities. 5. Health service providers need to understand how laws and legal practices present barriers to providing services, both locally and nationally. 6.

Documentation, monitoring and evaluation Strategic information, how to find it and how to use it is important to understand the scope, breadth and depth of the problems faced by MSM and transgender people. Module 4 attempts to explain key elements of strategic information such as epidemiological, biological, behavioural data, how social and operational research can be used, and why service delivery, programme planning and policy information is used for effective and useful monitoring and evaluation. Recommendations and comments include: \u2022\ufffd Rework and reduce the content to be relevant for health care settings, both public and community- based, bearing in the mind the target participants will be service providers and support staff. 7.5 Module 5. Programme management Module 5 presents a creative way to look at managing work \u2013 individual as well as programmatic. It is an easy to understand method of managing (managing up, down, out and in), and is perfect \u201cas is\u201d, according to the expert feedback. The only change recommended is to reduce the content to shorten it from a full day to one-half day training. 13 See also: http://www.stigmaindex.org/125/aims-of-the-index/the-process.html 19 8. Requirements for implementation A panel of four participant informal experts presented on system requirements that would be needed in three specific areas \u2013 health services sector, policy, legal environments and community engagement. The participants then focused on constraints within each of their own countries, and discussed how best to implement the set of recommendations as put forward. 1. Health sector systems requirements: Simply possessing knowledge about HIV, or even transmitting that knowledge to MSM/transgender people, is not enough. The health sector needs to have the capacity to deliver the necessary services, and so it is essential that certain structural capacities (which would address systems requirements) be built up in order to improve service delivery. Key health sector systems requirements include: \u2022\ufffd Clinic and laboratory capability \u2013 Tools and trained personnel capable of addressing HIV prevention and treatment issues. \u2022\ufffd Mapping capability \u2013 Resources and tools that would allow the collection of accurate demographic information. For example, who are the key-affected populations to be found in particular areas? \u2022\ufffd Linkages \u2013 Effective linkages with other institutions, such as government institutions, NGOs, CBOs, and private-sector businesses including doctors and clinics, which can further the reach and effectiveness of the health sector. \u2022\ufffd Medical education system awareness \u2013 Universities and other learning institutions and programme that train medical personnel need to be made aware of the specific medical issues facing MSM and transgender people, and helped to integrate such information into educational curricula. 2. Systems requirements related to communities: The environment, both within MSM and transgender communities and in the broader communities within which MSM and transgender people live, helps or hinders health-seeking behaviours. Key requirements for enabling health seeking include: \u2022\ufffd Localizing the issues \u2013 often there is adequate knowledge and goodwill at the national level, but translating this at the local level remains a challenge. \u2022\ufffd Awareness \u2013 local communities, including health care providers, often have negative or inadequate knowledge of the key populations living among them, or of the medical requirements of those people. For example, harassment of transgender people at medical facilities by staff or other patients needs to be addressed by increased community awareness and sensitivity, and specific measures, such as separate toilet facilities. \u2022\ufffd Community involvement \u2013 involving MSM and transgender people directly in HIV prevention, treatment and care and support work greatly enhances the chances of success. 3. Systems requirements and the legal environment: Often policies, laws and/or law enforcement patterns hinder rather than promote prevention and treatment efforts relevant to MSM and transgender people. Key requirements for promoting an enabling legal environment are: \u2022\ufffd Removing laws that discriminate against MSM and transgender people. \u2022\ufffd Bring together target populations, health providers and policy-makers with police and security enforcers to better understand public health needs. \u2022\ufffd Harmonize policies and laws in order to support public health strategies and encourage health- seeking behaviours. 20 8.1 Constraints to implementing the regional training package by country None of the nine countries and areas represented by the informal experts has national policy guidelines on these issues. Specific constraints for each country were reported to be as follows: China: If government leaders are not supportive, it will be difficult to implement the package. Some advocacy work will need to be done to ensure support. Models from other medical settings that could be used as examples are needed. Hong Kong: The buy-in of high-ranking medical personnel, such as the college of physicians or the chief of service in hospitals, is necessary", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f61e098-15d8-4c68-a74f-a7d514ee9272": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f61e098-15d8-4c68-a74f-a7d514ee9272", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7cae9cb0d85f07b6cbb3e19c826eab515abe137edd485e49e604ee4ff1ac96e"}}, "hash": "e7cae9cb0d85f07b6cbb3e19c826eab515abe137edd485e49e604ee4ff1ac96e", "text": "in order to generate interest in the package. If it is seen that the package has support from that level, then it will be easy to implement. India: The challenge is to get buy-in of the healthcare sector. In India it is private clinics that provide the majority of services to MSM and transgender people. When they try to access HIV or STI public health services, there is limited interest in treating them. This falls under the heading of public services so treating them does not generate income for the clinic. One suggestion is to tie up with the local council of doctors, trade associations, to give doctors continuing education credit points for undertaking this training. Indonesia: The MSM clinic in Bali has had a measure of success because it is centrally located, anonymous, open in the evenings and weekends, and advertises on the Internet through FaceBook and Twitter, so issues of accessibility and confidentiality are better addressed, thereby increasing client numbers. Malaysia: Since most MSM and transgender people prefer to go to private providers, it is necessary to engage with the private sector to implement this package, thus integrating the package via existing training mechanisms rather than creating new ones; however, private practitioners may not have time for additional training. Whilst the actual clinical service, procedures and testing are okay, it is the inadequacy or lack of services for MSM and transgender people that is the principal issue in Malaysia. Another issue is self-stigma: MSM and transgender people have been told they are \u201cbad,\u201d so they are reluctant to utilize services that will require the disclosure of personal information. In the public health services, you rarely see the same clinician twice, which makes it difficult to build relationships that would aid disclosure of such information. There is an existing model in Malaysia where private clinics do refer patients back to the public sector, as it is free for STI treatment and cheaper for other services. It should be used as a best practice model. At the moment, Malaysia is looking at restructuring its health sector; this will be a good time to integrate services with the private sector. Another hindrance is the fact that some community organizations conducting their own VCT see public health clinics as competition and may be reluctant to refer out. Myanmar: There is still a lot of stigma and discrimination, including amongst the Ministry of Health staff, despite the high priority given to MSM and transgender people in the National HIV Strategy. 21 Nepal: There is still a lack of sensitization in the society about MSM and transgender issues, and so MSM and transgender people are not utilizing existing facilities. Facilities must be made user-friendly, in addition to the changing of legal and legislative issues. Philippines: The constraints will be that the training package is heavier on the side of knowledge building and not skills building, which is urgently needed. Secondly, ways and means should be considered to measure the effectiveness of the training in terms of improving services. Thailand: Issues of confidentiality, quality of service, lack of public acceptance and low self-esteem often hinder health care-seeking by MSM and transgender people in Thailand. The challenge will be to get the package accredited so that it could be integrated into the system and not just be a stand-alone training, and gets the priority it needs in a country facing many other issues. 8.2 Potential partners for implementation The consultation was asked to help identify potential partners because it will be impossible for the United Nations system to be the sole source of support of the rolling out of these training programmes. It was emphasized that potential partners should be vetted, among other things, in terms of the likelihood of whether they would remain committed over time. A brainstorming revealed the following ideas: \u2022\ufffd Health sector institutions \u2013 Medical and training schools, professional and trade associations, medical councils, etc. \u2022\ufffd International public sector institutions \u2013 the UN family of institutions, World Bank, Asia Development Bank \u2022\ufffd Bilateral and multilateral donors and development partners \u2013 AusAID, DFID/UKaid, GIZ, USAID, and so forth. \u2022\ufffd National public sector institutions \u2013 National, regional and local governments, both health and finance ministries, institutions and private foundations. \u2022\ufffd INGO/NGO/CBO institutions \u2013 FHI 360, PSI, APMG, APCOM, MSM and transgender networks and CBO, etc. \u2022\ufffd Major private corporations as well as local businesses, including the tourism industry. \u2022\ufffd Media support 22 9.

Revision and peer review of the training package The revision of the package based on this meeting should be followed by a final peer review by a small group of three or four people from this consultation. Volunteers from among the informal experts at the consultation were solicited to be a part of the final peer review. 2. Translation/localization of the training package and trainers It will be important to have a standard template of key areas, concepts and terms describing how best to prepare translations in order to assure that information is consistent across the Region. This adaptation guide was recommended as a useful tool to assist in localizing the information. Internet options for information availability should be considered as well with a strong recommendation to eventually offer the material in electronic learning (e-learning) methods available off the Internet. It was agreed that, for each country, the facilitators should be local professionals. An ideal combination would be a medical professional and a community professional so that both clinical experience and legitimacy and real lived experience could be brought together. 3. Additional pilot projects Additional pilot projects will take place in Indonesia, Timor-Leste and Malaysia. The experiences from these training programmes will also inform the final version of the package. WHO SEARO will convene a meeting with programme managers, key service providers, decision-makers and policy-makers from the eleven countries they represent to inform them about the package and to discuss how to implement it in their countries. Financial and technical support at the country level will be sought, and hopefully, with enough interest, it can become part of national training packages for health service providers. In addition, the training package will be added as a key programme agenda for the WHO regional health sector strategy for key-affected populations (from the present to 2015). Further, WHO WPRO will support country level implementation and adaptation of the regional training package and the WHO guidelines in seven priority countries of Cambodia, China, Malaysia, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam. UNDP will continue to work with WHO to scale-up these trainings under the ISEAN-HIVOS Multi-country Global Fund Round 10 Programme and the South Asia Multi-country Global Fund Round 9 Programme. 23 10. Concluding remarks: Urgency for scale up Has the time come? Yes, and perhaps already passed, suggested Clifton Cortez, HIV Practice Leader for UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre, because many of the informal expert participants in this consultation expressed a sense of urgency for this work to be underway. HIV prevalence amongst MSM has been spiralling upwards since the Region first started to document such data, and is now being seen in high and rapidly increasing numbers amongst transgender people as well. All participants agreed that the time is well upon us to help move the response to the HIV epidemic amongst MSM and transgender people into the public health sector in Asia and the Pacific. And urgent too, is the need for new and strengthened partnerships to assure sustainability well into the future, such as the UNDP partnerships with WHO, both SEARO and WPRO, other UN family members like UNESCO, UNFPA and UNAIDS, with development partners and donors like USAID, AusAID and Hivos, and with those participating in the consultation representing government, community and private health services and advocacy networks. The consultation ended with strong commitments by both UNDP and WHO to move this work forward, including identifying needed funds, and adding additional value like finding or providing supportive services and technical assistance.

Feedback was solicited in three specific areas: corrections or changes needed, information that should be added, and general recommendations. The group of informal experts were drawn from both SEARO and WPRO regions and each have been directly involved in providing and supporting HIV/STI prevention, care and treatment for men who have sex with men and transgender people in a variety of settings, including HIV care and STI clinics, public and private, community-based organizations and ministries of health and social services. Here is the specific feedback for each of the first four modules. General, broader recommendations are documented throughout the report.

Provide a slide on stigma and discrimination (e.g., Ashok Row Kavi\u2019s onion graphic) and drivers for disempowerment for MSM and TG. 3. The facilitator guide should provide examples of innovative training methods that the facilitator can use. 4. Information and discussion is needed on a number of areas for this module, including: \u2022\ufffd Impact of increasing demand for services is needed. \u2022\ufffd Existing gaps in services and ways to improve service delivery to target groups. \u2022\ufffd Different models of service provision and an overview of what has worked/not worked (examples might include faith-based programming). \u2022\ufffd More information on ano-rectal and pharyngeal infections.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fca93f0-1dcf-4c41-b094-2a787fbd4b39": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fca93f0-1dcf-4c41-b094-2a787fbd4b39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8cea9edbbd7315fd8f4dceeb6c53bab944e7663af947ab90a57ca7498d75aaac"}, "3": {"node_id": "c88115ee-0a19-4ccc-bae7-9c8a946874da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54c0574d664aa27fda01851d71e3badd9e488b9f1ba09f620e47cd458066b5c5"}}, "hash": "5371d3197f7a3c91661dd0f7b8ebf94a04d34e684b99a6036dff69bfbe72aca1", "text": "\u2022\ufffd Provide reference documents on syndromic clinical guidelines and/or discussion on why syndromic approaches may no longer be appropriate for these sub-populations. 5.

Reduce the number of models; training should be more practical than academic and theoretical and follow the principles of adult learning of less input, more participation, including: \u2022\ufffd Instead of slides, have localized testimonials by community members or case presentations, with discussions guided by facilitators. \u2022\ufffd Testimony needs to underscore the continuum of care, clearly illustrating how VCT and STI treatment are gateways to increased health seeking. Module 3. Environments and interventions supporting HIV and sexual health programs for MSM and TG There was general agreement that this section will need tailoring to the local situation throughout. As well, it is important that this section provide a focus/be presented through the perspective of a public health approach as opposed to a rights-based approach. 1. Corrections/changes 1. Session 1, slide 8 (Environment of risk for MSM and TG): 2. Discussion must be localized (e.g., there may be no meetings places like bars, or local police may not be involved in harassment or shake-downs). 3. Change venue owners (inside box) to sex-on-premises venue owners. 4. Add sexual assault to transgender slide inside circle. 5. Illustrate better the linkages between the boxes in and outside of the circle. 6. Needs a reference or citation. 7. Session 1, slide 9 the group exercise should be contextualised in a health care setting. 8. Session 1, slide 14 (Enabling Environment): re-conceptualize to content familiar to medical practitioners and relevant to their work. 33 2. Additional information to be added 1. Add an additional slide on stigma and discrimination titled \u201cWhat can we do if this happens in a healthcare setting\u201d. 2. Add a slide on national and local policies that affect MSM and transgender people, and include other legal and structural barriers. 3. Emphasize issues of confidentiality and informed consent and the impact these have on MSM and transgender people. 4. Consider adding local information on drug use and criminalization laws and law enforcement. 5. Add information on the \u201cright to health\u201d when talking about availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of services. 6. Add information on advocacy, but focused on the healthcare setting and how to improve service provision, such as available tools and on developing an advocacy plan. 7. Inform participants that transgender people will sometimes have separate health needs from MSM due to various factors such as medication interactions (e.g., hormone therapy and ARV or STI treatments) in addition to physical and gender modification and reassignment. 8. Develop four or five storylines as case studies on transgender people, MSM, hidden MSM, PLHIV MSM (MSM+). 9. Emphasize importance of creating partnerships between NGO, health care settings and government services to ensure delivery of services and for creating an enabling environment. 10. Include discussion on role of religion and public health, including the impact and effectiveness of faith-based services. 11. Do we need to add something about drug use/laws specifically for MSM and transgender people? 3. Recommendations 1. Explain clearly what an enabling environment means within the context of the clinic or health service, and what at the service level inhibits access. 2. Introduce the concept of risk and vulnerability. 3. Limit use of key documents with a summary of the key messages in each document. 4. Keep in mind that documents may need to be translated. 5. Module needs to go beyond issue-identification and provide concrete steps to arrive at solutions. 6. A local policy or legal resource person is likely needed to support the facilitator in understanding related local issues. Module 4. Documentation, monitoring and evaluation 1. Corrections/changes 1. When discussing HIV prevalence outside of the local area or country, limit it and use it only as an illustration as to where the local area fits into the entire picture or where it might be heading. 2. Consider giving incidence in addition to prevalence but explain the differences. 3. Limit the number of behavioural data slides. 4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c88115ee-0a19-4ccc-bae7-9c8a946874da": {"__data__": {"id_": "c88115ee-0a19-4ccc-bae7-9c8a946874da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8cea9edbbd7315fd8f4dceeb6c53bab944e7663af947ab90a57ca7498d75aaac"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fca93f0-1dcf-4c41-b094-2a787fbd4b39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5371d3197f7a3c91661dd0f7b8ebf94a04d34e684b99a6036dff69bfbe72aca1"}}, "hash": "54c0574d664aa27fda01851d71e3badd9e488b9f1ba09f620e47cd458066b5c5", "text": "3.

Photos: UNDP, APCOM. 1 Background Access to a package of health services and social support by men who have sex with men (MSM) is recognized as a fundamental human right. Due to the lack of protective laws, insufficient skills and incomplete knowledge about male sexuality and sexual health, and high levels of stigma and discrimination, currently, access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and community support services is limited compared with the share of the HIV burden faced by these populations. In 2011, the Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that, \u201c\u2026homophobic, sexist and transphobic practices and attitudes on the part of health-care institutions and personnel may nonetheless deter Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender persons (LGBT) persons from seeking services, which in turn has a negative impact on efforts to tackle HIV/AIDS and other health concerns.\u201d1 In response to the alarming growth in HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender persons, UNDP and WHO in partnership with USAID, WHO, UNAIDS and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM) have been working together to better understand the legal and human rights aspects and other social determinates of the epidemic, identify priority health sector interventions and propose approaches to address stigma and discrimination issues. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law2 and \u201cLegal, Environments, Human Rights and HIV Responses among MSM and transgender persons in Asia and the Pacific: An Agenda for Action\u201d3 have documented that stigma in health care settings is a major barrier preventing access to health services, due to the negative attitudes of care providers, and incomplete knowledge about sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). Furthermore, WHO has identified insufficient skills regarding male sexual health (pharyngeal and ano-rectal care in particular); insensitive communication and counselling with MSM and transgender clinic clients as significant impediments to the uptake of services provided in health care settings.4 The ISEAN-HIVOS Multi-country Global Fund Programme contains a health sector component focusing on skills training of health care providers providing HIV and STI-related services for MSM and transgender people, and the reduction of stigma in health care settings in four countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste). UNDP, as the provider of technical assistance (TA) for the ISEAN-HIVOS project has been working with WHO (SEARO and WPRO5) to support the implementation of this component, starting with development of a training package with reference to the existing regional and newly launched global guidance: \u201cMen who Have Sex with Men and Transgender People: Prevention and Treatment of HIV and Other Sexually Transmitted Infections: Recommendations for a Public Health Approach\u201d, which was jointly developed by WHO, UNDP, UNAIDS, MSMGF, and giz in 2011. In order to develop a bi-regional training package which could be timely implemented in the four countries under the ISEAN-HIVOS Multi-country Global Fund Programme, an international consultant with direct working experience with MSM and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific (Dr. Graham Neilsen) was jointly recruited by UNDP and WHO in April 2012.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3faf1978-e504-4ec9-9334-fe550f73ac32": {"__data__": {"id_": "3faf1978-e504-4ec9-9334-fe550f73ac32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Review Consultation Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "484e08a685d0f6298af61bfcace8dfa8a49d6508b055ecc4a2264899af3ba5ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "38fb32af-b607-4c55-bf8c-8905ca51f1f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6163794dab9c4cd53080bad1b02f7bcafb9c2459c383054b39b2a234c9fd337"}}, "hash": "bd961838fb269579fcad03fb84649c2e00afad645baced24ba4b4281fdcef075", "text": "Graham Neilsen) was jointly recruited by UNDP and WHO in April 2012. The consultant developed an annotated summary of key resources on training on health issues for MSM and transgender people, and relevant global and regional and policy analyses on health and legal and human rights issues.

This report, authored by Graham Neilsen and Kaori Nakatani, summarises the process of the development of the package, pilot trainings and inputs from the two consultation meetings. The Review Consultation on the Development of the Training Package and Pilot Trainings was facilitated by Graham Neilsen and Edmund Settle. Purpose of the training package The training package aims to ensure that participants: \u2022\ufffd Have an understanding of effective HIV interventions for MSM and transgender people \u2013 in particular the 2011 WHO Guidelines and Comprehensive Package of Services for MSM and Transgender People; \u2022\ufffd Have the ability to apply surveillance data, research findings and other evidence about MSM and transgender people practically to their country or region; \u2022\ufffd Have practical knowledge of the legal and other \u2018environmental\u2019 factors that affect MSM and transgender HIV programming; \u2022\ufffd Have a good understanding of policy and other documents that can be used to defend their MSM and transgender programs; and \u2022\ufffd Have an improved capacity to manage MSM and transgender services at a national and regional level. The training package takes a holistic approach to broader health and other issues for MSM and transgender people and is not HIV-specific. The primary audience of this training package includes national and provincial officials overseeing HIV programmes with MSM and transgender people, direct health care providers for MSM and transgender people, and health bureaucrats responsible for advising government ministers and others on policy in the response to HIV. The participants of the second consultation meeting agreed that national policy-makers and city-level health care providers who are involved in clinical management and policy development should be included as part of the primary audience. Development of the package The training package includes a facilitators\u2019 manual, a complete set of PowerPoint\u00ae presentations, an annotated review of key resources and reference materials, copies of key reference documents, handouts, testimonial videos, pre- and post-course assessments, and evaluation forms. The consultant drew upon his extensive resource library or journal articles, guidelines, and reports; recent key publications from UN and other agencies; as well as other documents identified through cross-checking of references; and inputs from an extensive network of key informants. During the process of package development and pilot trainings, he identified many similar additional resources including video testimonials and all of these were maintained in an incrementally expanding folder of materials identifiable in the package as \u201cResources for Participants\u201d. Similarly, other key elements of the package such as the facilitators\u2019 manual, PowerPoint\u00ae presentations were revised in response to feedback and experiences in the various pilot trainings. Apart from technical content, many materials were revised in light of political and linguistic sensitivities identified in both the consultations and pilot trainings. A recurring issue throughout the process was the particular challenge of ensuring that participants developed a common understanding of the critical concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). This issue required substantial time in all pilot trainings \u2013 and understanding was greatly enhanced 3 in those trainings where training participants included openly gay, MSM or transgender people, or participants who were comfortable to disclose their personal experiences of gender expression. In some of the pilot trainings (e.g., Indonesia), the package was substantially changed; to the extent that all five modules were attempted in a two-day period, and followed by a half-day \u2018stakeholder meeting\u2019 with senior government and other personnel \u2013 in an attempt to advocate for the future use of the package. The success of such advocacy is questionable. Indeed, it could be argued that these were not actually \u201cpilots\u201d given that the package being used was so different from the original materials.

This was probably misguided and likely distracted participants from the core purpose of the package, generating confusing expectations, while also disappointing them, given that the clinical content was very limited due to time constraints. These issues are likely to arise repeatedly in the future use of the package once the original facilitators are no longer involved in the country-level rollout of the training. Other pilots (e.g., the Philippines) used the first three modules over three days, which could be more fairly considered a genuine pilot \u2013 given that it matched the intended timing of the three modules. Translation of the package is likely to be especially challenging. In many countries, there are simply no equivalent, precise local terms for many of the key concepts in the package \u2013 and facilitators will need to be highly knowledgeable so that they can get these difficult terms correctly understood. Similarly, the local terms that are used (including slang) are in constant evolution and meanings may be understood differently depending on geographical location, ethnicity, age, and educational level. This was particularly evident in the Philippines. In other settings (e.g., Indonesia), force of habit in the context of HIV may have led to the major error of translating \u201ctransgender people\u201d as \u201cwaria\u201d (which applies only to trans women) and thus completely precluded the existence of trans men from discussions in the training. Use of the package The intent of the training package is that it be undertaken over five days as follows: \u2022\ufffd Day 1: Module 1 (Context building) \u2022\ufffd Day 2: Module 2 (MSM and transgender people programming) \u2022\ufffd Day 3: Module 3 (Enabling environment, e.g., risk-taking by MSM and transgender people; law and policies related to MSM and transgender people) \u2022\ufffd Day 4: Module 4 (Strategic information related to MSM and transgender people) \u2022\ufffd Day 5: Module 5 (Program management) Key learning points for each day: Day 1 \u2013 Context building \u2022\ufffd Understanding the acronyms used in HIV and some core concepts can assist you communicating with and understanding others \u2022\ufffd Acronyms and abbreviations are used for common terms and groups affected by HIV \u2022\ufffd Acronyms and abbreviations are used for many organizations that respond to HIV \u2022\ufffd Key concepts in HIV in the region that are important to understand Dealing with common terminologies that are challenging for participants to understand, e.g., sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). 4 Day 2 \u2013 MSM and transgender programming \u2022\ufffd The needs of MSM and transgender people are influenced by the \u2018lived reality\u2019 of their lives \u2013 social acceptance or exclusion \u2022\ufffd Human behavior and decision-making related to health and risks are influenced by many complex factors \u2022\ufffd Competing priorities influence the behaviors and health seeking choices made by MSM and transgender people Day 3 \u2013 Enabling environment \u2022\ufffd How to ensure that people have the knowledge, means and power they need to respond to HIV \u2022\ufffd How to map the HIV risk, vulnerability and impact environments in which MSM and transgender people live \u2013 e.g., impact of religion, culture and tradition \u2022\ufffd Strategies for removing barriers and obstacles in the environment \u2022\ufffd The power of data to drive good programming \u2013 how the data that services and programs generate can be fed into planning One of the difficulties in this module is how to help participants to understand policy documents and how policies affect HIV programming and implementation.

The first pilot training was conducted in Tagaytay on 10-12 July 2012. It was targeted for Manila based-health care providers and 21 health care providers attended the training. The second training was conducted in Cebu on 25-27 September 2012 for 22 health care providers based in the Visayas and Mindanao, and 5 22 participants attended the training. The last pilot training was held in Manila on 27-29 November 2012, attended by 25 health care providers and social workers from Metro Manila, Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao. She noted that only Modules 1, 2 and 3 were addressed in the pilot trainings in the Philippines. Lessons learnt from the pilot trainings in the Philippines: \u2022\ufffd Some participants found it difficult to describe the local terminology related to sexuality. \u2022\ufffd The concept of SOGI was not easily grasped by all participants \u2013 even after considerable discussion. \u2022\ufffd The issue of use of information and communications technology (ICT) was discussed: for the Philippines, some participants felt that a major contributing factor to the HIV epidemic was the use of ICT for finding sexual partners. \u2022\ufffd Local HIV epidemiological data should be presented (where available) together with national data and tailored to the target audience. \u2022\ufffd Transgender people are largely absent in research and existing programmes in the Philippines. The training made the participants realize that most programmes and strategies for HIV prevention do not include transgender people. \u2022\ufffd There is a need to disaggregate efforts, particularly for transgender people. \u2022\ufffd There is a lack of scientific data on MSM and transgender people particularly at the local level. Existing data need to be disaggregated. \u2022\ufffd Most participants lacked capacity and knowledge on justice issues. \u2022\ufffd Participants raised the importance of strengthening school-based programmes, looking at transgender health needs, securing safe spaces for transgender people, and developing tailored messages for the transgender community. \u2022\ufffd There are some initiatives at the local-level, which are considered good practices (e.g., the Cebu City Anti-discrimination Ordinance No. 2339 issued in 2012). \u2022\ufffd The importance of holistic psychosocial services for MSM and transgender people was discussed and supported by participants. \u2022\ufffd Good teamwork between the co-facilitators was observed. \u2022\ufffd Follow-up pilot trainings in the Philippines addressed challenges identified in the earlier trainings. For example, significant efforts were made to make the participants understand the concept of SOGI in Manila training. Using the \u2018Genderbread Person\u2019 slide was very helpful in helping participants understand the key concepts in SOGI. Mr. Edmund Settle suggested it would be helpful in the future to hold a meeting for the mayors from China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste to provide policy support on MSM and transgender people. Others suggested that permanent city staff should be invited to the meeting for sustainability of the project. Recommendations from the Philippines: \u2022\ufffd Effort should be made during the training to desensitize participants so that they are able to talk openly about SOGI-related terminology. \u2022\ufffd More concrete examples should be presented in explaining SOGI. \u2022\ufffd There is a need to deepen the understanding on the dynamics of transgender people by presenting updated and disaggregated data in a more interesting way. \u2022\ufffd Need to discuss on access to justice related to MSM and transgender people during the training, in order to strengthen capacity and increase knowledge in the area. 6 \u2022\ufffd Facilitators need to be flexible in their use of different participatory methods according to the reaction of audiences. \u2022\ufffd Local good practices should be shared at the training for expansion and replication. \u2022\ufffd There is a need to emphasize the importance of collaborative work between health workers and policy-makers to protect the rights of MSM and transgender people. \u2022\ufffd Need to emphasize that MSM and transgender people have special needs and health care providers should be aware of them. \u2022\ufffd Need to have a session to deal with the attitudes of health workers particularly with transgender people \u2022\ufffd It is vital to include representations from MSM and/or transgender community members to discuss their perspectives at the training. \u2022\ufffd A more localized approach in the training is highly recommended.

In all three trainings, the participants came mainly from community health centers and the remainder were from Provincial AIDS Commissions, provincial and/or city health offices and MSM and transgender NGOs. The core team decided to have two-day training for health providers mainly targeted for community health centers, followed by a half-day meeting for health and other stakeholders. The training modules used for these trainings included modules 1, 2 and some parts of module 3 and session 1 of module 5. Based on the training module analysis, the following issues were raised: \u2022\ufffd Recognition of the importance of exploring the capacity and the knowledge of participants on HIV and STI issues and their perspectives on MSM and transgender at the beginning of training; \u2022\ufffd The crucial need to introduce correct terminology; \u2022\ufffd The need to provide additional time to explain sex and sexuality; \u2022\ufffd To include the latest updates on the national and regional epidemiological data on MSM and transgender people and HIV; \u2022\ufffd The need to review and use the correct local language for each slide; \u2022\ufffd The need to prepare guest facilitators before the training so that they know the purpose of the training and what is expected of them. \u2022\ufffd The need for the participants to prepare an action plan in sessions related to module 5. The action plan should be visible and realistic. 7 Lessons learnt from the trainings in Indonesia: \u2022\ufffd Communication with government and communities needs to be strengthened in Bandung to utilize existing facilities and boost service uptake among MSM and the transgender community. \u2022\ufffd The action plan of Medan shows an advanced and innovative marketing approach such as the use of Facebook\u00ae to promote clinics. Recommendations from Indonesia: \u2022\ufffd Allocate more time to expound fundamental concepts such as SOGI. \u2022\ufffd Provide the slides with updated local data. \u2022\ufffd Adopt training materials into local context by using local language with the correct terminology. \u2022\ufffd Include plans of action for the training and the stakeholders within a 6-month period. \u2022\ufffd Prepare well in advance for the training and conduct preparatory meetings and rehearsals. \u2022\ufffd Be flexible and adaptable according to the local situation. \u2022\ufffd Strong commitment from various stakeholders is needed for the design and implementation of the training. \u2022\ufffd It is important to build commitment of national stakeholders from the earliest stage of planning for the training and to have stakeholder meetings after the training. Stakeholder meetings in Indonesia: The objectives of the meetings were to raise awareness on the training; to garner local resources and support from local stakeholders; and to identify supportive stakeholders in the three cities. Lessons learnt from the stakeholder meeting in Indonesia: \u2022\ufffd Metaplan charts were used to express stakeholders\u2019 views and perceptions about MSM and transgender people. The result from Bandung and Medan showed that the participants still display high levels of stigma towards MSM and transgender people. In Surabaya, participants were more open and accepting of MSM and transgender people. \u2022\ufffd Positive findings: In Bandung, the commitment from the Education Office to communicate with the Provincial AIDS Commission and disseminate HIV information to schools.

Integration of the Health Care Training Package to the National Continuum of Care Programme. \u2022\ufffd The Indonesia Team suggested that further training could be considered for Malang in East Java, Manado, Jogjakarta, Jakarta, and Bali. \u2022\ufffd There was a discussion of the effectiveness of having national stakeholder Feedback on Training in Timor-Leste At the December consultation meeting in Bangkok, Dr. Flora Tanujaya, the main facilitator for the training in Timor-Leste summarized the experience of the pilot training. The training was held in Dili, Timor- Leste from 14-16 November 2012 and was attended by 43 participants. The three-day training covered module 1, some parts of module 2 and 3, a modified version of module 4 with local epidemiological data, and module 5. Two transgender women attended the training, which helped participants deepen their understanding of SOGI-related issues. Challenges \u2013 Timor-Leste training: \u2022\ufffd Some communication difficulties resulted in participants expecting that the training package was about STI clinical management. \u2022\ufffd Difficulties in administrative support for the training. \u2022\ufffd The number of participants was too many. \u2022\ufffd Almost all participants were young clinicians without program management experience. No other stakeholders from the national or provincial government participated. \u2022\ufffd The experiential perspective of clinicians was that MSM do not exist in Timor-Leste. \u2022\ufffd Basic terminology such as the \u201cComprehensive Package,\u201d the \u201cContinuum of Prevention-to-Care- and-Treatment\u201d and \u201cpeer-based interventions\u201d, was new participants. Recommendations from the Timor-Leste training: \u2022\ufffd Epidemiological data from Timor-Leste should be included. \u2022\ufffd Enough time to discuss new concepts such as SOGI should be allotted to avoid misunderstandings about MSM and transgender people. For example, the Genderbread Person slide was used and found to be very helpful. \u2022\ufffd Local language equivalents for key terminology should be presented and discussed. \u2022\ufffd Training materials should be translated to Tetum, and adapted to Timor-Leste\u2019s context in collaboration with MSM and transgender community groups. \u2022\ufffd If feasible, trainings should provide more opportunities for participants to get to learn about the real-life experiences of MSM and transgender people (e.g., testimonials, interviews or visits to local venues). 9 \u2022\ufffd Training materials should be modified according to the level and background of participants and local context. \u2022\ufffd Ministry of Health staff should be involved to discuss how to adapt this training package to be consistent with national strategies. \u2022\ufffd Capacity building of local facilitators should be considered. \u2022\ufffd Future trainings should have a mix of participants from various sectors and involve national stakeholders. \u2022\ufffd More time should be allocated to modules 4 and 5 depending on where participants come from and how much they are already involved in MSM and transgender HIV programming and policy- making. \u2022\ufffd Peer review by health and community professionals should be conducted when translating training materials. \u2022\ufffd Community leaders should be trained as facilitators of this training package. Feedback on training in China Dr. Li-Gang Yang, Head of STD Control Department, Guangdong Provincial Centre for Skin Diseases & STI Control and Prevention, presented a summary of the pilot training held in China. The MSM and transgender HIV and STI Clinical Training Course was held in Guangzhou from 5-8 November 2012. The training was modified in response to the request of local organizers in such a way that the training covered the 5 modules within two days and then used one additional day for clinical training. The training was conducted as follows: \u2022\ufffd Modules 1 and 2 (Day 1) \u2022\ufffd Additional sessions on management of common curable STIs among MSM and transgender people (Day 2) \u2022\ufffd Modules 3, 4 and 5 (Day 3) The second day was dedicated to STI clinical management training for STI physicians, public health officials from the Disease Control Department, health workers from the community, and MSM peer educators. The training organizers invited a local MSM community leader to act as a resource person.

Main discussion points about the China training at the second consultation meeting in Bangkok \u2022\ufffd There was concern that the original intentions of the training package could be lost when countries modify the training to a great degree during implementation. \u2022\ufffd Some participants supported the idea to differentiate a package for clinicians. \u2022\ufffd It is probably necessary to adapt module 3 specifically for clinicians so as to increase their interest and make them understand that clinicians develop or implement policies on a daily basis and need to be aware of the importance of policy-related issues. \u2022\ufffd The use of MSM and transgender community facilitators is necessary. \u2022\ufffd Ample time should be allocated to discuss new concepts such as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) and SOGI. \u2022\ufffd This training should be expanded nationally. It is important for communities to be involved in translation of training materials. Some terms must be carefully translated in consultation with local MSM and transgender community. Overall challenges in use of the training package \u2013 feedback from the second Bangkok consultation The second consultation meeting identified a number of challenges in using the package as follows: 1. Localization \u2022\ufffd Language: training should be conducted in local language wherever possible (e.g., Tetum in Timor- Leste) \u2022\ufffd Need time to discuss local terms: for many participants, the specialized terminology used in the training will be new and alien. There may not be precise terms in local languages for some of the concepts \u2013 and misunderstandings can easily develop unless the facilitators explain the terms patiently and then check what has been understood. \u2022\ufffd Need simple and contextual examples to clarify new concepts (e.g., in Indonesia and Timor-Leste) 11 \u2022\ufffd Better to include local HIV and STI data, preferably disaggregated (i.e. MSM and transgender separated), together with the national/regional data; should be tailored to the targeted audience. In some countries, local data may be very limited (e.g., Timor-Leste), but regional data must be presented so that participants can learn the rapidity with which HIV can spread among MSM and transgender populations. \u2022\ufffd Need to deepen the understanding on the dynamics of transgender people and the scope of their health needs (e.g., the Philippines) \u2022\ufffd In many settings, participants will lack the capacity and knowledge on law and justice issues (e.g., Philippines). Therefore, it is recommended that a local lawyer provide relevant inputs to ensure that accurate information is shared. \u2022\ufffd Integration with existing services (e.g., psychosocial support) is important (as was seen with the training in the Philippines training). 2. Translation of training materials \u2022\ufffd Translation of slides to local language \u2013 many slides lost their original meaning in translation and need review (e.g., Indonesia and Timor-Leste). Translation was very literal and was not adapted by someone familiar with the subject matter. \u2022\ufffd Need to translate some parts of the materials for specific regions (e.g., Philippines) \u2022\ufffd Need to involve community members in translating materials; peer review by health professionals and community professionals is needed 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0021d19-0471-4983-93d3-e9a263a41df4": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0021d19-0471-4983-93d3-e9a263a41df4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Review Consultation Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3496e4bec724ce9a600568ebab5e54ccc65749221a8b4272c0aeb496fcd3f83c"}, "2": {"node_id": "18a45cd4-25d5-4838-9f91-1dba655452b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c877162f76586d349229016a172a8043276581be1ec6d1d88ef6a3aff19e2427"}}, "hash": "7b179ba43f6b774c781a0b602948c1fa718075b4948b6de6d336ba7096e4311a", "text": "Participants and training materials \u2022\ufffd The current modules are more suitable for those who with programmatic experience (e.g., Timor- Leste where the participants were clinical staff without much program experience). \u2022\ufffd Separate trainings will be needed for clinicians (e.g., China and Timor-Leste where expectations of clinical content were high but", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca264895-0e59-4f1c-80d3-1a08cec67ea1": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca264895-0e59-4f1c-80d3-1a08cec67ea1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Review Consultation Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37939e8a0b79984b51bf99e47dcf02b96f51bc5265f8a4dccd4dae194936531b"}, "3": {"node_id": "abdf078b-fe41-4a17-ba62-02e65870baa5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad14c0f2109731f5e04c45522aa649dbbee8cba79d3ae54aa12dd998f91f0446"}}, "hash": "3dcfcdd0bafbe61e044e3afbb6d9f32047d8cb603210e99a69a7622b47226b49", "text": "not met because of the focus of this package). \u2022\ufffd Where possible, the materials should be modified in a way that clinicians can refresh their knowledge and skills to deal with MSM and transgender patients (e.g., China and Indonesia) \u2013 this is not the intention of the package but might be necessary in some settings for practical reasons. 4.

Conduct meetings with Department of Health (National AIDS and STI Prevention and Control Program \u2013 NASPCP) to discuss the sustainability of training package. 2. Conduct consultation meetings with MSM and transgender people groups to learn more about their health needs. The use of ICT should also be discussed. 3. Conduct consultation meeting with stakeholders including NGOs: - Consultation meetings with MSM and transgender groups to introduce the training package; - Consultation meetings with Local Government Units, the Department of Health, Department of Social Welfare and Development, Philippines National AIDS Council, mental health agencies etc. to integrate the training into national meetings and confirm commitment for this training from these agencies. 4. Integration meeting for both MSM and transgender people and stakeholders to: a) Discuss the output of the two consultation meetings above; b) Define the role of each stakeholder; and c) Create a technical working group to facilitate discussions and preparation for training-of- trainers (TOT) and localization. 5. Conduct TOT at national and regional levels 6. Conduct localized training in priority areas, namely Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Metro Davao, monitor the results of the training, and expand to other areas based on the results. Sustainability \u2013 Indonesia At the December consultation, Dr. Made Yogi Oxtavian Prasetia described steps to roll out the training in Indonesia. Two relevant national training modules exist in Indonesia: one is STI-targeted for doctors and nurses and the other is on the Comprehensive Continuum of Care targeted for HIV program managers and NGOs in provinces and districts. The Indonesia Core Team and national stakeholders agreed to integrate this training package into the two training modules. The next steps presented were: 1. Retranslate the original modules and get them reviewed by health sector and community experts; 2. Liaise with the Ministry of Development and Empowerment of Health Human Resources to discuss how they can assist future trainings; 3. Conduct technical working group meetings; 4. Pilot the revised materials (ICT topics to be included); and 5. Finalize the training materials. Sustainability \u2013 Timor-Leste At the December consultation, Dr. Flora Tanujaya suggested next steps to accelerate the training. 13 1. Hold consultations with national stakeholders to discuss: - The importance of rolling out training in order to attract the attention of senior Government officials; - How to modify the training materials according to the local context; - How this training could fit into the National AIDS Strategy and STI Strategy and existing HIV programme; - How this training could fit into the existing Behaviour Change Intervention (BCI), VCT and STI training modules and plans; and - How this training could support improvements to meet the health needs of the MSM and transgender communities. 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abdf078b-fe41-4a17-ba62-02e65870baa5": {"__data__": {"id_": "abdf078b-fe41-4a17-ba62-02e65870baa5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Review Consultation Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37939e8a0b79984b51bf99e47dcf02b96f51bc5265f8a4dccd4dae194936531b"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca264895-0e59-4f1c-80d3-1a08cec67ea1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3dcfcdd0bafbe61e044e3afbb6d9f32047d8cb603210e99a69a7622b47226b49"}}, "hash": "ad14c0f2109731f5e04c45522aa649dbbee8cba79d3ae54aa12dd998f91f0446", "text": "2.

Promote public health and community partnerships. 14 Recommendations: Mr. Settle stressed the importance of national ownership in the process of translating the training package. He also suggested that current MSM-related initiatives and/or city-level interventions should be taken into account when planning future training and TOT and how they link to such initiatives. Further, he suggested that community people, including national MSM networks, should be part of the TOT. Dr. Yang responded that there are social entrepreneurship programs running in key metropolitan cities and they can integrate this training into such programs. Malaysia Kristiyanto, Training Coordinator, ISEAN HIVOS Project and former staff of the Malaysian AIDS Council suggested next steps to advocate for conducting the training in Malaysia. In recent years, the proportion of new HIV infections through injecting drug use has decreased significantly and sexual transmission has become the major driving factor of the HIV epidemic. Legal and social norms related to MSM and transgender people are challenging factors for HIV programming in Malaysia. MSM and transgender people have been included in the National Strategic Plan on HIV and AIDS since 2005. Suggested steps included: 1. Discussion with key stakeholders including the Deputy Health Minister/CCM Chairperson, Ministry of Health, Department of Islamic Affairs, Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development, UN agencies and UN Theme Group and the Malaysian AIDS Council. It would be very important to involve the Department of Islamic Affairs to get buy-in for this training and to advise the Ministry that the intention of the training is to explore health issues. Since the Ministry of Health works only with general public, it would be critical to work with the Malaysian AIDS Council to reach MSM and transgender community groups. It should be possible to integrate the training into post-basic training for clinical staff employed by the Ministry of Health. This training takes six months at Sungai Buloh Integrated Health Science College (Sg. Buloh KSKB) and part of the curriculum is to understand key affected populations and to be non-judgmental. Throughout the process of integration, it would be crucial to work with the Malaysian AIDS Council since the organization is the main partner with Sg. Buloh KSKB for the post- basic training. 2. Translate the training materials into Bahasa Malaysia (optional, as English is one of the main languages in the country). 3. Include the ICT component in the training materials to be considered since the Internet is often the main source for MSM and transgenders to find sex partners. Further, it is important to utilize the Internet for counseling, as people often prefer anonymous counseling. Discussion: \u2022\ufffd There was discussion about how to approach the Ministry of Health to implement this training. The suggestion was made to explain that this training provides a means to promote access to health care, rather than addressing rights issues. In relation to this discussion, it was suggested that legal and policy issues should be specifically addressed when localizing the training package. Reflections for rollout \u2013 main comments: \u2022\ufffd Module 4 is focused on outcomes and HIV and STI-related stigma and discrimination is not addressed adequately nor is the importance of coverage, funding, and disaggregated data. These issues to be emphasized in the training. \u2022\ufffd A concern was raised that, in Malaysia, these kinds of training materials have never been used for health care providers and more health professionals should be trained. 15 \u2022\ufffd The questions around next steps of the training package were raised; how to promote the training package at country-level; how to develop an evaluation module or system for communities to evaluate the quality of services given. The ideas to divide the package into two parts and/or develop an on-line version was shared. \u2022\ufffd The sustainability of the training was raised as a concern. Mr. Edmund Settle summarized issues that recurred throughout the consultations as follows: \u2022\ufffd A major issue is how to strengthen local coordination mechanisms beyond this", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5282654d-a636-42cd-bd5b-53696fd3370f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5282654d-a636-42cd-bd5b-53696fd3370f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Review Consultation Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4760f1163bdbe77fa8918a32e54aec538d22da4267d63fbb0285df06c03c157"}, "3": {"node_id": "258a5b97-c7f8-4390-b6cb-e6ca2cf03f6c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebd7e70438eddedae8f1f15555258f3de70322d113a9fbc50bdb5d1c37b21639"}}, "hash": "269af42732294bf449128b86314be1d2cc0dd2aa741902d16457bdb47a001add", "text": "training. It is UNDP\u2019s mandate to assist and strengthen coordination mechanisms. The Philippines has been very successful in strengthening its local coordination mechanisms, as there is a national body to manage/coordinate local partners such as the Local Government Units. Mr. Settle asked whether it would be useful for UNDP to strengthen local coordinating mechanisms and their HIV-related capacity and whether it would be worth exploring the existing Filipino training module on health and development to strengthen local coordination mechanisms. \u2022\ufffd Indonesian participants at the December consultation explained that they have a National Development Planning Board (BAPPENAS) to coordinate policy and budgeting, as well as a planning and development board for the coordination of provincial policies and budgets (BAPPEDA). In the area of HIV, the National AIDS Commission has the authority to coordinate and strengthen national and provincial programs. BAPPENAS is a member of the NAC. In that regard, it might be difficult to directly train BAPPENAS and/or BAPPEDA to strengthen their capacity on HIV. UNDP APRC and the Indonesia Team will follow up on the issue. UNDP APRC will follow up on the issue of training in Malaysia and Timor-Leste. \u2022\ufffd There was discussion about the challenges the facilitators faced during the pilot training related to sexual orientation, gender identity and sexual behavior. Although we should only look at sexual behavior in HIV prevention programme, community people should be included to assist in giving greater depth to such topics. He also asked continuous support to translate and localize the final training package as next steps and UNDP would support the process. Further, he mentioned the submission of ISEAN-HIVOS Phase 2 plan would be in June 2013 and that the December consultation meeting was very helpful to identify the activities needed for Phase 2. At the December consultation, Dr. Zhao Pengfei shared his reflections on how best to roll out this training supported by country offices based on his experience on the use of this training package by making the following points: 1. It is critical to institutionalize the training; 2. The UN through working groups to assist the implementation of the training at the country level; collective efforts will be needed; 3. WHO could mobilize academic and medical stakeholders to promote the implementation of the training (e.g., by working with universities, national STI centers and hospitals); 4. Establish links this training to HIV program coverage and quality of interventions to better respond to the health needs of MSM and transgender people; 5. How to use STIs as key indicators in HIV prevention programs; 6. How to use these training materials in the broader public health or sexual and reproductive health spheres in collaboration with UNFPA and other agencies; 7. Importance of listening to local facilitators and incorporating local contexts into the training; 8. Keep asking what the most frequently asked questions are during the training so that facilitators will be able to modify the training materials according to audience and the needs of MSM and transgender community. 16 At the December consultation, Mr. Edmund Settle summarized the following as key points to ensure sustainability of the training package: 1. Develop next steps, including the revision of local training modules, as well as capacity development of trainers; 2. Ensure the integration of the training into national programs; 3. Support local coordination mechanisms to support the implementation of this training; and 4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "258a5b97-c7f8-4390-b6cb-e6ca2cf03f6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "258a5b97-c7f8-4390-b6cb-e6ca2cf03f6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\"The Time Has Come\" - Review Consultation Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4760f1163bdbe77fa8918a32e54aec538d22da4267d63fbb0285df06c03c157"}, "2": {"node_id": "5282654d-a636-42cd-bd5b-53696fd3370f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/time-has-come-review-consultation-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "269af42732294bf449128b86314be1d2cc0dd2aa741902d16457bdb47a001add"}}, "hash": "ebd7e70438eddedae8f1f15555258f3de70322d113a9fbc50bdb5d1c37b21639", "text": "Support local coordination mechanisms to support the implementation of this training; and 4.

studies undertaken as part of the assignment to develop a framework for media to engage on issues relating to Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) persons in South Asia. Centre for Advocacy and Research, India (CFAR) undertook this assignment sponsored by UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre between April 2012 and May 2013 in which period we interacted with community members, leaders, activists, media practitioners and civil society from across India, Nepal and Bangladesh to gather their experiences of being part of the issue discourses and of engaging with media. The framework suggested in this document draws upon a variety of inputs by these key stakeholders. We would like to acknowledge our deepest gratitude to each one of them for sharing their insights on a range of issues of direct relevance. In undertaking the country-level interactions in Nepal and Bangladesh, we received excellent support from Blue Diamond Society (BDS) and Bandhu Social Welfare Society (BSWS), respectively. We would like to especially acknowledge the support and cooperation extended by the teams and members of these organisations. Among the individuals, we are particularly thankful to Sunil Babu Pant, Bhumika Shrestha, Bobby, Umesh, Parshuram, Durga and many of their colleagues and members at BDS, some of who also participated in the focus group discussions (FGDs). Madhav Dulal of Ujyala FM and Kyle G Knight, journalist, researcher and chronicler, besides sharing their responses, were of immense help in facilitating our interactions with local media in Kathmandu. Basu Guragain facilitated our interaction with the young members of his organisation Pink Triangle Nepal. Of our interactions with media people, we would like to especially mention Keshav Podel of The New Spotlight, Ajay B Khanal of The Himalayan Times, Hari Bahadur Thapa, Gopal Khanal and Atul Mishra of The Kathmandu Post, Ghanshyam Khadag and Sunder Khanal of The Daily Kantipur, and Subeena Dutt for their valuable participations. In Bangladesh, Shale Ahmed and his team at BSWS extended every support to us in facilitating the country interactions, with Premangshu Sarkar and Rahmat Ullah personally coordinating the meetings at each stage. Detailed interactions with other senior members \u2014 Umme Farhana Zakia Kanta, Foisul Ahsan, Royal and Beraj \u2014 gave us programme as well as community insights on the issues. Among the other community leaders, Bobby Hijra and Zoya Sikdar were kind enough to share their experiences, with the former also facilitating for us a group discussion with transgender persons at Sustho Jeebon. Media fellows Hassan Bipul of BDNews24 and Moni Mahmood of Bhorer Kagoj spared considerable time for us, and also led us to others in media, including Angur Nahar Monty, Saiful Islam and Shafiq Rehman. KSM Tariq of FHI360 provided useful detailed information on the HIV prevention project, Madumita.

Acknowledgements 1 A Framework for Media Engagement on MSM and Transgender Persons in South Asia aims to describe the positive ways that media can influence policies and programmes, and the political and social environments in Bangladesh, India and Nepal in relation to MSM and transgender persons. It also examines the relationship between media and MSM and TG representatives, and how these individuals or groups engage and influence the media, successfully or unsuccessfully. It includes a broader interrogation of the way the issues of HIV and sexual and gender identity are brought to the media\u2019s attention or become salient issues for media in its reporting. It outlines key events and policy documents related to creating awareness about HIV / AIDS among MSM and TG persons in Asia, and how media responded to these issues and efforts. The broader aim of the framework is to use media as a positive force to improve human rights and ensure universal access to HIV and healthcare services for MSM and TG persons in South Asia. Part I of this document is the Framework itself, which, building on the literature review and case studies, found later in the document, describes key findings and recommendations towards positive media engagement for bettering the health and human rights of MSM and TG persons in South Asia. Part II of this document is the overall literature review which summarises and describes the findings of a broad review of the response to HIV in Bangladesh, India and Nepal in relationship to MSM and TG issues, and an analysis of media response and engagement in each country. Part III of this document comprises country case studies, including a detailed examination of sexual identities in each country, political progress and markers, challenges and success, and recommendations. Each case study includes its own executive summary. The Framework The creation of this framework recognised three concerns: 1. HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender persons has been increasing within the South Asian region; and could further contribute significantly to new infections. 2. Reaching these communities is affected by the social, political and legal environments, such as punitive laws, the lack of or presence of social protection, and stigma and discrimination. 3. The media has a positive role to play in affecting a country\u2019s social, political and legal environments. The context for these concerns is the emergence, since 2000, of communities, politics and discourse centred around MSM identity and homosexuality in South Asia, the intensifying of global and regional responses to HIV such as MSM and TG-focused work funded by the Global Fund, and the strengthening of MSM and TG community organisations. Key milestones include reports, such as the 2008 Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia and UNAIDS Global Epidemic Reports, and different positive political achievements, such as the de-criminalising of homosexuality in India in 2009, as well as opportunities for the media to engage in a positive way with the core issues of this report. The framework maps a trajectory for the emergence of MSM and TG issues and how they can be positively supported by the media. MSM and TG issues emerge in the public eye through a variety of means: the visibility of individual activists, community organising, news reports, documentaries and films. Some of these are driven by the MSM and TG communities; others by the media reporting on MSM and TG issues. Executive Summary A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 2 This works to counter denial (both of HIV, and of certain gender and sexual identities). Media coverage and visibility increases social acceptance, which, in turn,contributes to health gains (such as access to HIV care and prevention services), human rights gains and political gains. At the same time, positive media coverage can help to shine the spotlight on urgent healthcare needs (that increase with a rise in HIV prevalence) and related", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f93df11c-7916-40d1-8883-36f3b0a5f95f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f93df11c-7916-40d1-8883-36f3b0a5f95f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4776baca1db1a2c63ec52d4ba41e585c60f3e4e41c7f8b0418addef3b529f85b"}}, "hash": "4776baca1db1a2c63ec52d4ba41e585c60f3e4e41c7f8b0418addef3b529f85b", "text": "challenges. Media has proved itself as an enabling force to effect change; for example,it can influence the decision-making processes. The framework also notes the different ways in which media can report on MSM and TG issues. Media can report on HIV in a way that stigmatises people with HIV or those vulnerable to infection. It can report in a way that highlights the needs for vital services. It can paint individuals as victims, or as powerful advocates. The way that communities engage with media is also influential, whether they manage to create partnerships with local, state or national media and the manner in which they propose features and reports on human interest stories. The next stage of successful media engagement is to scale up and deepen engagement beyond mere visibility and human interest stories towards more strategic and formal frameworks that involve comprehensive and continuous communication. This could involve covering areas ranging from policy and programmes to supporting community activism. Tools for communities to strengthen media engagement include media fellowships and round tables, and media tracking and monitoring. The framework also underscores the importance of articulate, trained and diverse community leaders who can represent issues to the media; this has been of the utmost importance in all countries. Some of the challenges identified for the framework include the complex relationship between HIV and gender and sexual identity. HIV and MSM are not synonymous. In different countries, locations and times, it seems more advantageous to focus on one than the other, sometimes resulting in the erasure or diminished importance of one set of issues. Media fatigue has also been identified: for example, there is less reporting on gay issues in India since. Representing the diversity in the community is also a challenge. For example, in the mainly urban representation of MSM and transgender persons. It can also be a challenge to identify the strongest framing devices for positive outcomes\u2014 for example, the successful emphasis of \u2018right to health\u2019 arguments, and social inclusion, parity and equality. Some key enablers of successful media engagement were identified as: charismatic spokespeople, documenting issues such as human rights violations, combining local and national-level engagements, producing media, and nurturing supportive allies to create a positive environment for media engagement. The final Media Engagement Framework proposes to be based on: 1. Consistent, regular and open communication exchange; 2. Regional partnership and cooperation; and 3. The use of evidence and data to strengthen discourse. Individual projects will then include components to: 1. Provide the scope of the initiative through \u2014 a. a regular mechanism for communication exchange between stakeholders; b. monitoring and stimulating ground-level community responses; c. tracking and monitoring media; and d. the use of online media. 2. Shape evidence \u2014 a. Using epidemiological evidence; b. Documenting good practices and challenges; and c. Creating media-friendly products. 3. Connect community with media by \u2014 a. Training community representatives; b. Ensuring crisis management capacity; c. Sensitising media; and d. Sustaining meaningful relationships. Executive Summary 3 Recommended Actions for Programme Managers Media management \ufffd Adopt multiple sensitisation strategies to engage the various levels of expertise and influence and reporting cadres in media. G Generate awareness among senior journalists about the urgency of the issue and the quality of response; engage with media leaders and decision-makers; partner with a select group of sensitive journalists; and identify and partner with sensitive media practitioners who support the community during crisis. G In-house mechanisms must constantly align local messages, with the discourse being steered by national and regional leads on the community and their issues. As part of this mechanism, local programmes must consistently address myths and misconceptions of journalists through formal and informal engagement strategies. G Focus on using events and campaigns to sensitise reporters. Include intervention site visits that provide first-hand knowledge and help build perspective. \ufffd Generate bodies of evidence on communities\u2019 roles, leaderships and initiatives, showcasing elements of enterprise and action by the communities. \ufffd Include monitoring and tracking of media as an essential component of the body of knowledge you are working to build and sustain at your respective levels. \ufffd Ensure a conscious connection between micro- level and local evidence, such as case studies, and situation updates and discourse at national and regional levels. Make local voices, events and experiences become part of wider discourses. \ufffd Develop meaningful articulation of epidemiological evidence to include and address social and familial nuances of risks and vulnerabilities.

Literature Review The literature review involved delving into major policy documents and reports, including those generated by UN systems and APCOM (Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health), and charting key milestones that stakeholders from civil society organisations, networks and organisations of MSM and transgender communities, donors, experts and government achieved in the last 10 years. The evidence from the literature review was classified under the following thematic areas: Scaling up Inclusive Programmatic Responses, Strengthening Policy and Legal Reforms, Facilitating Greater Community Involvement, Building an Enabling Environment, Provisioning Public Education for General Population, and Service Providers. The review recognises the milestone marked by the Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia in 2008 that recognised the significant need, backed with solid evidence, to address men who have sex with men in national AIDS responses. The literature review also examines early organising around MSM and TG issues in South Asia dating back to 1994 in India and tracing the advancement of the issues since then, including the Risks and Responsibilities consultation in 2006 and the formation of APCOM. A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 4 The review recommends a clear definition of MSM and transgender persons, with an explanation of their vulnerability to HIV in Asia and social marginalisation. The diversity of communities should also be represented. The literature review compares major events in the development of a response to HIV infections among MSM and transgender persons with reporting on MSM and TG issues at the time. Not surprisingly, the coverage was found to be lacking, and varied by country. The major events or milestones examined by the literature review were: the Risks and Responsibilities consultation in 2006, the UNAIDS Action Framework 2009, the Recommendation for a Comprehensive Package of Services 2009, the regional articulation of a human rights approach to HIV including addressing barriers faced by MSM and transgender persons (as expressed in ESCAP resolutions in 2010 and 2011, and the Asia Pacific Intergovernmental Meeting of 2012), the UNDP report on legal environments, human rights and HIV responses 2010, and three major reports in 2012 on HIV and the Law, HIV and Sex Work and the Law, and Transgender people, Rights and HIV vulnerability. Finally, human rights obligations, as referenced by such protocols as the Universal Periodic Review, were compared with country responses in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. It is proposed that all of these events and milestones form a context that can be reported in the media, used for media briefings, and to provide data and references to be used in media reports. Also, many of these documents affirm and reference the need to engage with and sensitise media on these issues. Country Case Studies The three country case studies \u2014 from Bangladesh, India and Nepal\u2014 describe media engagement in these countries in a way that highlights similarities and differences, and can be integrated into a set of recommendations. In Bangladesh, recognition of the hijra (part of the TG) community by government, combined with sustained community organising on HIV prevention for TG and MSM persons have enabled positive print media representation in recent years. Much of this can be credited to the pioneering role of the organisation Bandhu Social Welfare Society (BSWS) that, adopting a rights-based approach, engaged with media at both local and national levels. BSWS clearly recognised media engagement as an effective strategy for its objectives and hosted roundtables beginning in 2008 and a media fellowship programme in 2011. It also produced a community- led alternative press. The overall success in media engagement in Bangladesh is due to a mutual, mediated and multi-level engagement. Its strategies for improving media engagement include: empowering media advocates; engaging online media; widening outreach with key stakeholders; deepening engagement through longer and more complex initiatives such as research; expanding subject focus beyond health; regular exchange and sensitisation with the media, and appealing to international and national human rights instruments and bodies of data and evidence to build positive public opinion.

Just as in Bangladesh, community organisations partnered with media to raise issues about HIV, rights violations and human interest stories. Media sensitisation workshops and site visits were tools used to improve media coverage. Challenges cited were a lack of national media coverage (and that national media on HIV was shaped by government officials) and a lack of a systematic approach by CBOs to use data and other evidence for media briefings and coverage. Media topics of interest included gay couples and violence towards sexual minorities. Reporting on HIV issues has at times been strong, particularly at the state level. Recommendations from India on media engagement had some similarities with Bangladesh and some differences: the need for community leaders to work Executive Summary 5 together, to emphasise the significance of empowerment, to highlight community protest against violence and rights violations and to focus on specific programme-centred messages, as well as leverage the opportunity of events for messages. Media engagement should be consistent and planned. Nepal provides a unique model, where the LGBT movement adopted a human rights-centred approach, and where violence towards LGBT community members overshadowed attention to HIV and a more health- centred model, resulting on a clear focus on rights. Particular success with government programming and legislation also provided positive messaging and environments for media coverage and engagement (including a court ruling in 2007-08 to stop discrimination against sexual and gender minorities). The group Blue Diamond Society focused at first on communicating with community members and then engaged in wider public education. As in India, and to an extent in Bangladesh (a role played more by the organisation BSWS than by individuals), the Society members feel that their success in media engagement was due to charismatic and articulate community spokespersons (such as Sunil Babu Pant). Different from other countries though was media traction on the promotion of a broader range of social issues and activities such as gay marriage, gay tourism and gay sports. They also had particular success in national politics, for example, the creation of a National Taskforce for Sexual and Gender Minorities. On the other hand, current challenges for media engagement include sustaining interest and battling media fatigue, and that the previous media success meant that insufficient effort was put into partnerships with friendly allies to create a more generally supportive and sustainable environment for media coverage that supports MSM and TG healthcare and rights in the long term. 7 Background The independent Commission on AIDS in Asia (CAA) unequivocally noted that sex between men accounts for an increasing share of new infections in Asia and can no longer be treated as a taboo subject.1 Referring to key populations at higher risk (which includes MSM and transgender persons), it stated categorically that their levels of risk behaviour, and the starting points of HIV transmission, vary from country to country, but the overall pattern tends to be consistent across the region. Since 2000, homosexuality and gay identity issues in South Asia had begun to have a presence in the public domain, particularly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. In fact, the issue gained momentum and began to have unprecedented visibility in countries like Bangladesh and Nepal,2 and in some cases like in Nepal, communities became a visibly prominent part of popular national movements. In all of these cases, there was visibility for the issues through media coverage of the issues and its advocates and engagement with the media.3 Even as the issue discourses have, in varied ways, utilised rights, popular movements and, now increasingly, the multi-hued gay identity, there is wide recognition that the context of HIV and the communities\u2019 risks and vulnerabilities is vital not only to sustaining meaningful mass media presence4 but also on how the communities\u2019 enabling roles in HIV prevention and care services can strengthen their negotiations on core issues of social inclusion, parity and equality. This realisation has been particularly evident across community nodes and leaders in the past couple of years. As Nepal grapples to re-engage an apathetic structural disposition and a disengaged media environment, communities in Bangladesh and India are keen on bringing back momentum around the issues as in the past couple of years.

International initiatives like the Global Fund\u2019s targeted funding strategy for key populations advocate stronger community involvement in the national HIV programmes. The Global Fund\u2019s foray led to the largest ever in-country awards for HIV prevention among sexual minorities, following the first funded community-led regional programme (South Asia). In India, for example, by 2009, states such as Tamil Nadu and, to a lesser extent Karnataka, began to acknowledge the need to include transgender people in social welfare schemes and entitlements.5 The spirit and scope of this assignment to develop a media engagement framework draws much from this mandate. Part I \u2013 ASSIGNMENT SUMMARY AND MEDIA ENGAGEMENT FRAMEWORK A Framework for Media Engagement: Improving Human Rights and Universal Access to HIV and Healthcare Services for Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Persons in South Asia Assignment Summary and Media Engagement Framework Improving Human Rights and Universal Access to HIV and Healthcare Services for Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Persons in South Asia A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 8 Scope and Method Through this assignment, CFAR attempted to etch out a Media Engagement Framework by understanding the series of emerging practices across South Asian countries which enabled community leaders and media professionals alike to understand what helped attain visible advances on their issues, and how such experiences can be consolidated to supplement the current HIV programme\u2019s mandate of arresting epidemic trends among these key populations at higher risk. As part of this, an exhaustive literature survey was undertaken to bring out the contours of the issues as represented on public and alternate domains across the South Asian countries. In addition, we profiled country-level experiences in the form of case studies for Bangladesh, India and Nepal, primarily on the basis of first-hand responses of community members and leaders, media and civil society across these three countries. As will be illustrated in the succeeding sections of this document, and in the country case study narratives accompanying it, the method in attempting this media framework has been primarily about exploring, revisiting and regurgitating the course and experiences of communities and their issues becoming a part of public discourses in the region. Being entirely community-led initiatives, their narratives used symbols and associations, mediums and voices to nudge their way into public consciousness. Trying to understand these components, we remained equally keen on figuring out how a vital issue of risk and vulnerability reduction to HIV by key populations such as transgender people got posited. Very often, the human rights and identity issues were used to drive key discourses for community entitlements. Here, it was important to ascertain whether and how evidence relating to HIV becomes part of it. Where it did, was it guided by a method, or a sense of consistency? We were also attempting to understand the manner in which the induction of the HIV issues in their discourse was being perceived by the community members themselves. It may have led to self-deprecation and \u2018double stigmatisation\u2019, thus forcing a \u2018cautious use\u20196 as in Nepal; or the community may have \u2018used HIV as an advocacy tool\u2019, as Shale Ahmed of BSWS asserts in Dhaka.7 An Overall Assessment On the release of the Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia (CAA) in 2008, The Times of India observed that South Asian countries could avert increases in infections and death\u2026 with high-impact interventions such as HIV prevention programmes focused on key populations and increased anti- retroviral treatment.8 Across the three countries that are representative of the South Asian region, successive surveillance figures show that there is cause for concern over the HIV prevalence trends among the key populations at higher risk. There is also wide recognition that HIV prevalence is increasing among transgender people and the MSM community. As institutions spearheading prevention and support programmes continue to highlight the fact through periodic assessments and global release of epidemic updates, the concern is equally shared by lay community members like Royal in Dhaka when he emphasises that the \u2018number of cases of new infections among community members has been on the rise\u2019.9 The question is whether, to the media, the representation of this issue was sustained and strategically framed. Media tracking and monitoring10 reveals that the issue did manage to get space in the public domain across countries. On mass media, it often required dramatic and powerful spokespersons and high profile connotations (\u2018story pegs\u2019, in media parlance). For instance in India, these reports coincided with high-profile developments such as the Delhi", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1423f42a-9d0a-47c1-89c1-395780be7193": {"__data__": {"id_": "1423f42a-9d0a-47c1-89c1-395780be7193", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdc8705b4e54fa184b5436a98acad4ddb634d05dbd756c126f970ff1bfe2114f"}, "3": {"node_id": "a078da5e-5c9e-42f8-b56f-71bd54f2134f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b700ada2122d3b646b70b24da91032113ad466cb39403bf97574fec3774b3d63"}}, "hash": "2cac8bcabf802fd967c3944e1265c3aff8091a449e1aaada34311d0c8713d1d3", "text": "High Court order de-criminalising homosexuality in July 2009, the release of the UNAIDS Global Epidemic Report, 2010 and 2012, the release of the HIV sentinel surveillance report, 2010-2011. The question then is whether this augured well. Yes, in drawing attention to the issue, acting as a reminder and acting often as a timely global pressure on policy- makers to address the issue in a befitting manner. That addressing the epidemic trends among key populations including MSM and transgender persons was going to need concerted yet highly sensitive and deft articulation is evident in the complex programme architectures and detailed action frameworks designed as a result of the Commission report on AIDS. As revealed in the literature review, too, putting out 9 global evidence on the epidemic11 and advocating strongly for regional initiative at assessing the effect of law on the MSM community and transgender people by UNAIDS with the support of UNDP South and South East Asia,12 proved to be decisive. Going forward, UNDP India was making major advocacy gains in strengthening legal entitlements for transgender people and mainstreaming their voice across institutions. This only demonstrated a need to mount and sustain a multi-pronged approach to negotiate socio-legal barriers, even as HIV programmes were strategising to augment institutional capacities and build appreciation, readiness and the necessary spirit of inclusion in structures of governance and service delivery. None of this could be achieved optimally without the support and the consistent engagement of media with these issues. Making Issues Related to MSM and Transgender Persons More \u2018Visible\u2019 Given this, as programme focus on the most vulnerable sections intensified in the following years, and as the increasing emphasis on \u2018community-led\u2019 approaches began to make members, community identities and their issues \u2018more visible\u2019, how did it get reflected in media? Young transgender respondents at an FGD in Kathmandu summarised the scenario in the following two observations:13 1. \u201cEarlier, we were treated very poorly, and it was common for everyone to call us using such terms as \u2018chhakka\u2019 and \u2018hijra\u2019 (the term \u2018hijra\u2019 is not always used in a derogatory way). Now, it\u2019s different, after the court verdict (of 2007-8). We have university interns visiting us. There are theses being written on LGBT issues. And it\u2019s the same with media. Now there are many more stories on us, mostly positive.\u201d 2. Bobby, a present board member who has been associated with BDS since 2001 recounts: \u201cFrom a group of 10 members in 2001, we today reach out to over 300,000. But, due to a \u2018rumour\u2019 being aired by a media house, all of these members across 38 districts of Nepal are not getting essential drugs. Medicine supplies have been hit. We are forced to once again go for sex work as our salaries have stopped.\u201d Meanwhile, in another group discussion in Kathmandu, young MSM14 refer enthusiastically to the popularity of a Nepali feature film depicting same-sex love as they narrate how social media is increasingly becoming a useful platform for their community. They echo the editor of The Himalayan Times, Ajay B Khanal\u2019s view that while \u201can active community and a series of events like gay marriages, pride marches and Olympics\u201d have helped the issue come out in open, \u201cwe need more people from the community and streams like films, book publishing and media\u201d to sustain and create \u201ccurrency on the issue\u201d. The Bangladesh scenario, though more challenging with regard to the sexual minority communities, evidences parallel streaks as Umme Farhana Zakia Kanta15 at BSWS asserts that \u201csocial discrimination has lessened as a result of media writings. Hijras protest at being harassed or ridiculed now. People are more accepting. We see them getting employed in news channels, beauty parlours, ministries and some have even started living with families\u201d. The group of transgender persons (hijras) we met at Sushtho Jeebon in Dhaka16 did not miss the chance to emphasise how they have been organising street shows and other awareness-building programmes for \u201cissues of the masses like tuberculosis and family planning\u201d as it augers well with \u201ca largely positive print media orientation and the government\u2019s attitude in the last 4-5 years\u201d towards the hijras.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a078da5e-5c9e-42f8-b56f-71bd54f2134f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a078da5e-5c9e-42f8-b56f-71bd54f2134f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdc8705b4e54fa184b5436a98acad4ddb634d05dbd756c126f970ff1bfe2114f"}, "2": {"node_id": "1423f42a-9d0a-47c1-89c1-395780be7193", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2cac8bcabf802fd967c3944e1265c3aff8091a449e1aaada34311d0c8713d1d3"}}, "hash": "b700ada2122d3b646b70b24da91032113ad466cb39403bf97574fec3774b3d63", "text": "The group organises the shows as part of an FHI (Family Health International) public health programme, as it continues with its \u201ccare, counselling and STI health check-ups for both transgender persons and MSM in its drop- in centres.\u201d At the same time, both community and civil society efforts in bringing community issues into the general purview is evident across a range of films in Bangladesh.

It was able to wade through a maze of complex issues and communicate the essential dilemmas, and most importantly, at crucial junctures, rose up to demonstrate informed engagement with the community. Especially in the aftermath of the positive judgement,18 it showed a timely consciousness to focus on the road ahead and the challenges that still remained. The media, even as it partnered in celebrating the landmark success, also stressed that the essential struggle lay in getting families and friends to accept homosexuality and until that barrier was breached, homosexuality would remain invisible to a great extent.19 At the national level self identified gay activists including Gautam Bhan, Rahul Singh, Aditya Bandhopadhyay, Ashok Row Kavi, Shohini Ghosh, Sunil Paul and Danish Sheikh were using the medium (33 features tracked from 2005).20 Most of these articles dealt with securing rights of sexual minorities in light of the emerging discussions in the High Court case where Section 377 IPC was being argued. At another level, newspapers were reflecting the voice of a vast number of LGBT people who were coming out in gay pride rallies, movie screenings, protest marches, media briefings, etc. Through 2008 community voices strongly articulated the denial of rights, inclusion into society and the persistent stigma faced at familial and societal level, discrimination at workplace, and victimisation in public places. These articulations form a significant backdrop to the courtroom discussions which were more often being dominated by the government and political stand / opposition. The educated middle class young professionals contributing responsibly to society and coping with an alternate sexuality and stigmatisation was a crucial aspect of the narrative and imagery that emerged from media coverage. Consistent community presence helped reshape the gay image in media from that of a deviant, exotic and colourful individual to an everyday person. This is supported by the large number of stories that were emerging in the national media of gay people21 coming to terms with their sexuality, being persecuted by their families or village elders for being different, and seeking protection of the courts. At the programme response level, there is a differing pattern in the state and national news reporting. The community voice was not that well represented in the national media. More often than not, media coverage was shaped by official figures, representatives of the government \u2014 the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Home Affairs, officials of NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) \u2014 and, to a much lesser extent, community representatives speaking about the presence or lack of health services. For instance, a sample of 60 national newspaper health clips analysed for the period between 2010 and 2012 showed a complete absence of the community voice.22 However, this scenario changes when state-level media reporting is analysed and a strong presence of the community voices is noticeable in health- related coverage. The quality of articulation by the community was sharp and underscored their demand for increasing the number of interventions beyond the urban centres, improving the quality of the services by ensuring community participation in monitoring implementation, strengthening public healthcare services to include sexual minorities and ensuring accountability. Key Gains Let us see how such a recognisable shift in \u2018opening up of the issue\u2019 and growing spaces on public domains augurs for the community. Enhanced mass media coverage, coupled with an increasing role of civil society, led to a certain level of social acceptance for the communities necessary to initiate and harness discourses and galvanise favourable opinions on key issues. It has been possible through communities\u2019 persisting roles across a range of crucial areas \u2014 ensuring access to HIV care and prevention services, addressing human rights issues, shaping up popular identities for the 11 community and, in Nepal\u2019s case, a proactive participation in the country\u2019s popular pro-democracy movement. Social acceptance gains are evident in the many legal, constitutional and attitudinal gains that precipitated in these years recognising their distinct identities and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "167413ac-d63a-42f2-8e62-60632ae3339d": {"__data__": {"id_": "167413ac-d63a-42f2-8e62-60632ae3339d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88262072f1f258ec9d133035e36a4607a266f7cea7b029c85e76cb365155ecd9"}}, "hash": "88262072f1f258ec9d133035e36a4607a266f7cea7b029c85e76cb365155ecd9", "text": "fundamental rights as equal citizens. It is a process well begun, of addressing intricate and pervasive socio-legal barriers as mandated in the programme architecture and action frameworks. Media as a stakeholder and the communities\u2019 engagements with it have gone quite a distance on this mandate. However, the question is whether it has gone far enough to create a platform that can consistently sustain practices that are inclusive, unbiased and free from stigma and discrimination enabling the community to reduce its risk of HIV and the many related vulnerabilities. Major Gaps At a time when the number of new infections overall in the region was registering a downward spiral, the rise in HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender people has been a matter of great concern. This was particularly evident in Nepal when in 2011 the deadlock between the Government and NGOs resulted in the former not releasing funds to organisations \u201cworking with MSM and a sizeable transgender population\u201d and therefore \u201cunable to treat or prevent HIV from spreading because of the government\u2019s embarrassing financial disorganisation\u201d.23 Such voices clearly resonate with the belief that, if not arrested, HIV could undermine the many other affirmative symbols of associations the community had laboured to attain over the past decades. What is as much significant is to deliberate on what would prompt sufficient media focus on the criticality of the epidemic risks for the community. In Nepal, although community organisation began around HIV prevention services, the nascent collective identity soon became a part of the rights and the popular pro-democratic processes, and used its presence in the public domain to claim basic rights and entitlements relating to life, identity and equality.24 As a long drawn struggle, \u201csexual minorities continue to face problems to acquire citizenship certificates according to their identity despite the SC order,\u201d said Jyoti Sanghera, OHCHR-Nepal Representative, quoted in The Kathmandu Post.25 Shaping of Discourse Determinants As is clear, the battle for citizenship rights in fact got closely linked with enabling the community to access basic services such as healthcare. By 2010, Sunil Pant was declaring, \u201cWithout the [citizenship] cards, transgender people are denied access to education, jobs, healthcare, inheritances, passports and foreign travel.\u201d26 What this example essentially signifies for all the three countries alike is that it is today critical for the community to secure validation of the social acceptance it strove to attain over the past decade. Even more important is to consolidate the acceptance to meaningfully align the more entrenched mindsets, institutional practices and structural barriers as part of a comprehensive paradigm that is inclusive in spirit, just in outlook and capable of extending population-based outreach services for the community. Media as an Enabler It is important to unravel and understand the way media strove to evolve such a paradigm. We find the basis of engagement varies from country to country. In Bangladesh, 9 of the 12 media reports that came of the fellowships27 focused exclusively on the unacceptable levels of indignities the hijras were subjected to. Titled as Sad Saga of Hijras; Sufferings of Sexual Minority Students; Rights of Hijras need to be Protected; Their Miserable Life; They have a difficult life \u2014 The lives of Hijras,28 to name a few, the stories exposed in no uncertain terms the levels of stigma, homophobia and hate the hijras faced across their life cycle from childhood to adulthood. They also spoke about how key institutions such as family, hospitals, schools and colleges and police mandated to care, nurture, protect, defend and treat all human beings equally, turned vile and discriminatory against them, often reducing them to near destitution and a life of unimaginable misery. Narratives on media used voices of the affected community and messages of need for social acceptance did impact attitudes of stakeholders that mattered.

As an alternative we have set up the healthcare facility,\u201d observed Shale Ahmed of BSWS.30 Gaining Spaces for Community Initiatives Similarly in Nepal, prior to the court\u2019s judgement in 2007-08, many of the media reports graphically reported about the mindless brutality metis31 and the third gender were subjected to. Many of these also depicted HIV as a critical, if not the most disabling, vulnerability for the communities, often reporting how crucial services meant for community members were getting jeopardised by social and structural barriers. With a maximum judgment in favour of the community32 coinciding with the wider pro-democracy aspirations, the tone and tenor of discourses changed decidedly, with survival and aspiration-centred depictions overshadowing facets such as the continuing structural barriers, as also the persisting epidemic related risks for the community.33 The more consistent media monitoring in India shows that, in recent years, media played a key role in supporting the community in times of crisis such as denial of healthcare, severe forms of discrimination at workplaces, denial of entitlements and violence, etc. Media, on its own initiative across the country, highlighted high levels of discrimination faced by gay persons. In India, media was writing on a whole range of issues \u2014 the Section 377 legal debate, government efforts to mainstream the community through social protection initiatives, high levels of stigma and discrimination and violence faced by them to their role in leading HIV prevention efforts. For instance, at the national level between 2008 and 2010, a sizeable space (35% of articles tracked during the period)34 was devoted to op-eds, edits and guest columns from senior journalists, social activists, lawyers, anthropologists and community activists amongst others. During the period 2007 to 2010, in India we witnessed regular reporting on sexual minorities in the national and state media. Dates of hearing in court, gay pride rallies and other celebrations, discrimination and violations against the community were \u2018story pegs\u2019 used to reach out to the media on a regular basis. In fact, courtroom discussions were regularly picked up by the legal reporters, but the community leaders also made efforts to build consensus around some critical issues: the contradictory positions taken by the Ministries of Health and Home Affairs on homosexuality; the statement that AIDS was caused by homosexuality; opposition to anti gay statements that homosexuality destroyed family values. The consistency of community efforts revolved to a great extent as a response to the court proceedings. Gay pride rallies became a regular feature in metropolitan cities from 2007 and helped gay activists to steer media focus on calling for attention on gay rights. At the state level,35 we see that state level community organisations such as TAI - Vizhudugal working with transgender people and MSM were quite successful in maintaining a consistent relationship with media through the years, and observing community specific anniversaries (such as the Koovagam Festival), national holidays, transgender week, Indian festivals, beauty pageants. They also organised local initiatives at the state and district levels such as peer outreach week, mobilization for better community health, etc. to successfully raise their demands for social inclusion and attention to their rights. Local media was considered an important partner in all these initiatives. Consistent engagement helped the community to gain the confidence of media persons 13 and recognise the importance of community leadership in fashioning its response. Apparently such human interest news reports and features on social injustice and human rights violation did help enable these communities to break the silence and denial. In an article as early as 2009,36 UNDP\u2019s HIV/AIDS Group Director in the Bureau of Development Policy, Jeffrey O\u2019Malley, while talking about Nepal, was quoted as stating that \u201cIf nothing else, people aren\u2019t denying the existence of homosexuality anymore.\u201d According to Pradeep Khadke, the human rights coordinator at BDS, all this was possible because \u201crather than challenging Nepalese society, our group has built alliances within the democracy movement and tried to change attitudes and policies through political persuasion.\u201d Did this visibility help to break the denial on HIV? According to Sunil Babu Pant, this took a different form in much of Asia, because, \u201c\u2026for years, authorities asserted that HIV couldn\u2019t be a problem because homosexuality simply", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9440902-60ad-4cd7-8234-621328ee348b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9440902-60ad-4cd7-8234-621328ee348b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a317f294f6952df4fb19bf75c249bcefdeeb82cbe36aa62b11047a0eca5bd05a"}}, "hash": "a317f294f6952df4fb19bf75c249bcefdeeb82cbe36aa62b11047a0eca5bd05a", "text": "didn\u2019t exist.\u201d But by the late 1990s, it was obvious that HIV and AIDS posed a serious public health threat that would only get worse if the official policy continued to ignore it. Therefore, it was no coincidence that Blue Diamond Society initially worked on AIDS issues. Scaling up to Address the Deeper Challenges: Recognising Media Engagement Needs Across countries in the region, the barriers of stigma and discrimination and the challenge of ensuring universal access for a largely hidden and closeted community are similar. Across the three countries, issue discourses on the public domains have shown versatile and progressive intensities; in each of these countries, given their specific socio-political textures, the communities have been able to wrest significant legal and constitutional breakthroughs in support of their distinct identities; there are visible strides in community organisation, leadership and a certain degree of agency with which their voices get portrayed on the public domain. And yet, the biggest programmatic challenge of the day is about the \u201ccontinued reluctance to come out of the closet\u201d. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the intended outcomes of targeted intervention and focused HIV prevention tend to get offset by continued vulnerability to violence, hate crimes and ostracism. Clearly, impact of the \u2018gains\u2019 accomplished is yet to trickle down in a way that the community is able to respond cohesively to the interventions. Country specific initiatives, such as the Pehchan Project in India and the DivA project in Bangladesh and Nepal, have been responding to these barriers by emphasising proactive roles for the communities themselves. As these continue, a simultaneous focus on positioning and portraying the communities\u2019 crucial roles as enablers and change agents in the process needs to be ensured. In such a context, the significance of a media engagement framework lies in developing and sustaining a comprehensive communication paradigm. It must be able to engage with all the critical correlates such as evidence, programme architecture, best practices, reduction of stigma and discrimination and the policy and legal safeguards, and most essentially, the proactive dispositions of the communities. Strengthening Media Engagement: Persisting Challenges Looking at the way the LGBT community negotiated barriers, as in the case of Nepal, media discourse did not focus as much as it needed to on HIV related vulnerabilities and risks of the community. As is being realised by community leaders, lack of any informed mediation on these issues on the public domain is having an impact today in the form of low and desultory media engagement with their issues. In the case of Bangladesh, the systematically-evolved multi-level media engagements with these issues have demonstrated some highly replicable instruments such as those of Media Fellowships or the Media Roundtables.37 However, the domain-specific challenges being thrown up, as regards sustaining and evolving these instruments into wider platforms for scaled-up media engagement,38 underline the need for better preparedness and capacities on the part of the communities to engage meaningfully with the diverse needs of media. It calls for focused Improving Human Rights and Universal Access to HIV and Healthcare Services for Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Persons in South Asia A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 14 investments in the fundamental areas of media tracking and monitoring to build nuanced intelligence on the domain. Similarly, differentially calibrated sensitisation efforts for media practitioners would need to target barriers, lack of openness and pre- conceptions at key levels of reporting, news editing and gate keeping. And, as media overtures on the issues gets demanding the community must get simultaneously prepared with enhanced capacities to reciprocate and respond effectively. Again, in a setting like India\u2019s, where community-led responses have been able to demonstrate some tenuous engagements on public domain especially at sub-national levels, there are replicable lessons on how concerted media engagement with issues of key populations have been able to shape and inform wider public discourses within the overall context of HIV. Notwithstanding these, issue dynamics today more than ever are having to contest deeper institutional resistances, and quite naturally, are in need of strategically nuanced mechanisms for mediated engagements not only with media but simultaneously also with other key agencies in decision-making and governance. This includes controversial statements by policy-makers, many of who allege that male-to- male sex is \u201cunnatural\u201d.39 Opportunities and Challenges: Contours of a Media Engagement Framework Across settings in South Asia, while we have some fundamentally differing socio-legal and programmatic dispositions vis-\u00e0-vis issues of gender and sexual expressions, what is significantly common for any media engagement framework are the following.

As strong issue advocates, these leaders have been able to engage media with their needs and concerns, albeit in varying ways and using different instruments of engagement. There is a clear recognition, even in a relatively more challenging setting like Bangladesh, that this engagement thus far has \u2018helped break the silence\u2019 on their issues.40 If we analyse the voices on media we find that community voices got represented across a range of issues, with many like Bhumika Shrestha, Roshan Mahato, Bhakti Shah41 and others getting recognised as faces depicting some key facets, too. Similarly, in Bangladesh, more and more community faces like Pinkey Sikdar, Zoya, Bobby Hijra and others show a clear ascent as leaders and spokespersons. As there is a growing recognition to widen the horizon of cross- sector issues with which communities need to connect more intently, the process of enabling more members to emerge as spokespersons and focal points needs strengthening. Media practitioners like Hassan Bipul (BD News 24, Dhaka) and Gopal Khanal (The Kathmandu Post, Nepal) evidence a \u2018pressing necessity for more and divergent voices to represent community issues\u2019 to \u2018sustain\u2019 or \u2018revive\u2019 media interest. Needless to state that such a process of enabling community representatives needs to be designed and inculcated as a consistent component of programme interventions intended for the communities. In India, an analysis of 217 health-centred news clips from four high prevalence states (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra) for the period 2005-2010 shows that out of an approximate 344 voices tracked, roughly 90 voices (26%) were those of community representatives, followed by NGO implementers (21%) and SACS/ NACO officials (16%).42 What is more significant is that the quality of articulation by the community was sharp and underscored its demand for increasing the number of interventions beyond the urban centres, improving the quality of services by ensuring community participation in monitoring implementation, strengthening public healthcare services to include sexual minorities and ensuring accountability. Sustaining Gains: Emerging Concerns What is of paramount importance today is how the gains made thus far can be taken forward and consolidated into a sustained advocacy that reverberates with the day-to-day realities, needs and aspirations of the millions of community members who continue to remain disengaged with many of these enabling processes. 15 This is clearly evident in the concerns being expressed by scores and scores of smaller community groups from far-off areas of Nepal whose members gathered in hundreds in 2012 to protest before offices of the highest government officials including the Prime Minister, the continued denial of basic healthcare and HIV prevention and care services.43 Both, the blatant inaction on the part of the government, and the community\u2019s unified struggles against this, needed strategic mediation by media as a public instrument and a leveller to wrest rightful outcomes for the community. As an enabling move, however, there has been a conscious programmatic thrust at expanding services and outreach to the remotest areas, as Premangshu Sarkar of BSWS in Dhaka pointed out: \u2018Programme intensities have increased manifold in the past couple of years as we have expanded from 8 DICs in 2009 to 38 across remote districts in Bangladesh. We are also networking an unprecedented number of CBOs from across these places under the DivA project\u201d.44 However, in India for instance, since 2011 the space for reporting on gay issues has diminished as indicated by the media tracking. There is a degree of fatigue for media, which would like different aspects of the issue to emerge and the community is also challenged on shaping up to this challenge. It is evident however that the CBOs clearly recognised media as a critical ally in shaping societal attitudes towards the gay community and understanding their role in HIV prevention efforts.45 From this flows the obvious challenge that gender and sexual identity movements in all these countries, in spite of securing some significant mass media presence and remarkable gains and recognitions, have to contest homophobia, coupled with stigma and discrimination as the most virulent and defiant barrier.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3228c4a2-eae9-48fd-a762-0fcde51ba782": {"__data__": {"id_": "3228c4a2-eae9-48fd-a762-0fcde51ba782", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96b3fcc53255b0318190e3bb21815814973113a703acf09d45a873344110c997"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb2d3bb6-5630-4add-a15b-c4be46d01d87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83dc1aaa4013af2684bdb65b0a0f94ea2f2cfcb2696f8be940ef1b3b5e3c4d4a"}}, "hash": "14f8761a5134c3406485b62d8f09832c6ca1d8a388a6de4ac038c5960beb40ff", "text": "What this points to is that mass media representation on their issues have failed to sustain a momentum necessary to motivate inclusion of the issues in localised and interpersonal discourses; or that the element of people-connect (especially people who matter) in the portrayals and representation on media needed to be more vivid, diverse and consistent in order that a wider cross-section of sub groups within communities could identify", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb25a9ce-79f8-4482-aa2f-eecc4bd4af24": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb25a9ce-79f8-4482-aa2f-eecc4bd4af24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "195ffdd9a860e37c7015e22dc97ec342f5f5448adcef3a58a395515ff74bc106"}, "3": {"node_id": "31e5a9e5-5892-4c57-994e-7a1a6ed55e88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72722cc964a09a7e27c978a5ca9b6d993fc781a01fdf8a04f147ee75e9c5fc55"}}, "hash": "ff80c5067946955c129dfb2732bfacd00aedbce6d1b27cb65d8673140fd269fc", "text": "more readily; or the diverseness in perspectives necessary to co-opt a multi-sector alignment on the issues could not be forged owing to a lack of an informed mediation of issue discourses, and their agendas. Reflecting the lack of response, Madhav Dulal, Pahichan Programme Coordinator of Blue Diamond Society stated that \u201cthe gays, who are living a dark life in the Nepalese society, cannot report that they are HIV positive\u2026.\u201d46 In Nepal, analysis of 62 reports with messages broken up across themes like mapping of key populations at higher risk, HIV surveillance, programmatic response, reduction in stigma and discrimination, legal barriers, social entitlements (enumerating third gender in Census, Right to Citizenship Card) shows key stakeholders executing HIV, health and social development programmes as completely disengaged on issues affecting MSM and transgender persons. In fact, out of 316 messages carried in these reports, they accounted for a mere 27 messages of which 17 were voiced by the officials of the Census Department.47 Community-led responses and negotiations around issues of MSM and transgender persons as reflected in the media continue to have an overwhelmingly \u2018urban\u2019 representation. As both the programme and community leaderships recognise the difference between the urban and rural contexts, their concerns to reach out to \u2018the far-off and distant community members\u2019 is becoming visible in efforts like Pahichan in Nepal, and BSWS\u2019 focus on strengthening \u2018local level engagements and capacities through Stakeholder Forums and the DivA project\u201948 in Bangladesh.

Similarly with the radio programme Pahichan -begun in August 2012 and being broadcast by some 11 FM stations everyday-, its producer Madhav Dulal gets \u2018regular emails and phone calls with highly emotive messages in support from distant listeners.\u2019 In Bangladesh, the fact that under the DivA project, some 61 community-led CBOs across the country have been brought into a singular training and capacity building fold is a \u2018promise of significantly vital outreach for our messages\u2019, feels Beraj, a community member who works as a Training Officer on the project. Similarly in India, the Pehchan project undertook media outreach in Andhra Pradesh in November 2011 to prevent HIV transmission amongst MSM and transgender people through community-led efforts. It led to strong messages to implement the interventions in remote and rural areas through various initiatives such as community radio, static clinics and partnership with the link worker scheme in rural areas. An analysis of 56 messages emerging from a sample of 26 reports found strong focus on the components of the intervention that would reach the community (25% messages) while a large segment of the reports were urging stakeholders including the police, railway authorities to respond in a more emphatic manner, take measures to reduce community\u2019s vulnerability to violence and enable access to welfare measures (52% messages).49 Another targetted media outreach effort that emerged from Pehchan in Tamil Nadu focused on the uptake of counselling services through a community-run helpline, providing support to those struggling with their identity.50 Having gone through these trials and tribulations, there is an across-the-board recognition that strategic positioning of the epidemic dynamics is vital to not only sustaining any meaningful mass media presence, but also on how communities\u2019 enabling roles in HIV prevention and care services can strengthen its negotiations along core issues of social inclusion, parity and equality. As community-led initiatives in Nepal have begun to re-emphasise this context once again for positioning a gamut of LGBT issues on the mass media, in Bangladesh it has continued to be in front, with foremost institutions reiterating the \u2018right to health\u2019 focus to advance issues of sexual minorities51 like the MSM community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31e5a9e5-5892-4c57-994e-7a1a6ed55e88": {"__data__": {"id_": "31e5a9e5-5892-4c57-994e-7a1a6ed55e88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "195ffdd9a860e37c7015e22dc97ec342f5f5448adcef3a58a395515ff74bc106"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb25a9ce-79f8-4482-aa2f-eecc4bd4af24", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff80c5067946955c129dfb2732bfacd00aedbce6d1b27cb65d8673140fd269fc"}}, "hash": "72722cc964a09a7e27c978a5ca9b6d993fc781a01fdf8a04f147ee75e9c5fc55", "text": "These clearly reflect the priorities being articulated by community leaders in different country settings, and are in unison with international efforts like the Global Fund\u2019s targeted funding strategy for key populations advocating for stronger community involvement in the national HIV programmes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84f0a5be-d239-454a-9b63-25348593bedd": {"__data__": {"id_": "84f0a5be-d239-454a-9b63-25348593bedd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ed884c2bd27016041019533ae2d84ac28e100b51bddf4ba2f7558f0820eb470"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae1e9de9-af37-42bc-92ac-0168d63f39ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1df5631ac6d7b3bb4c03035243bd23bfce50e282d57b495485dcdc521ef9f76"}}, "hash": "a7307b071d8ac966e459756804328b18e2a15848e9882896bd05fd98d5849ff9", "text": "The Global Fund\u2019s foray led to the largest ever in-country awards for HIV prevention among sexual minorities. In India, as mentioned earlier, states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka began reworking social welfare schemes and entitlements by 2009 to augment access for transgender people. In addition, with a visibly higher level of acceptance across countries for transgender people and their concerns, there is a growing consciousness to expand community-led discourses to embrace longer- term contexts of empowerment and social mobility. Senior rights activist Sara Hossain in Dhaka strongly argues for the discourse on transgender identity to \u2018recognise the leverage that health and HIV issues have given to the community for it to bargain for even more enabling entitlements\u2019. Clearly, what such a cross-sector paradigm will need is deft mass media mediation capable of identifying spaces within on- going discourses around risks, vulnerabilities and identity, to weave in and effectively coalesce the long- term aspirations of the community. Emerging Key Correlates for Media Engagement Through this assignment, CFAR attempted to etch out a Media Engagement Framework by understanding the continuum of practices, notions and outcomes enunciated in the succeeding sections that enabled community leaders, civil society and media professionals to respond on issues of sexual and gender minorities across countries in South Asia. As a backdrop, CFAR had its experience of intervening as part of a national response to HIV and AIDS in India since 2005 under the Avahan initiative. This broad canvas enabled CFAR to work with numerous partners working and advocating on issues related to key populations and HIV and AIDS, including the MSM and 17 transgender people\u2019s organisations and leadership. Part of this experience also informed the India country case study undertaken as part of this assignment. Looking at the regional scenario, when we juxtapose community experiences, gains and breakthroughs in the preceding decade\u2019s time with the evolving contours of ground level challenges and epidemiological imperatives, we find that champions and advocates have grappled with extreme forms of issue complexities, and yet have generated some effective lessons in media engagement. In Nepal, for instance, Sunil Babu Pant asserts that \u2018the focus on documenting day-to-day incidences of human rights violations from early 2000s proved to be a clinching body of evidence for the historic 2007-08 court verdict\u201d. His ascent as \u2018a highly affable, media-friendly and articulate issue champion\u2019 is vouched by media insiders of all hues, many of whom equally recognise the gradual shaping of other community faces like Bhumika, Roshan and others as \u2018promising young voices\u2019. In Bangladesh, the quiet yet sustained manners in which the lead community group BSWS involved local level media ever since 2008 across Dhaka, Sylhet, Chittagong and Comilla,52 and supplement it with national level engagement of decision makers in media through yearly Roundtables53 show up as highly effective mechanisms. Of as much interest is their experiment with Media fellowship54 as an instrument to strengthen informed expressions on the issues. Even on relatively \u2018more technical\u2019 aspects of epidemiological evidence and estimation, we find that when engaged in a more coherent fashion such as through fellowships, the media has shown discernible interest in reporting in balanced forms. Evidence presented in media reports, though not significant in quantitative terms, show a qualitative shift as regards understanding the epidemic burden shared by the community and its associated risks. Having said this, we also reckon that communities have continued to face \u2018gaps\u2019, and to \u2018address these gaps in the emerging discourses\u2019, they have responded with their own versions of \u2018mediating and trying to shape the discourse\u2019 through such efforts as Orao Amader (Bangladesh)55 and Pahichan (Nepal). Similarly, there are lessons from the way media and civil society have responded to community needs and challenges and engaged with issues. The fact that Kiran Nepal, Sudeshna Sarkar, Deepak Kharel evoke spontaneous recall among lay community members in Nepal as \u201chighly sensitive media people who helped initiate and shape early contours of the discourse on LGBT issues\u201d56 clearly brings out the potential of harnessing all such affirmative voices as allies. In Bangladesh, the persevering manner in which the community has worked with diverse profiles of stakeholders from police to doctors and academia and nurtured them as \u2018visible support groups\u2019 has equally useful lessons in creating a strong media- friendly support system around the issue.57 A Media Engagement Framework Guiding Ethos 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae1e9de9-af37-42bc-92ac-0168d63f39ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae1e9de9-af37-42bc-92ac-0168d63f39ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ed884c2bd27016041019533ae2d84ac28e100b51bddf4ba2f7558f0820eb470"}, "2": {"node_id": "84f0a5be-d239-454a-9b63-25348593bedd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7307b071d8ac966e459756804328b18e2a15848e9882896bd05fd98d5849ff9"}}, "hash": "d1df5631ac6d7b3bb4c03035243bd23bfce50e282d57b495485dcdc521ef9f76", "text": "Sustaining a climate of consistently regular exchange Given these varying experiences across countries of negotiating public domain spaces for issues of MSM and transgender persons, any media engagement framework will need to constantly keep in sight all the key elements \u2013 of evidence, programme architecture, reducing stigma and discrimination", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c8c6974-1263-46bf-a224-9ec118f35d41": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c8c6974-1263-46bf-a224-9ec118f35d41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77e6b04cb2ba6e6ff4a216c18d4c1b6eab36c18fd3166d8401b8957c561c2f16"}}, "hash": "77e6b04cb2ba6e6ff4a216c18d4c1b6eab36c18fd3166d8401b8957c561c2f16", "text": "\u2014 as critical to the entire discourse, as it strives to increasingly position the communities as the node for solutions, as capable of enterprise, and most essentially, as agencies rather than just victims or survivors. Equally vital is to align the communities and its representative voices with media and other key supporting agencies in programme, governance and opinion building; and keeping this alignment mutually dynamic and vibrant. 2. Regional backdrop for the Issue The expansive similarity in the socio-cultural, systemic as well as epidemiological dimensions across countries in South Asia is an opportunity that must be harnessed to keep the discourse on scale in the region. Sustaining regular exchange among communities, civil society initiatives, experts and media will strengthen a climate of dialogue, openness and innovation necessary to keep the issues meaningfully relevant in shifting socio-political landscapes and public consciousness. Senior Improving Human Rights and Universal Access to HIV and Healthcare Services for Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Persons in South Asia A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 18 community leaders like Shale Ahmed in Bangladesh, who has been central to steering the issues of the MSM and transgender people in the country for over a decade, points to this need in no uncertain terms \u2014 \u201cWe need UN and international endorsements to be able to engage media\u201d more intensely on issues of sexual minorities and be able to \u201cbring inclusive focus on the group\u201d.58 Community leaders and media practitioners across the three countries often expressed the desirability of inter country exchanges \u201cto learn from the fast changing scenarios in countries like India and Nepal\u201d as regards increasing acceptability of these hitherto \u201clargely hidden sections\u201d of populations.59 3. Cogent evidence to strengthen informed steering of the discourse At a time when the policy and programme think tanks in the region have begun coming out with a representative body of cogent evidence in the form of the MSM Country Snapshots, it is pertinent that all issue-based engagements with media utilise the full potential of these compilations as strategic media products. As a periodic source of epidemiological, behavioural, programmatic and legal information and data pertaining to the communities, the Snapshots bring in the credibility and representativeness needed to engage the highest levels of media on the issue. It must be used as a catalytic tool to foster and deepen meaningful exchanges between lead policy and programme institutions at the regional level like UNDP, UNAIDS, APCOM and AIDS Data Hub with decision makers and opinion leads in media. More tactically, the making and release of the Country Snapshots should be occasions to bolster communities\u2019 engagement with media on the one hand, and deliberate the discourse directions in the region on the other. On the same plane, an online clearinghouse such as \u2018The Source\u2019 at APCOM should be used as a platform for sustaining regular interaction and sharing with a cross section of media practitioners in the region. Its presence and outreach as a credible knowledge source on the community should also be used to celebrate and showcase media\u2019s contributions on the issues and partnerships with various community nodes. A framework modelled on the above ethos will have as its cornerstones the following key correlates and components. A. Scoping the initiative \u2013 At the core of the engagement framework is a comprehensive mechanism to cater consistently to the needs of convergence; and will entail: a. Internalising guiding dimensions of the programme needs and focus \u2014 This calls for a regular mechanism of interfacing community with leaders, experts and programme managers. Emerging evidence and focus themes devised by representative institutions should be used to anchor deliberations and develop shared understanding of future roadmaps. The exchanges should aim at establishing and increasingly highlighting national and regional connects for local issues through regular flow of human interest evidence, information on community initiatives and programme data. b. Monitoring and qualifying ground-level responses to the various stimuli (social, structural, policy and services) \u2014 Lead community entities must sustain a process of visiting and reviewing interpersonal-level discourses among members. The process would aim at fathoming day-to-day challenges and aspirations that must in turn get represented and reflected in wider discourses on community issues. Both these components together would encourage a process such that community members can comprehend and relate with how institutions of governance, programme agencies and stakeholders like media at macro levels are responding to their issues, as it deepens the leadership\u2019s acumen and civil society\u2019s knowledge of ground level needs, challenges and aspirations.

Understanding and constantly assessing the domain of media and its responses to both programme and ground level dynamics \u2014 Tracking and Monitoring of Media is an essential pre-requisite to any informed long- term engagement, as it constantly informs the community of how the media is responding to and prioritising evidence. To engage with the domain of media, monitoring of key (and sampled) outlets and tracking of how various issues get positioned and followed up will help with necessary intelligence on domain trends, leanings of key interest groups, stakeholders and spokespersons on issues of direct and affiliate relevance, and identifying practitioners. Media monitoring is essential for any dynamic process of aligning issue needs and concerns, and establish effective cross-sector linkages. In fact, the India case study gathered media evidence from over 3,000 clips that were analysed from the national and state newspapers and interactions with activists, community leaders and journalists who shaped evidence and coverage around the issue. This was made possible by the consistent tracking and monitoring of media by Centre for Advocacy and Research from the years 2005 to 2010.60 The Nepal experience shows that predominantly human rights violations centred coverage by media through years preceding the judgement transformed from a victim- centric to a more open portrayal in the post- judgement period, celebrating survival-hood, triumph and performance by the community. Even a basic monitoring exercise, as the community began being widely accepted as a \u2018pro-democracy\u2019 enabler in these times, would have helped them utilise this shift in engaging more purposefully with the domain of media. Simultaneously, media tracking and monitoring must inform, and lead to identifying, like- minded practitioners across spaces like news reporting, feature columns and opinion spaces at various levels \u2014 local, sub- national, national and regional. With such a pool of information and trends, communities will be better supported in pushing issue agendas with media. d. Utilising the \u2018liberating\u2019 potential of online media formats \u2014 Much as it is a great multiplier, the online media has emerged as an effective medium for attaining the necessary take-off momentums, especially on issues with complex dynamics. In a clear appreciation of this, the Executive Director of APCOM noted on its 6th anniversary on March 23, 2013: \u201c\u2026launching a strategic new website today which intends to create a genuine online neighbourhood where stories of best practices, lessons learnt and challenges overcome are widely shared, ensuring that we reach governments and policy-makers as well as the grassroots of the grassroots.\u201d In our content analysis, we have clearly found that a significant proportion of media interest on complex issues like those of the sexual and gender minorities have come from online media. Some of the most prolific writings, exploring the less obvious yet vital aspects of the communities, too have appeared on online editions. Both in terms of depth of coverage and quality of narratives, the online stories have been remarkably ahead of the others. Simultaneously, the recent years have also seen a proliferation of serious online media outlets, especially in countries like Bangladesh where, in a matter of two to three years, the \u2018numbers have grown exponentially\u2019. Communities and issue advocates must encourage the use of online media spaces, utilising essentially the amiable passages these ensure for community experiences to come out on public domains, including the convenience of oft-needed privacy and confidentiality. B. Shaping evidence \u2014 As the most critical building block of the whole engagement edifice, this component needs to be constantly shaped from Improving Human Rights and Universal Access to HIV and Healthcare Services for Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Persons in South Asia A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 20 the ground up and informed by both programme overtures and media responses. Its correlates would comprise: a. A categorical focus on utilising epidemiological evidence \u2013 It is essential to recognise that epidemiological evidence is a specialised body of knowledge, and often highly technical in itineration, too. Clearly, it needs sophisticated articulation and media focus such that these can be made to relate with the more \u2018visible\u2019 or easily discernible or popularly perceived facets of the epidemic. It can be achievable by a two-pronged approach. One, by ensuring a more regular and cogent mechanism for interpolation of evidence from local to the regional levels, and portraying through documentations the impacts inter alia. It must be able to bring out how seemingly feeble local evidence (such as new infection trends in a population) is a stark corollary of a possible epidemiological behemoth at the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7301004-7d84-48d9-af5b-b99f475606e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7301004-7d84-48d9-af5b-b99f475606e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94cfcaaeaff01de04130483b3f4fdc4a3545a93236f0fc9fa3b54120c0fa965e"}}, "hash": "94cfcaaeaff01de04130483b3f4fdc4a3545a93236f0fc9fa3b54120c0fa965e", "text": "national or regional levels. This is where the process of engagement must leverage the advantage of representative evidence like the periodic MSM Country Snapshots. And two, by ensuring to develop and constantly nurture a pool of senior, credible and seasoned media practitioners with knowledge, expertise and institutional clout to delve into complex paradigms, and comment on these with authority. Encouraging regular exchanges within such a pool to harness inter-country and regional perspectives would augment the quality of issue narratives on media as it transcends from a mere \u2018news\u2019 format to specialised spaces like columns and special features including one-page spreads focusing just on this issue. Moreover, many publications and channels have a weekly supplement and news magazine that do in-depth issue analyses, such as BBC\u2019s \u2018Panorama\u2019 and \u2018Horizon\u2019 programmes. b. Documenting good practices and challenges from within community processes \u2014 The core objective of documentation, besides creating a body of knowledge, would be to showcase the various facets \u2014 of mortal existence, of enterprise, of talent, as well as of existential dilemmas and travails as the community perseveres through reclaiming its entitlements. As a practice, documentation needs to be inculcated as a routine yet essential process because it is only a trail of incidences and events that finally produce clinching evidence necessary to precipitate meaningful actions. The guiding objective of this documentation should be to create a tapestry of human interest cases and pegs with which media can connect more readily. c. Creating media-friendly products \u2013 Documentation of community-led initiatives and shared showcasing on mass and campaign media should be fed by a variety of products. These products can be customised in the form of issue backgrounders, campaign briefs, event handouts, etc. to policy papers on service provisions, case study compilations, fact sheets on entitlements, status updates on key demands, etc. The objective of this regular customization is to ensure engagement with diverse levels of practitioners, and to be able to cater to diverse formats. At one level, this documentation creates a vital knowledge trail on the travails, roles and initiatives of the communities. At another, it provides for an essential ingredient in the form of credible human interest pitches for media to relate more naturally to. Furthermore, using such documentation to showcase the community across public, campaign and alternate media domains will help legitimize and strengthen evidence sharing across, which in turn is necessary to encourage more \u2018free-flowing\u2019 discourses on platforms and outlets accessed by communities farther off the mainstreams. As evidenced in Bangladesh, community organisations like BSWS have been fairly active on both fronts - community dissemination and engaging the media. 21 However, a lack of connect between the two has meant that real life accomplishments or testimonies from communities could be brought out only with the use of a targeted initiative like the Media Fellowship begun in 2011. The community dissemination products like Spandon, continued since 2004, nonetheless have scores of accounts from communities that could have been worked upon to secure meaningful spaces on public domain. The Unique Package of Services that MSM, transgender people and other key populations at higher risk need, go beyond just ensuring condoms, lubricants, safe sex practices, treatment for specific STIs, psycho-social and mental health support, to including legal and policy support for disseminating HIV prevention education among the peers. This implies that there needs to be clear denominators against which the communities are mapped, such as, do services reach them consistently and with all necessary prophylaxis, and that processes are tracked to assess gaps or unmet needs. Incidences like the one targeted against outreach workers in Lucknow show61 that many such community specific targets may not be achievable given the fact that mainstream health and related institutions have to be sensitised and made responsive. Thus, documentation of good and robust practices on the ground and putting these out on the media becomes all the more important. C. Interfacing community with media \u2013 The component has three lead streaks as under: a.

It would focus on strengthening leadership\u2019s capacities to track divergent streaks on public domain, timely sense the need for appropriate response to these, and galvanize informed multi-pronged engagement. The Nepal experience in particular brings out the criticality of this component. It further underscores the need to keep on-board a variety of stakeholders from community, media, civil society and government as part of a crisis management mechanism. Crisis response would focus necessarily on ensuring skills for interpolating evidence, intercepting opportunities, shaping and modulating messages, motivating voices from ground levels, aligning spokespersons and ensuring sustained media relations and follow ups. c. A cohesive sensitisation of media targeting key levels of skill, expertise, institutional management and domain influences \u2013 It will need to devise and pursue sensitisation efforts with media at least at two to three levels. At one level, an exercise like the Fellowship in Bangladesh or the NAMA awards62 in Nepal must continue to initiate frontline cadres of reporters and journalists into the issue who can work with positive role modelling, human interest features, etc. At another level, a much more serious, specialised and evidence-informed engagement must look at developing a breed of senior, issue-based practitioners competent to inspire dynamic alignments with other Improving Human Rights and Universal Access to HIV and Healthcare Services for Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Persons in South Asia A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 22 issues of relevance, explore nuanced aspects of the issue and cross-sector linkages. The sensitisation modules for them need to incorporate interactive tutorials, site visits and expert interactions as essentials. Most importantly, it is a sustained emphasis on exposure to epidemiological and other data and evidence, facilitation by experts, and access to a diverse range of spokespersons and champions that will be crucial to an effective sensitisation regimen. Therefore, constantly informing this engagement with national policies, legal barriers, national and regional HIV responses relating to the transgender and MSM communities would be vital. The content analysis clearly brings out how the rich evidence on epidemiology and its trends in the country snapshots, programme architectures essential for MSM and transgender people and all the barriers that need to be overcome in keeping with national and international covenants have gone severely under-reported, not finding their way onto mass media. These must be placed systematically, supported with documentation of practices and voices from the ground and local opinion leaders. On a yet higher level, community leadership must look to utilize opportunities and spaces for engagement with professionally acknowledged media forums such as the South Asian Free Media Association (SAFMA). With a proclaimed mandate to strengthen cultural and people-to-people contacts in the region, such a body comes as a like-minded ally capable of negotiating meaningful spaces on public domains across countries for MSM and transgender people. Sustaining active dialogues and exchanges with such forums on key community issues will not only enrich the community\u2019s perspectives, but essentially also strengthen its goodwill across media nodes in the region. Similarly, media and cultural exchange initiatives at the regional level such as those under SAARC are opportunities that should be utilised for sharing human interest aspects across countries in the region. The advantage of people-to-people exchange that these soft mediums offer augers perfectly well for communities across populations in the region, and must be leveraged consistently, especially to showcase enterprise, assertion and triumph by communities. d. Sustaining a meaningfully consistent relationship between media professionals, community leaders, and allies including experts, programme leads and civil society \u2013 The process must be conscious of retaining issues of MSM and transgender people on public domain, guiding discourse tonality and locating opportunities for cross-sector alignments. What is of utmost significance is to keep a certain intensity of media campaign alive at all times. It would have high tide and ebb tide phases, but must not go out of the radar of media. While special days, celebratory events and public functions are occasions to be utilised for creating high decibel splashes on key issues, these must be accompanied by a well-worked out plan of \u2018build-up\u2019 and \u2018follow-up\u2019. This is to ensure that beyond the obvious proclamations, noises and rhetoric, a variety of arguments and perspectives get to deliberate the finer nuances of issues. It would encourage and bring forth voices and opinions from the peripheries to become part of the discourses, making these increasingly representative and shared. 23 1.

Prime concerns The concerns were three-fold: 1. There is a growing recognition that HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender persons was increasing within the region and could contribute significantly to new infections. 2. Any effort to respond to the higher incidence of HIV among the communities and scale up the programme to reach out services to them would, in all likelihood, be thwarted or not allowed to reach the target group, given the presence of punitive laws across South Asia and lack of social protection to these communities. 3. To build an enabling environment for these highly stigmatised and hidden communities, it would be necessary to harness the positive power of the media and evolve ways to engage with the domain consistently despite the hostile legal and social environment and the media\u2019s own contradictory nature. 2. Methodology and Rationale In keeping with this proposed design, we delved into major policy documents and reports, including those generated by APCOM63 (see Annexure1). They enabled us to chart out key milestones that stakeholders from civil society organisations, networks and organisations of MSM and transgender community, donors, experts and government achieved in the last 10 years. These documents helped us chart the role they have played globally, regionally and nationally in drawing attention to the risk and vulnerability they experienced and in advocating for scaling up the response. Before we examine how these efforts were made globally, regionally and nationally to set and advance the mandate for multi-pronged programmatic response, it would be worthwhile to articulate some opinions leading advocates expressed for a meaningful and basic media engagement. Hon. Michael Kirby, former Justice of the High Court of Australia, while speaking of the \u201cpositive power of media in reshaping attitudes to be more supportive\u201d, stated that given the growing impact of satellite televisions, global media, the internet and social networking, these should be harnessed for \u201csecuring a change in global attitudes to sexual orientation and gender identity.\u201d (Godwin, 2010, July). Taking this forward, Mr. Roy Wadia, Communication Adviser, APCOM, in his presentation spoke about how, \u201ccommunications should not be an afterthought as it is a process that underpins the growth and success of APCOM.\u201d (Wadia, 2010, June 23-25). Both underscore the importance of mass media and the need to harness the \u201cpositive power of media in reshaping attitudes to be more supportive and accepting of diversity of sexualities and gender identities.\u201d (Kirby, Deconstructing Homophobia, 2010, May 17). If mass media needs to be harnessed as an ally and facilitated to play an effective interventionist role, and at the very least not encourage homophobia or spread myths and misconceptions, there is need to define the quality and thrust of the media engagement expected. There has to be recognition of the dimensions of the issue, including the strategies used regionally and nationally, to address concerns of MSM and transgender people and the challenges in their wake. Part II \u2013 NARRATIVE REPORT Literature Review Literature Review A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 24 Recognising \u201cMomentums\u201d Since many changes witnessed in the last few years were made possible by the \u201cmomentums\u201d given to the issue, we need to highlight this. From the perspective of designing and building a framework for a strong media engagement, we need to understand these processes and etch out enabling approaches and strategies that ensure better programmatic outreach of MSM and transgender people and scaling up of delivery of basic services informed by robust evidence. Independent Commission on AIDS in Asia One defining momentum was the release of the Report of the Independent Commission on AIDS in Asia (CAA), as it exhorted all governments to recognise the fact that \u201csex between men accounts for an increasing share of new infections in Asia and can no longer be treated as a taboo subject.\u201d (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008, March 26). The arguments were premised on the fact that the lack of social acceptance of MSM put them and their partners at risk. It went on to explain that: \u201cSame- sex monogamy is fairly rare in Asia; social taboos and discrimination mean many men who have sex with men also have sex with women and may be married. Also many men who have sex with men have high numbers of male partners and low condom use. In many Asian cities this has led to a rapid rise in HIV prevalence", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32b6a35c-63f6-4868-987b-5fc0c430e7a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "32b6a35c-63f6-4868-987b-5fc0c430e7a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e86bf5fc96a273f43df3cf2230653c6246bb6bf766934f3a410c2f2aa3ae65db"}}, "hash": "e86bf5fc96a273f43df3cf2230653c6246bb6bf766934f3a410c2f2aa3ae65db", "text": "among men who have sex with men.\u201d (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008, March 26). Experts and policy-makers who authored the report agreed with the observation of UNAIDS (2007) that the \u201ckey component missing virtually from all national programmes are services for men who have sex with men.\u201d Therefore, much more is needed to be done to convince governments about the necessity to enhance investments in HIV programming for MSM and not allow this omission to persist. They were also aware that despite the evidence to show that HIV prevalence among MSM is 50 times higher than the general population, \u201cinvestment on HIV programming in several countries for MSM remains low at 0-4% of the total spending for HIV programming region- wide.\u201d (Constella Futures, USAID, 2006).64 Therefore, the challenge before the advocates was to strengthen the evidence to prove the increasing incidence of HIV among MSM and transgender persons, showcase practices that worked and advocate a policy and legal reform to deal with the many structural barriers and challenges the community faced, including stigma and discrimination. 3. Thrust and Findings In this context it is essential to delineate what worked in shaping the regional and country response, where and to what extent did policy and legal reforms, or the lack of reforms, impact programme delivery and social inclusion of MSM and transgender community. There is also the need to establish whether the efforts by community-based organisations to shape interventions and assert their leadership and participation in the programme have worked strategically and programmatically. Finally, it needs to be understood how various stakeholders\u2014 including the media, which influences the larger environment\u2014 have been supportive to the concerns, issues and aspirations voiced by the MSM and transgender communities. We explored the evidence on HIV epidemic among MSM and assessment of country-level responses which included the role of community organisations and networks and the legal and policy struggles and reforms across the region. To distil varying dimensions of the HIV response, the evidence, analysis and assessment was classified under five themes. They were: G Scaling up Inclusive Programmatic Response G Strengthening Policy and Legal Reforms G Facilitating Greater Community Involvement G Building an Enabling Environment G Provisioning Public Education for General Population and Service Providers Engaging holistically From an advocacy perspective, different aspects of the issue were inter-dependent, with each aspect influencing and shaping the other. The challenge for advocates and pioneers lay in coalescing these 25 aspects into a seamless, unified position, adequately nuanced to highlight a comprehensive and rights- based approach to programming for MSM and transgender persons. In the face of structural and institutional barriers MSM and transgender people experience, efforts were made to negotiate with various aspects so that any disconnect or crossed wires between them did not turn adversarial. Key stakeholders, including regional and national networks, made a difference in this effort. The regional leaders responded eagerly, contributed to the ongoing international debates on sexual diversity and sexual minorities, spoke with a unified voice, learned when and how to compromise and established multiple processes to ensure effective functioning of the evolving regional network and its capacity to engage key stakeholders, be it the UN system, national governments or donors. The beginning As a prelude to the scaling up of MSM and transgender programmes, in South Asia and particularly in India, a national meeting was organised in 1994 by gay/MSM groups such as the Humsafar Trust and Naz Foundation International, where community and civil society organisations along with donors and governments\u2019 representatives \u201cbegan addressing many issues facing gay men including HIV among MSM.\u201d (APCOM, 2008).65 This paved the way for conceiving pan-regional consultations at Bangkok at the International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2004) and in Delhi, India in 2006, which brought together community organisations, networks, regional and international donors, technical experts, government representatives and UN partners. Together, this unique group of concerned individuals worked to evolve a consensus on key aspects of HIV among MSM and transgender people and plot strategic ways forward. This included setting guiding principles, reviewing current epidemiology, planning for resource mobilization, reviewing legal rights, identifying key strategic initiatives and policies and, last but not the least, setting the mandate for the formation of a community-led coalition, \u201cto generate region-wide coordinated advocacy for policy change, social justice, rights and an equitable allocation of public resources for HIV interventions, care, treatment and other services.\u201d (Risks and Responsibilities: Male sexual health and HIV in Asia and the Pacific, 2006 September).66 The quality of engagement with the issues was dependent on the ability of MSM civil society leaders, in partnership with experts, donors and UNAIDS and its partners,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ec82ad3-5f26-4392-8a80-f4ee0b519678": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ec82ad3-5f26-4392-8a80-f4ee0b519678", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c581cee13371eb0b64a428ceb273169d7158080d708be82558b133ffbc58175c"}, "3": {"node_id": "01a704a8-6214-4584-8ffd-7e99755977fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3ced5cf242be09d42fda41d935bab317e6ce72adbe488d643888c5c3145b816"}}, "hash": "dc15a13e15eff9b27f0dd2e1beedebce985fcb85cb43361621b2ef692c74bbd7", "text": "to negotiate standpoints and influence governments to spearhead changes in national AIDS plans by assuring \u201cinclusion of male to male sexuality in national and sub-national HIV frameworks of action.\u201d (Risks and Responsibilities: Male sexual health and HIV in Asia and the Pacific, 2006 September).67 Reconciling positions The literature review reveals two positions on the quality of advocacy - one can be referred to as maximalist and the other as more incremental and relative. This also corresponds with the assessment of the response at different levels. At one level, the assessment was about the extent to which basic HIV and AIDS and STI prevention services were being provided to different key populations (UNAIDS, 2007) and at another level, about the quality of response on non-HIV and AIDS / STI issues. This approach created a half-full and half-empty syndrome. While MSM civil society spokespersons, experts and donors acknowledged that there had been some increase in the basic HIV response across the region, they also stated unambiguously that the potential for a holistic and integrated response remained untapped. The maximalist view, therefore, was that despite increases in the responses, there continued to be steep increases in HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender persons (NACO, 2012; Nepal AIDS Control, 2012)69 because the response was inadequate and not as comprehensive or as scaled-up as was needed. (UNAIDS, 2007).70 There was recognition that the inclusion of MSM and MARPs in the region had advanced since 2000, and by 2008, it was decisive and had been assiduously achieved over a period of three to five years. (National Centre for AIDS and STD Control, 2012), (APCOM, 2008) (World Health Organisation, Regional Office for Literature Review A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 26 South East Asia, 2010).71 At every stage the envelope was being pushed. Having to engage with different stakeholders on various facets of the issue, the collaborations and alliances forged by the regional and national networks and community-based organisations did not discourage them from positioning concerns of MSM and transgender persons in a grounded and rooted manner (APCOM, 2009).72 Representatives of MSM and transgender persons who were at the centre of major processes, including consultations, high level dialogues, policy reviews and developing the scope and framework of research studies and programmes, were not only advocating with governments and donors for community centred and inclusive response but also applying reality checks in support of it. This helped to reconcile the two positions and enabled the community groups to both collaborate and contest simultaneously. Strengthening informed perspective on media If we seek to strengthen media engagement at the regional and country levels, it is essential to prepare backgrounders and issue briefs (in as many regional languages as possible) on the definition of MSM and transgender persons. This alone will enable us to leverage the media to go beyond the news peg of breaking \u2013 or today\u2019s news, ensure more in-depth coverage, recognise key developments and do sustained issue-centred advocacy. The brief must also explain why MSM in Asia are vulnerable and few identify themselves as MSM, indicating that there may be no real sense of community. More importantly, they are not willing to accept a gay identity, either. As regards sexual behaviour, many prefer to play the dominant gender roles, and have male to male sex covertly. \u201cFluid and situational male-male sex is believed to occur among one quarter to one half of men in certain populations (e.g. rickshaw pullers in Bangladesh and truck drivers in India).\u201d (Treat Asia, 2006).73 It is important to explain the diversity within the group as MSM is an umbrella term intended originally to be defined on the basis of behaviour rather than identity, which led, in the early phase, to including even transgender people, particularly trans women (male to female) to be identified as MSM. But since this was in conflict with their gender identity, the transgender persons soon asserted and formed separate groups and networks. Similarly, there is a need to explain what makes transgender people particularly vulnerable to HIV and social marginalisation. In the report, titled \u2018Lost in Transition: Transgender people, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in Asia and Pacific Region\u2019 (Sam Winter, UNDP, 2012) it is stated that Asia Pacific is \u201chome to a large number\u201d of transgender people; in fact, at least as many as 9.5 million.

The media briefs must also capture historically, thematically and institutionally the role played by different stakeholders: government (local, provincial and national), donors, the UN system, community- based and civil society organisations, global and regional Networks and others, to engineer the much- needed changes in the response to the Asian epidemic. While etching out the role of each stakeholder, effort must be made to trace the unity and diverse standpoints that have emerged on dimensions of the issue. This will enable the media to be nuanced, highlight incremental and long-term changes or transformative processes and not position the issue in a fragmented and a-historical manner without understanding the consensus building process that has taken place over the years. 27 As mentioned earlier, a key milestone was the 2008 release of the report of the Independent Commission on AIDS in Asia by UNAIDS by the then Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, who endorsed some of the overarching principles set out in the report, including the urgent need to safeguard the rights of most-at-risk populations. The report asserted that efforts to halt the Asia HIV epidemic must focus on high-risk behaviour occurring chiefly among the three sub-populations of female sex workers (including transgender women), persons who inject drugs (IDU) and men who have sex with men (including male sex workers). (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008, March 26).74 From a media perspective, the CAA Report must be presented as a policy document with the \u2018reverence\u2019 that is due to any effort that helps to legitimise priorities based on scientific evidence and rising above compromises and addresses with the urgency that the issue merits. With a newsmaker like the Indian Prime Minister releasing the report and the Commission head, the eminent economist Dr. C. Rangarajan, major national and state dailies in India reported on the event extensively, including The Hindustan Times, The Hindu, Asian Age, The Tribune, Deccan Herald and The State Times. The newspaper headlines reflected the gravity of the issue and an astute understanding of the issues: G Unsafe Sex Practices as Asia\u2019s Undoing; G Tolerance as key to winning battle against AIDS; G AIDS to push 6 m Asian households below poverty by 2015; G Sex between men leading to new HIV infections and HIV stigma; and G UN panel calls for legislation. Depending on what they saw as critical, newspapers excerpted segments of the report and raised the bar on the issue but the question worth asking is whether this report has been perceived as a valuable resource by the media? Or was the Report projected just as news of the day? For the Indian context, in a quantitative monitoring on the number of times the CAA Report has featured in subsequent reports from 2010 onwards, there was absolutely no mention in the 434 news reports monitored between 2010 and 2012. More importantly, in reports supported by UNDP and UNAIDS on the HIV response for men having sex with men and transgender persons in the region, alarming projections emphasising that the dynamics of transmission have changed and unprotected sex among men having sex with men likely contributes to 50% of new infections kept appearing. On the media such messages have to be taken up by leaders of the response to the epidemic, with the need to assert that the reports are \u2018warnings\u2019 or \u2018wake- up\u2019 calls that help to address the issue in a determined fashion. Therefore, much of the evidence, arguments, observations and recommendations made in such reports need to be brought back into the mass media domain and contextualised suitably against today\u2019s developments. Advocacy on the media has to be broadened to examine the possibility of intervening in more qualitative spaces including opinion pages and popular discussion columns. Emerging evidence The Commission on AIDS report was fashioned in an environment where the emerging evidence indicated an urgent need for focused prevention among key affected populations, and at a time when stakeholders from governments, donors, experts, civil society and community leaders were conscious of the neglect and low coverage of services for most-at-risk populations, such as MSM and transgender persons.

The AAC Report cited a survey done in 2006 revealing that targeted intervention programmes in 15 Asia Pacific countries \u201creached less than 8% of the estimated number of MSM.\u201d It was clear that the programmes were under-targeting most- in-need groups, which in many ways resulted in extremely low coverage. It was also pointing to the grim fact that national programmes were being implemented in a vertical and highly circumscribed manner without the necessary support and collaboration of related departments and, in some cases, even implemented in conflict with the advice of frontline departments such as Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Women. Even the basic response was not commensurate with the realities of the situation. Studies also referred to the fact that, \u201cone-third to two-thirds of MSM reported not using condoms during the last episode of anal sex with a male partner; unprotected sex with females was common, more so with regular female partners; use of water-based lubricants was not high.\u201d (World Health Organisation, Regional Office for South East Asia, 2010).77 Presenting evidence on mass media From a media engagement perspective, it is essential to keep in mind that during this phase we witnessed a lack of country readiness to responding to the epidemic despite having evidence to show that the situation was grave and could not be ignored or undermined. So, at one level, the evidence was stark about the high levels of risk the communities of MSM and transgender persons were facing because of poor provisioning of services; and from an advocacy perspective, it can be demonstrated, conceptually or hypothetically, how much lower the prevalence rate could have been had a full-fledged response been mounted. However, this can lead to sensationalising information and the media arguing for top-down solutions and assuming that ends justify means. The media needs to be educated about the means and the human rights framework that should govern such a response. It is essential to strike a balance between means and ends; between raising the bar on the issue and focusing on its urgency as well the considered response that is needed, as was recognised at the Risks and Responsibilities meeting in Delhi in 2006. Historic meeting on male sexual health and HIV in Asia and Pacific, 2006 Recognising the urgent need for advancing programmes that address HIV-related vulnerabilities of MSM in the region, the first-ever international consultation on male sexual health and HIV in Asia and the Pacific was organised in New Delhi, India, from September 23 to 26, 2006, under the title of \u201cRisks and Responsibilities\u201d. (Risks and Responsibilities: Male sexual health and HIV in Asia and the Pacific, 2006 September).78 The meeting organisers brought together 380 delegates from governments, policy-makers, donors, researchers, grassroots and community-based organisations from 22 countries across the Asia-Pacific region and eight countries from other regions. The main thrust of the conference was to create a tripartite dialogue between community, government and donors. The dialogue worked towards identifying needs and solutions, identifying appropriate policy interventions, and gaining government and international support for interventions so that \u201cservices in adequate quantity and of good quality reach those who need it most.\u201d To achieve this, working group sessions were held on each of the three days with deliberations following \u201cthe specific themes of each day, supported and informed by the expert presentations made at the beginning of the day\u201d in plenary. What was significant about the Working Group deliberations was that participants worked together and identified specific action points and needs. This ranged from seeking better data on MSM, rigorous epidemiology studies, analysis of risk behaviour, greater involvement of MSM and transgender persons in national surveillance systems, systemic recognition of and engagement with the related cultural, social, behavioural and response needs and the need for transgender people to have separate projects run by transgender-led community-based organisations with adequate funding.

Great emphasis was placed on the fact that \u201cintervention efforts should be community-led.\u201d Community, they stated, should be part of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of national programmes as well as needed pro-active efforts to de-criminalise same-sex sexual relations and enact anti-discrimination legislation. (Risks and Responsibilities: Male sexual health and HIV in Asia and the Pacific, 2006 September).80 The outcomes emerging from the Risk and Responsibility Consultation can be seen as a watershed, as the title suggests, to build a symbiotic relationship between risks faced by the individuals and communities of MSM and transgender people, and a framework of responsibility that gives equal ownership of the response to risks to communities, with governments and the others involved. This was reflected in adoption of the \u2018Delhi Declaration of Collaboration\u2019 and \u2018Guidelines for Good Practice\u2019, along with a call from consultation delegates to form a coalition of MSM organisations, CBOs and networks to carry forward the success of the tripartite dialogue between community, government and donors. (Risks and Responsibilities: Male sexual health and HIV in Asia and the Pacific, 2006 September).81 The Consultation established a consensus on the key strategies, partnerships and collaborations to mount a national and multi-stakeholder response with MSM and transgender persons assuming responsibility to lead risk reduction initiatives. The regional coalition was to become APCOM. In its 2008 report to the Global Forum on MSM and HIV, it stated that the major contribution of the Risks and Responsibilities consultation lay in the fact that it had \u201cbrought the attention of many governments to the issue of HIV epidemics among MSM and the need to address them directly... [and] resulted in positive changes in national AIDS plans and strategic planning to reduce the incidence of HIV and increase services for MSM.\u201d (APCOM, 2008).82 The level of consensus that emerged at this Consultation was strengthened by the policy paper contributed by UNAIDS in the lead up to the meeting. The paper acknowledged the support of MSM and transgender community members from across the region in shaping it. The policy paper contextualised that a community-informed HIV response among MSM and transgender people was, in fact, the \u201cmissing piece in national response to AIDS in Asia and Pacific.\u201d With male-to-male sex positioned as one of the growing drivers of the epidemic and with clear evidence showing that HIV prevalence among MSM was accelerating, it was clear to all stakeholders shaping the regional and national response that any denial of services for them will only add to the disease burden. It was in this context that the adverse effect of criminalising same-sex acts was also highlighted. \u201cIt will only act as a catalyst for unsafe practices\u201d was the warning sounded to 16 out of 20 countries in Asia \u2013Pacific in which male-to-male sex was still against the law. (UNAIDS, 2007).83 Apart from the UNAIDS background paper, data on other topics such as epidemiology of HIV infection and risk behaviours, human rights related to health and male-to-male sex, HIV programme spending (or lack thereof in the region), same sex male sexuality and HIV, prevention of best practices and a summary of the UN-led pre-consultation in-country meetings of MSM, donors and government officials were also provided to meeting delegates and the media. (UNAIDS, 2007).84 One of the significant concluding observations in the report was that the meeting helped everyone understand that all must maintain a careful focus on the \u201cgrowing body of evidence of HIV epidemic among MSM, and on the fact that high-risk behaviours, unwittingly engaged in by MSM unreached by HIV interventions will drive HIV epidemics in the world today.\u201d (APCOM, 2008).85 Media response An analysis of the coverage that emerged during the consultation in India revealed that it coincided with an Open Letter by a well-known literary figure, Vikram Seth, the Nobel Laureate Dr. Amartya Sen, leading intellectuals, opinion makers, journalists and social activists, addressed to the Government of India, Members of the Judiciary, and All Citizens against Section 377.

As the case progressed, media reported it consistently (discussed in the latter part of the report) till the judgement was delivered. Meanwhile, with the advocacy beginning to focus on the need for scaling up HIV prevention, care, support and treatment for MSM and transgender, the regional network, in partnership with all key stakeholders involved in HIV prevention and AIDS treatment in the Asia-Pacific region, used the ICAAP in Bali and later in Busan, to get the UN system, experts and civil society organisations to engage with the many issues that were essential. (APCOM, 2009).86 Lagging response Therefore, one central concern that kept growing and getting reiterated was the ever increasing vulnerability of the MSM community and transgender persons to HIV. The Global HIV Prevention Working Group that was convened by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that HIV prevention services reached only 9% of men who have sex with men. (Global HIV prevention working group, 2007). This was reinforced by the UNGASS 2008 country reports that showed that 71 per cent of countries did not report on the percentage of men having sex with men receiving services and in the rest of the countries that reported, it could be as low as 12%, as in Africa. (amfAR, 2008). Studies conducted by amfAR, USA, 2008 and data presented by the International HIV and AIDS Alliance at the International AIDS Conference at Mexico showed that HIV prevalence among MSM was much higher than the general population in many countries, and in the case of transgender the prevalence rate ranged from \u201c10 per cent to 42 per cent in five Asian countries.\u201d (International HIV/AIDS Alliance, 2008). Apart from contributing \u201csignificantly\u201d to the AIDS epidemic, the situation was further compounded by the fact that in many contexts there was evidence to show that men who have sex with men also have sex with women and both MSM and transgender people are also involved in sex work and/or inject drugs. (UNAIDS, 2009).87 As stated above, the defining point for the Asia Pacific region came with the two Reports of the Independent Commission on AIDS for Asia and Pacific. The report on Asia highlighted that the HIV epidemic among MSM ranged from \u201c13 to 32 per cent\u201d, including in countries like India. (UNAIDS, 2011).88 Based on a projection model, the Commission predicted that if HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender persons does not get addressed immediately \u201c50 per cent of new infections will be among these communities by 2020, outnumbering HIV infections caused by unsafe sex work and unsafe injecting drug use, if comprehensive targeted HIV prevention programmes for MSM are not scaled up.\u201d (Constella Futures, USAID, 2006 and Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008, March 26).90 UNAIDS action framework to better response and access to services Meanwhile, given the uncertainty in the level of access of the two communities to appropriate HIV services, the UNAIDS Action framework assumed great importance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

and inequity were thwarting the \u201cdesire to access health-related services \u2026 as well as to social benefits.\u201d (UNAIDS, 2009).91 The Action Framework document concluded that \u201cthere is

This included spelling out the role and responsibility of the UN system, extending technical support to the national programmes and community of MSM and transgender persons and their regional and country level Networks, identifying key issues, recognising that transgender people have specific concerns and needs and initiating the process of advocating for comprehensive programme framework to ensure optimal delivery of services for men having sex with men and transgender persons. (UNAIDS, 2009).96 Along with co-sponsors, UNAIDS was willing to support the national governments in setting norms and providing \u201cspecific policies and guidance for rights-based and evidence-informed programmes and services.\u201d They were willing to do system strengthening as well as augment the capabilities of governments and give the necessary technical support to improve \u201cepidemiological and behavioural surveillance, programme monitoring and evaluation, and related operational research on men who have sex with men and transgender people,\u201d as also strengthen partnerships to address the barriers, \u201cdevelop and implement a system for the UN to address emergency human rights situations\u201d faced by the community and strengthen the capacity of community and civil society groups and networks. (UNAIDS, 2009)97 Recommending comprehensive package of services Now the major challenge for the UN system was to go beyond advocating to building a consensus \u201cabout the basic components of a comprehensive package of programmes and services to prevent HIV transmission and to provide treatment, care and support for MSM and transgender people with HIV in the region.\u201d (UNDP, 2009)98 This initiative stemmed from a strong demand from all levels of leadership. The 100 participants representing all key sectors at a regional consultation organised in February 2009 by WHO (WPRO), UNDP, UNAIDS and the Hong Kong Health Department aiming to strengthen the health sector response to HIV among MSM and transgender people had expressed the \u201cneed for a widely endorsed, single, comprehensive regional reference package to better inform national responses\u201d; and recommended implementation of a \u2018highly active\u2019 programme, especially in countries with high HIV prevalence and incidence among MSM and transgender. (UNDP, 2009)99 Literature Review A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 32 Out of this Regional Consensus meeting emerged the framework - Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among men having sex with men and transgender. What stands out about the consensus building process was the manner in which the many complex aspects and various dynamics influenced the issue- from the needs, concerns and expectations of the community to the capability of key stakeholders to address the nitty-gritty when all stakeholders responsible for programming had to be ready to engage with major substantive and operational challenges. This stemmed from the need to scale-up the response and achieve a high level of inter \u2013 connectedness between different services and entitlements. And to do that effectively the meeting had to factor in diverse processes often located in different domains to ensure a broader readiness to sustain the continuum of services, from prevention to care, support and treatment for men having sex with men and transgender persons. The community-centred standpoint and rights-based perspective of the Consensus Statement was best reflected in the manner in which it reconciled the different dimensions of the issue, such as \u201cseeking to address restrictive legal and regulatory frameworks, and stigmatising and discriminatory social norms\u201d with the priorities of \u201cpromoting appropriate policy development, and the meaningful engagement and mobilization of affected communities.\u201d Since this meant exploring far broader approaches and \u201ca combination of interventions\u201d including mass media and internet to target the community of men having sex with men and transgender people and a \u201cmix of MSM and transgender people-specific and mainstream services that are MSM and transgender people- friendly, the issue of how these services and programmes are delivered became", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5680fe7a-69c9-49b5-8555-0afab7059c07": {"__data__": {"id_": "5680fe7a-69c9-49b5-8555-0afab7059c07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa9e7fa37b812b3125cf2bcce2ac174095f953b4aa85accd0cfeac187a1f028e"}, "3": {"node_id": "17a7d518-9e7b-4334-9bac-e5acfae33287", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f467416d24713ff5a88edbb40fcdd3bbee3fe00d4ea0c84da61ba578f4333138"}}, "hash": "135e410878da1a12d5b377c68b58a309730c15e42c551ee979009aa800710e4f", "text": "\u201cas important as the elements\u201d of the comprehensive package recommended.

(UNDP, 2009)101 Media response It is in this context, when the UN system along with member states were working on the action framework and developing a consensus on what constitutes a \u201ccomprehensive package\u201d for the programming, a sample of news reports from the four countries of Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India was monitored for the period 2010-2012 to identify how various dimensions of HIV issues were represented. It was found that HIV related issues and concerns figured very sparsely. The media reported more on legal and societal barriers faced by the community and focused on non-HIV aspects. Barriers Here, the barriers posed by \u201cbad laws\u201d began to assume singular importance. With HIV prevention, treatment and care programmes being constantly undermined by existing legislations and law enforcement related to key populations, including, amongst others, the criminalisation of same sex relations, it became imperative to address challenges that these brought in their wake. Hence, issues like \u2018safe environment\u2019 for men who have sex with men and transgender people, \u2018partnership with law enforcement authorities\u2019, \u2018legal assistance\u2019 and \u2018community involvement\u2019 became central to the response. (UNAIDS, 2011)102 Regional articulation of the human rights approach With critical pronouncements being made on global platforms about national strategies \u201cinadequately focusing\u201d on key populations and \u201cnoting with concern\u201d the continuing barriers faced by MSM and transgender persons in accessing services, there was a growing recognition, assertion and will to address the barriers posed by the existing legal and policy set ups to key populations across the Asia Pacific region. In the recent past, this regional articulation has contributed to the sub-regional and international processes in the strategic way forward based on new evidence and approaches. 33 This was reflected in the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Resolutions 66/10 (May 2010) \u201ccalling for action to achieve universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support in the region\u201d (ESCAP, 2010) and 67/9 (May 2011) urging a \u201cAsia Pacific regional review of the progress achieved in realising the Declaration of Commitment on HIV and AIDS and the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS.\u201d (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ESCAP, 2011) What is significant about this call to action, articulated in 66/10, was the stress it placed on abiding by the commitments to the Millennium Development Goal target, of \u201cuniversal access to treatment for HIV and AIDS for those who need it\u201d, to which all member states had agreed, and \u201cto ground universal access in human rights and undertake measures to address stigma and discrimination, as well as policy and legal barriers to effective HIV responses, in particular with regard to key affected populations.\u201d (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP, 2010). In fact, with the Resolution 66/10 having expressed grave concern about the continuing high prevalence of HIV among key affected populations, including men having sex with men and transgender population, as well as the \u201cextent of legal and policy barriers that impede progress in developing and implementing effective ways of responding to HIV,\u201d the 67/9 Resolution took this forward; calling upon members and associate members to review national laws, policies and practices to \u201cscale up high-impact HIV prevention, treatment, care and support to achieve 80% coverage for key affected populations with a view to achieving the universal access target.\u201d (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ESCAP, 2011).

This strategic process- of assessing the progress of the Asia Pacific nations in line with the ESCAP 66/10 Resolution-further strengthened national commitment towards addressing legal and policy barriers. It was represented by government delegations from over 35 countries in the region. These included Bangladesh, India, Maldives Nepal, and Pakistan. The note, presented by the Secretariat, firstly recognised that stigma and illegality attached to community behaviour actively prevents them from accessing government services on an equal basis. Secondly, it focused on legal protection of transgender people as a key strategy to develop a more inclusive framework that treated transgender persons as equal citizens. The framework should include the \u2018ability to vote, be identified in legal documents and the right to inherit.\u2019 It was also suggested that criminal laws prohibiting behaviours of key populations led to stigma and discrimination which hampered efforts to engage in prevention, treatment, care and support. Calling on the examples to amend legislation seen in the case of India, Fiji and Australia, it was emphasised that de-criminalising same sex behaviour, prohibiting discrimination and recognising same sex relationships are important ways to challenge the stigma and discrimination experienced by key populations in the community and in health settings.

They stressed the need to harmonize and align the policies in different sectors such as legal, health and social welfare by increasing multisectoral dialogue and cooperation among sectors, including justice, law enforcement, health and social protection as well by involving key populations in policy and programme development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 2012). A critical outcome of the inter-governmental review was the endorsement of the regional framework to support the implementation of the international and region specific commitments through numerous measures, including a review by the Commission; organising national multisectoral consultations on policy and legal barriers and undertaking participatory and inclusive national reviews of the implementation of the political declaration and ESCAP Resolutions. (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 2012)..103 The second critical outcome was defining the areas for regional cooperation, which included establishing regional accountability and governance mechanisms for inter-governmental reviews of country progress towards universal access; sharing good practices and strengthening multi-sectoral approaches to enhance universal access, develop partnerships at the local, national and regional level involving government, civil society, key populations, faith based organisations and the private sector. (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 2012)104 Developing informed evidence to engage with legal barriers To engage systematically with the many legal and social barriers, including the stigma and discrimination the MSM and transgender faced, meant understanding where the law and especially the \u201cenforcement policies and practices\u201d affected the quality of HIV responses among MSM and transgender people and assessing the role that key stakeholders could play in \u201cimproving the legal environment affecting MSM and transgender as populations.\u201d This led to a comprehensive compilation of legal environments, human rights and HIV rights among MSM and transgender people in the Asia Pacific region, which recommended the need to strengthen leadership, community empowerment and advocacy to improve the legal environment and address stigma. (UNDP, APCOM, 2010) It is significant that this study, conducted in 48 countries of the Asia-Pacific region, and informed by widespread \u201cconsultations with community representatives, legal experts, and UN agencies\u201d, stated in no uncertain terms that with less than 20% of MSM and transgender people having access to HIV prevention services in many countries of the region, the repressive legal environment contributes to their low level of access to services. This implied that with most of the HIV programmes for MSM and transgender people in the region operating in the early stages of implementation in a non-supportive legal environment it would result in a \u201crange of adverse consequences for HIV responses,\u201d including \u201cimpeding prevention activities\u201d, discouraging the MSM and transgender people from seeking services, \u201cinhibiting investments in programmes\u201d and \u201clegitimising discriminatory\u201d treatment by healthcare providers.

(UNDP, APCOM, 2010)105 Despite the recent advances in the improvement of the legal environment in India, Pakistan and Nepal, in every country the affected communities reported that the anti-sodomy laws were misused to harass them. In Bangladesh, as way back as 2003, a Human Rights Watch report found that the police actively interfered with outreach work among MSM, including confiscation of condoms. (UNDP, APCOM, 2010)106 In India, many social research studies conducted among MSM and transgender people from 2003 to 2008 across many cities and towns, revealed that both Section 377 and the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act were used to harass and arrest MSM, transgender and male sex workers. 35 A study conducted in 2006 in Chennai showed that of \u201c62 MSM outreach workers surveyed, 85 per cent reported having experienced varying levels of harassment from police, and 86% reported varying levels of harassment from others.\u201d (UNDP, APCOM, 2010). In another study conducted in 2007, 48% of 301 kothis surveyed in six Indian cities reported that they had been harassed by police because they have had sex with other males. (Bondyopadhyay, 2007). In Nepal although the legal and political environment has improved since 2007-2008 as a result of the Supreme Court decision, a study in 2010 showed a high level of police violence against Metis.

Media response Meanwhile, media reportage on legal barriers and challenges also increased. In countries like India and Nepal, with the constitutional and judicial route being used to overcome the legal barriers by challenging the law on the ground that it violates Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Indian Constitution, the media built a discourse around the legality of same sex relationship among consenting adults (UNDP, APCOM, 2009).110 What followed in terms of reportage was very much shaped by the confidence exuded by the wide spectrum of MSM and transgender advocates and organisations across different parts of the country. They organised Gay Pride Rallies, contested and challenged arbitrary acts of the police and administration, held high profile beauty pageants and reached out to and mobilised hidden community members. In India out of a total of 2,020 news reports from 2009-2012, 366 reports were celebratory and focusing on Gay Pride Marches, rainbow celebrations, beauty pageants and other milestones, including launching of books, art shows etc. When broken up, it worked out to 211 reports in 2009, 88 in 2010, 48 in 2011 and 19 in 2012. Once sensitised about the predicaments of MSM, the media became pro-active and committed in many parts of the country. Editors began to dedicate pages and columns in the weekend supplements for an in- depth exposition on this issue. In April 2008, The New Indian Express newspaper underwent a major, drastic and exceptionally modern layout and design makeover under its new Chief Editor Aditya Sinha. Soon after launching the life style supplement Indulge and the popular City Express supplement, it started a section called Sexuality on Saturdays in the supplement named \u201cZeitgeist\u201d, which had previously covered Gaming and Graphic Novels, Sexualities and other contemporary issues. Zeitgeist had a popular fortnightly column, \u2018The Venus Flytrap\u2019 by Sharanya Manivanna and other authors from the gay community like Anirudda Vasudevan and Sid Narain that drew huge popular response. In 2009, a total of 76 lead articles and about 150 smaller news reports on sexuality and gender were published. After almost 30 months, the Zeitgeist appeared for the last time on January 29, 2011 as the new editor, Prabhu Chawla, dropped the supplement (CFAR, 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e7772fd-d245-42d0-b12f-c4e44b509660": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e7772fd-d245-42d0-b12f-c4e44b509660", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1f7cc29d57e213c6bcd4157ae3cd1ae2b650c517cddf6f74e3e60f61d0e35cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "b88f9b1c-d3a7-45cf-ae31-5474488c1985", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6528c1380f621e8634b97dcd95955dc1fb59be2f9ad9a257404fa06e7ec5cc1c"}}, "hash": "5210a2721ec9ea50a83fd152b53c2e3135410f890962d74e1384845f39fbca51", "text": "Undoubtedly, the media built a supportive environment for the issue, but from the much-needed celebration of identity and normalising the sexual orientation; an equal attention has to be paid to the quality of services and entitlements being provided or not being provided or accessed.

These articles covered issues of gays in Nepal fighting for their rights, profile of Sunil Pant as the first gay MP voicing demand for LGBT in Nepal, LGBT contesting elections, Supreme Court ruling, Gay Tourism, Gay Weddings, Gay Pride marches and stigma and discrimination.

In India, of a total of 397 reports monitored (129 reports for 2010, 142 for 2011, 126 for 2012), 388 reports were on rights, legal barriers and the intolerance that communities are combating. In these, transgender persons and LGBT issues featured in 181 and 143 reports respectively, with MSM featuring merely in 14 reports. Of the 397 reports, only 35 reports spoke about HIV, of which 15 focused on HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender persons, 20 on prevention services and the risk by these populations and overlapping with these were about 20 reports on services. (CFAR, 2012) A sample of 76 media reports taken for Nepal for the period 2009-2011 spoke about the need to tackle the inclusion of the communities and their rights through reforming the law. Of these, 13 pertained to MSM, 24 to transgender and 39 to the LGBT community (CFAR, 2012). In fact speaking about this, Sunil Pant, Blue Diamond Society, was quoted in the media as stating that \u201cit was impossible to wage an effective battle against HIV and AIDS without also addressing official attitudes towards\u201d MSM, LGBT community and transgender persons.\u201d111 Hardly 16 reports dealt with HIV, of which 3 reported on HIV prevalence, 6 on prevention and risk faced by these groups and 12 on services. Again, in Sri Lanka out of 40 reports we monitored for 2010 to 2012 (17 in 2010, 19 in 2011, 4 in 2012), we find all 40 reports focused on the disabling environment the communities face, the lack of rights and stigma and discrimination they face. MSM and LGBT feature in 26 and 13 reports respectively while transgender persons get featured in just one report. Of the 40 reports, HIV issue figures in 11 reports with 3 focusing on prevalence, 5 on services and all 11 on prevention and the risk faced by MARPs community. (CFAR, 2012) In Bangladesh, we saw similar trends when we monitored 30 news reports for the three years 2010- 2012. Of this, 4 reports were on LGBT and 11 reports each on transgender and MSM. These 26 reports focused on the lack of supportive environment, legal barriers and the discrimination that MSM and transgender persons were facing. Only 7 of these reports covered HIV, of which 2 were largely on surveillance, 4 on services and 5 on prevention and the risks faced by the community (CFAR, 2012).

To strengthen evidence informed advocacy it would be 37 worthwhile to create issue centred backgrounders and fact sheets and use it as prime advocacy tools to sensitise and engage the media at every given opportunity. A sample of such country specific Backgrounders and Fact Sheets appears towards the end of this Report as an Annexure. Path breaking reports What followed the compilation of this highly qualitative report on legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific were three path-breaking reports that have laid the foundation for future media engagements. These engagements emphasise the need to remove and change all punitive and outmoded laws against sex workers, MSM and transgender people and injecting drug users. They also underline the significance of commissioning far more in-depth researches and the conduct of these in partnership with transgender people so as to assist better understanding of these communities. Their inclusion is vital to evolve community centred HIV responses for each of these groups and ensure meaningful risk reduction. To strengthen media engagement with these issues, some key pointers that emerged are best reflected in the press release on the launch of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law: \u2018Risks, Rights and Health\u2019.112 Referred to it as a \u201cLandmark\u201d report, shaped by a high -powered Commission comprising of former heads of state and leading legal, human rights and HIV experts, what made it unique was that these leaders in turn did extensive research and interacted with more than 1,000 people in 140 countries to evidence the review process in a truly meaningful way. The Commission\u2019s major contribution was seen as stimulating the review processes (as mandated by ESCAP resolutions) by member-states not only to make laws sensitive and aligned to human rights framework but also recognise that the existing \u201claws and practice rooted in sound public health evidence and human rights must be used to better HIV response\u201d are brought to scale and replicated. For the first time, we have seen a public health and development issue such as HIV being advanced so decisively and governments being told that they have a responsibility to repeal outmoded laws that \u201cstem from ignorance and intolerance\u201d in favour of laws that prohibit discrimination and violence and protect at- risk populations-referred to as powerful, low-cost tools to ensure that HIV investments were not wasted. Similarly, the Report on Sex Work and the Law examines 48 countries in Asia and the Pacific to \u201cassess laws, legal policies and law enforcement practices that affect the human rights of sex workers and impact effectiveness of HIV responses.\u201d (UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre and UNFPA Asia Pacific Regional Office, 2012) The Report goes on to state that where sex work has been \u201cde-criminalised, there is a greater chance for safer sex practices\u201d and, therefore, suggests that \u201ca radically different approach is necessary to control disease and make lives better for sex workers, including dropping the words \u2018prostitute\u2019 and \u2018prostitution\u2019 from the lexicon because they stigmatize those involved in the business.\u201d The report went on to classify Thailand and New Zealand as best places for sex workers of Asia to be in whereas the \u201cmere possession of a condom\u201d in places like China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam were being used as evidence to denote that the \u201cperson is an illegal sex worker.\u201d113 Again, in the case of transgender persons, the research study Lost in Transition: Transgender people, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia Pacific Region, jointly released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Asia Pacific Transgender Network (APTN), showed that \u201ctransgender persons are among the most socially ostracised in this region and lack fundamental rights, including basic access to health care and social protection schemes. Hence, they recommended the need for concerted action by governments, civil society, development partners and the transgender community itself to design and conduct further research to fill the lack of information about transgender people and their environments. (Sam Winter, UNDP, 2012)114 Literature Review A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 38 Future response From the media engagement perspective, all the three reports are extremely important and can prove to be game changers if all the evidence and arguments presented are taken to the journalists and they are sensitised about their implications and significance for developing an effective response to HIV among MSM community and transgender persons.

Evolving issue briefs and actionable plans The Global Commission on HIV and Law115 based on representation from 140 countries recommended to governments, civil society and international bodies to de-criminalise private and consensual adult sexual behaviour including same sex acts. It called for the repeal of laws that criminalize consensual sex between adults of the same sex; removal of legal, regulatory and administrative barriers to the formation of community organisations by or for gay men, lesbians and or bisexual people, respect for existing civil and religious laws and guarantees relating to privacy; amending of anti-discrimination laws expressly to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation as well and promote effective measures to prevent violence against MSM. The regional consultation organised by the Global Commission on HIV and Law in Bangkok in 2011 to input into the Global Report process, bought together communities, NGOs, policy-makers, legislators, judges and law enforcement officials from the region and provided an unique opportunity to discuss the legal environment, articulate existing evidence, gaps, concerns and generate new evidence on the rights and law in the context of HIV. Importantly, the regional consultation sought to identify \u2018clear and actionable recommendations with a concrete plan for follow up\u2019. (Global Commission on HIV and the Law, 2011) The dialogue was premised on the experiences including those with police, public security officials and other authorities who use a range of laws as a basis to harass, arrest and detain members of the key population. Legislations, regulations, ordinances and other instruments across a wide range of legal areas, such as criminal, zoning, employment, public health laws needed to be considered. Thirdly, an alignment of health and legal responses was required at the national and regional levels. (Global Commission on HIV and the Law, 2011) A crucial discussion at the consultation was the necessity of access to legal services, including legal aid and education about legal rights as a key element of an enabling environment for HIV responses. Reflecting on the paucity of legal and advocacy services to enhance access to the justice system, participants stated that laws had limited impact if confidential, timely and affordable redress were not accessible116. It was emphasised that quality legal services would ensure better legal outcomes and generate evidence needed for law and policy reform. The regional dialogue discussed the impact of culture and religion on legal frameworks, including the use of religious and morality arguments against sexual minority groups. Participants submitted that cultural resistance to human rights concepts and approaches hindered public health reforms.117 Articulating the way ahead, the Commissioner of the Global Commission, Jon Ungphakorn, stated that evidence was a key strategy to show that stigma and discrimination suffered by communities impact society as a whole. Evidence needed to be presented by the Commission to governments to indicate that addressing stigma and discrimination was a \u2018practical issue\u2019118. The Bangkok regional consultation put forward seven lessons including - the need for evidence informed responses; law could be a hindrance and a help to successful HIV responses; the HIV paradox of the need and utility for a rights-based approach and the continued objections by government and community resulting in resistance by law makers. In the context of the media, a key lesson was the need to keep up the tempo. It was observed that media interest in HIV and human rights had reduced and pressure was required to drive home the urgency that millions of lives were at stake. (Kirby, UNDP Law Commission and HIV: Seven Lessons from Bangkok, 2011). 39 At the South Asia level we have seen the emergence of a strong recognition that a public health response lies in the protection of rights of PLHIV and key populations at higher risk. At a dialogue organised for the South Asia region, key recommendations emerging on the responses to the legal and policy barriers faced by sexual minorities were: \ufffd De-criminalise conduct linked to People Who Use Drugs (PWUD), sex workers, MSM and transgender persons through legislative processes or judicial interventions. \ufffd Work simultaneously on short-term initiatives to address and mitigate the impact of relevant criminal laws. \ufffd Sensitise and disseminate information on the rights and issues of key populations at higher risk to law and justice sector stakeholders and healthcare providers. \ufffd Empower PLHIV and key populations at higher risk with knowledge about their rights under the law and the mechanisms that they may utilise to access and defend these rights. \ufffd Empower human rights institutions", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37641693-a54f-45cf-b0a2-c0c4659ccb91": {"__data__": {"id_": "37641693-a54f-45cf-b0a2-c0c4659ccb91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ef2e6e4edca8846636f2692adf8b079898df55dfded96f5603fca4932a6bda1"}}, "hash": "8ef2e6e4edca8846636f2692adf8b079898df55dfded96f5603fca4932a6bda1", "text": "with the necessary and appropriate statutory powers to enable them to address and respond to diverse legal and ethical dimensions to human rights. \ufffd Advocate for constitutional challenges and public interest litigation, recognising the role of judicial leadership. \ufffd Sensitise the media about the objectives of a legal enabling environment, and the rights of key populations at higher risk and PLHIV. \ufffd Advocate for healthcare providers and law and justice sector authorities to commit to a public health approach.

The Global Commission on HIV and the Law \u2018Risks, Rights & Health\u2019, the \u2018Legal Environments, Human Rights and HIV Responses among MSM and Transgender People in Asia and the Pacific: An Agenda for Action\u2019, \u2018Sex Work and the Law in Asia and the Pacific\u2019 and the research study, \u2018Lost in Transition: Transgender people, Rights and Vulnerability to HIV\u2019 lay down a foundation for future media engagement based on changing outdated laws and recognising sexual minorities. 2. Further, the Global Commission on HIV and Law called for the repeal of laws that criminalise consensual sex between adults of the same sex; remove legal, regulatory and administrative barriers to the formation of community organisations, amend anti- discrimination laws; promote effective measures to prevent violence against men who have sex with men, etc. 3. At the South Asia level, there was an emergence of a strong recognition that a public health response lies in the protection of rights of PLHIV and key populations at higher risks. At a dialogue organised for the South Asia region, key recommendations emerging on the responses to the legal and policy barriers faced by sexual minorities, included de-criminalisation, the need to address and mitigate the impact of relevant criminal laws, sensitising and disseminating information on the rights and issues of key populations, advocating for constitutional challenges and public interest litigation, the role of judicial leadersing and sensitise the media, etc. Country responses to human rights obligations At the country level, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and to some extent, Pakistan had made strides in attempting to reconcile its human rights obligations and commitments under international protocols at the level of policy by the government and in judicial interventions and pronouncements. Reporting under International Protocol, Declarations In the last few years, South Asian countries have begun to report on the status of sexual minorities and transgender people as part of the international Literature Review A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 40 reporting obligations under various protocols such as the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and CEDAW. This has also provided the opportunity for community leaders and civil society to call for greater accountability towards the rights of sexual minorities. In India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh community leaders have used the reporting mechanism of the Periodic Review, CEDAW and Rapporteur reporting processes for health and human rights and violence to highlight the rights violations of the marginalised communities and call for renewed commitments to amend or repeal discriminatory laws. India\u2019s UPR, submitted in 2012 by the Ministry of External Affairs, stated that homosexual intercourse treated as a criminal offence under the Indian Penal Code was struck down by the Delhi High Court (Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, 2012). However, the joint stakeholder report submitted as part of the alternate process stated that even as the judgment was under appeal in the Supreme Court, discrimination continued against the LGBT community. The stakeholders further reiterated that the state had abdicated its role to defend the judgment, relegating the defence of human rights of LGBT to civil society (Working group on human rights in India and the UN (WGHR), 2011). The UN Human Rights Council welcomed the decision to support the de-criminalisation of homosexuality. However, it observed that the government had not done enough to ensure the protection of LGBT people (UN Human Rights Council, 2012). Nepal\u2019s UPR submission does not mention any measures taken to protect and promote the rights of sexual minorities (Government of Nepal, 2010). However, the civil society representation observed that discrimination against sexual and gender minorities continued including denial of citizenship, marriage, non-recognition of identity and refusal to allow access to socio-cultural affairs. They also called attention to the non- implementation of the Supreme Court directive for a task force to study problems and enact appropriate legislation in the context of rights of sexual and gender minorities.

Bangladesh\u2019s civil society report raised the concerns of LGBT during the fourth round of Bangladesh UPR in February 2012. Sexual Rights Initiatives (SRI) presented a report on the socio-political rights of sexual and gender minorities, including gays, lesbians, hijras, kothis and intersex people in Bangladesh. (Sexual Rights Initiative, 2009). It was the first time that the issue of sexual and gender minorities in Bangladesh was presented at an international forum. The Bangladesh Foreign Minister denied the existence of homosexuality in his country. The GOB rejected recommendations in the SRI report to de-criminalise consensual same sex activity by repealing Section 377. Amongst the recommendations made at the UPR review process was to call on Bangladesh to de- criminalise same sex activity between consenting adults and adopt further measures to promote tolerance in this regard (Czech Republic) (Citizen\u2019s Initiatives on CEDAW - Bangladesh, 2010)121. In Bangladesh, the combined sixth and seventh UN CEDAW Alternative Report submitted by the Citizen\u2019s Initiative comprising of 38 women\u2019s and human rights organisations stressed on the absence of a consistent position by the government and stated that it indicated a \u201clack of co-ordination, if not outright contradiction, among different Ministries. For, on the one hand, the Foreign Ministry does not acknowledge the existence of same-sex practices, let alone homosexuality, while on the other, the Health Ministry continues to undertake programmes to provide support for HIV awareness among the MSM community\u201d.122 The report highlighted that sexually marginalised populations were being persecuted by the police under Section 54 which allows for arrest without warrant in case of suspicious behaviour. Additionally, HIV and AIDS programmes had been threatened or 41 closed due to threats of law enforcement authorities. It was observed that sexual and gender minorities had minimal access to medical services due to social stigma and discrimination by the medical service providers. Combined with the loss of traditional forms of livelihood, hijras had been forced into sex work for survival and were routinely subjected to rape and police intimidation. Reporting processes of the Human Rights Watch have been used to depose on rights violations by state authorities and law enforcement agencies. Community representatives (in Nepal) have actively participated in drafting the Yogyakarta Principles, ensuring the drafting of the UN resolution on SOGI. (India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) (Working group on human rights in India and the UN (WGHR), 2011), (Human Rights Watch, 2002), (National Alliance of Women, 2006) (Nepal NGO Coalition, 2010) At the Asia Pacific level, processes initiated to assess Progress Against Commitments in the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS and Millennium Development Goals, in February 2012, have emerged as a key forum to enunciate country specific policy and legal barriers and government commitments in addressing those barriers. India\u2019s statement emphasised the multisectoral response to ensure that ministries, civil society, corporate sector and development partners \u2018were sensitive and responsible for implementing and integrating HIV and AIDS in their charter\u2019. The policy initiatives in place included the national policy on HIV and AIDS and world of work ensuring no discriminative work place policy and linkages to services; operational guidelines for tribal action plan, operational plan on mainstreaming HIV and AIDS and on women empowerment to address the vulnerability of women and GIPA. While the statement refers to these policies being drafted to implement HRG friendly initiatives and social protection schemes, no mention has been made about the inclusion of specific communities such as sexual minorities or the barriers to access. (UNESCAP, 2012) Nepal\u2019s submission focused on the formation of a multisectoral sub - committee to improve the collaboration between different government and private sectors and mainstream HIV into sectoral plans and recognised that government intervention and budgetary allocations were essential to ensuring implementation.

(Naz Foundation and Others Versus Government of NCT Delhi, 2009) In Nepal, in 2012 the Supreme Court of Nepal recognised a live-in relationship between two lesbians. The court allowed a woman X to live with her lover Y as she wished, rather than with her husband.123 In 2007, the Supreme Court directed the Government Literature Review A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 42 to end discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Action is yet to be taken to introduce legal protection from discrimination. The Supreme Court directives require the government to end the system of preventing transgender people from obtaining basic citizenship rights. Key recommendations include enacting new laws and amending existing discriminatory laws so that people with different SOGI can exercise equal rights; formation of a seven member committee to study same-sex partnership laws in other countries and provide recommendations; prevent penalization of individuals who cross-dress; ensure equal rights, identity and expression for transgender people regardless of their sex at birth. (Sunil Babu Pant and other Versus Nepal Government and others, 2008) In 2008, the Bangladesh Courts ruled that transgender people are full-fledged citizens and have the right to vote. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2009 recognised transgender people as citizens of Pakistan and held that they were entitled to equal protection of rights, including the right to life and dignity. The Government of Pakistan was directed to give preference to transgender people in civil service positions. (Dr. Mohammad Aslam Khaki and another Versus Senior Superintendent of Police (Operation) Rawalpinidi and others, 2009). The Supreme Court has been regularly monitoring progress of implementation of the Order. On November 14, 2011, the Supreme Court directed hijras to be enrolled in the voters list and directed the Election Commission to \u201ccollect the details of eunuchs from the social welfare departments of the provinces where they are registered and take steps to register them as voters\u201d. (Dawn Daily News, 2011). In 2011 province governments were directed to create job opportunities. (Daily News, Tribune, 2011) State policies and programmes for inclusion of sexual minorities and transgender people Governments of India, Nepal and Bangladesh have made efforts to be more inclusive of transgender persons through measures, such as- including a separate identity in passports (India, Bangladesh, Nepal); identities for transgender persons (India, Nepal, Bangladesh); inclusion as a separate category in the census (India, Nepal). In 2011 Nepal completed its first national census which officially includes a third gender option opening the way for stronger recognition of sexual and gender minority rights in the provision of public services.124 In May 2011, the passport office of Bangladesh became the first government body to formally recognise the third gender. Applicants were allowed to choose either \u2018male\u2019, \u2018female\u2019 or \u2018other\u2019 on their passport application forms. However, the government stated that no specific package was planned for the community.125 The Parliamentary standing committee on the Social Welfare Ministry called on the Ministry to rehabilitate trans-sexual persons and ensure their basic rights. The committee also sought efforts to address the fear and stigma against the community.126 Provinces like Chittagong have announced identification instruments such as birth certificates and health cards for transgender people. The Government of Bangladesh has announced a special budgetary allocation for marginalised communities in the 2012 budget.127 The Approach Paper to the 12th Five-Year Plan of India developed by the Planning Commission of the Government of India makes inclusion of minorities and other", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04616635-c635-4de4-9944-c86fecf09fce": {"__data__": {"id_": "04616635-c635-4de4-9944-c86fecf09fce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "548d25db3e1478cf4cbe74abe9bb13b478fa12303f61a45e275e3d624e27c6f6"}}, "hash": "548d25db3e1478cf4cbe74abe9bb13b478fa12303f61a45e275e3d624e27c6f6", "text": "excluded groups as a cornerstone of its objective and calls for special programmes to bring them into the mainstream. (Planning Commission of India, Government of India, 2011). In formulating a more inclusive approach to health, the paper calls for a more focused approach based on the special requirements of different groups including those who belong to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, (Planning Commission of India, Government of India, 2011).128 It further calls for special attention to be paid to the needs of key populations at higher risks such as men having sex with men, (Planning Commission of India, Government of India, 2011).129 The chapter on Social and Regional equity recommended a Plan for the backward regions which addresses communities that suffer discrimination because of their social and cultural identities, such as LGBT groups and sex workers. The transgender identity is recognised in passports (Ministry of External Affairs), voter ID cards (issued 43 by the Election Commission of India) and the Unique ID Card of the Government of India. In the state of Tamil Nadu, the government established a Transgender Welfare Board in April 2008, the first of its kind in India. The board was mainly formed to address a variety of concerns of the transgender people that includes education, income generation and other social security measures. The board has conducted the enumeration of transgender populations in all 32 districts of Tamil Nadu and in some places identity cards- with the gender identity mentioned as \u2018Aravani\u2019- are being issued. The government has issued ration cards (for buying food and other items from government-run fair price shops) for transgender people. The state government issued a government order in May 2008 to enroll transgender people in government educational institutions and to explicitly include \u2018other\u2019 or \u2018third gender\u2019 category in the admission forms. In collaboration with the Tamil Nadu Aravanigal Welfare Board, free sex reassignment surgery is performed for hijras/transgender people in select government hospitals (Social Welfare Board, Government of Tamil Nadu, 2006). In September 2012, the State Government of Tamil Nadu took a further step to extend pension benefits for transgender people (The Hindu, 2012). In the state of Karnataka, the Backward Classes Commission recommended to the State Government to include sexual minorities into the backward classes list to enable them to access social schemes and benefits. This is under review by the state government. (Karnataka State Backward Commission, 2011). (Deccan Herald, 2010). Media Response Media reporting on the legal and policy barriers faced by the gay and transgender community has been varied across the South Asian countries. In India, the media articulated a strong rights position during the run up to and after the Sec. 377 judgement through reports, features and editorials. A similar trend was seen in the Nepali media. In Bangladesh, the media reported on the policy measures. The media has played a crucial role in strengthening acceptance of gay issues in India. It has helped to build a supportive environment around the petition filed by Naz India from 2008 (5353 news reports on the gay community). In 2009, around the period of the judgement, 900 English news clips were tracked which focused on the judgement. The month following the Delhi High Court judgement saw a spate of news coverage with 600 news reports quoting the government, community members, lawyers, experts, medical professionals (Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR), 2012). Media played a crucial role at many levels. It questioned the government\u2019s inability to take a clear stand on the issue (The Hindu, 2009) (Indian Express, 2009). In 2008, while tracking the progress of the court proceedings (over 150 news reports) these headlines were a hard-hitting indictment of the government\u2019s lack of commitment and vision. The Free Press Journal stated that \u201cthe Centre has failed to sort out the differences between the Home and Health Ministries over de-criminalisation of homosexuality...\u201d.130 It consistently highlighted the court\u2019s intervention in seeking the government to make its stand known.131, 132 Through 2008 and 2009, the media kept continuously tracking court proceedings (50% of articles tracked); commenting on submissions made by the government and other petitioners, tracking the division within the government, highlighting concerns of the gay community using forums like the gay pride parade (CFAR, 2012). Following the judgement, senior journalists came out publicly to endorse the view that the law was excessive in its attempt to regulate private lives. Legal experts134 were quoted extensively supporting the progressive spirit of the judgement. One author commented that the judgment has paved the way for constitutional protections for the \u201cpersonal autonomy of vulnerable minorities\u201d.135 The media has written about the need to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e15d381c-8875-4c0c-9b9b-05a2f0d2d083": {"__data__": {"id_": "e15d381c-8875-4c0c-9b9b-05a2f0d2d083", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21bf3fc400e0ff87d5b3b0d6d059625b7374dc2bbc8e3f331ec56cc96be74ee4"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d59fdf9-951f-47a9-ab00-63ffb59faa3e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4100ce018473a72b75a3722666112b2528659b040d84a20afe95001c7d3cc8c1"}}, "hash": "6f9ba34af6d29ce13b58ee902f815e2744e776f6b60814b9a43e3622e2eda9c7", "text": "ensure adequate policy initiatives for entitlements and social inclusion of the MSM and transgender people.

Literature Review A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 44 Acknowledgements We extend our deepest gratitude towards Bandhu Social Welfare Society (BSWS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh for the sincere support they gave us through our country visit. Without them being there for us, we would not have achieved what we have in the limited and tumultuous times we visited the country for first hand interactions with stakeholders. Shale Ahmed and his team at BSWS extended every needed support to us in facilitating the in-country interactions, with Premangshu Sarkar and Rahmat Ullah personally coordinating our meetings at each stage. The detailed interactions with senior members Shale Ahmed, Umme Farhana Zakia Kanta, Foisul Ahsan, Royal and Beraj provided us with programme and community insights on the issues. Among the other community leaders, Bobby Hijra and Zoya Sikdar were kind to share their experiences, with the former also facilitating for us a group discussion with transgender persons at Sustho Jeebon. Media fellows Hassan Bipul of BDNews24 and Moni Mahmood of Bhorer Kagoj spared considerable amounts of time with us, and also led us to others in media including to Angur Nahar Monty, Saiful Islam and Shafiq Rehman. KSM Tariq of FHI360, while sharing his insights on issues of the sexual and gender minorities in the country, provided useful detailed information on the HIV prevention project, Madumita. While our efforts to interact personally with many, including those at UNAIDS, MJF, BLAST and others could not materialize due to large scale political protests taking place in Dhaka and the resultant disruptions, we are hugely indebted to Sara Hossain to have found time to interact with us online during her travel in USA. She shared some poignant insights on several key facets of the issue with us. PART III \u2013 COUNTRY CASE STUDY 1 BANGLADESH Strategising Spaces for Issues of MSM: The Evolving Hijra Discourse in Bangladesh Executive Summary Introduction The context of Bangladesh is one where shifts in state and civil society responses towards the basic entitlements and rights of the transgender (hijra) communities have become increasingly visible, particularly in the last few years, as policy makers begin to accept that talking about the hijra issue is no longer taboo. The increasing government recognition of the hijra community is seen to have enabled a \u2018largely positive print media orientation in the past 4-5 years\u2019. Reflecting on what may have crystallised the shift, Shale Ahmed of BSWS recounts that they \u201cfaced strong resistance and harassment for carrying out activities like distributing condoms... (as part of HIV and SRH work that the group began in 1997), ...we realised we had to engage actively with every key section at local and higher levels.\u201d Sustaining a continued focus on HIV prevention, the community-led initiatives ensured significant gains for transgender people (hijras), and there was much needed recognition for MSM in the country, including identification by the NASP of \u2018sexual minority\u2019 (MSM) as a key population at higher risk in the country and therefore the need for interventions specifically targeted at them. Pioneering Community Participation and Leadership to Advocate on Issues of Sexual Minority: Building an Enabling Environment Most publically visible community organisations, leaders and spokespersons in Bangladesh have a direct connection to BSWS, which consciously adopted a rights-based approach and a public health perspective in its HIV and SRH interventions, more notably from 2006. The \u2018sexual health rights framework\u2019 supported 45 by BSWS is particularly useful in addressing specific issues of the MSM populations given the \u2018critical nature of the issue\u2019 in challenging socio-legal and religious settings. Engagement with media at local levels on issues of transgender people is a notable feature of the focus on multi-sector stakeholders such as lawyers, journalists and civic authorities.

Beyond civic body representatives, lead media outlets and the police, they have gone on to engage with elected members of parliament, the Law Commission and National Human Rights Commission in 2012. Galvanising Societal Leaders It is also noteworthy how the media has helped position a range of key public figures as spokespersons or with crucial messaging on concerns and issues raised by sexual and gender minoritiy communities. Evocative events with a strong human interest element took place in the first decade of operation and intensified discussion around the issues, in the public domain. Importantly, the community responded by looking to utilise this openness and to harness meaningful institutional support and endorsements. High-level state and civil society engagements at the national level, including with national commissions, ministries of health and social welfare, members of Parliament, top police and civic bodies in Dhaka and other cities, took place in this period. Unravelling Media Engagement through Strengthening Community Spokespersons and Media Participation From 2008 we find that sexual minority organisations like Bandhu Social Welfare Society (BSWS) saw engagement with the media as an effective and key strategy. Partnering with the media to build an enabling environment for ensuring services to excluded and stigmatised communities assumed diverse forms, and ensured in the process that different mediums, vehicles and community voices were used in messaging. Events were used to establish linkages with related issues such as human rights, men\u2019s role and male sexual health and to enable BSWS to facilitate an exchange between different stakeholders, often persuading media to sponsor the events. In one such scenario, the media both reported on the event and held the first Roundtable on \u2018HIV and AIDS and our Responsibility\u2019 in November 2008. More of such events formalised/followed later. Ongoing interaction between media, community and programme leaders provided building blocks for future consolidation efforts such as the Media Fellowship Programme in 2011. During this time, qualitative attempts were begun by the media to explore the issues from social, legal and epidemiological perspectives. There was a visible gradual intensification in the presence of transgender issues in the public domain beginning in 2010. A structured initiative like the Media Fellowship on issues of sexual minorities initiated in 2011 opened a \u2018floodgate\u2019, as \u2018fellows\u2019 became a good peer force within media. Significantly, a community-led alternate media initiative begun in 2004 has continued being regularly published. Spandon is a quarterly newsletter on male sexual and reproductive health that is circulated by and for the community. Deconstructing Content A monitoring exercise undertaken as part of this assignment filtered out a sample of forty (40) reports on issues of sexual and gender minorities and HIV for Strategising Spaces for Issues of MSM: The Evolving Hijra Discourse in Bangladesh A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 46 detailed review. Of these, 12 reports were generated by the Media Fellows. The reporting pegs (key theme to weave a story /news report around) and messaging by media had served to strengthen the evidence- informed and community-centred advocacy of BSWS, thus leveraging the power of mainstream media. Taking a strategic focus on media forward, BSWS found it opportune to use the media more closely to mediate discourse in the public domain. As part of a grant, it produces and airs a 24-minute weekly talk show \u2018Orao Amader\u2019 (\u2018They too are ours!\u2019) on national television to discuss issues of the transgender community. What Worked? Thematically, the stigma and discrimination against sexual minorities is a persistent concern which was very strongly written about and depicted in many mediums, including a highly evocative and hard-hitting film \u2018Ghetoputra Kamala\u2019. The representation by media spokespersons was decisively in favour of the community, their organisations, and individuals aligned with them. It ensured that Media Fellows from leading publications used the framework of human rights and the approach of social inclusion to shape reports and locate within it the paradigm of risk and vulnerability to HIV.

What emerges from an analysis of the media reports is the showcasing of effective interventions and innovative programmes when it came to sensitive initiatives such as sex education. In fact, media justified the intervention on the grounds that it will strengthen HIV prevention among heterosexuals as well as MSM and transgender people. The battle against stigma and discrimination is linked strongly to strengthening the community\u2019s access to services, including information. Therefore, support from media to strengthen community outreach services to MSM and transgender persons is critical. A section of the media voiced strong views on not only the legal barriers that exist but on the kind of risks and vulnerabilities the communities of MSM and transgender persons endure. This, coupled with the media reports of horrific incidents of stigma and discrimination the hijra communities faced, showed in no uncertain terms their plight, and in many ways, led to the government introducing new schemes, and to state publicly that continued marginalisation of these communities is not the answer. Consolidation and Scaling up of Media Engagement It is vital to recognise the momentum that has been generated on multiple levels. Programmatic, civil society and state responses have converged increasingly, both to recognise the scale and nuances of discrimination the gender and sexual minorities are living with, as well as the critical need to strengthen comprehensive responses that are genuinely inclusive of the realities, needs and dilemmas of these at-risk communities. In a fitting recognition of this shift, and the way media\u2019s response has resulted in breaking the silence on the issue, BSWS envisages a clearly laid out role for media in its Strategy Plan for 2012-16. In harnessing media as an engaged stakeholder, it will continue to brace itself to face barriers and challenges to ensuring meaningful interface between media, community and the key mediating stakeholders. A Mutually Mediated Multilevel Domain Engagement with Media The shift from the earlier district and event-centred approach to a more qualitative approach of conferring 47 fellowships to a few journalists stemmed from the need to change the \u201csocial landscape surrounding MSM and sexual minorities; building favourable public opinion; supporting legal reforms; and strengthening policy advocacy efforts\u201d (excerpted from the Note on Media Fellowship programme, BSWS). From this perspective, it is clear that a concerted beginning was made. On major thematic areas, the reports by Media Fellows were framed keeping the country-specific evidence and the ground level experience of the community in mind. Way Forward Empowering advocates in media As \u201conly 21 of the planned 27 fellowship stories could finally appear on media\u201d, the focus of community and programme leaders now is more on \u2018one-to-one engagements\u2019 with senior media professionals, including editors. While insiders also agree that \u2018person to person advocacy\u2019 may work best with gate keepers, what the community and programme leaders need to ensure is that setting of agendas on the issue does not get left to the media alone. The fact that BSWS is \u201cplanning to organise a policy level conclave with lead media editors\u201d in the near future testifies that the community recognises the need to evolve a multi-layered engagement mechanism for the media. Of as much significance, however, will be the need to work out a framework for seamless exchanges between these layers within media so that management, readership and editorial dynamics get meaningfully engaged with by issue needs, and the fast-changing institutional dynamics of mass media does not impede the momentums gained. Expanding issue visibility in the public domain In a shift of focus this year, the next batch of media fellows is from the electronic sector. As Bobby Hijra of Sustho Jeeban states, \u201ccompared to print, the electronic media is still resistant to our issues,\u201d it points to deeper questions of entrenched trends and mind-sets that continue to exist, and the very nature of the medium, as it tends to exploit- often unethically-the over-simplified fact that \u201cseeing is believing\u201d or everything that is visually depicted is the ultimate truth. If we are to successfully engage in partnership with the electronic media as a whole, this medium will need to be approached strategically in a variety of ways including working out agreement upon norms of consent and the rules of engagement. Intensifying community-led dissemination and engagement Clearly, programmatic and community efforts to make the issue more omnipresent in the public and alternate domains must be continued so as to break", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09cd64fd-b6a0-4854-8911-fec4353cfdab": {"__data__": {"id_": "09cd64fd-b6a0-4854-8911-fec4353cfdab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85b40e9b15ed576168c22a9be2478e4e1be1742ed920940a899a1f433e8b2435"}, "3": {"node_id": "079dc80f-e4b6-44a8-a030-acde1952a611", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b54a90a877949a87646bda5ab60a88f7821e7f0ec02d602910c7f1ad5592945"}}, "hash": "11dae835d0286c57706c47244c467a6255fe4f5e19d0841a56395e2d706d76fe", "text": "through the hesitation and resistance to open, interpersonal discourses. Therefore, the on-going programme dissemination efforts must innovate fresher ways of deepening and diversifying its outreach among key stakeholders, including young people and other key social sector focal points. At another level, the need to make the mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, including those for media, \u2018more inclusive and broad-based so as to allow in and strengthen the social justice and empowerment perspectives\u2019 also is important. Deepening engagement Supplementing initiatives like the Fellowship with longer-term, \u2018tested\u2019 mechanisms like \u201cinvolving interested media practitioners in issue-based researches, ensuring their regular exposure to community realities, and involving them as active members in issue-based networks\u201d is cited by insiders as crucial to broaden uptake of an intricate issue like the sexual minorities by media in Bangladesh. Further, retaining sexual minority issues as a component of the health rights discourse in the country finds favour with senior media professionals. At the same time, as the HIV and health paradigms anchor these issues, and as support for social inclusion of transgender communities widens, a conscious attempt to carefully introduce discourses around social justice and empowerment of the other LGBT groups may need to be heeded. Expanding evidence helps connect other life realities Especially on the transgender issues, the current context is seen as appropriate to expand the discourse beyond just health. Similarly, generating Strategising Spaces for Issues of MSM: The Evolving Hijra Discourse in Bangladesh A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 48 evidence around other relevant thematic areas of social justice, identity and empowerment of the minority groups in active engagement with media will help expand representation on the public domain. Regular sensitisation and exchanges with media Creating issue ownership within media is vital to overcoming internal resistance. Therefore, \u201cmore sensitisation efforts involving the entire line-up within media houses\u201d would need to be supported to create \u2018long term reporters\u2019 who are thoroughly immersed in the dynamics and realities of the issue. It is also essential to address the underlying community concern around media\u2019s inability to ensure confidentiality. There are successful programmatic interventions like the Madhumita project to leverage towards sensitising the media. From the perspective of the community and programme responses, this calls for a need to develop institutional capacities for media engagement and evolve effective frameworks where nuanced mediation by community champions, rights advocates and like-minded professionals is able to steer the discourse on public domain keeping it meaningful and effective. Institutional support through representative evidence and Rights directives/protocols Given the complex socio-legal and religious positioning relating to issues of sexual expression, the necessary impetus to sustaining any positive opinion building needs to be backed by the highest levels of institutional support, including reiteration of representative evidence, credible epidemiological data and binding rights directives by international institutions and government. Introduction The context of Bangladesh is one where shifts in state and civil society responses towards the basic entitlements and rights of the transgender (hijra) communities have become increasingly visible, particularly in the last few years. Speaking of the first government initiative to impart vocational training in 2011 to a batch of hijras, the project-in-charge and Deputy Secretary of Economic Relations Department, S M Ebadur Rahman said, \u201cOur biggest achievement is that the hijra issue is no longer taboo. Even the policy-makers have now realised that marginalisation is not the answer.\u201d136 The initiative, culminating with a public rally by thousands of community members in Dhaka, was amply reported across the media. Bobby Hijra of Shustho Jeeban137 was able to qualify this further:\u201d Recognition and new programmes initiated by the government have been key to the largely positive print media orientation towards us in the past 4-5 years.\u201d138 This is also evident in the area of HIV prevention. \u201cThere has been a marked intensity in the focused HIV prevention interventions for MSM and transgender communities in these last few years. From 8 DICs in 2009, we are now managing 38 across 19 districts,\u201d (senior programme staffers at Bandhu Social Welfare Society (BSWS).139 The question that arises is what has helped foster and crystallise the shift.

Speaking about this, Shale Ahmed141 agrees that they \u201cfaced strong resistance and harassment while carrying out activities like distributing condoms as part of HIV and SRH work beginning 1997. We realised we had to engage actively with every key section at local and other levels.\u201d In over a decade, we witnessed some major developments which include: recognition of hijras as a separate category in the census enumeration of 2008; identification by the NASP142 of \u2018sexual minority\u2019 as a key populations at higher risk in the country and the need for interventions specifically targeted at them; allocation of dedicated budgets for these populations in 2011-12; and a noticeable shift in public domain representations. All these show up as significant milestones for the sexual minority communities. Pioneering Community Participation and Leadership to Advocate on Issues of Sexual Minority in Bangladesh - Bandhu Social Welfare Society (BSWS) Most publically visible community organisations, leaders and spokespersons in Bangladesh have direct connection to BSWS, which consciously enhanced a rights-based approach and a public health perspective in its HIV and SRH interventions, more notably from 2006. These organisations have either sprung up from this group (in the past143) as collectives focusing on gay and hijra issues, or are strongly networked with it.144 The relatively new entity, Shamporkor Noya Setu, may be one of the very few who claim to focus more on MSM issues along with those of the hijras, as Zoya Sikdar, who formed the group in 2010, feels that \u2018there has been a fair amount of recognition for the hijras, but not for the other minorities\u2019. As a group, BSWS has had a decade-long grounding (beginning 1996-97) in HIV and STI care and prevention services before it embarked on rights- based approach in 2006. The shift was a deliberate move as the \u201cteam sat together and chalked out the future strategies and then went to MJF and sought funds,\u201d stated Shale Ahmed. Much before this, they had \u2018realised the need for engagement with a variety of stakeholders to sensitise them on issues around sexual expression and gender identities at local levels\u2019.145 Admittedly, such a shift became essential as peer educators faced opposition on the ground and were hampered in their efforts to reach out information and condoms to at-risk groups and individuals. Later, as part of a conscious enhancement of community-centred perspective in its outreach and advocacy efforts, it was open to expanding its scope of interventions by including more Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) programmes,146 while maintaining its focus on HIV prevention - \u201cIf you look at our organisational strategic plans\u2013the first plan was purely around HIV; the second had HIV and other communicable diseases; while the third which we are implementing now for 2012-16, is SRH that also includes HIV. So, there\u2019s a conscious inclusion of issues of mental health, psychosocial and psycho- sexual health issues. And HIV is a useful advocacy tool, especially for continuing the much-needed focus on MSM as a key group in our programmes in the country.\u201d147 The current mission statement of BSWS is working for \u201c...the well being of sexual minorities by facilitating sexual and reproductive health services and supporting human rights\u2026.\u201d148 There is a clear across-the-board recognition that the past four to five years have been particularly significant in bringing about a recognisable visibility for the rights and health issues of the transgender community in the country on the public domain. Affirming this trend, diplomatic correspondent Angur Nahar Monty at Bhorer Kagoj observed: \u201cOn the transgender issue, I have noticed a whole lot of names in the media. They appear quite often, and give out strong messages, too.\u201d For the other key sexual minority group, the MSM, while \u2018programme interventions have intensified with the government lately recognising them as a key population at higher risk,\u2019 presence on the public domain remains muted, mostly confined within the sexual health rights framework, and not open and uninhibited as that for the hijra issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc0829f0-06af-4c2f-92d0-35963102acfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc0829f0-06af-4c2f-92d0-35963102acfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "534e62b443a7e26512183beb9cee11e6202efa9e63fb66b38075a6405d81778a"}, "2": {"node_id": "08c2a077-c514-46c1-91fa-96ac634249cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1c45a62a76a1021012ee0e12abddc0ef0fc93fc1265c718c67e7a57fd576148"}}, "hash": "8a5c45f6d39312a1aa776ce4b6d632c068d9feece1a8c162254bea4068b74c16", "text": "\u201cThe critical Strategising Spaces for Issues of MSM: The Evolving Hijra Discourse in Bangladesh A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 50 socio-legal nature of the issue itself is the biggest threat for our programme focused on sexual minorities\u2026so", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5674ef4a-c4ea-404b-b086-300330c15b05": {"__data__": {"id_": "5674ef4a-c4ea-404b-b086-300330c15b05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd4a31fb9e1635d301787db4f8363dbf1c0854ae989cce6f1a82b7c0e54fa4f2"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e41438d-d7fb-407a-8d8b-2666f756a84f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99454d74f36d1ff71f92799b4e42a087111b8b9a3c93f8cae47a509b992d5ebc"}}, "hash": "0d68e19016b9fc4c27f945f38125837d34b830cc4303b37f46ebc3fddc495541", "text": "much so that people question whether we are \u2018promoting\u2019 homosexuality,\u201d shares Umme Farhana Z Kanta of BSWS. Building an Enabling Environment To ground the intervention in community-centred approaches it became necessary to \u201cunderstand and engage with local stakeholders and foster effective linkages.\u201d 149 In advancing awareness and advocacy as part of the rights based focus since 2006, the group\u2019s engagement with key stakeholders became more systematic and institutionalised. A look at how BSWS\u2019s engagement evolved ever since the formalization of first district and division level forums of lawyers, journalists, and law enforcing agencies in 2008, shows that while at one level it focused on advocating and addressing risks through harm reduction approaches for community members, there was a parallel focus on reducing vulnerability and mitigating the adverse impact of social marginalization by supporting livelihood opportunities. Forming Forums of Key Stakeholders As part of this, district and division level forums of lawyers and forums of journalists were formed by 2008 in all 3 divisions where the group works, and later all the 19 districts of the three divisions were covered with forums set up in each district. These engagements were the key advocacy focus areas for the group until 2010-11, when emphasis on policy advocacy got included as a prominent component. \u201cAs part of our policy advocacy thrust in the last two or so years, we have reached out to and engaged key decision making entities on the rights and identity issues of the sexual minorities.\u201d150 These include convening a meeting of the forum of members of Parliament in 2012 where 15 MPs participated; enlisting NHRC\u2019s engagement on the issue as a critical ally; engaging top decision-making levels in police, elected civic bodies of the metropolises of Dhaka and Chittagong into a responsibility and action framework aiming others. Reflecting Forum Initiatives in Media To address social vulnerabilities at local levels, the local forums ensured regular interface with opinion makers, including religious leaders. Events like marches, seminars, workshops and trainings were organised at local / division levels regularly, with most of these being organised by local media outlets. In Comilla, for example, \u201cour experience of involving local religious leaders in our programmes has been very fruitful,\u201d recounts Premangshu Sarkar who was earlier working with the Comilla chapter of BSWS. The fact is reflected in media reports, too.151 In fact, an analysis of the early media reports on the sexual and gender minorities clearly brings out how an overwhelming number of these reported these events. This is true of Dhaka as of other areas like Chittagong, Sylhet, Rajshahi and Comilla.152 Many reports, while focusing on risks to the community, also position the community spokespersons, including BSWS, within the stigma and discrimination narratives. A significant feature across these local /sub-national centres has been in how engagement of the community with diverse external stakeholders led to bringing local elected representatives and civic bodies, like the municipal corporations of Chittagong, Dhaka, etc. on board on their issues.153 Capacitating Communities Clearly, the patient yet steady manner in which the issues of gender and sexual minorities shaped in Bangladesh was steered and influenced primarily by how the community worked in a coordinated manner, winning both state and non-state actors as allies to simultaneously address social vulnerabilities, structural barriers and resistance along with risk reduction. Programmatic response too recognised the intensities as is visible in the scaling up of efforts to intensify focus on the MSM communities. The ambitious project Div.

To name the more prominent ones - the release of the documentary film Pratibimbo \u2013 Reflections in 2009; launch of the film, Call me Salma in 2010, the transgender beauty pageant in 2011, the government project to impart vocational training to hijras in 2011 and the remarkable popularity of feature films Common Gender and Ghetuputra Kamala in 2012 - all of these intensified introspection on public domain. Equally important is the keenness with which the community responded to these changes by looking to utilize the positive gravitations to harness meaningful institutional support and endorsements. Nearly all high-level state and civil society engagements at the national level, including with national commissions, ministries of health and social welfare, members of Parliament, top police and civic bodies in Dhaka and other cities, materialised in this period. \u201cFor the first time in our history, we were publicly recognised by the government on the International Language Day celebrations on Feb 21, 2013 when ministers called us on stage and announced that the community of hijras is a valid entity on the government list, and publicly recognised our organisation,\u201d156 Unravelling Media Engagement From 2008, sexual minority organisations like Bandhu Social Welfare Society began to see a qualitative engagement with the mass media as an essential and key strategy. This is borne out by the many special efforts they made, including instituting a Media Fellowship program, to strengthen their engagement in shaping content and messaging on the media. Pre-Fellowship Phase A sample of early media reports sourced157 from the archives of BSWS shows that issues of hijras, and to some extent the MSM, found spaces in media as part of event-based reporting around seminars, workshops, special-day celebrations, visit of dignitaries to programme areas, etc. As almost each of these events had a strong theme of HIV prevention and care, the media too tended to use this theme as the core peg to weave in health, discrimination and rights issues of these communities. Having stated that, we need to recognise that the strategy of partnering with the media to build an enabling environment for reaching out services to highly excluded and stigmatised communities assumed many forms. Ensuring that Different Mediums, Vehicles and Community Voices are Used to Put out Messages Among the 25 reports for 2008 and 2009, there were four where the media focused on the existential travails of the hijra community. This included reporting on a documentary film, entitled \u201cReflections\u201d, made by a community member on the life of a hijra; another pertained to the release of a book by a member of the community (Ananya), and a special feature158. Together they pieced testimonies, reflections and a well-researched article on the hijra community supported by data, real life accounts of two well- known community members and strongly argued appeals for appropriate social and systemic actions to address their alienation. The story by Momin Mehdi also got republished in another Bangla weekly159. Many such examples of well-researched and in-depth reports emerge.160 Strategising Spaces for Issues of MSM: The Evolving Hijra Discourse in Bangladesh A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 52 Strengthening Community Spokesperson and Media Participation The fact that different mediums were used suggests a conscious effort on the part of the community- centred organisations like BSWS and community leaders like Ananya, Shale Ahmed161 and others to leverage the media in different ways to empower the community as well as sensitise others by putting out message in as telling a manner as possible.Events were used not only to establish the linkages with related issues such as human rights, men\u2019s role and male sexual health but to also enable BSWS to facilitate exchange between different stakeholders, often persuading the media to sponsor the events.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ba528f1-aedf-4163-8212-e7aebecec1a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ba528f1-aedf-4163-8212-e7aebecec1a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d69731721a7d42d1fe03b64999b44992919a5eeb608e95cc603b0e3186758c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "e868835a-0359-4d20-8598-2367c6558282", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbf576dc1ca73cbcf30d08f5c83b1e89656310454e4263d28b4ca2324628315d"}}, "hash": "484a055f028d1599aeaf70424b29998339bf8bf5f39305b97b41fb8581aa7c88", "text": "In such a scenario, the media responded both at the level of reporting on the event as well as by holding the first Roundtable in Nov 2008 on \u2018HIV and AIDS and our Responsibility\u2019 under it aegis162, in some ways demonstrating their belief in functioning as an \u201cengaged\u201d institution.

It corroborates this with how the census of 1998-2007 reports an increase in new infection among these communities and the lack of \u2018legal, social or police support\u2019 for them.163 A similar tone and content is visible in media stories in the following years as responses from various levels within the media \u2013 local beats, health beats in the capital as well as management-supported initiatives like Roundtables \u2013 began to help position affirmative spokespersons from diverse sections like the government, media, civil society and the program, on the issue. In the process, the media also complements programmatic efforts to bring highly recognisable community faces like Ananya, Pinkey, Zoya Sikder, et al. as change agents. \u201cWe now think in terms of doing something for society. With Bandhu, I am taking small steps, communicating with South Asian transgender people, and performing at many places\u201d, recounted Ananya at the 24 Nov 2010 Roundtable \u201cHIV and AIDS: Universal access and Human Rights for MSM and Hijras in Bangladesh\u201d organised at the Dainik Jana Kantho. Led by the Chief Editor, Abed Khan, the event re-emphasised the need to focus on both \u201cmass and targeted media, including the internet, as an integrated component in service delivery, prevention messages, health promotion and social support services\u201d.164 Stories and reports carried in local editions of Rajbari, Comilla and Chittagong, clearly evidence how community-led efforts included media as an important local stakeholder on the issue. It is important to recall that BSWS programme centres began constituting local advocacy bodies in districts \u2013 Forums of Journalists and Forums of Lawyers (DLLG) around 2008. Many media reports, often accounts of programme events, meetings, special camps, Forum meetings, etc. brought out issues of risks confronting MSM and hijras.165 Clearly, there are two distinct levels at which media began to get engaged on the issue beginning 2008 - the more high profile efforts like the yearly Roundtables held at the national level, and at the same time a more sustained intervention with local media outlets to ensure inclusion of the issue in their reportage. This sustained interaction between media, community and programme leaders is seen to have provided the building blocks for consolidation later through the Media Fellowship programme in 2011. \u201cWe were more comfortable working with media by 2011. And so, even though we were apprehensive about how media would respond to our Fellowship on \u2018sexual minorities\u2019 RFP, we were confident about publishing the notification. And it all proved right because we had a very good response from the media\u201d, confirms Shale Ahmed. At the same time, we also notice beginnings of qualitative attempts in media to look into and explore the issues from social, legal and epidemiological perspectives. Inclusion of some of these proactively inclined media interests like Moni Mahmood and Rubel Khan as Media Fellows in 2011 depicts a consciousness on the part of the community leadership to deepen media sensitivity around its issues. \u2018Press releases, data and information on the communities provided regularly by Bandhu formed the basis for the stories we did on HIV and the LGBT issues. Of course, what also helped is that our editor, Shyamal Dutta, was a key media focal person for UNAIDS during 2010 and 2011\u2019, shares Moni 53 Mahmud166. Simultaneously, on media\u2019s part, a greater proclivity to include issues of gender and sexual minorities becomes visible among lead outlets like the Daily Kaler Kantho, the Daily Jana Kantho, Bhorer Kagoj,167 the former going on to host the Roundtable event in 2010. \u201cWe began focusing on mass media as a domain in 2008. We feel it has helped break the silence on the issue.... But we need to work out a media plan now complete with messaging, channels, voices, spokespersons, etc. In our third Strategy Plan we envisage a distinct role of media. So, working out the Plan of Action will be the essential next step for us now,\u201d outlines ASM Rahmat Ullah of BSWS.

As the Bandhu media fellowship initiative rolled out by mid-2011, a range of reports by selected fellows emerged towards end of the year across key national media outlets.169 It is noteworthy that in this period, the number of reports filed by journalists from outside the media fellowship fold too went up. Responding to this fact, community leaders reckon that \u201cmedia fellowship opened a floodgate for us in the media\u201d, and that the \u201cfellows are a good peer force within media\u201d.170 Many of these story initiatives are sensitively handled accounts of real life negotiations amid continued discrimination, and accounts of community\u2019s assertion. In all of this, there is a visible evolution in the ease with which media tends to handle transgender persons\u2019 issues in this period -both in terms of the number of journalists reporting, the diversity in the community voices garnered by them, and the openness in treating the narratives. Also significant is how a community-led alternate media initiative sustained consistently ever since 2004. Spandon, a quarterly newsletter on male sexual and reproductive health, has continued to be published and circulated by BSWS. \u201cWe have had a regular practice of sending out our newsletters to all stakeholders - government, police, lawyers, CBOs and other civil society originations,\u201d affirms Shale Ahmed. A bilingual publication, Spandon, is one of the more prominent of the dissemination efforts that the community-based programme has sustained. It essentially is a quarterly report and update on programmatic and civil society initiatives targeted at the transgender and MSM communities. Naturally, HIV and AIDS show up prominently. It reports on new interventions; updates on consultations held with government bodies, law enforcement bodies and civil society nodes; celebrates milestones in recognition of their alternative identities (films, census, government initiatives); and showcases stories of change. Deconstructing Content A deconstruction of 40 reports of which 12 were generated by Media Fellows, by analysing voices, evidence and statements these used in support of respective pegs and messaging171 showed that a purposeful beginning was made to strengthen evidence informed and community-centred advocacy leveraging the power of mainstream media. The intent was stated in the Note on Media Fellowship Programme, 2011. In the introductory segment, the Note labours the point that the \u201ccontinuing and rapid rise of HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM); marginalisation of sexual minorities and their extremely low access to information and services regarding prevention and treatment;

Strategic focus on media too happened in the same period with the formalization of the media fellowship programme in 2011. BSWS further found it opportune to use media more closely to mediate discourse on the public domain alongside. As part of a grant, it began a 24-minute weekly talk show \u2018Orao Amader\u2019 (translation: \u2018They too are ours!\u2019) on the national television to discuss issues of the transgender community. In the early episodes aired, the show sought to bring community representatives and civil society together and facilitate discussion on the community\u2019s issues, concerns and realities. Doctors, government representatives, MPs and programme managers interact with community members on aspirations, life realities and moments of change to help better awareness, address myths and misconceptions and help demystify transgender issues and realities. As a dynamic community-led initiative, the format is seen to respond actively to opportunities. Tarana Halim, a leading lawyer and MP, \u201cwas open to participating in this BSWS TV show as a guest after she got exposed to the transgender persons\u2019 issues in the Forum of Parliamentarians organised earlier by BSWS.\u201d173 The show was quick to have her as a key figure in one of its episodes. So, to assess what worked, and what may not have, let us examine media reports that emerged from the Media Fellows. The criteria used to assess174 the reports are as follows. \ufffd Firstly, did they push the envelope and ensure a more comprehensive discourse or coverage on the epidemic and the issues affecting the most-at-risk- populations or MARPs? \ufffd Secondly, are the Fellows reflecting greater sensitivity and inclusive perspective on MARPs? \ufffd Thirdly, did the symbiotic relationship between risk and vulnerability reduction, between enlarging access to services and preventing and reducing stigma and discrimination against all gender and sexual minorities get reflected in a substantive way in media reports? \ufffd Fourthly, did they result in greater and better documented visibility for sexual minority organisations and their representatives? The quantitative analysis used a sample of 40 articles of which 12 were reports written by Media Fellows and 28 other reports published (print and on-line) in 2011 and 2012. It examined the thematic break-up and messages, evidence and voices that emerged. The thematic areas included: mapping the MSM and transgender population, epidemiology, high-risk practices, programmatic response, condom use, enhancing and strengthening service delivery for marginalised community, HIV testing, migration, stigma and discrimination, legal reform, enabling environment. 55 Thematic Break-up of News Reports -Fellowship and Non-Fellowship Theme Estimation- Mapping Epidemiology High risk practices Programmatic Response Condom Usage Enhancing and Strengthening Service Delivery for marginalised community Increase in HIV Testing Migration Prevailing Stigma and Discrimination Fellowship No. of news reports with details 1.

The quantitative analysis is not in any way a comparative assessment of the 12 reports of the Media Fellows with the other 28 articles. What stands out about the substantive reports of Media Fellows is the attempt to bring together and focus on human rights aspects. Thematically, stigma and discrimination against sexual minority shows up as a persisting concern which got very strongly written about and depicted on many mediums, including a highly evocative and hard-hitting film. In terms of spokespersons, the representation was decisively in favour of the community and their organisations and individuals aligned with them. It ensured that Media Fellows from leading publications used the framework of human rights and the approach of social inclusion and inclusive citizens to shape their reports and located within it the paradigm of risk and vulnerability to HIV. On further examination, to see how much of the 40 reports reflected the country specific evidence that was brought together by different agencies and organisations both national and international, we find that an effort was made never to lose sight of the fact that at the centre of the epidemic are the highly vulnerable, marginal and even ostracised communities facing heightened risks and threat not only of HIV but also of extreme impoverishment and social marginalisation.

It is presented like a basic estimate or number that informs everyone about the magnitude of the issue. In 6 of the 42 reports there is a reference to the official estimation about the number of MSM and hijras in Bangladesh and out of this 5 reports were from Media Fellows. The estimated number of 1,43,062 MSM mentioned in the Country Snapshots 2012 gets reflected in two media reports and the estimate of 40,000 to 1,50,000 stated in the WHO-SEARO Report, 2010, gets partly and fully reflected in all the 6 reports. On the source for estimation of 65000 hijras, it was attributed to the community-based organisation Badhan Hijra Sangho or to authorities, and in one report to the Department of Social Welfare. But most community leaders and activists were also quoted as stating that the estimate of 150000 was conservative and the numbers were \u201cgrowing.\u201d It would be important to state that even as early as 2008, media reported that the \u2018population of hijras in Bangladesh is 15000 only\u2019, of which \u2018356 hijras are in Dhaka and Manikganj\u2019176.

Although this report makes an elaborate mention of BSWS and its special focus on the hijra community, the estimation was disowned by BSWS \u2013 \u2018We are not aware where the author of the report would have got those numbers from.\u201d178 It is clear that when it comes to mapping estimates there is a basic hunger for numbers but by the time we reach the Fellowship period we find that more and more accurate estimates begin to emerge. Some of it even works negatively for the community because, according to Hassan Bipul, Asst Feature Editor, BD News24, and a BSWS Media Fellow, the \u201cway media tends to respond is like this \u2013 out of a total population of 170 million, there are barely 65,000 to 80,000 transgender persons estimated to be there in the country. I am not sure but this is the general perception. So, the editor is often right in declining space for their issues, unless there is a strong peg of interest, like an event, etc.\u201d Epidemiology In 5 out of 42 reports, of which one was written by a Media Fellow, there is substantive epidemiological information about overall HIV prevalence in Bangladesh and world-wide among MSM. Official releases put out by the Bangladesh AIDS Programme on World AIDS Day as well as global surveillance data released by UNAIDS and WHO were cited. This data is also reflected in the Country Snapshots 2012. What is significant is that when it came to reflecting ground realities or interpreting the implications of this data, the articles cite Bandhu Social Welfare Society or experts to justify a state of \u201cHIV alert\u201d on the ground that these official figures do not reflect fully the vulnerability of sexual minorities to HIV. They asserted that 60 to 70% of sexual minorities are \u201csupposedly infected with STIs\u201d and expressed the fear that since Bangladesh \u201cshares a large porous border with India, home to more than 1.5 million people with HIV,\u201d they have to \u201ckeep Bangladesh on the HIV alert.\u201d Clearly, a beginning has been made to use the evidence to ensure that the overall figure of less than 1% HIV prevalence is not used to mask or obscure the vulnerability migrant populations and \u201c70% of sexual minorities infected with STI\u201d face. Earlier, while media reports carried overall HIV estimates, there were specific reports in Daily Jugantar in Nov 2008 that make a mention of increasing prevalence of HIV among sexual minority groups. It was stated that community \u2018census of 1997-2007 reports increase in new infections in these sexual minority groups\u2019.179 On World AIDS Day it is seen as more befitting by the same publication, as well as by leading dailies like Pratham Alo, to talk about overall HIV and AIDS prevalence and the need for prevention rather than narrow it down to MARPs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e800950-24ee-4847-8950-f9988f479343": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e800950-24ee-4847-8950-f9988f479343", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed5fc57c73a6ec61661471d92aeb101db73429d0dca26a7362bc4da8235a6798"}, "2": {"node_id": "73eee089-9222-4b30-8f7a-df6ee7800ed9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80cfe7fdd7bab2b17eeaebd006c0559a9e0f4bb8ecbe05b39cc27c14fe2a0021"}}, "hash": "402e0196e715a482853a913e404183486187c2eda25ed3effc7af82a02ee39eb", "text": "It is significant that Moni Mahmood, Correspondent, Bhorer Khoj, a BSWS Media Fellow 2011, and a Bandhu Media Forum member in Chittagong (2008- 10) who has written some 20 stories on HIV and LGBT issues in his 13-year journalistic career, states that while", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff1e12e2-3e3d-4af4-a257-0fea061ca071": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff1e12e2-3e3d-4af4-a257-0fea061ca071", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b81bf6087eeafa5e884811163d95c30c380a110d7985b5f6786a2aa704c06e9"}}, "hash": "4b81bf6087eeafa5e884811163d95c30c380a110d7985b5f6786a2aa704c06e9", "text": "\u201cover all, HIV awareness has increased, it is not happening amongst the MARPs.

High Risk Practices The evidence and assessments are stark and revealing. With the National AIDS/STD Programme admitting that \u201calthough MSM behaviour is largely hidden, it is however believed that it is more prevalent than previously thought.\u201d180 Hence, there was little scope for any defensive or minimal response. The concern was more unflinchingly articulated by the independent Commission on AIDS in Asia (CAA) when it stated: \u201cSex between men accounts for an increasing share of new infections in Asia and can no longer be treated as a taboo subject\u2026 Social taboos and discrimination means that many men who have sex with men still disguise their sexual preference by also having sex with women (in marriage or otherwise)\u2026 and are also more likely to spread the virus to a large number of other people.\u201d181 The Country Snapshots 2012 went on to express explicitly that although not enough is known about the nature of male-male sexuality in Bangladesh\u2026 59 \u201cPrevious exploratory research has consistently found that approximately 2% of males engage in same-sex sexual behaviour\u201d and also reinforce the fact that same sex monogamy is fairly rare among Bangladesh MSM and transgender persons. The evidence in the Country Snapshots showed that among MSM some have as high as 51 partners in a month\u2019s time with many engaging in group sex and ending by having unprotected sex with both male and female partners. This, coupled with low condom use, and association with IDU and blood sales, increase their risk of contracting HIV infection. The question that emerges is how did the media handle and engage with such sensitive evidence. Six media reports, of which one was by a Media Fellow, which highlighted the issue brought out quite graphically the multiple vulnerabilities that have put these \u201coften neglected communities\u201d at risk. They focused on the risk faced by these communities from many \u201csocial, cultural and economic pressures\u201d including forced marriage, living life in the closet mostly in a highly compartmentalised manner given the threat of severe reprisal, lack of awareness about the risks of unprotected sex, the double stigma they face as MSM doing sex work, no access to basic entitlements such as education and being subjected to inordinate violence, harassment, deceit and betrayal. Having strongly articulated the predicament of the community, the central message that emerged from these reports was their growing risk to HIV (for no fault of theirs) and its consequent impact on HIV prevalence and transmission. \u201cMany of them even get married and lead a family life along with being sexually active with other partners. This further increases the risk of transmission amongst the general population,\u201d was stated in one of the reports of a Media Fellow. Therefore, while the seamless link between vulnerability and risk was highlighted, the question that continues to dog any process of engaged communication is whether enough is being done by the media to demystify HIV and establish the fact that \u201cthe socio- cultural contexts\u201d in which such sexual relationships and \u201cinteractions occur determine how MSM perceive and manage sexual risk and thus impact the uptake of HIV services.\u201d This is where we find that one of the major challenges lies in ensuring that vital nuances are captured. This is amply reiterated in the keynote observations at the National Stakeholder Consultation on Human Rights of Sexual Minority Populations at Bangladesh NHRC on June 13, 2012 where it avers that interventions should \u2018stay along the right to health focus which is more appropriate in the recent country context\u2019, as direct \u2018SOGI interventions might face some problems\u2019182. This opinion is further reinforced by a community member and a Media Fellow- \u201dI have been open about my gay status for many years, but not on the media. It is part of the same society, and thus reflects the same biases. They cannot portray homosexuals from a neutral position,\u201d states Rafiqul Islam Royal, an openly gay member engaged in programmatic and community actions for last 16 years at BSWS. Agreeing to Royal\u2019s view that \u2018there is much more to gays than just their sexuality and orientation\u2019, media fellow, Hassan Bipul shares a recent case where a senior reporter of over 20 years\u2019 standing from Jasole district (Benipole) framed a story on condom distribution among MSM", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "403aff16-5c9f-462c-b275-9ff480c3691e": {"__data__": {"id_": "403aff16-5c9f-462c-b275-9ff480c3691e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e553d6032ac6e58db04d4d391e34769a4e7bc1d4bb066a5466b8e032b30d508"}, "3": {"node_id": "60111597-4ea9-4ae4-87df-a259120b28e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09ea1d49a8604367011d285572ff95dd9cba60ee69b282a854473e6a4beb9333"}}, "hash": "5f05f0f49ec113f5588b1854eacbd390e54b95c2bb02f8811fd855737d9414b3", "text": "in his area as an \u2018anti-faith\u2019 initiative. Bipul was pointing to the \u201centrenched misconceptions at all levels within media which will need to be addressed\u201d. Programmatic Response If we take these concerns forward and look at the issue of HIV prevention programmes and risk reduction services, we need to see whether the issues being raised by spokespersons from the community were being linked with the evidence being presented. For instance, the evidence as presented in the Country Progress Report, Bangladesh tells us that although there was no \u201cchange in the rates of active syphilis among MSM, MSW and hijra.\u201d Yet, given the fact that \u201clarge proportions of MSM and MSW, report STI symptoms, and MSM are highly networked, so if HIV were to emerge, it could spread very rapidly in this population, if prevention efforts are not adequately scaled up\u201d.183 And then the data shows that \u201cthere is a decrease in HIV programme coverage among these most-at-risk population groups. Accessing VCT and STI services was low among the MSM, MSW and hijra populations\u2026. Coverage by prevention programmes during 2006\u20132007 declined substantially from previous years (2003\u20132004) with only 10\u201315% Strategising Spaces for Issues of MSM: The Evolving Hijra Discourse in Bangladesh A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 60 of MSM receiving a service\u2026. In Dhaka, among MSM, only 14.5% used the services and among MSW it was only 1.3%. The hijra community had not accessed VCT services.\u201d184 It is in this context that we need to examine what the media reflected. Out of the 4 reports that focused on these issues, three of which were by the Media Fellows, what became central in their reports was the position that the sexual minority community was not being reached out to with the necessary services. Across the reports the key message was that \u201cif they are not reached out to or the general population stigmatises and discriminates against them, they are at a higher risk of being infected with HIV and a host of other complex diseases.\u201d Shale Ahmed of BSWS185 emphasised that the \u201ccommunity is afraid to approach doctors for any sexual diseases\u201d because \u201cif the doctors happen to know that they are a sexual minority, they are sent away or not treated properly.\u201d And, \u201cas an alternative we have set up the healthcare facility,\u201d he added. In the case of hijras, it was pointed out that as minors they were often subjected to coercive sex and in most instances they were \u201cunprotected, putting them at risk of transmission of STI/HIV.\u201d Reflecting upon the service and intervention scale up by Bandhu, Foisul Ahsan stresses that there has been a \u2018deliberate emphasis on running three kinds of DICs \u2013 one meant only for the hijras, the other for MSM and a third one as an integrated set up meant to cater to both groups.\u2019 Responding to Royal\u2019s claim that the \u2018number of new HIV+ cases is increasing fast in our (MSM) community,\u2019 Premangshu Sarkar of Bandhu shares that \u201cfrom just 8 DICs in 2009, we scaled up to 38 DICs in the 19 districts we work in. There has been a tremendous growth in these past years\u201d. Royal also makes it a point to mention here the new project intervention \u2013 Empowerment of PLHIV among MSM and transgender persons in Bangladesh \u2013 where he would be training PLHIV caregivers. The reports bring out the problem of an insensitive healthcare system and the lack of real and meaningful access to services. An early 2010 report186 argues that if homosexuals do not use condoms and lubricants, their \u2018vulnerability to HIV and AIDS increases manifold\u2019, and yet \u2018very few of them are able to access services\u2019 for fear of their orientation being revealed. There are evidences of similar community concerns on media outside Dhaka too.187 Therefore, although the more compelling and telling evidence that \u201camong the MSM and MSW populations, none outside of Dhaka reported using VCT,\u201d did not get featured in these reports, the fact that MSM and transgender persons would prefer to visit healthcare centres set up by the NGOs and community groups revealed where the concerns lay and the kind of action that had to be taken to address them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60111597-4ea9-4ae4-87df-a259120b28e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "60111597-4ea9-4ae4-87df-a259120b28e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e553d6032ac6e58db04d4d391e34769a4e7bc1d4bb066a5466b8e032b30d508"}, "2": {"node_id": "403aff16-5c9f-462c-b275-9ff480c3691e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f05f0f49ec113f5588b1854eacbd390e54b95c2bb02f8811fd855737d9414b3"}}, "hash": "09ea1d49a8604367011d285572ff95dd9cba60ee69b282a854473e6a4beb9333", "text": "Low condom use Low condom use was borne out by many studies and what was worrisome was that it was declining, and in the case of hijras, the decrease in condom use from 2006 to 2010 was quite steep.

Again, the concern was framed in an inclusive manner as it brought out the communities\u2019 risk and vulnerability to HIV rather than merely flaunting the evidence to sensationalize the threat of HIV. In the case of hijras, the complex process of condom negotiations with partners was brought out to demonstrate how high risk behaviour was inversely connected with social marginalization and disempowerment. Enhancing and strengthening targeted intervention and service delivery for marginalised community On the scaling up of service delivery for MSM, the Country Progress Reports (2012) focuses on how the Global Fund supported programme - one of the largest Targeted Intervention programmes - has supported setting up 65 DIC for MSM/SW/hijra in 40 districts reaching about 33,000 MSM/MSW/hijra. To achieve this they have, in collaboration with ICDDR.B, \u201cconducted behavioural surveys and size estimations to create evidence for setting intervention sites and 61 designing at micro-level.\u201d188 And in its Strategic Plan for HIV and AIDS, 2004-2010, the National AIDS/STD Programme commits to \u201cmaximising treatment effectiveness and ensuring equity in access and rollout, consistent and affordable supply of quality assured drugs for prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic infections (OIs), ensure access to ART treatment counselling including adherence counselling, nutrition treatment, support, and financial planning.\u201d189 Some of these vital developments are reflected in the media. Out of the three reports, one entitled, It is Hard for a Gay Bangladeshi,190 talks about the Global Fund initiative and the Drop-in-Centre located near a popular cruising site that \u201ccaters to the health and welfare\u201d of MSM. The other two reports, one of which was by a Media Fellow, was on the government\u2019s decision to supply free Ante-Retroviral Therapy (ART) to people living with HIV and the need for comprehensive sex education in schools. In both reports, major stakeholders such as government officials, NGO heads, community representatives and doctors are quoted which shows that both issues are of importance. On the supply of free ART, we find that the government is confident of making the drugs \u201cavailable at five big hospitals initially\u201d and it has \u201dalready bought those \u2018expensive\u2019 doses worth over Tk 40 million needed for a year.\u201d Speaking on behalf of civil society organisations, Habiba Akhter of Ashar Alo Society, welcomed the move and felt that, \u2018once government started the supply, they will never stop.\u201d She emphasised that with the drugs costing Tk 15,000, it would be \u201cbeyond the means of many middle-class patients.\u201d191 In the other report, written up by a Media Fellow, what is significant about the framing of the report on sex education is the emphasis on the need to reach out to \u201cMSM students\u201d and include homosexuality in the sex education curriculum. It affirmed this idea by quoting a MSM student, who expressed deep disappointment at not getting any information useful to him. \u201cI got nothing\u201d he stated. The fact that the sex education did not cater to the needs of MSM pupils was criticised on the grounds that \u201cschools have an obligation to support and enhance the self- esteem of all students regardless of their sexual orientation\u201d and must recognise that it is \u201dimportant for both straight and MSM pupils to be given information and skills for HIV prevention.\u201d What emerges from the reports is the showcasing of positive interventions and programmes and pushing the envelope when it came to difficult initiatives such as sexuality education. And on an issue such as sexuality education, the media justified the intervention on the ground that it will strengthen HIV prevention among heterosexuals as well as MSM. Prevailing stigma and discrimination The battle against stigma and discrimination is linked strongly to strengthening community\u2019s access to services including information. Therefore, support from the media to strengthen community systems to deliver services to MSM and transgender persons was critical. The Country Progress Reports and Country Snapshots 2012 made it clear that \u201ccommunity-based organisations operate much of Bangladesh\u2019s MSM health outreach in the absence of state-run alternatives.\u201d Similarly, they credit the NGOs for improving MARPs\u2019 access to testing facilities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2373e7f0-a85d-4e8b-b087-752b7f594820": {"__data__": {"id_": "2373e7f0-a85d-4e8b-b087-752b7f594820", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b271221f8c38087b137ab4769df2a6b35423fffcd08bcff2b85ecd108ecac96a"}, "2": {"node_id": "80321d3a-2abf-48ec-9208-9172a17c4e75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "553e26253670e9cd3868775a22d7d1e3dc5a98cbc14c51d60913fd0cbd9ccbd1"}}, "hash": "ce47ebf4a8f28892c930aab532c60b73d3a50eb17483d8fea279292d0e447a11", "text": "Based on the Country Snapshots 2012 a media report of April 2012192 publicised the effort being made by BSWS to \u201creduce the risk of STI/HIV transmission among hijras in Bangladesh the role that community centres are playing in ensuring that \u201cservices like blood/STI tests as well as sex education are readily available.\u201d What is significant about this report is that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ccd4786-a19f-43d2-9f8a-0a678e7d5b0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ccd4786-a19f-43d2-9f8a-0a678e7d5b0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb6f176dece04303405b716dad5741033372384d21d2650428622adb37ad3740"}}, "hash": "cb6f176dece04303405b716dad5741033372384d21d2650428622adb37ad3740", "text": "all these efforts by NGOs and CBOs were positioned as part of the country programme to capacitate MSM organisations bolster community\u2019s access to services. Across the 40 reports a predominant engagement of media, in particular of Media Fellows, was on the issue of stigma and discrimination. With nearly 21 out of 40 reports and 8 out of 12 reports of Media Fellows focusing on the issue, carrying nearly 65 messages on stigma and discrimination against hijras and MSM out of a total of 158 messages193, this was an issue that got strong attention. Strategising Spaces for Issues of MSM: The Evolving Hijra Discourse in Bangladesh A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 62 In the Country Snapshots 2012 we find that an assessment done in 2000 by Naz Foundation International revealed that stigma against MSM was common among health practitioners. There also is mention of documented cases of harassment of both MSM and HIV outreach workers by law enforcement authorities.194 The media reports were scathing. What emerges in each of these reports is the unacceptable levels of violation community members and outreach workers were facing in virulent forms ranging from being ostracised, \u201cdisowned\u201d, spurned, shunned, assaulted to being abused by society, parents, doctors and other service providers. In fact, each of the 8 reports brought out by the Media Fellows and 13 reports filed by other journalists reported graphically the many forms of violation they faced, located it in the context of denial of citizenship rights to hijras, and across the reports, communicated the community\u2019s need and demand for work, education, healthcare and the right to use public transport. The reports brought out that much of the neglect of the community was the result of an entrenched bias in each of these institutions, and even attempted to affix responsibility for the sorry plight of the community. The reports showed how basic citizenship rights such as healthcare, education, right to movement, shelter, and security were denied to the community. Two of the reports focused on the total denial of healthcare services in both private and government hospitals and clinics. The discrimination against sexual minorities was extreme and highly questionable. It bordered on outright refusal to treat them for STI or learn about the STI treatment protocols laid down for such a vulnerable community and in most instances the doctors even refused to treat them for general ailments such as fever, diarrhoea and diabetes. Sexual minorities were discouraged from speaking to doctors, entering clinics, often subjected to humiliating and abusive treatment by all and sundry, including security guards. They pointed out that under these circumstances their vulnerability to HIV, STI and to a host of ailments was not only heightened but compounded by having to resort to alternative therapies and treatment from unqualified practitioners. In another report, a journalist wrote about the \u201csuffering of sexual minority students\u201d where he shared the first-person testimonies of MSM students who had dropped out of school due to extreme persecution by students and teachers, unable to withstand the daily taunts, hate-filled acts and indignities. The report sought a systemic redress for such discriminatory acts. The most poignant reports were those that etched out the extreme sense of rejection and scorn experienced by community members. They have gone as far as to state they were being treated like \u201cuntouchables\u201d, denied entry into all public spaces and facilities including buses, toilets and even cremation and burial grounds and subjected to the worst kinds of indignities and torture from the police to the parents. Some of these heartrending happenings were also captured in a film which, in turn, generated reports reviewing the film or using the film as a peg to do more human interest features. Legal barriers WHO-SEARO report admits that the legal barriers and challenges are onerous. There is recognition that while Section 377A criminalises consensual sex between adult men and can be used to harass and intimidate MSM, the law can be equally oppressive to transgender and hijras. In fact, by being silent on transgender and hijra issues, it only encourages greater discrimination against them. The seven media reports, of which six are online reports and one by a Media Fellow, highlight the oppressiveness of the law which may not prosecute the sexual minorities but is certainly doing everything to \u201csilence their voices\u201d, force them into a \u201cshadow existence\u201d, a \u201clife of secrecy\u201d and to \u201cconform to bigotry, misguided notions of honour and caricatures of justice and morality.\u201d The lesbians were also seen as \u201cdoubly marginalised.\u201d They were emphatic that \u201cSection 377 contradicts the fundamental", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf5a3927-7b57-4651-9459-e5ad8db69f94": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf5a3927-7b57-4651-9459-e5ad8db69f94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55799a0c666050ada516f14fc6c18ce61752ee5dbf7238812983f79c9d4a63a5"}}, "hash": "55799a0c666050ada516f14fc6c18ce61752ee5dbf7238812983f79c9d4a63a5", "text": "principles of dignity and equality and violates international human rights law.\u201d And the community leaders were quoted as stating that in the \u201ceyes of law\u2019 they have been declared \u201cguilty\u201d and they have to \u201csuffer in society in many ways.\u201d Moreover, with Article 377 being read down in neighbouring India, Shale Ahmed was quoted stating: \u201cAll the human rights groups in 63 our country are demanding a similar step in our country.\u201d 195 It is clear that a section of media voiced strong views not just about the law but the kind of risk and vulnerability it was putting the community of MSM and transgender persons into. This coupled with the media reports about the horrific incidents of stigma and discrimination the hijra communities face showed in no uncertain terms their plight and has in many ways made the government introduce new schemes and state publicly the realization that continued \u201cmarginalization of these community is not the answer.\u201d196 Advancing access to social entitlements The Bangladesh National Strategic Plan for HIV and AIDS 2004-2010 committed that the priority groups of people at risk of HIV infection will have access to social protection \u201cin ways that respect their human rights and dignity and will be empowered to protect themselves and others\u2026. create a nation in which all those whose livelihood and employment strategies or lifestyles put them and others at risk of infection are protected.\u201d197 Out of eight reports on this theme, with three relating to the Media Fellows, a range of social entitlements and welfare programmes for hijras were focused upon and senior officials of Department of Social Welfare quoted on different schemes and a holistic rehabilitation plan for hijras. Also, the launch of a Livelihood and Skill Training programme for hijras was widely reported on the media. Consolidation and scaling up media engagement: Lessons from the trajectory of responses It is vital to recognise the momentum generated on multiple planes. Programmatic, civil society and state responses have converged increasingly, both to recognise the scale and nuances of discrimination the gender and sexual minorities have been living with, as well as the criticality of strengthening comprehensive responses that are genuinely inclusive of the realities, needs and dilemmas of these at-risk communities. Parallel to this is the way media\u2019s response intensified \u2013 putting these communities, rather than just the epidemic, at the centre of the rights and inclusion discourse in the country. In a fitting recognition of this shift, as well as the vitality of consolidating the gains made, ASM Rehmat Ullah of BSWS cites how media\u2019s response \u2018has resulted in breaking the silence on the issue by now\u2019, and in the same breath goes on to emphasize the clear and present need for a roadmap when he states the \u2018need to work out a media plan, complete with messaging, channels, voices, spokespersons, etc.\u2019 In a proactive move, the lead outfit spearheading the LGBT discourse in Bangladesh, BSWS envisages \u2018a distinct role for media\u2019 in its Strategy Plan for 2012- 16, and clearly recognises the need to \u2018work out a clear Plan of Action as an essential next step\u2019. In consolidating media as an engaged stakeholder, it will need to negotiate barriers and challenges to enable more seamless interfaces between media, community and the key mediating stakeholders; strategically use evidence and voices of champions, partners and allies on the issue to position community\u2019s rights within the imperatives of addressing the epidemic; and strengthen processes and mechanisms of engagement with media in order that entrenched trends, domain pulls and other distractions get addressed organically. A mutually mediated multilevel domain engagement with media As a movement shaped largely by intrinsic forces and a persevering community involvement, and yet securing gains in an adversarial socio-legal terrain, the whole course of positioning the LGBT issue on public domain in Bangladesh evidences some crucial coordinates essential to any meaningful media engagement. Beginning with engaging the local media beats through district level forums, it consciously traversed its way to bringing on-board gate keepers in the form of Roundtables, and later facilitated the media fellowship as an instrument of informed expressions by media. These strategies made it possible for the media to have an active engagement with the issue. They not only covered it as journalists but also engaged with it by sponsoring and hosting events around the issue.

The shift from the earlier district and event centred approach to a more qualitative approach of conferring Fellowships to a few journalists stemmed from the need to change the \u201csocial landscape surrounding MSM and sexual minorities; building favourable public opinion; supporting legal reforms; and strengthening policy advocacy efforts\u201d.198 From this perspective, it is clear that a concerted beginning was made. A deconstruction of the reports shows that on major thematic areas the reports were framed keeping the country-specific evidence and the ground level experience of the community in mind. It is not surprising that representatives of community, civil society organisations and human rights activists were significantly represented in the reports monitored. While highlighting the many barriers faced by the key populations at risk, they also brought out the role being played by community organisations in mapping and reaching out with services to the communities. Impact on the domain of media As a media insider put it, \u2018fellowship and awards as instruments serve only a designated purpose\u2019. Going by a media fellow\u2019s account, too, three stories conceived and complied by three colleagues at Bhorer Kagoj as part of a planned special feature on hijra issues \u2018continue to await front-page space for over two months\u2019.199 Just also how Shale Ahmed summarises community leaders\u2019 and programme planners\u2019 opinions - \u201creporters are easy to sensitise. Our focus needs to be on editors and gate keepers. They are critical, but just not interested.\u201d \u201cTwo of the more progressive dailies have come forward and convened the three Roundtables so far. Beyond 2010, however, our efforts to persuade the bigger outlets have not borne results,\u201d notes Shale Ahmed. So much so, one of these, the highest circulated Bangla daily in the country \u201cwithdrew the name of its journalist\u201d from the Media Fellow\u2019s list. Such tendencies within the media to distance itself from \u2018such a complex issue\u2019 is seen by insiders as being borne out of the compulsion of \u2018being a drawing room newspaper that is accessed by all in the family\u2019. Empowering advocates in media \u201cOnly 21 of the planned 27 fellowship stories could finally appear on media\u201d as the rest could not get through the gate keepers, informs Premangshu Sarkar, the nodal person on media fellowship at BSWS. He asserts that their \u201cfocus now is more on one-to-one engagements\u201d with senior media professionals, including editors. They have also identified a pool of \u2018concerned and positively inclined\u2019 senior media professionals including stalwarts like Manjarul Islam Bulbul (Chief Editor, Baishakhi TV), Abed Khan (Chief Editor, Kaler Kantho), Ghulam Sarvar (Shomoy Kaal), and Saiful Islam, who have a \u2018highly empathetic disposition on the issue\u2019. These faces, the programme feels, should help them \u2018break ice\u2019 with the more resistant ones in the media. While insiders also aver that person-to-person advocacy may work best with gate keepers, what the community and programme leaders would need to ensure is that setting of agendas on the issue does not get left to the media alone. The fact that BSWS is \u201cplanning to organise a policy level conclave with lead media editors\u201d in the near future testifies that the community recognises the need to evolve a multilayered engagement mechanism for the media. Of as much significance, however, will be the need to work out a framework for seamless exchanges between these layers within media so that management, readership and editorial dynamics get strategised by issue needs as well as by comprehending and engaging with the fast-changing institutional dynamics of mass media. Expanding issue visibility on public domain In a shift of focus this year, the next batch of media fellows is from the electronic sector. \u201cCompared to print, the electronic media is still resistant to our issues,\u201d states Bobby Hijra, pointing to a scathing story carried recently by a private television channel that depicted the hijra community in an extremely poor light.200 Echoing a commonly held opinion on how the electronic media tends more to savour sensational treatment and depiction, KTM Tariq of FHI360 avers that on the occasion of the last AIDS Day, there was no media facilitated programme on television.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "990c53fd-3f49-4f61-9ac8-6c66041cdf37": {"__data__": {"id_": "990c53fd-3f49-4f61-9ac8-6c66041cdf37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2f0921c366e4ed347e8203b939d49a2ebdf374e9fb1781a8c604ee420047c5d"}, "2": {"node_id": "08426123-df00-4be8-ad70-b476182ace56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10e851b87e83feafdcbbb357d521f8b5dcfd0b12028d995fbbea5b77c9d9e7bc"}}, "hash": "0e1e60eb021e7941aa017421a5a3ef6611d42fe986d1f216ba3b56a374ebd61d", "text": "65 Opening the media fellowship this year for electronic journalists, and facilitating a television programme on issues of hijras on national television are some of the ways in which the community-led initiatives may be trying to create acceptance of its issues in this medium.

This medium will need to be strategised with in many ways including agreeing upon norms of consent and the rules of engagement if we are to secure an engaged partnership with the electronic media as a whole. Intensifying community-led dissemination and strategic engagements Clearly, programmatic and community efforts to make the issue more omnipresent in the public and alternate domains must be continued so as to break through the hesitation and resistance to open interpersonal discourses. Therefore, the on-going programme dissemination efforts must innovate fresher ways of deepening and diversifying its outreach among key stakeholder sections, including the youth and key social sector focal points. This is where senior rights activist Sara Hossain asserts the need to make the mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, including those for media, \u2018more inclusive and broad-based so as to allow in and strengthen the social justice and empowerment perspectives.\u2019 Simultaneously, efforts to engage the \u2018more progressive\u2019 mass media outlets need to be intensified to strengthen acceptance and serious commitments on the issues within media. Deepening engagement with practitioners to catalyze \u201cChange Makers\u201d on the domain Senior media professionals like Angur Monty, who has for many years in past been actively associated with campaigns like the ones on domestic violence, anti- tobacco campaign and others, feels that \u201cfellowship and awards have been used as popular instruments to activate media interests\u201d on complex issues, but these can only go a distance unless supplemented with longer-term mechanisms like \u201cinvolving the interested media practitioners in issue-based researches, ensuring their regular exposure to community realities, and involving them as active members in issue-based networks\u201d. It is this breed of practitioners who will become the \u2018in-house change makers\u2019 and influence peers. The widely accepted view to retain sexual minority issues as a component of the health rights discourse in the country finds favour with senior media professionals. \u2018Working closely with health reporters, including engaging them in in-depth researches\u2019 can be a win-win deal for media houses, HIV and AIDS advocates and the issue champions for sexual minorities. At the same time, there also is an equally pertinent point of view that \u2018overdoing the health angle\u2019 to promote rights issues of these communities runs the risk of typecasting and \u2018narrowing down the more salient aspects of dignity, identity, human rights and rightful civic and livelihood entitlements to only the health issue dynamics\u2019. Some are quick to even point out here that the Bandhu fellowship, for example, was meant essentially to advance issues of \u2018sexual minorities\u2019, and not so much just their \u2018health rights\u2019.201 Therefore, as the HIV and health paradigms continue to provide anchor sheet support to these issues; and as the support for social inclusion of the transgender communities widens, a conscious attempt to carefully introduce discourses around social justice and empowerment of the other LGBT groups may need to be heeded. Evidence to embolden connects with other life realities Especially on the transgender (hijra) issues, the need to expand the discourse beyond just the health discourse is further emphasised by Sara Hossain who also feels that a pronounced focus on stigma and discrimination by the media may have pitched up the \u2018victim syndrome\u2019 at the cost of an opportunity to bring in the more pertinent issues of social justice, identity and empowerment. The possible reason for this, she feels, may be a complete absence of documented evidence of discrimination against the community in the country, and goes on to suggest a more comprehensive civil society thrust on creating such evidence, and evolve more interactive frameworks around these to engage the media.

For this, they must \u2018be able to own the issue\u2019 as any other change maker. It corroborates an underlying community concern around media\u2019s inability to ensure confidentiality. Reacting to the response of young MSM members in a FGD where they declined outright to engage with any media on the ground that \u2018media would not care one bit about giving out all our details,\u201d Tariq of FHI360 confirms that \u201conly now our media partners have begun appreciating the confidentiality issue\u201d, as he recounts the experience of several rounds of sensitisations carried out through media forums under the Madhumita project. Wider, issue-centric challenges, as reflected in the content analysis, point to a need to use sensitisation and regular engagement efforts with media to address the natural propensity to get fixated on numbers, use stigma and discrimination to heightened proportions, and portraying community members often as passive, with no agency whatsoever. From the perspective of the community and programme responses, what this calls for is a need to develop institutional capacities for media engagement and evolve effective frameworks for this - where nuanced mediation by community champions, rights advocates and like-minded professionals is able to steer the discourse on public domain keeping it meaningfully effective. It is pertinent to note that while a community champion like Bandhu has undertaken several rounds of sensitisation exercises with many institutions including \u2018law enforcement agencies, police, lawyers, medical professional, and even religious leaders\u2019 in the past years, \u2018no such exercise has so far happened with media\u2019. As a one-off exercise, we find a media training initiative202 undertaken recently by the organisation to familiarize \u2018mid and senior level staffers with handling and interacting with media\u2019.203 Moving beyond such beginnings in self-preparation, it is hoped that the focus on media\u2019s role as envisaged in the Strategy Document (2012-16) would help \u2018evolve and develop a comprehensive media strategy\u2019.204 While their experience of the media fellowship is \u2018the only strategic step in this direction so far\u2019, there is a definite recognition of the \u2018need for an elaborately worked out strategy framework\u2019. Institutional support in the form of representative evidence and rights paradigms For any consistent engagement of media on issues of sexual minorities, Shale Ahmed points out that a necessary impetus needs to come from credible and reputed institutions like the UN and the government. \u201cA lead by UN institutions would be crucial to engaging both the government and media in any longer term framework\u2019 on the issue, where the civil society can act as a key facilitator. Representative evidence, credible epidemiological data and binding rights \u2018directives from international bodies can serve as prime movers\u2019 and will help \u2018create in-house issue champions within media\u2019, he avers. 67 Media played a crucial role in drawing attention to the links between the high HIV risk and the degree of stigma and violence through illustrative narratives rather than just with statistics and data. It not only helped shape thinking in the community, de- stigmatising them and enabling greater acceptance, but played a key role in seeking government accountability towards individual rights of sexual minorities. It went through a maze of complex issues and communicated the essential dilemmas: that bigotry, stigma, discrimination and violence diminish the enjoyment of basic rights of sexual minorities and are unacceptable, and called on the government to protect and enable these rights. Legal Environment: Section 377 In 2009 the Delhi High Court read down the 150 year old Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, thus legalising consensual sex activities between adults in private, including those of same sex couples. Following this, 16 religious organisations filed a special leave petition with the Supreme Court challenging the High Court verdict. In early 2012, the Supreme Court heard arguments from the various parties and reserved the matter for judgment, but did also state that homosexuality should be seen as one of the things that has become acceptable, as many things do in an ever-changing society. The judiciary has also intervened to protect specific rights of LGBT people, such as employment and social welfare. In a judgement by the Allahabad High Court in 2010, interim relief was given to a professor who was suspended from the Aligarh Muslim University because of his sexual orientation. The Supreme Court in 2012 passed interim orders calling on the Government to ensure opportunities and facilities for COUNTRY CASE STUDY 2 INDIA Focused Programme Actions Magnify Articulations on MSM and Transgender Persons\u2019 Issues: Reflections", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c459c5d-2f7b-47fb-8f6a-df9e6dc4400c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c459c5d-2f7b-47fb-8f6a-df9e6dc4400c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "826a8819386fd84ac7cf32f8b951c1ce98efe405ac4b27ce95cd71f2411f90cf"}, "3": {"node_id": "458d28a9-c0a3-4982-bf72-456b7ba4a889", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "004fa6206f7e66d6a4f3ac4634ea49a4749af80ea66bc83aa938f8618eb36bcf"}}, "hash": "15ea5096e77e7354bec3ba222efa1141eabcab8e7071cc5373152c069a81a7f5", "text": "from India Acknowledgements This document analysing the engagement of the media in India around issues of men having sex with men (MSM) and transgender people (TG) would not have been possible without the contributions made by activists, community leaders and community organisations who provided vital insights on the subject.

Executive Summary Three factors formed the basis of the response on men having sex with men (MSM) and transgender people (TG) in India \u2013 firstly, emerging community leaderships, secondly, a favourable judicial climate and lastly, a strong HIV prevention programme that articulated the need for rights-based and a community-led approach. These factors contributed to the shift in the media discourse which helped the engagement of a wide group of civil society stakeholders around homosexuality and male to male sex, individual rights and HIV prevention.

National HIV Programming for MSM and Transgender People The third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP III) emphasised the need for increased attention to MSM and a strategy was outlined to develop HIV prevention programmes for transgender persons and MSM sub-populations (including male sex workers). Central to the NACP III strategy was the innovative idea to directly invest in community based organisations to respond to the epidemic. By 2007, community leaders were concerned that despite the programme scale up, community efforts were not getting adequate funding. This belief, combined with research that showed high levels of risk for MSM and transgender people (including hijras) in India, and with persistent advocacy by a core group of community leaders and advocates led to the submission of a successful award from the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Round 9, for a planned HIV response for vulnerable sexual minorities. Emerging Community Movement Community organisations such as Humsafar Trust (1994), Sangama (1999) and Bharosa Welfare Trust (1999) were some of the earliest pioneers to recognise the challenge and contradictions of mainstreaming gay people, particularly MSM. Whilst recognising the lack of both public and private spaces for the community due to discrimination and the uneven application of the Section 377 law, early leaders were aware of the urgency of ensuring HIV prevention and support services reached these mostly invisible populations. At the state level, the emergence of organisations like Social Welfare Association for Men, Sahodaran and Suraksha Society in Tamil Nadu, Humsafar in Mumbai (Maharashtra), Naz Foundation (India) Trust in Delhi, and Bharosa in Uttar Pradesh, enabled the movement to gain visibility, while offering HIV prevention and support services. Recognising the need to build a broader advocacy platform against the background of people who feared revealing their identity, many organisations and collectives came together to form the Indian Network for Sexual Minorities (INFOSEM) in 2003, and in addition, in 2004, the National MSM & HIV Policy, Advocacy, and Human Rights Task Force (National Task Force), now known as the MSM Advocacy Network. Strengthening the Early Environment Early efforts were made by community organisations to work with a variety of stakeholders such as the police, media and local health departments and national ministries, though many intentionally kept away from the media. Public rallies to protest injustice against the MSM community became an integral feature. More recently, using the Western concept of gay pride parades and celebrations, community leaders have sought to engage and educate the media and the general public on the ill and unfair effect of Section 377 and its impact on the community, particularly with regard to individual empowerment and HIV prevention, care, support and treatment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "458d28a9-c0a3-4982-bf72-456b7ba4a889": {"__data__": {"id_": "458d28a9-c0a3-4982-bf72-456b7ba4a889", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "826a8819386fd84ac7cf32f8b951c1ce98efe405ac4b27ce95cd71f2411f90cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c459c5d-2f7b-47fb-8f6a-df9e6dc4400c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15ea5096e77e7354bec3ba222efa1141eabcab8e7071cc5373152c069a81a7f5"}}, "hash": "004fa6206f7e66d6a4f3ac4634ea49a4749af80ea66bc83aa938f8618eb36bcf", "text": "Findings on Media Engagement The Media was writing on issues ranging from the Section 377 legal debate, government efforts to mainstream the community through social protection initiatives, high levels of stigma and discrimination and violence faced by them and their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7031f691-87c4-41a7-8328-b545dcc74134": {"__data__": {"id_": "7031f691-87c4-41a7-8328-b545dcc74134", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fe14ce550bb3419d542a497f832f4e8a918964c7c08d941ffac02e3e0230b47"}}, "hash": "6fe14ce550bb3419d542a497f832f4e8a918964c7c08d941ffac02e3e0230b47", "text": "role in leading HIV prevention efforts. Humsafar Trust, Sangama, Sampathik Trust, Sahodaran, TAI and NGO alliances such as Voices Against 377 engaged with the media using formal and informal strategies. In 2000, organisations such as Humsafar Trust and Sangama worked with selective journalists who were sensitive though not necessarily well informed about the community, rights violations and their vulnerability to the HIV epidemic. In 2001 in Lucknow, local police citing sodomy and obscenity laws detained four outreach workers from 69 Bharosa Trust and Naz Foundation International (NFI), a UK charity with a local office. The charges related to HIV prevention materials targeted to MSM that were deemed obscene as well as in violation of Section 377. NFI took their case to the international stage, engaging its extensive network of colleagues and supporters in the UK and the US and gaining international media attention. This was the case, after seven years, which formed the basis of the reading down of Section 377, amidst heavy media coverage of the issues. In Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, community organisations conducted media sensitisation workshops to address myths and misconceptions of journalists. This helped engage journalists in writing about life realities and everyday facets of the community. Informal discussions held between journalists and community also led to planning more thoughtful features and reports exploring the many challenges and travails they faced. These reports were not always linked with the high coverage phases or major events, and instead kept appearing in the intervening periods of lull, thus ensuring a certain degree of presence on the public domain. Sampathik Trust (Pune), Sangama (Bangalore), TAI - Vizhudugal (Tamilnadu) and Samraksha (Hyderabad) narrated instances of using site visits to share practical examples of the work of the CBO and instil confidence amongst the media. Each visit was tailor- made for a specific category of media professionals and shaped to their specific expectations. The media was interested in highlighting high levels of discrimination faced by gay couples. Since 2011, media tracking reports show that the space for reporting on gay issues has diminished. This could be a result of fatigue from reporting on the same aspect of the issue. The media would like to focus on other aspects but the community may not be as much ready to come out as indicated by the media tracking. There is a degree of fatigue for the media, which would like different aspects of the issue to emerge but the community is at present finding it difficult shaping up to this challenge. Whilst CBOs were clear that the media was a critical ally in shaping societal attitudes towards the gay/MSM and transgender communities and understanding their role in the HIV prevention efforts, few if any had clarity on a consistent approach of media engagement. There are instances to show that even earlier when there had been a coordinated partnership between the community, prevention programmes and the media, incidences of new HIV infections within the MSM community is on the rise. These community-centred initiatives focused on fact sheets, profiles of MSM and transgender persons who made a difference, and best practices to help shape in-depth media coverage on the quality of the response. However, there was no systematic and uniform approach among CBOs to generate evidence from the HIV response (using the programme data, along with narratives illustrating changes). Community leadership and participation played a strong role in articulating LGBT rights and negotiating the legal environment in India since 2005. They were participating in developing media coverage either in writing as contributors or by organising activities and media interactions, providing quotes, narratives or sharing stories for feature length articles. Through 2008, community voices strongly articulated the denial of rights, social exclusion along with the persistent stigma faced at the familial and societal level, discrimination at the workplace and abuse and violence in public places. The consistent community presence helped to reshape the gay image in the media from a deviant, exotic and colourful individual to that of an everyday person. The community voice however, was not that well represented in the national media. Coverage was shaped by officials, representatives of the government such as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Home Affairs, NACO and to a much lesser extent community representatives speaking about the presence or lack of health services. The presence of a large number of MSM and transgender people\u2019s voices emerged only from the many events organised around community rights and entitlements.

At the programme level, articulation on programme achievements, structural barriers and peer strategies to reduce barriers was on account of capacity building in advocacy that community leaders underwent before presenting to media. The consistency of community efforts revolved to a great extent as a response to the court proceedings. State-level community organisations were successful in maintaining a consistent relationship with media, which helped to gain the confidence of media on the importance of community leadership in the response. Unfortunately, while many of the mid-to senior-level leaders understand the importance of keeping the media abreast of the issues related to the community and attempt to engage them into advocacy initiatives, constraints such as lack of trained personnel and financial resources limit these efforts. Mapping the Coverage - Content Analysis Initial reporting on MSM and transgender persons was very low to almost non-existent through 2005. By 2008, the media had taken note of the vital debate that was impacting a significant number of Indian citizens, members of the LGBT communities. The period from 2008 to 2009 accounted for 64% of the total media coverage, which also provided space for peripheral issues related to the community to emerge. A large segment of the national news focused on the Delhi High Court, and thereafter the Supreme Court, proceedings (32%). This high volume media coverage continued until 2010, a year following the Delhi High Court landmark decision on Section 377. The gay pride parades and rallies, which were initiated by the LGBT groups starting in 2008, also became a key source of news and information (16.5%) in the media about the community. Media Engagement with the Enabling Environment In the early years, media focused on the growing incidence of HIV and AIDS in the country and homosexuality but continued to link homosexual activity to child abuse. News reports began to emerge of young people unable to cope with the confusion of differing sexual identities. Stories of violence faced by gay people became quite common in newspapers. These narratives of extreme abuse often struck a chord with the journalists who began to focus on the need for greater protection for vulnerable communities. News reports in 2008 and 2009 referred to the stigma and discrimination as a challenge for motivating the community to become more visible in society, to come out of the closet. From 2005 to 2009, the human narrative became a pivotal space for engaging with the lives of LGBT people. Coverage of the HIV Epidemic and Programmatic Response HIV and AIDS and other health messages formed around 7% of the reports from 2005. Reports that focused on the law, gay pride, individual rights and social inclusion also often made reference to the high and increasing HIV prevalence within the MSM and transgender communities, thereby underscoring the need for a public health framework. Media was recognising the extent of marginalization and its impact on HIV prevalence amongst the MSM community and transgender people. It was also providing strong messages on their HIV risk and vulnerability. Most of the messaging emerged as evidence from surveillance reports, UNAIDS estimates, WHO SEARO report, and mapping estimates. Following the Delhi High Court decision in July 2009, 11 news reports and opinion pieces dealt with the health impact of the judgment. Senior health correspondents referred to the impact that the judgement would have on reducing risk of HIV transmission, and strengthening demand for services. News report focusing on the health implications stated that the judgment would reduce the fear among the gay community and enable them to access medical facilities and demand services without fear of reprisal. It was recognised that the challenge lay in convincing people of \u201ca large 71 population of MSM who were fighting increasing incidences of AIDS\u201d, conferred community leaders. There were 35 reports on the Pehchan project launched across India to prevent HIV transmission amongst MSM community and transgender people through community-led efforts. The reports urged the implementation of interventions in remote and rural areas as well. Coverage on Legal Environment About 32% of the news coverage centred on court proceedings.

When the community focused on key issues such as risk reduction, more specific program-centred messages emerged. The events provided opportunity to articulate about different facets of vulnerability reduction. A consistent and planned use of media enabled the community to mainstream vulnerability reduction into the larger framework of state obligations. 1. Reflections from the India case study Any framework to augment media\u2019s role in strengthening discourse around MSM and transgender people\u2019s situation in India has to be ensconced in the international, national and sub-national response that emerged over the years. Additionally, the framework needs to be developed through a series of emerging practices that enabled community leaders and media professionals alike to understand what worked for them. In India, three critical factors form the basis of response on men having sex with men (MSM) and transgender people (TG) \u2013 firstly, the emergence of community leaderships, secondly, a favourable judicial climate and lastly, a strong HIV prevention programme that articulated the need for a rights-based and community-led approach. It is argued by media experts and activists that these factors contributed greatly to the shift in media discourse which helped engagement of civil society stakeholders around homosexuality, rights and HIV prevention as part of a larger health response for the community. A strong community-based movement for rights of gays and better access to health care and HIV prevention, care and support services laid the foundation in the late 90\u2019s. This was accompanied by the judicial intervention on the law impacting gays, and from 2006 to 2009, there was considerable debate which etched out the responsibility of the Government to uphold and support the health, human rights and freedom of the gay community. The central argument [in the petition by Naz Foundation (India) Trust] was that Section 377 of India Penal Code (IPC) posed a structural barrier to HIV outreach efforts amongst MSM preventing them from accessing prevention and treatment services. From 2010, this discussion was renewed in the Supreme Court. The HIV sentinel surveillance of 2007 estimated that prevalence amongst MSM was 7.41% and eleven states were indicating prevalence higher than 5% amongst the MSM population. The third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP-III) emphasised the need for increased attention to MSM and a strategy was outlined to develop HIV prevention Narrative Report Focused Programme Actions Magnify Articulations on MSM and Transgender Persons\u2019 Issues: Reflections from India A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 72 programmes for transgender persons and MSM populations (including male sex workers). There was an articulation for a strongly gendered and rights approach in the context of the HIV response. Despite the recognition of risk and vulnerability of MSM and the accompanying programme scale up since the launch of the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP III), research findings and community voices continued to point out that the national response was not working at optimum. Budgets in under-targeted interventions were inadequate to meet costs of essential commodities such as water based lubricants. This coincided with the emergence of a group of community leaders who were articulating the need for stronger community involvement in the national HIV program. At the international level, the Global Fund was articulating a targeted HIV funding strategy that was centred on key populations including MSM. This led to the largest ever in-country awards for HIV prevention among sexual minorities.205 By 2009, states such as Tamil Nadu and to a lesser extent Karnataka began to acknowledge the need to include transgender people in social welfare schemes and entitlements. As this engagement framework and detailed case study indicate, media was slowly but surely reflecting these concerns. Amidst the vast number of news reports on the HIV epidemic in India, the spiralling epidemic trend amongst MSM emerged as a key issue. This was reported in great detail along with the high levels of stigma jeopardising", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08f0b593-ae27-484d-9fc2-8e20b2b11c2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "08f0b593-ae27-484d-9fc2-8e20b2b11c2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b3e4b3ec2de8b9cd12ef50c9cc687a6308a54e63f40278a743474acead323bf"}}, "hash": "0b3e4b3ec2de8b9cd12ef50c9cc687a6308a54e63f40278a743474acead323bf", "text": "access to these communities. In fact from 2007, media was actively reporting stories of couples being rejected by families and communities or facing violence because of their sexual orientation. UN agencies, NACO and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recognised gaps in the national response and responded by scaling up efforts under NACP-III to address these. At the same time, community leaders were also acting as vital counter points within this discourse raising concerns about the quality of services and the continuing stigma that prevented access. News reports noted the importance of community engagement to promote service uptake amongst hidden populations. Media played a crucial role in drawing attention to the inexorable links between high HIV risk, stigma and violence through narratives rather than just statistics and data. News reports and detailed features began highlighting peer-led service delivery, motivating and influencing MSM to visit drop-in centres, avail voluntary counselling and testing facilities and undergo STI and testing referral services. These were often accompanied by mention of community efforts to respond to violence faced by peers. The legal debate around Section 377 IPC, which centrestaged and sometimes overtook the health debate pertaining to the community, had a salutary impact on the media discourse in many ways. Firstly, it was in recognising the complex linkage between rights, stigma and risk. Following the positive judgment, many reports chose to focus on the road ahead and the challenges that still remained. It was being recognised that while there would be a change in the way police treated the community, the essential struggle still lay in families and friends accepting homosexuality, and until that barrier was breached, homosexuality would remain invisible to a great extent. The large number of stories of \u201ccoming out\u201d, \u201ccoping\u201d, suicides and \u201cpublic gay figures\u201d that was put out in the media reflected a sense of celebration while acknowledging that inclusion remained a trial for many community members. In the case of young adults sharing their confusion in trying to come to terms with their alternate sexuality, the media emphasised on the role of family members, friends, mental health experts and health care providers in bridging gaps. Media not only shaped preventions around the community, de-stigmatising them and enabling greater acceptance, it also played a key role in seeking government accountability towards minority rights. It went through a maze of issues to communicate the essential dilemmas - that bigotry, stigma and discrimination and violence diminishing the enjoyment of basic rights by sexual minorities was unacceptable - and sought accountability from the government in addressing these. Secondly, HIV within the community was unacceptably high and was being fuelled by a complete absence of rights, criminalization and stigma by health care providers. Thirdly, following decriminalization a more holistic approach was needed towards the gay community \u2013 an approach 73 that would encompass access to sensitive health care, acceptance of new thoughts within jurisprudence to extend the principle of inclusion and accommodate gays in every aspect of social life, and a more inclusive social fabric which respected their identity and right to privacy. 2. Environment Key milestones impacting the rights and vulnerability discourse of MSM and transgender people in the Indian scenario are: A. Legal environment In 2006, the Supreme Court held that the 140-year old penal law (Section 377 IPC) merited a more considered scrutiny and asked the Delhi High Court, which had dismissed an appeal by Naz Foundation, to consider the matter afresh. Naz Foundation (India) Trust had filed a petition before the Delhi High Court seeking the reading down of Section 377 of the India Penal Code (IPC) on the grounds that it posed a structural barrier and prevented HIV prevention and care and support services from reaching MSM. From 2006 to 2009, the Delhi High Court heard the case with the Ministries of Health and Home filing affidavits on the government\u2019s stand on the issue. Through the case, the two ministries took contradictory stance in the court leading to much confusion about how the government viewed the issue. The Home Ministry took the stance that Section 377 IPC needed to be retained whereas NACO under the Ministry of Health filed an affidavit stating that the law was a hindrance to HIV prevention efforts across the country. Further, the Ministry of Health took the stand that the Section violated the right of MSM to dignity, privacy and equality. Activists, civil society organisations and community representatives came together and formed Voices Against 377. In a landmark judgment, the Delhi High Court overturned the 140 year old section, de- criminalizing consensual homosexual activities between adults. \u201cThe essence of the section", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ef690e5-efb0-4cd6-b88f-ad680143b73f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ef690e5-efb0-4cd6-b88f-ad680143b73f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7a81b46028f445fc0981b4b07079d63bd2b1a39ce92012ee775ff2296dc2318"}}, "hash": "d7a81b46028f445fc0981b4b07079d63bd2b1a39ce92012ee775ff2296dc2318", "text": "goes against the fundamental right of human citizens\u201d, stated the High Court while striking it down. In a 105-page judgment, a bench of Chief Justice Ajit Prakash Shah and Justice S Murlidhar said that if not amended, Section 377 of the IPC would violate Article 14 of the Indian constitution, which states that every citizen has equal opportunity of life and is equal before law.206 The days following the judgment saw some of the highest visibility ever provided to the gay issue. Presence on public domain ranged from splashes across media outlets to discussions on social media, celebrations and advertisements. Predictably, high visibility to the verdict led to a more organised opposition. Over 16 religious organisations argued that the judgment was an antithesis of India\u2019s cultural fabric and would result in erosion of moral and social values. Through 2010 and 2011, legal interventions supporting the Naz judgment were filed by Minna Saran and 18 other parents of LGBT persons, Sekhar Seshadri and 12 other mental health professionals, Nivedita Menon and 15 other academics, film director Shyam Benegal, and Ratna Kapur, Babu Matthew and other law academics. After initially opposing the Delhi High Court judgment, the Government of India decided not to file any appeal against the Delhi High Court\u2019s verdict, stating, \u201cin so far as [Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code] criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults in private [before it was struck down by the High Court] was imposed upon Indian society due to the moral views of the British rulers.\u201d In February and March 2012, the Supreme Court heard arguments from the various parties and reserved the matter for judgment. The judiciary also intervened to protect the rights of employment of gay people. An Allahabad High Court judgement in 2010 gave interim relief to a professor suspended from Aligarh Muslim University because of his sexual orientation. The court upheld the right to privacy argument and observed, \u201cthe right to privacy is a fundamental right which needs to be protected and unless the conduct of a person, even if he is a teacher, is going to affect and has substantial nexus with his employment, it may not be treated as misconduct.\u201d Focused Programme Actions Magnify Articulations on MSM and Transgender Persons\u2019 Issues: Reflections from India A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 74 Over these years, the judiciary also upheld the rights of transgender people. The Supreme Court in 2012 passed interim orders calling upon the Government to ensure opportunities and basic entitlements for transgender people such as voter ID, passport, driving license, ration card and admission to education institutions. B. National HIV programme for MSM and transgender people The HIV sentinel surveillance of 2007 estimated that at a national level the prevalence amongst MSM was 7.41% and eleven states were showing rates of prevalence higher than 5% among the MSM population. By 2009 it was estimated that 1.7% of all HIV infections were related to sex between men. The third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP-III) emphasised the need for increased attention to MSM and a strategy was outlined to develop HIV prevention programmes for transgender persons and MSM populations (including male sex workers). The main components of the interventions included behaviour change communication through outreach education and counselling, condom promotion and distribution; TSI referral and treatment, HIV testing and care and support through referral services; and, creation of an enabling environment within which the programme could operate unhindered. The NACP-III strategy centred on investing in community based organisations as a key strategy to respond to the epidemic and ensure coverage of around 60% of the total MSM population. This articulation led to scaled up interventions from 2007 to prevent HIV amongst men having sex with men across India. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) was also communicating with the Ministry of Home to repeal Section 377 IPC. Despite the scale up, gaps in the national response were being recognised (WHO, 2010). These included the continued high rates of STI prevalence, inadequate supply of commodities such as condoms and lubricants and inconsistent condom usage in commercial and non-commercial male and female partner settings. In 2007, Government HIV prevention programmes for MSM were initiated in 30 sites. This was expanded across 131 sites by the end of 2009207 reaching out reportedly to a population of over 275000 MSM, thus indicating coverage of 78% of the total MSM population (NACO, 2009). Simultaneously, the Avahan programme supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had launched a similar programme on scale and was intervening among roughly 27% of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea16e1cd-b50e-4c77-8cff-5bd5882503ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea16e1cd-b50e-4c77-8cff-5bd5882503ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b32a92d088d99722af0d19016c4d535749591630b84e1a98e247351ba62bd7e1"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4cc7555-f79a-4861-a451-f341f8451d3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f6b986de7cdaa7544a20430dc151cb5abd1a21b7aaf33a4449b6fb6d236f6ff"}}, "hash": "12748160e75642000feb214bae6b82bd94477978a803e0b01987c5bca7a9e4c4", "text": "the MSM population (2006) in the four high prevalence states. This was scaled up to 70% by the end of 2009 (BMGF, 2010)208. By 2007, there were community leaders who were concerned that despite the programme scale up, community efforts were not getting adequate funding. This core group comprising of gay activists such as Ashok Row Kavi, Vivek Anand, Pawan Dhall and Aditya Bandopadhyay forged a common understanding that MSM communities need to be equal partners in the country\u2019s HIV response. This to a great extent was echoing the Global Fund strategy that appropriate targeting of HIV funds amongst marginalised populations such as MSM was crucial to the success of HIV responses. It was emphasised that key populations faced \u201csignificant\u201d vulnerability to HIV transmission as a result of high risk behaviour, poor coverage by HIV and health services, criminalization and social marginalization. Consequently, the Global Fund\u2019s Sexual Orientation and Gender Identities (SOGI) Strategy, agreed to in May 2009, called on government and technical and civil society partners at country level to strengthen their focus on HIV-related vulnerabilities of people who are marginalised due to sexual orientation, gender identity, or consensual sexual behaviours. This understanding, combined with research indicating high levels of risk for MSM populations in India and the persistent advocacy of the core group, led to the grant of the funds under Round 9, which is the single largest country grant on HIV response for vulnerable sexual minorities. The Pehchan initiative is an ambitious programme seeking to reach 450000 MSM and transgender people and build capacities of 200 community organisations across 17 states by the end of 2015. Central to the Pehchan programme are initiatives to strengthen community systems and community mobilization approaches - seen as essential strategies for effective HIV prevention within key populations. 75 Along with a basic package of clinical services and commodities for safe sex, the three large scale interventions focused on strengthening responses to violence faced by community, and advocated with stakeholders such as government departments for entitlements, police for reducing harassment and violence and media for strengthening mainstream inclusion. By the end of the third phase of the National AIDS Program, it was estimated that there was a 70 fold increase in the coverage of MSM and transgender populations. C. Emerging community movement Community organisations such as Humsafar Trust (1994) and Sangama (1999) were some of the earliest to recognise the challenge and contradictions to mainstreaming concerns of gay people in India209. Notwithstanding the lack of spaces for the community on public domain, they recognised the urgency of HIV prevention and support services for this invisible population. In order to change mindsets and policy, the efforts of Sangama, Humsafar and later on Sahodaran focused on ensuring visibility as a key factor. \u201cOne cannot take the issue forward if there is no visibility. It is difficult to mainstream,\u201d asserted Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar Trust. In the early years, encouraging people to visit the drop-in centres was difficult and visibility had to be given up to ensure that the community could visit the centre freely.210 At the state level also the emergence of organisations like Sahodaran (Chennai, 1998) and Suraksha (Hyderabad, 2004) enabled the community gain visibility. \u201cOur initial efforts were only to provide spaces for people to speak and share and get over the confusion of being different,\u201d explained Jaya of Sahodaran. Across India some of the groups that were offering HIV prevention and support services included Naz Foundation (India) Trust, Humsafar Trust (Mumbai), and Social Welfare Association for Men (Chennai). Recognising the need to build a broader advocacy platform, community collectives were brought together in 2003 to form the Indian Network for Sexual Minorities (INFOSEM).211 Community-based organisations were also responsible for running nearly 65% of the total HIV prevention interventions amongst MSM and transgender populations. Along with another coalition, MANAS Bangla based in West Bengal, these networks emerged as focal points to undertake policy advocacy with the government and other stakeholders. In fact, the policy and operational guidelines for interventions for MSM for the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP-III) were developed with the active support and intervention of these networks.

The rallying point for the early marches in 2005 was to call for the repeal of Section 377 following which numerous parades were held by communities. However, in 2008 the first ever national gay pride march was organised across Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai. The rallying point for thousands of activists, community members and common people was the repeal of Section 377. Using the gay pride, community leaders sought to engage and educate media and the general public on Section 377 and its impact on the community. By 2009, the gathering momentum of the Focused Programme Actions Magnify Articulations on MSM and Transgender Persons\u2019 Issues: Reflections from India A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 76 gay pride parades and the impact it was making became evident when an appeal was filed in the Delhi High Court in 2009 asking for the rallies to be stopped. A notable initiative in strengthening visibility of the community was the coalition, Voices Against 377. It was formed in 2004 by 12 progressive organisations to articulate and strengthen a unified voice against Section 377 IPC. Using initiatives such as the Million Voices campaign, rallies, debates and consultations, the coalition attempted to reach out to a broad spectrum of civil society groups including activists, NGOs, student bodies, medical practitioners, lawyers and media to put forth diverse opinions of sexuality as a response to Section 377 as well as to counter myths and taboos relating to sexuality. The open letter of support in 2006 written to the President of India, its Parliament and the judiciary by a galaxy of influential Indians including writers, academicians, actors, economists, social activists and media people was a powerful call to end the discrimination and abuse faced by gay and bisexual men and women. The letters made a strong argument against curbing of human freedom. Over the years, celebrities such as cine stars Celina Jaitley and Rahul Bose and designers Suneet Varma and Rohit Bal began to actively campaign for gay rights and became associated with the movement. E. Community and media partnerships Across the country, media supported the movement for strengthening rights of the gay community. Since 2008, reports have appeared on a range of related issues quoting a galaxy of voices from political, intellectual and legal realms. Media engagement enabled better understanding and helped position the issue of homosexuality on public domain, even cajoling some of the most reluctant and conservative bastions of society to take a stand on protecting the community against vulnerabilities and rights abuses. There is consensus among MSM and transgender community representatives interviewed as part of this assignment that coverage of their issues on media has undergone a sea change compared to early 2000s when the focus was on sensationalising the community, in particular the transgender people. Often, these forms of reporting caused further harm and resulted in the community preferring to remain hidden.214 Manohar and Ashok Row Kavi agree that early on when they began engaging media on community issues it was not supportive. According to Ashok, this was due to the \u201cinvisibility of the community\u201d which led to speculative and wild reports on their \u201cunnatural behaviour\u201d. Partly, the community could be held responsible for this disconnect. Rex, an MSM activist who worked with Sangama in the initial years, states that the fear and confusion over their identity forced gay people to stay underground.215 On the part of the media, lack of information and myths surrounding the community\u2019s life style, coupled with the evidence on high HIV prevalence, confounded perceptions about the community. Early responses to address these were initiated by activists individually and as part of collectives like Naz International, Humsafar Trust and Sangama who sought to build a more focused media engagement with the concerns of the community. They used varying strategies to encourage media to engage with the issues and write about these. It became evident that each of these collectives or CBOs had its own idea of a workable strategy of engaging media with very few having a cohesive, well thought out and consistent approach of engagement. \ufffd For instance, Humsafar Trust led by Ashok Row Kavi from the initial days focused on sensitising media about the community. Ashok stated, \u201cOur approach", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20601651-508e-4a51-8277-ea8cfa909911": {"__data__": {"id_": "20601651-508e-4a51-8277-ea8cfa909911", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf000da847c9bec6304eeaed50426867701281f2dd392dd654e301e2eed71bd1"}}, "hash": "cf000da847c9bec6304eeaed50426867701281f2dd392dd654e301e2eed71bd1", "text": "was two pronged - focus on broad sensitisation workshops using the rights discourse for journalists. The discussion on HIV vulnerability came a little later when prevention programmes began. Bombay Dost served the purpose of reaching out to the MSM community. It was a head- on approach to get the community together, with discussions on sexuality and sexual orientation.\u201d 77 \ufffd Sangama worked intensively to highlight violations and violence and engaged with senior journalists. 216 \ufffd Samraksha Society (Hyderabad) initially decided to keep away from the media for fear of backlash that the gay community may face. However, over a period of time they began to selectively work with a few senior journalists sensitive to issues of marginal communities.217 \ufffd Individual stories of triumph by community representatives helped shape the human narrative. Transgender people such as Laxmi Tripathi, Rose and Kalki were part of these initiatives.218 \ufffd In 2005-06, transgender communities working on HIV prevention in Tamil Nadu began systematic efforts to engage media in partnership with Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR). From 2006 to 2009, nearly 65 events and anniversaries were organised by the TAI Vizhudugal community. \ufffd Some of these events were community festivals such as the annual Koovagam festival (annual transgender week celebrations) attended by transgender people from across India. Others were peer conventions, talent shows and cultural events. These events were accompanied by media briefings, one- to-one media interactions and visits to CBO intervention sites. Media teams were organised to visit the annual festivals. Trained community leaders used the opportunity to interact with media and share how they were reaching out to their peers with HIV prevention messages, motivate adoption of safe sex practices and deliver healthcare services. They also shared about community efforts at seeking government entitlements and social security schemes. \ufffd Over the four year period, 103 journalists visited the Koovagam festival and witnessed efforts of the transgender people. 219 \ufffd In Karnataka, MSM and transgender community organised a state media consultation in partnership with CFAR in 2008 for journalists from the district media. There was a perception that, unlike the state media based out of Bangalore, the district and rural media were handicapped by the lack of information and \u201chuman face\u201d. MSM in districts and sub districts were not comfortable sharing with media. They feared that their identities would be revealed. 30 district reporters gathered for a two day workshop where the legal scenario, rights of the community and the on-going HIV response was shared and discussed. Representatives of MSM community took the opportunity to engage with media. Site visits to the drop-in centres run by Sangama were arranged for media. They had a chance to observe first- hand the involvement of the community in providing a healthy environment for their peers. Community members interacting with media also had an opportunity to understand the limitations of rural and district reporters and the need to tailor messages. \ufffd CBOs in Maharashtra such as Samapathik Trust partnered with CFAR to organise state and sub-state level media sensitisations in Maharashtra in 2008. State level events sensitised select print and electronic media practitioners on the issues of the MSM and provided them with information on the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme and the scaled up response to HIV. Following an introductory discussion on \u2018Media responsibility in reporting on HIV and AIDS and the MSM community\u2019, other sessions were aimed at giving information on NACP-II and NACP-III, sexual identities and the role of the MSM community in managing the HIV response. Resource persons drawn from institutions like National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) and community organisations such as Samapathik Trust enriched the discussions.

They had also attended previous HIV and AIDS orientations. The 72 participating journalists got to know the state response to HIV, the district scenarios and implementation challenges on the ground. Journalists learned about the contribution of the MSM community in HIV prevention work. The session on MSM was handled by members of the Samabhavana Trust. \ufffd In Andhra Pradesh, MSM CBOs such as Darpan Foundation and Samraksha Society reached out to media in partnership with CFAR and organised the first state media consultation on community issues.

Representatives of state level CBOs, Suraksha Society and Darpan Foundation supported by Sangama, highlighted the lack of an enabling environment. The exercise in media engagement was seen as a crucial step for the CBOs as it helped the community gain support of the state media. The state consultation and the rally led to a strong coverage of around 86 news reports of which only 1 report portrayed the community in a negative light. Through the media consultations in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, an attempt was made to engage media with MSM community concerns and share about the community\u2019s contributions in the HIV prevention work. This was a significant first step given that very little had been reported or written about the community\u2019s meaningful work on ground. The sub-state consultations helped the district media with insights into the issue, understand the state level programme and get introduced to the challenges of the community. The broad perspective provided in the consultations was aimed at bettering representation of the district and grassroots HIV responses on local media. These interactions used fact sheets on epidemic evidence, peer role in motivating community members adopt safe behavioural practices and encouraging condom use and profiles and sketches of MSM and transgender people from small towns and districts who were fighting stigma to shape their professional spaces. Narratives interspersed with data showcased the impact of peer-led strategies on encouraging young male and transgender people visit community health centre with confidence, interact with peers and learn about better health practices. These formal and informal strategies adopted by the community exposed senior and mid level beat reporters to the complexities of issues and the extent of marginalization faced by the community. Such interactions with community proved invaluable for some journalists who were constrained by the absence of credible information, and enabled them write on the isolation faced by sexual minorities. Many of these aimed to help the community negotiate concerns of being \u201cousted\u201d220. For others, such interactions helped to shape stories around stigma and discrimination and the absence of rights.221 The evidence and narratives availed reporters with sharp messages and helped them raise critical issues222. Many journalists also battled with the need to balance information in reports with ensuring dignity and confidentiality of community sources. \u201cOne drawback while covering issues related to this community (MSM and transgender people) is the need to sensitively handle the information and to keep their identities hidden. Newspapers want verifiable aspects of the information provided, such as what the source is doing or where they live. It may cause trouble for the source. Unwitting revelation of information strains our contact with the source for later follow ups or exploration of other story angles. Many reporters feel challenged to balance generating enough reader interest through a story and not harming the community.\u201d - L Subramani, Senior Sub Editor and Senior Correspondent, Deccan Herald. 79 Support within newsrooms formed an important aspect of how stories was approached and framed. Supportive newsrooms were few and far between in the early days. This resistance got negotiated by reporters seeking to focus on complexities affecting the gay community223. It often led to conscious decisions by reporters to tailor community issues differently so as to wrest available media spaces.224 Not surprisingly, in the context of India, journalists also reflected on overcoming media fatigue shrouding the issue and constantly sought ways to hold reader interest by fashioning reports varyingly. There was a constant search for \u2018different angles\u2019 within an overall commitment to remain sensitive on the issue. Thus, with new topics competing for readership, journalists were often trying to reinvent spaces. 3. Mapping coverage \u2013 content analysis (CFAR, 2013) Coverage on the issue is marked by an intense phase during the three years around the Delhi High Court judgement decriminalising homosexuality (2008 - 2010).

However, by the end of 2008, it was evident that media both national and in the states had taken note of a vital debate impacting a significant minority in India (CFAR, 2013)225. This high volume media coverage at the national and state level was maintained until 2010, the year following the Delhi High Court judgement. There was a gradual fall in media interest thereon. Interestingly, the three year period from 2008 to 2010 accounted for 64% of total media coverage between 2005 and 2012, and provided space even for peripheral community issues to emerge.

The gay pride rallies which were initiated by LGBT groups from 2008 also became a key source of information (16.5%) and news about the community. The \u201ccolourful\u201d visual and anecdotal nature of the community, as senior journalist Vikram Doctor described, was ideal for media and presented numerous opportunities for being picked up in long and short media formats. A. Media Engagement with the Enabling Environment Negative reports Pushkin Chandra murder (23 reports) - The Pushkin murder in 2004 opened a hitherto closed area for the national media. HT (Gay community grows in city, August 16, 2004) took the opportunity to link the growing incidence of HIV and AIDS in the country with homosexuality. It also linked homosexual activity to child abuse. Senior columnists such as Swapan Dasgupta (The problem is not homosexuality, August 23, 2004) also highlighted the global concern over child pornography and the pornography allegedly found in the murder victim\u2019s apartment to draw the conclusion that there was a \u201csystematic assault on family values\u201d against which ordinary and decent people were wary of speaking out. Community protest against vilification was picked up by a few newspapers. Few balanced articles emerged during this period. Notable amongst these were Avijit Ghosh (How Gay is their world, August 22, 2004) and Suveen Sinha (The nowhere men, Outlook 2004) which wrote on the challenges faced by gay community. One of the more balanced expressions came in an article by Nina Martrys in the Times Of India 21, August 2004 where she suggested that visibility is a double edged sword, indicating that the greater the visibility on media, higher would be the \u201cmetro\u2019s latent homophobia\u201d. At the state level, criminal activities of transgender persons and MSM were reported. In Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and to a lesser extent in Maharashtra and Karnataka, number of reports on communities\u2019 (especially the transgender people) criminal activities gradually increased to around 116 reports in 2010. These were mostly in the language newspapers (405 reports 2005 - 2010). Such reports were much lesser at the national level (32 news reports).

Between 2005 and 2008, 41 incidents (63 news reports) of lesbians eloping, marrying, 81 being asked to leave their homes, seeking court\u2019s protection and committing suicide emerged from small towns such as Meerut (UP), Chaibasa (Jharkhand), Chindwada (MP), Hoshiarpur and Amritsar (Punjab), and Koraput (Orissa) across the country. While articles highlighted couples wanting to live together or marry, they also began to draw attention to the public humiliation, social pressure bought on such couples and social and religious intolerance226. At the same time, these incidents were used to underscore the need for a change in social attitude.227 At the state level, reports began emerging from 2005- 06 on the pervasive violence faced by transgender and MMS communities. Initially, these reports were from Tamil Nadu (38 reports in 2005). By 2006, similar reports emerged from Maharashtra (29) Karnataka (11) and Andhra Pradesh (7). Stories of violence faced by gay people also became common in newspapers. [When gays get stalked and robbed, Times of India, 22 June 2008; Hatred hurts as much as hate crime, DNA, 25 December 2008]. In the period from 2005 to 2012, 73 news reports tracked in the national newspapers underlined the extensive and pervasive violence faced by the gay and transgender communities both within homes and in public spaces. Reported forms of violence ranged from being thrown out of homes or workplaces to beating, rape and murder owing to sexual orientation. Organisations such as Sangama in Bangalore reached out to media extensively with stories of consistent violence faced by gay and transgender communities. They found that irrespective of differing views on homosexuality, media found the level of abuse, violence and discrimination faced by the community as unacceptable. Interviews we conducted with journalists (including with L. Subramanium, Y Maheshwar Reddy and Yogesh Pawar) confirmed that these narratives of extreme abuse at all levels often struck a chord with journalists who began to focus on the need for greater protection for vulnerable communities. While most reports of stigma and discrimination focused on violence and isolation and the need for society to reconcile its cultural attitudes, some also harped on its impact on the health of the community. In fact almost all the news reports in 2008 and 2009 that highlighted the HIV and AIDS epidemic within the MSM and transgender community referred to the stigma and discrimination as a key challenge in motivating the community to come out. Highlighting injustice - arrest of gay people, Lucknow, 2006 (20 news reports) The arrest of four gay people on charges of running a \u201cgay club\u201d in January 2006 sparked a nationwide debate and was reported widely by newspapers (20 news reports). According to many activists, the episode itself and media coverage sparked debate on how criminalization of homosexuality was impacting health outcomes. The reports were important for two reasons. Firstly, for the strong messaging that emerged on separation of the public and private spheres. Secondly, it highlighted the contradiction shrouding the government\u2019s health agenda which on the one hand had service provision for MSM and on the other criminalised the same community.228 The issue found support in statements from international bodies such as UNAIDS and Human Rights Watch. These imparted the necessary seriousness to the issue which could no more be set aside merely as a lifestyle of a few people.229 Journalists also realised the importance of the statements against the background of the HIV epidemic.230 Removal of Aligarh Muslim University professor, 2010 (19 reports) In 2010, strong and supportive media coverage around the suspension, legal struggle and eventual death of a gay professor of Aligarh Muslim University to a large extent indicated the shift in media perception of the critical issues of rights of marginalised communities. The media discourse (19 reports) focused heavily on the right to privacy of all individuals and concerns over its invasion.231 Even as the university attempted to defend its decision to remove the professor (14 quotes), activists strongly argued against the invasion of individual privacy and the blatant violations of dignity that occurred (18 quotes).

Similarly, the first open gay royalty emerged as an icon for a community searching for well known figures to \u201clegitimize\u201d their identity (27 articles, across 5 years). Since 2005, media tracked his everyday life from being disowned to eventually accepted, the UNAIDS award 2006, knighthood in 2007 by Greece to the opening in 2009 of an old age home for homosexual couples thrown out by families. Media was recognising his iconic role in centrestaging the gay discourse in India and internationally.232 In their reports and opinion columns, senior media people took note of the attitude change that was emerging among the creative artists and intellectuals and acknowledged the importance of normalising gay people and recognising their privacy. [Vir Sanghvi, Hindustan Times, 16 September 2009; Repeal this law, Deccan Herald, 22 September 2009; What\u2019s law got to do with it?, Shohini Ghosh, 20 September 2006, Indian Express; Gay and Happy, Deccan Herald, 28 October 2006, L. Subramani]. From 2005 to 2009, the human narrative became a crucial space for engaging with the lives of gay people (108 articles including reports and features). Using events such as the gay pride, more stories of professionals coming out with their gay identity began to emerge across newspapers. Gay prides and media coverage National newspapers put out 53 news reports on the first ever gay parades in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Kolkata. In 2010, 68 news reports were tracked from national newspapers writing about the gay prides in Delhi and Mumbai on the occasion of the first anniversary of the 377 judgement. State newspapers in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Mumbai extensively wrote about the gay prides (65 news reports). Media tracking figures indicate that approximately 17% of the total news reports on the MSM and transgender issues related to the coverage of gay prides and rallies. It is essential to emphasize the importance of this space in terms of the Indian media reporting on LGBT issues. The space expanded over 2008 and 2009 when rallies became an arena for common people to gather and express their solidarity with gay rights. Secondly, as is evident from the messages below, reports emerging from gay pride rallies were not just about celebration, but about articulating the aspirations of a hitherto invisible community. In the period from 2009 to 2012, the community gradually began to draw attention to the stigma and violence faced by it (32% of total messages tracked \u2013 Table 4). Post the High Court judgment, greater emphasis was placed on the need for policies that would help the community negotiate rights violations in work spaces and in employment and inclusion on the government role in ensuring socio-economic security and entitlements (16% of total messages). 83 Table 4: Messages from gay pride rallies 2009 2011 2012 Number of news reports 35 60 47 Government stand on homosexuality is problematic 67 Data sought by Supreme Court will not help / will further stigmatise gay community 20 Effective response to HIV epidemic/ Help respond to risky practices and access interventions to be accessed freely 7 47 11 Stigma and Discrimination - More acceptance from family and society after judgment but stigma continues and more substantive rights need to be assured in the coming period to fight stigma (parenting, property, marriage, adoption) 70 58 26 Arguments against decriminalizing homosexuality 3 19 More measures need to be taken for social inclusion 8 73 Other legal cases/ High Court decision discussion 22 47 Total 110 225 143 Table 5: HIV and AIDS reports Main issue covered by news report on MSM, transgender persons 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 TOTAL Four States 2 21 24 96 57 31 23 20 260 National 6 11 10 31 16 3 88 20 185 Total 8 32 34 127 73 34 111 40 B. Coverage of the Epidemic and Programmatic Response Reports focused on HIV and AIDS and health messages formed around 7% of the total news reports tracked from 2005.

It was also providing strong messages on HIV risk and vulnerability of the MSM and transgender population. Data emerging from the WHO-SEARO report on the epidemic and high incidence amongst the population was reflected in a large number of the reports. Out of the 254 messages analysed, 57% of the messages were on the number of MSM population in India and the risk of HIV on account of the invisibility, isolation and stigma. While 23 messages focused on the official estimates on MSM and transgender persons, 48 messages shared epidemiological information on increasing prevalence amongst the MSM population. About 28% of the messages focused on programmes and services being accessed by the community and 11% focused on safe sex practices. Focused Programme Actions Magnify Articulations on MSM and Transgender Persons\u2019 Issues: Reflections from India A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 84 A sample of 80 news reports from 2011 and 2012 on HIV was picked for analysis. From the 185 messages tracked, 39 messages emphasised on the number of identified MSM in India and the challenges in identifying the population for health interventions due to high levels of stigma. The risk posed by the lack of regular condom use was explored on varying counts including low ability to negotiate with partners or non availability of condoms (5 messages). NACO\u2019s efforts to develop specific interventions for the MSM and transgender populations and cater to their specific needs emerged quite sharply. Most messaging emerged from surveillance reports, UNAIDS estimates, the WHO-SEARO report and mapping estimates. UN and NACO officials were quoted most extensively in highlighting the challenges of intervening in a stigmatised population. Few community voices emerged in these reports. Table 6 Key messages relating to HIV and AIDS Key Messages \u2013 HIV in stories on MSM/ transgender persons 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Total Risk faced by the MSM community 2 13 20 58 30 23 146 Condom/ Prevention 0 4 1 4 4 2 17 STI reduction 0 3 2 5 2 1 13 Blood safety/ Donation 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 Program measures \u2013 ICTC, VCTC, motivating community to access 0 6 22 27 12 5 72 Reaching out to other service providers 1 4 5 The gay pride was also used to present messages on the impact that de-criminalising homosexuality would have on the HIV response. Out of the 478 messages emerging from a sample of 142 news reports around the gay pride from 2009 to 2012, 68 messages stressed on risky practices which continued due to stigma despite the judgment and on the need to strengthen access to treatment for transgender and MSM populations. (Table 4) Reporting on the Pehchan programme Thirty five (35) reports tracked were on the Pehchan project launched across India to prevent HIV transmission amongst MSM and transgender people through community-led efforts. These contained strong messages on the intervention in remote and rural areas and the use of initiatives such as community radio, static clinics and partnership with the link worker scheme in rural areas. The reports stated that the strength of the initiative was the partnership between the government and existing community systems233. Best practices emerging through these partnerships were highlighted. For instance, the helpline to assist individuals struggling with their identity was highlighted in Chennai, Tamil Nadu and recounted experiences of people who had benefited from the counselling [Help lines to the aid of those struggling with sexual identity, The Hindu, 11 November 2011]. An analysis of 56 messages emerging from a sample of 26 reports from Hyderabad found strong focus on the community-centric components of the intervention (25% messages). A large segment of the reports urged stakeholders including the police and railway authorities to respond in a more emphatic manner, take measures to reduce the community\u2019s vulnerability to violence and enable access to welfare measures (52% messages). Legal environment and its effect on HIV reporting a. Legal proceedings also provided opportunities to raise contentious issues of access to health care for a significant section of the population. Though coverage from 2005 to 2012 indicates that number of media reports solely on HIV and AIDS amongst MSM and transgender community 85 was significantly lower than that on rights and entitlements, the legal reports consistently reflected the HIV discourse. b.

In the process, reporting on gay community and HIV risk also emerged. A break-up of 27 news reports from national newspapers tracking the legal developments in 2006 reveals that 8 news reports wrote on how Section 377 hampered HIV prevention efforts among MSM. [Sanchita Sharma, \u201cArticle 377 is the biggest hurdle in tackling HIV\u201d, Hindustan Times, 27 September 2006] Jugran Nitin, \u201cThe invisible gay face of AIDS\u201d, Sahara Times strongly referred to the evidence presented in the report, MSM and HIV and AIDS Risk in Asia. c. Even as media began to come to terms with the complexity of gay issues in 2005, journalists were questioning research reports on homosexuality in prison and the government ignoring the recommendations for condom distribution. Activists such as Anjali Gopalan questioned the ambiguous stand of the government which was funding MSM programmes but was unable to reconcile the need for a stronger environment through the review of regressive laws such as 377. [Giving gays their legal rights, The Telegraph, 14 December 2005] At the same time, columnists were also questioning why the debate on rights of the gay community had to subscribe to the high risk of HIV debate to gain acceptance.234 Other commentaries however used the HIV argument to underline that a law was impeding legitimate prevention initiatives and pushing the already spiralling epidemic. [Will Gay marriages be allowed in India, Pratibha Parmar, India Today December 2008]. Anirban Mahapatra pointed out the contradiction between the Ministry of Health running the HIV programme and opposing review of Section 377. He examined the negative impact of the law through aspects like pushing gay people underground and preventing them from reporting violence and abuse. [Giving gays their legal rights, The Telegraph, 14 December 2005, Anirban Mahapatra] d. Two incidents in 2008 and 2011 helped to shape the health arguments with regard to MSM and transgender populations quite sharply on the media domain. In 2008, the Health Minister, Ramadoss called for legalising homosexuality in an effort to combat HIV. 106 news reports were devoted to the need to protect gays and transgender people to ensure that HIV response was more effective. Nineteen (19) news reports highlighted various statistics to emphasize risk of the MSM population.235 Another crucial piece of evidence that was being shared was that 86% of HIV transmission was happening through unprotected sex, including among MSM. Data was quoted from such sources as NACO\u2019s estimates and amFAR\u2019s research (\u2018MSM are 19 times more likely to be infected with HIV\u2019). Seventeen (17) reports highlighted that a strong national response had led to reduction in HIV prevalence and a similar response was needed on war footing to address HIV amongst groups such as MSM. The reports focused on the need to remove structural discrimination against those vulnerable to HIV and strengthen an enabling environment (23 reports). The report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia was quoted stating that unprotected sex was a major determinant of HIV rates. [Law criminalising sex between men must go: Ramadoss, Tribune 2008]. In 2011, the Health Minister Azad\u2019s comment calling homosexuality a disease sparked not just a frenzy of outrage but also a debate on the limited understanding guiding health interventions amongst such key populations. 77 reports tracked the comment by the Minister. Of these, 37 reports underlined the estimates provided by NACO of the number of MSM. UNAIDS Executive Director, Michel Sidibe was extensively quoted emphasising a stigma free environment to ensure successful programme implementation among key populations at higher risk. Data was put out by the UN indicating that over 67% of Focused Programme Actions Magnify Articulations on MSM and Transgender Persons\u2019 Issues: Reflections from India A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 86 the 400,000 strong MSM population was able to access prevention services owing to a strong and progressive AIDS policy [UN hails India\u2019s HIV services to gay, transgender people, Statesman, 12 July 2011]. These statements were picked up by other reports emerging during this period. Newspapers were also quick to point out that the remarks reflected a \u201cremarkable lack of understanding amongst most people on the issue and the perception that MSM is the primary reason for the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in India.\u201d The reports argued that given the continued lack of awareness about the disease, the consequences and steps for prevention, there was little chance of halting the epidemic.

Following the Delhi High Court decision in July 2009, 11 news reports and opinion pieces dealt with the health impact of the judgment. Charles Gilks, Country Coordinator, UNAIDS emphasised that the judgment would enable greater action through the supply of products and services to reduce risk of HIV transmission through gay sex. [The road after section 377, Mint, 12 October 2009]. Senior health correspondents referred to the impact that the judgment would have on reducing risk of HIV transmission and strengthening demand for services. Sanchita Sharma [\u201cBut why aren\u2019t the hijras clapping\u201d, The Hindustan Times, 5 July 2009] stressed on the fact that the significance of the judgment was on its impact on public health for MSM and transgender people. Quoting UN agencies, the report stated that a major impediment to HIV prevention amongst the gay community had been removed with the judgment. Kounteya Sinha [\u201cHC order will help in the HIV battle\u201d, Times of India, 3 July 2009] highlighted that the infection rate amongst the MSM community was 7.4% owing to high prevalence of risky multi partner sex and with limited access to condoms.236 Similarly, other news reports focusing on health implications stated that the judgment would reduce the fear among the gay community and enable them to access medical facilities and demand services without fear of reprisal.237 It was recognised that the challenge lay in convincing people of \u201ca large population of MSM\u2019s who were fighting increasing incidences of AIDS\u201d.238 Reports quoted NACO officials and SACS officials in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab and Rajasthan saying that the judgment was a big push to fighting stigma and enabling better access to services. It highlighted that the fear of legal action had actually prevented NGOs from taking up targeted intervention projects for MSM and transgender populations239. An analysis of 228 quotes from a sample of 100 news reports around the judgment indicates that opinions emerging from activists, UN agency heads, NACO and SACS officials, donors, HIV positive people and gay community representatives saw the far reaching impact of the judgment on HIV policies and programmes for the MSM community and an urgent need to scale up interventions. (29 out of 228 quotes focused on the impact on HIV interventions). f. Analysis of legal reports between 2010 and 2012 indicates that there were fewer spaces being provided to discussing the risk of HIV and the programme response as compared to 2008- 2009. Only 43 HIV messages were tracked out of a total of 346 messages in 118 reports on the law between 2010 and 2012. (Table 7) In comparison, in the run up to the 2009 judgement (July 2009), there were 50 news reports on high incidence of HIV amongst MSM and the challenge of a strong response in the prevailing environment of stigma and discrimination. These had a total of 73 messages. However, reports in 2011 and 2012 continue to strongly reinforce the arguments that the law was hindering an effective response. Interestingly, these arguments were quoted from lawyers and activists and not from government officials. 87 C. Coverage on Legal Environment a. Reports on legal proceedings in the High Court and Supreme Court formed a major portion of news coverage in the six-year period from 2007 to 2012. Roughly 32% of news coverage centred on the proceedings. 606 reports, opinion pieces, guest columns and editorial pieces emerged during this period which shaped the entire discourse on community rights. b. As the content breakup below shows, these legal reports were rich with details of court proceedings with over 50% of the reports dealing with some aspect of the proceedings such as the continued confusion within the government over its stand (both post and pre High Court judgment) and legal options before Naz Foundation and the pro-gay lobby after the High Court judgment. They also noted the impact of the High Court judgment on the gay community and the need for more proactive measures from the government. c. In the run up to the judgement in 2008, most of the reporting was devoted to the affidavits filed by the government and the continued confusion. The Health Ministry stand on section 377 was extensively referred to during this period (2008) owing to the statement of the Health Minister Ramadoss at an HIV conference that the gay community should be legalised to enable HIV prevention measures to be implemented. Following this statement, the differences between the Cabinet Ministers emerged sharply on public domain and this got duly reflected on media.

During this period, 79 news reports raised crucial concerns including the harmful impact on HIV prevention among the MSM community as the cabinet continued to vacillate on issues of morality and social good, stigmatising an entire community as delinquent and criminal, right to privacy amongst adults without state interference, erosion of family values due to homosexuality, gay sex as injurious to health, gay sex leading to HIV and homosexuality as a disease, et. al. Legal reports during this period chose to highlight the confused approach and arguments by the government and were silent on the petitioner\u2019s arguments. [Homosexuality is a vice, says centre, Statesman, 27 September 2008; P.P. Malhotra confirmed that the Centre would \u201cobviously\u201d object to the removal of the law.

The days following the Delhi High Court judgment in July 2009 saw some of the sharpest media reporting on the recognition and triumph of gay rights and greater rights for minorities. To a great extent, reporting in this period brought out the extent to which the Indian media had engaged with and evolved a nuanced understanding of the arguments that emerged since 2004 (when the high court began to hear the public interest litigation). A large segment of news reports wrote extensively about the legal meaning, impact and consequences of the judgment.

It was observed that post-Naz foundation decision, it will be much more difficult to discriminate against vulnerable minorities like dalits and disabled persons. This was raised by many media columnists. For instance, Tarunabh Khaitan, a legal commentator, wrote in The Telegraph: \u2018It may seem that this judgment does not obviously benefit Hemanshu, who is Hindu, English-educated, male, able-bodied, north Indian, straight, Hindi-speaking and upper- caste. But should Hemanshu lose his legs in an accident, or get posted in a non-Hindi speaking or non-Hindu-majority area, he too will be protected. The court has recognised that pluralist societies rarely have permanent majorities or minorities. The Constitution stands for the principle of minority protection, whoever they might happen to be. This should be noted by the ulema and the archbishops who seem to have failed to envision a fellowship of the disenfranchised in their response to the court\u2019s judgment.\u2019 [Good for all minorities, Telegraph, 9 July 2009] An edit in Deccan Herald stated that \u201cthe judgment is an affirmation of the equal rights of sexual minorities.

Media at the same time was also indicating that numerous challenges still remained for the MSM community. Analysis of 228 voices gathered from 100 news reports of the judgement reveals the attempt to articulate the road ahead. Religious organisations across the country were outraged at the verdict that read down section 377 of the Indian penal code and demanded that the government must not legalise homosexuality.

The judgement did not consider the impact of watering down provisions of section 377 on punishments for rape and paedophilia. Reporting on such aspects, media noted, \u201cIt is a sensitive issue, and therefore requires a wider debate. At the time we discussed section 377 from the perspective of a small population it impacted, but now it involves the entire society. The issue needs to be discussed at length.

A key feature of the effort was a close partnership between the state HIV program, organisations implementing the initiative and senior community leaders. The event led to over 80 media reports across newspapers, TV channels and websites. Anecdotal evidence of the impact of one such coverage on the community itself comes from a community representative after a full spread cover story was done by a mass circulation Telugu language daily Andhra Jyothi. He states that the supportive and informative nature of the article helped to mobilize the target audience. Similarly in 2008, NGOs based in Karnataka - Samara, Sangama, Suraksha, Sadhane, Samara - partnered with CFAR on the occasion of the World AIDS Day and 15 journalists were selected for a briefing. Community representatives used the opportunity to speak about the myths and misconceptions surrounding these communities and the media was equally appreciative of the community efforts to reach out to them. One- to-one interactions were organised for journalists following the briefing. The resulting coverage (15 news reports) not only supported the struggles of the community to access their rights but also paved the way for increased reporting by these reporters on the growing incidence of HIV amongst MSM and the need for interventions. As a follow up to consistently ensure media partnerships, in 2008, two district level MSM conventions (Dharwad, Bangalore) were used as spaces to encourage media and community interactions. Press conferences organised before the events helped journalists understand the rationale behind the MSM conventions. 25 news reports emerged from these two initiatives which were seen as a watershed in reporting on MSM and transgender issues in the state.240 Focused Program Actions Magnify Articulations on MSM and Transgender Persons\u2019 Issues: Reflections from India A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 92 Analysis of reports emerging out of a coordinated community media partnership in Tamil Nadu In Tamil Nadu, between 2005 and 2010, partnership between the community leadership of transgender people and CFAR helped to systematically mobilize media focus on the numerous development concerns faced by the community including response to HIV prevention amongst the community. 40% of the total coverage on transgender people (593 out of 1452) emerged from the partnership. Not only did media coverage on transgender community grow but it also recorded a high percentage of community voices (33% of total voices) and supportive government and political voices (19% of the total voices). Central to this strategy was to continuously harness the community-media partnership through 65 large and small events in the six year period including festivals, anniversaries and rallies. From 2007, a large number of reports were built around the theme of vulnerability reduction (929 out of 1452 reports) and around 8% of the coverage (110 news reports) focused on addressing the risks faced by the transgender community to HIV infection due to stigma and discrimination. An analysis of 65 reports on Koovagam (2006\u20132008) and 74 reports on Aravani Pengal Week (APW) (2008\u20132011) which emerged out of community, media and CFAR partnerships shows that the Koovagam news reports generated 147 messages and the Aravani Pengal Week reports generated 129 messages.

They spoke about the necessity of condom use and sought the support of the public to take forward their condom distribution work at the event. Here, media played a significant role which was evident in the support it voiced to the many risk reduction initiatives taken during the event including urging District Collector and villagers to extend greater support for HIV prevention activities. The events provided opportunity to articulate different facets of vulnerability reduction. This ranged from raising concerns about social exclusion, speaking about practices enabling social inclusion and demanding more consistent access to social entitlements and welfare schemes. Vulnerability reduction messages account for 28.26% of the total messaging, and within it the messaging on social entitlements was distinctly ahead of the other two facets. While messages on risk reduction had to be contextual and crafted in a non-judgmental manner, on vulnerability reduction the challenge was to ensure that the messages were down-to-earth and reflected the rights-based approach. The events were designed to enable spokespersons both from the community and NGOs to message in a convincing manner. They spoke about both rights and responsibilities and even enacted the message by performing some humanitarian service such as planting saplings, etc. to show that even though they are socially marginalised, they are responsible citizens. On social entitlements, the messages were concrete and they not only wanted the government to issue \u201cOrders\u201d but also develop a well formulated implementation plan and the necessary mechanism to ensure that the entitlements reach the community. Although entitlement to ration card, skill development and livelihood schemes and quality education were messaged repetitively, what is significant is the wide range of demands that were made encompassing almost every aspect of governance. This included access to services such as health, legal, grievance redress, shelter, old age home, counselling, marketing facilities, bank loans, a separate social welfare board and declaring a day dedicated for transgender empowerment. A consistent and planned use of media enabled the community mainstream vulnerability reduction into the larger framework of state obligations. Focused Program Actions Magnify Articulations on MSM and Transgender Persons\u2019 Issues: Reflections from India A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 94 Acknowledgements This country case study is shaped by inputs from a variety of community members, media professionals and researchers with whom we interacted during our visit to Kathmandu in March 2013. We would like to dedicate this space acknowledging their valuable participations. Among the individuals who contributed significantly, we are particularly thankful to Sunil Babu Pant, Bhumika Shrestha, Bobby, Umesh, Parshuram, Durga and so many of their colleagues and members at BDS, some of whom also participated in a focus group discussion. Madhav Dulal of Ujyalo FM and journalist, researcher and chronicler Kyle G Knight, besides sharing their responses, were of immense help in facilitating our interactions with local media in Kathmandu. Basu Guragain facilitated our interaction with the young gay members of his organisation Pink Triangle Nepal. Daniel Coyle spared valuable time sharing his experiences of research on facets of social lives of sexual and gender minority groups in Nepal. Of our interactions with media people, we would like to especially mention Keshav Podel of The New Spotlight, Ajay B Khanal of The Himalayan Times, Hari Bahadur Thapa, Gopal Khanal and Atul Mishra of The Kathmandu Post, Ghanshyam Khadag and Sunder Khanal of the Daily Kantipur and Subeena Dutt, former editor of Wave magazine, for their valuable participations. A series of Bandhs affecting public life in Kathmandu disrupted many of our scheduled meetings including those with representatives at the country UN office, the Ministry of Health and with senior journalists like Kunda Dixit and Kanak Mani Dixit. We are as much thankful to our friend Prakash C Nayak who was based at Kathmandu during the period and helped with local logistics along with Ambika Thapa. The LGBT movement in Nepal evolved from being predominantly human rights-centred to being part of a wider socio-political struggle.

Of the 24 media reports documented by BDS and mentioned for the year 2003, 22 stories are centred on human rights violations or social stigmatization, with five mentioning the contexts of HIV and AIDS or SRH. Key Aspects of the LGBT Discourse Although the focus of BDS as the lead LGBT group remained on addressing HIV, the sheer intensities of day-to-day violations faced by LGBT community members seems to have forced a dominantly human rights approach in the way it steered its issues. COUNTRY CASE STUDY 3 NEPAL The MSM and Transgender Persons\u2019 (LGBT) Movement in Nepal: Role and Engagement of Media Executive Summary 95 The fact that on human rights they could engage the media more persistently is testified by how documentation of violations against the community were positioned onto the public domain, which served \u2018as clinching evidence\u2019 used by the court later when it pronounced the historic judgment in 2007-8 stopping all forms of discrimination against sexual and gender minorities. Alongside the human rights focus, some early sensitive reports by media representatives like Kiran Nepal, Sudeshna Sarkar, Sandeep Chakan, etc. are recognised as critical, necessary impetus to creating and strengthening convergence with wider society. Purely from the point of view of communication, such beginnings may have been of strategic long term significance for the issue. Aligning access to HIV prevention with human rights, \u201cBDS was successful in convincing the National AIDS Programme to include men who have sex with men as a key population at higher risk in the National AIDS Strategy.\u201d As it constantly conferred with the media on human rights violations faced by community members, the negative impact on HIV services too were covered. As part of project commitments, BDS leveraged its HIV, AIDS and sexual and reproductive health mandate to focus on strengthening community awareness using a series of community disseminations. It helped strengthen, in particular, the MSM and gay identities, as it advanced HIV education. At the same time, these campaign publications were solely \u2018for-the-community and by-the-community\u2019, and remained detached from the wider public discourses. In the later phase, post the court judgment, BDS addressed the gap by undertaking wider public education through paid programmes on a national television channel and later on FM radio. Structural Barriers Writing on the barriers and biases the community was facing, media tended to mostly use the widely identifiable theme of social injustice rather than highlight the deep-seated structural barriers that were marginalising the community in a far more entrenched manner. Missing was a conscious, informed or strategic effort by the movement and its advocates to deepen media engagement on the issue of structural barriers, particularly in relationships with key stakeholders (including the media) in the post- judgment phase.. More immediately, community disinclination to come out in the open only meant that there were no engaging human interest stories of individual dilemmas, relationships, and family and social negotiations, or the deleterious effect it was having in increasing their vulnerability to all kinds of life-threatening challenges. This disconnect resulted in a virtual absence of any demystification of the issues in the public domain. Surge in Positive Media Coverage The legal milestones attained by the community in 2007-8 catapulted it to the centre stage of public discourse, with media celebrating the historic significance in reclaiming the rights of these communities, world over. Analysis of media reports show that both national and international media continued to report with prominence the significance of this historic development for the next few years. Still, even as the state and legal responses were showing clear signs of positive shifts, discrimination and abuse at the social and structural levels did not show signs of abatement in this period. The hugely positive and aspiration-centred depictions overwhelmed the paltry reporting of continuing struggles for survival and basic civil liberties on the public domain. Key Factors to Success Increased presence of community spokespersons \u2013 From the perspective of the media, the phenomenon of historic recognition of the community\u2019s identity and rights \u2013legal, state and constitutional \u2013was an attractive opportunity for further attention. At the same time, the charm, affability and accessibility of the movement\u2019s pioneer, Sunil Babu Pant, led the media to position him as the quintessential face and champion of the movement, even with continued efforts to position others as \u201cvictims\u201d, change agents or role models.

Advancing citizenship rights \u2013 Parallel to the above, lead champions like Sunil Babu Pant remained keenly conscious of using their political stature to push for institutionalising the mandates for recognition of the community in government and legal processes and policies. Persistence also led to significant actions such as the creation of the National Task Force for Sexual and Gender Minorities and the inclusion of community needs in planning and policy development by other ministries and key agencies. Continued community participation in HIV prevention \u2013 A notable trajectory of community involvement remained at the ground level in the form of the continuing HIV prevention services. Gaps, Challenges and Emerging Lessons Loss of the HIV discourse - The human rights\u2019 path taken by the LGBT movement in Nepal eventually overcame the need for continued attention to HIV prevention, care and treatment. Out of 58 reports on the issue of citizenship rights for the community, for example, only three mentioned the link of such vital rights with the communities need for basic health services, including addressing HIV-related risks. Need to address the persistent concerns - Continued perseverance of the community at the ground level may have done little to change structural responses and biases, as evidenced by a constant flow of local media reports on harassment and resistance to change by local authorities. In the predominantly positive portrayals during the post-judgment and post- gains phases, the media lacked the necessary engagement to demystify and dismantle entrenched resistances to acceptance for the community at social and institutional levels. Sustaining continuity in media engagement - Critically, the leadership\u2019s consuming engagement with negotiating policy discourses in the intervening periods distracted it almost entirely from documenting evidence and sustaining a media trail as it did so successfully in the beginning of the movement (2003- 2008). Media was not prepared by the community for the post-victory scenario, and did not understand nor was able to deconstruct state obligations to help establish supply and demand dynamics. This has particular relevance today as some media persons, a few officials and some disengaged community members have publically challenged the decade-long legacy and leadership of the community. The challenge is severely jeopardising even the basic momentum necessary to keep the LGBT movement apace in the country. The need to have media gate keepers in place has been acknowledged as a clear necessity for the future. Entering the media space to address entrenched biases \u2013 Once again, the community had to take on the role of media in order to address exclusion by media, through the Pahichan programme that was aimed at disseminating LGBT issues. The emphasis has been on reiterating community vulnerabilities, health needs, and HIV risks. No cooperation or active engagement with the outside media is apparent and likely does not exist. Conclusion: A Carefully Nuanced Media Re- engagement to Advance the Rights of MSM and Transgender Persons The evolution of the LGBT movement in Nepal brings out some vital lessons in how it leveraged a popular tide on the public domain and was able to align itself effectively to wrest salient gains for itself. At another level, however, the way media as a key stakeholder was engaged with this evolution and the emerging issues of the community brings out the fact that especially at critical junctures of the evolution process the engagement tended to be selective on the part of the media. As evident, a lack of informed mediation with media may have lead to heightened or loosly founded- expectations, even as media\u2019s engagement may not have invested in necessarily the most critical issue 97 dimensions. While the volume of media reporting and attention to the issues have been dramatic, the important question is whether such an intensity yielded the desired outcomes for the community, especially given the need to mainstream the unique concerns of the community. As media largely chose to support the community and the movement, somewhere the alignment had to be defined by the issue advocates such as the LGBT community leaders rather than the media itself. Clearly, presence of the issues on the public domain could not be negotiated to effect long term strategic alliances with key stakeholder institutions like rights advocates,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fc81109-9fed-4106-afb7-f034ad6c7780": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fc81109-9fed-4106-afb7-f034ad6c7780", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0d61fe65f9ae3c8310e37d314f2cd395ff61cf0c9d2c97ef97edf1ad4e65303"}}, "hash": "e0d61fe65f9ae3c8310e37d314f2cd395ff61cf0c9d2c97ef97edf1ad4e65303", "text": "experts, government and the dominant civil society. Given the current state of media disengagement with the issue, the need to work on the gaps and challenges and etch out a dynamic framework for community engagement with media becomes even more vital. Introduction The picture of the LGBT narrative in Nepal emerging from our literature review was that of a predominantly human rights-centred struggle waged resolutely by the community and its leaders. It also indicates the process of evolution from a small community initiative to being part of a wider socio-political struggle. Especially towards end of the last decade, continued assertion by the community was also able to make remarkable gains in terms of legal and constitutional recognition, more frequently occurring public space share, visible civil society support, and indeed, in tandem with all these, a commensurate public domain presence. Gains accomplished Of the many veritable gains accomplished by the community in the preceding and intervening periods, the more historic ones can be recounted as the Supreme Court directive of late 2007 to the Government of Nepal to stop all forms of discrimination on grounds of gender and sexual identities; the final court order to this effect in 2008; the National Committee recommendation on same sex marriage in 2012. Of as much significance was the inclusion of the \u2018other\u2019 category in the census enumeration process. Overall representation on public domain Representation of these path-setting developments on the public domain tended to celebrate the socio- political foresight and \u2018progressiveness of the society\u2019241 as much it lauded the communities\u2019 struggles behind the gains, very often sensitively illustrating the pathos and deprivation in their lives. Partly, such a public domain disposition came across as a spill over of the widely sympathetic recognition media in general had been ensuring for the community since 2003-4242, more so as the community\u2019s struggles and outcries resonated with the wider socio-democratic movement in the country.243 The HIV discourse \u2013 as visible on the public domain in this entire decade \u2013 both, maintained a parallel streak, and was very much part of the largely human rights-centric LGBT narrative in the country. Critical examination of these trends was consciously done during first hand interactions with key stakeholder including the community, media and civil society in Nepal.244 Key elements The manner in which the LGBT issue got positioned on the public domain was entwined with how the community was negotiating severe forms of violations for basic survival and clamoured for its rights and entitlements vis-\u00e0-vis the social and structural biases and repression. Although the focus of a LGBT group like BDS was on addressing HIV, the sheer intensities of day-to-day violations faced by its community members245 forced a dominantly human rights approach in the way it steered its issues. As a result of the path setting constitutional and legal recognition of their sexual and gender identities in the country in 2007-8, the public domain itself tended to support the rights based outlook of the community movement led by BDS. A scan of media reports that appeared on their issues across years evidences how human rights abuses and individual and collective struggles and resistances The MSM and Transgender Persons (LGBT) Movement in Nepal: Role and Engagement of Media Narrative Report A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 98 by community members were used as the most frequent pegs by the media246. In fact, the sheer presence of compelling human interest hues in these incidences of discrimination and atrocities may as well have been one of the factors that led to not only a spate of media reports but also created a strong public discourse and opinion on the anti-democratic practices of the then regime. Also significant is how BDS and its members continued being the most consistently visible community voices on LGBT issues on the public domain, including online international portals like www.globalgayz.com. Flag bearer on the issue The LGBT discourse in Nepal has by and large been synonymous with BDS - the group recognised as the sole agency that brought the issue into public reckoning ever since its inception in 2001. BDS has continued being recognised and posted in public domain as the flag bearer on the issue. Beginning as a group on \u2018HIV prevention in 2000-01, it got drawn into addressing incidences of violations against the gay and transgender people by 2003- 4\u2019.247 A predominant human rights focus prompted a transition to leading and representing a civil liberties movement on behalf of the community, and later to a more coordinated movement for gender and sexual identities and rights in Nepal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b1d9a4a-5b50-4744-a7a4-0ea0e26ae571": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b1d9a4a-5b50-4744-a7a4-0ea0e26ae571", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18be16718b24e2738922c88e5c78a521151202653a0f6949a9ad136c9628549e"}}, "hash": "18be16718b24e2738922c88e5c78a521151202653a0f6949a9ad136c9628549e", "text": "They found themselves becoming a natural focal point for disparate members from the LGBT communities, and instantly succeeded in bringing them together on a common platform. Having got focused on addressing on a day-to-day level incidences of discrimination, repression and other violations by police and others, the group could network and consolidate its members better, and was already out there in the open. It was proactive about engaging with media to report and highlight all incidences of violations, and media in general responded empathetically. Even today, many journalists are able to clearly recall248 how they used to be contacted by BDS and Sunil Pant whenever there was an incidence of illegal detainment or forceful arrest by police, etc. In all of this, the larger civil society, media and human rights groups remained empathetic to the LGBT community, especially the transgender subgroup who were the more visible lot249. We find that when BDS began as a small group of community volunteers to support and give voice to individual struggles of community members, the media joined in as a key instrument in amplifying their voices and concerns. \u201cIntense media focus on violence against gender variant people\u201d has been noted as a key explanation for a heightened local cultural relevance for the third gender in the country \u201cas the contemporary sexual and gender minority rights movement emerged in Nepal.\u201d250 Early trends From as early as 2000, and more concretely from 2003, there are numerous media reports on abuses and atrocities on community members, in most cases by the police. These relate mostly to forced and unlawful detention, torture, beating, rape and humiliation faced by them at the hands of the authorities, and often also the associated social and familial persecution251. BDS attempted to bring these together in the form of a compilation and review of media reports. A typical example of the reports depicted in this Review is as follows. \u201cOn Feb 05, 2003, Himalayan News Service reported \u2026. \u2018Some 10 gays, who were dancing at the Babylon \u2026.at about 1:30 am, were reported to have been physically assaulted by a Mongolian-faced man demanding sexual favours.

The document samples media reports that emerged in the succeeding years and comments on the community\u2019s response to violations. Making Human Rights the focus It is of significance to note how the intensification of the pro-democracy movement and the continued instances of such atrocities and discriminations directed at LGBT communities may have forced BDS into redefining its organisational focus in those days even though, as Sunil Pant confirmed, \u201cthe organisation\u2019s focus in the initial phase was on HIV and AIDS outreach.\u201d BDS\u2019 outreach emphasised HIV prevention and educating members of the MSM community about 99 their particular vulnerability to the infection. When BDS took \u201ca conscious decision to move slowly into the human rights campaign from merely continuing HIV and AIDS outreach, \u2026(it) began documenting violence against community members and raising awareness about the rights violations against the SGM [sexual and gender minority] community\u201d252. Of the 24 media reports documented by BDS and mentioned in this Review for the year 2003, 22 stories are centred on human rights violations or social stigmatization. Mention of HIV and AIDS or Sexual and Reproductive Health contexts are there in only five of these stories. Two stories (on gay parade, fashion show) are about social assertion and inclusion. As BDS was becoming conscious of documenting incidences of violations and atrocities targeted at the LGBT community members, it helped facilitate more effective interaction with media on the issues. Many of these accounts were graphically documented in detail, and reproduced later by BDS and Bhandari in the form of a review. Media as an early enabler Interspersed in this period of increasing violations are also media stories recounting the courageous yet uphill task that a community group like BDS had mounted upon; how atrocities impacted delivery of HIV and AIDS care and services by its staffers, etc.253 Even within the predominantly human rights-centric focus, media was framing specific reports on issues of LGBT and HIV254. We also find media coverage interspersed with stories promoting awareness and acceptance for this community255 all along this period. Clearly, BDS was aware of making efforts to reach out to the media, and saw media as a critical agency. \u201cInsurgency began around the same time, leading to more violence and atrocities against community members. We had to intervene in individual cases almost every day.

We thus started documenting these from the human rights perspective. As violence escalated, we engaged journalists to cover and expose it all from the civil rights perspective\u201d - Sunil Babu Pant of BDS recounting his struggles in the early days. The stories done early on by Kiran Nepal profiling the nascent struggles by a group of volunteers, or by Himal Khabar in 2003-4 on the first national convention of the LGBT community are seen as pieces of public domain messaging that helped initiate the process of building a receptive environment for the community. Similarly, those on gay rights by Sudeshna Sarkar, Sandeep Chakan or the programme on national TV\u2013 Sangharsh, raised the issue of alternate gender identities sensitively. These not only helped position the issues in wider public recognition, but also helped address the \u2018hitch and hesitation\u2019 that media in general faced in approaching members of this community. In this sense, the works of these early pioneers are recognised as critical necessary impetus to opening up dialogue with wider society, and positioning the community\u2019s struggles within the larger social democratic movement in the country.256 These may as well have in many ways been the cornerstones on which the \u2018largely positive\u2019 outlook of media on LGBT communities got shaped in the following years. Purely from the point of view of communication, such beginnings may have been of strategic long term significance for the issue. Pro-democracy movement: Game changing times for LGBT Looking at how LGBT issues got posited in the wider public domain in these years, we find that the trajectories of violations against the community tended to reverberate with the bigger pro-democracy movement in the country. As Sunil Pant stated in 2006, \u201cBDS has also been an active participant in the recent democratic movement in Nepal.\u201d257 Both, global mediations and media\u2019s role and response in this entire period, got naturally aligned into amplifying the rights debate. The organisation of \u201cthe first national convention in 2003 was a significant step in encouraging the community to come out in the open\u201
