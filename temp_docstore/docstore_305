The simple greenhouse gas mitigation technology has suffered from repeated setbacks in finding its roots in Cambodia due to the lack of national technical capacity, as well as the small market that does not attract enough external interest, despite the potential Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) that could be generated under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). He has drawn the following thought-provoking lessons from this unfortunate experience: \u201c(1) a least developed country, even surrounded by neighbours with the appropriate technology, will face difficulties in transferring even the most simple equipment if there is no well-established national market for it; (2) south-south transfer of technologies may face the same market and institutional barriers as north-south transfer of technologies, and require appropriate government support; and (3) awareness raising of greenhouse gas mitigation technologies is a requisite of technology transfer but not a sufficient condition for laying the foundation of a market.\u201d CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 200 Dear Network Members, Anaerobic digesters for swine farms: An experience of technology transfer for greenhouse gas mitigation in Cambodia Simple proven technologies are not always simple to implement. This short essay aims to share Cambodia\u2019s experience in acquiring anaerobic digesters for the treatment of wastewater from swine farms. As petroleum products were approaching new highs in late 2007, it became imperative for Cambodian swine farms to reduce their expenditures in order to remain competitive with cheaper meat imports from Vietnamese breeders. Swine farm operations are both large consumers of electricity and large emitters of greenhouse gases (CRCD 2006). Electricity is used to keep piglets, especially newborns, constantly warm, thus considerably reducing mortality rates; as well as to power mechanical equipment for the preparation of animal feed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6eae4906-f256-4b8c-a970-558daab991a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6eae4906-f256-4b8c-a970-558daab991a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92e12c9c83f48203e4ed9b85e33bbe6e756472c3927df18af868a03d24822373"}, "2": {"node_id": "65633e7a-67d7-492c-9ac0-74da5d0f6dea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "484fdf0014de30138097a3d1859fb8d1964eec3a6275b8c180e55522503ee512"}}, "hash": "d5fbde6c2f307ab699e442ce6d3bf51fb51c3fde635362e7da71d0b5fedc6bac", "text": "Wastewater from animal enclosures is collected in open air lagoons and ponds, producing significant quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

The methane captured from the ponds is cleaned up and combusted in a gas engine to produce electricity, in essence a modified electric generator.

Most Cambodian swine farms had the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes CO2eq a year, putting them below the limit of simplified small-scale methodologies for the CDM. The main interest of local farmers was in the savings in fuel expenditure, while the sale of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) under the CDM would contribute to the purchase of the necessary equipment. Although there were several experienced suppliers of gas generators in Cambodia, none had the experience to set up a turnkey installation with a methane capture component such as an anaerobic digester. Thai and Vietnamese suppliers were contacted over the course of six months with little success. Their lack of interest stemmed from the fact that the Cambodian market was estimated to be too small to justify the cost of sales and maintenance operations. In addition, these companies were not able to provide accurate quotes without site visits, which in their opinion, were not justified given the handful of potential buyers in Cambodia. It is likely that had a small group of swine farmers been able to successfully install anaerobic digesters, others may have followed suit, laying the foundation of a market. After a year of dealings, an environmental consultancy firm from the Philippines offered its services, but was equally unable to find interested suppliers. Most of the smaller Cambodian swine farms have since succumbed to market forces and are no longer in operation. It is ironic that the leading Cambodian engineering firm now provides a turnkey service for biogas digesters. Simple technology such as methane capture from wastewater ponds and combusting for electricity production remains a guarded secret in Cambodia, and a competitive advantage for those businesses with access to it. A few of the larger factories, swine farms and breweries have been able, through their international business connections, to contract the services and purchase the equipment from suppliers outside the country (Samrong Thom Animal Husbandry 2008; Carbon Bridge 2008). However, for the community-and family-based entrepreneurs, these greenhouse gas mitigation technologies, although common place in most of South-East Asia, remain difficult to acquire. A number of lessons can be learned from Cambodian swine farmers\u2019 unfortunate experience in their attempt to acquire greenhouse gas mitigation technologies: (1) a least developed country, even surrounded by neighbours with the appropriate technology, will face difficulties in transferring even the most simple equipment if there is no well- CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 201 established national market for it; (2) south-south transfer of technologies may face the same market and institutional barriers as north-south transfer of technologies, and require appropriate government support; and (3) awareness raising of greenhouse gas mitigation technologies is a requisite of technology transfer but not a sufficient condition for laying the foundation of a market.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 202 Dear Colleagues, Capacity building for mitigation, technology transfer and financing: Highlighting the least developed countries perspective The present sub-theme, as it covers three of the four building blocks of the Bali Action Plan, is of particular relevance for the least developed countries (LDCs) of the Asia-Pacific region. While the region covers two of the world\u2019s largest economies (China, India), it also hosts multiple middle-income countries and economies in transition. Additionally, all the 14 LDCs in the Asia-Pacific region (*) are particularly vulnerable to climate change and are least prepared to deal with its impacts. In these countries, development, deployment and diffusion of low emission and mitigation and adaptation technologies are hindered by various barriers, which include lack of adequate financing, poor institutional structure, lack of capacity to utilize existing financing mechanisms for technology transfer and/or for developing new and innovative technology options. As an example, I would like to highlight the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). According to Kyoto Protocol Article 12, this market-based mechanism was set up to help countries meet the emission targets of Annex I Parties, and to encourage the private sector and developing countries to contribute to emission reduction efforts. However, whether the CDM has been able to become a true \u201coffset mechanism with global reach\u201d and to make the expected contributions to sustainable development remains open to question. According to the CDM project database, as of 18 May 2010, of the 2,594 projects registered so far, only 11 are hosted by the LDCs of the Asia-Pacific region. To illustrate the disparity further, I would like to underscore that one of the most vulnerable countries, Bangladesh, has only two registered projects so far; and another most vulnerable island country, Maldives, has no projects registered at all. This is in contrast to 850 projects registered for China and 507 projects registered for India. This uneven distribution of the CDM projects is known. It is also known that while there is a huge potential for CDM project development in many of the LDCs, the capacity to prepare such projects in many of these countries is very low, and capacity development efforts, in general, lag behind. I believe capacity development to meet the challenge of climate change (for mitigation and adaptation) is needed both in the public and the private sectors. For example, when considering the CDM, the private/public sector actors that require support include Designated National Authority, other government institutions, private sector and non- governmental organizations (NGOs). An important aspect integral to the capacity development requirement is the need for substantial investment in research and development so that technological innovations can happen. Related to this is the need for sustained efforts to enable strengthening of institutional capacity to accelerate the deployment and diffusion of innovative technologies as well as the existing ones. While the country specific contexts in developing countries may differ in terms of the state of national institutions and private sector capabilities (as clearly seen in the experience with CDM), it is vital that due emphasis is placed on facilitating supportive conditions in least developed countries to enable them to develop, deploy, diffuse and transfer mitigation and adaptation technologies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4474112-19cc-4f72-b185-535ccc2ee6d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4474112-19cc-4f72-b185-535ccc2ee6d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "353f00dff1bf48480cf9c115124faeff2023d296680897bd519e0ed9414edcd5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f54e36f8-0bd6-42a1-9703-568218a0ae23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a30209cf812bec8a09a414bf25526cc1d8e4ac4a939b2cbecfb05478542e224"}}, "hash": "4174d77aa976ecfb20fc23f96f071165aebecf99c6b2197e8daa7084dd5a3cb1", "text": "The Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) has emphasized the need for supporting countries not only to adopt \u201cexisting environmentally-friendly technologies but also to develop the capacity to innovate new technologies and practices\u2026\u201d (EGTT 2009: 11).

Such a website can serve as a platform for climate technology resources that facilitate technology choices for development in a changing climate, and can potentially be a very useful resource for countries facing the climate change challenge, especially LDCs. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 203 To sum up, the issues under discussion are undoubtedly very complex. However, I think that it is important to recognize that capacity development needs in terms of climate change varies widely, and this is true even when considered from a regional perspective. Therefore, efforts for meeting those needs in terms of both mitigation and adaptation technologies, as well as financing, should remain cognizant of these varying ranges and special attention should be given to the least developed countries. Best regards, Sarwat Chowdhury Consultant EEG/BDP UNDP, New York Notes (*) The LDCs in Asia-Pacific are: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Lao PDR, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor Leste, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

The importance of technology for the pursuit of a low-carbon economy, especially in China, was also the focus of the contribution from G\u00f8rild Heggelund, Andrea De Angelis and Inga Fritzen Buan. All contributions touched on financing as crucial for whole spectrum of technology, from research and development, to diffusion, deployment and transfer. I note, however, that the big advantage of the Montreal Protocol is the dedicated fund, the Multilateral Fund (MLF), which is focused on the objective of the Montreal Protocol and through which development and transfer of technology is financed. Climate change financing, on the other hand, is mainly channelled through what is known as voluntary donor institutions comprised of multilateral financing institutions, regional development banks and bilateral aid agencies, considered to be outside of the framework of the financial mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Very little progress has been made both on the ground and in the discussions on the implementation of developed countries\u2019 commitments on technology development and transfer in the UNFCCC, including in the current negotiations. Studies have also shown that little or no technology transfer has taken place through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The contributions by Yang Youlin and Lu Qi showed that much is being done for mitigation in Asian developing countries, in China in particular, through policies and programmes on sustainable land management. These demonstrated that developing countries are undertaking mitigation actions, even without the financing and technology resources from developed countries, but that they could do much more if these legal obligations would be met under the UNFCCC. These two contributions also underlined the co-benefits that are derived from climate change mitigation activities, in terms of providing better livelihoods for the people, and preserving biological diversity. Kishan Khoday\u2019s analysis of the impacts on global trade of national mitigation policies was a focus of the current negotiations because of the economic and social consequences of response measures to climate change. Article 3.5 of the Convention, taken from the Rio principles, stipulates that \u201cmeasures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade\u201d (United Nations 1992). The danger exists not only in the projected legislation in the United States, but also in Western Europe, especially France. This illustrates that policy responses to address climate change and its adverse effects should be dictated not by economic interests alone. Least developed countries (LDCs), as demonstrated by Sarwat Chowdhury, face many difficulties in taking mitigation actions. It is for this reason that, in the climate change negotiations, developing countries have taken the position that there must be a balanced consideration of adaptation and mitigation, in particular for financing. It is indeed true that LDCs have little project activities under the CDM. This is also because many LDCs, especially in Africa, are sinks instead of sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The recognition that many developing countries, especially LDCs and small island countries, have little mitigation capabilities is the main reason that the Adaptation Fund was set up under the CDM in the Kyoto Protocol. The Adaptation Fund, mainly financed through shares of certified emission reductions (CERs) under the CDM, is a solidarity fund through which the developing countries that have CDM projects share the benefits derived from these projects with other developing countries. Furthermore, the CERs are added to the assigned amount of developed countries which means that whatever is reduced in developing countries can be emitted by developed countries, and therefore have no direct climate benefits. The CDM is only beneficial for emission reduction if the project activities assist developing countries in their pursuit of sustainable development, or a low-emission pathway to growth. In this regard, developing countries refer to a low-emission growth, rather than merely to low-carbon development that covers only reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Many developing countries in Asia have a large amount of emissions coming from agriculture, in particular rice production, and need to address these emissions as well. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 205 Keith Openshaw\u2019s contribution on the detrimental effects of unrestricted population growth on development in general and climate change mitigation in particular made valid arguments. A sustainable population policy in developing countries would, however, need to be accompanied by other sustainable development objectives. It has been shown that empowerment of women, education and the availability of basic services are also powerful \u201ccontraceptives\u201d.

Both in mitigation and adaptation, therefore, developed countries should lead. This means of course that developing countries will follow that lead, but that the extent to which this is done is determined by the implementation of obligations for the provision of financial resources and transfer of technology to developing countries. Moreover, the Convention provides that the commitments for emissions reductions by developed countries \u201cwill demonstrate that developed countries are taking the lead in modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions\u2026\u201d (Article 4.2), that is in production and consumption lifestyles. On the other hand, the Convention also recognizes that \u201c\u2026 economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties\u2026\u201d (Article 4.7).

Opening Message Dear Network Members, The sub-theme for the next three weeks will focus on issues relating to climate change research, education, training and public awareness, especially from the perspective of human development. While research in both physical and social sciences (including economics) will provide the basis for learned policy-and decision-making, education and training will enhance the human and institutional capacity. Raising public awareness is essential to empower all stakeholders so that actions for change can be taken, both individually and collectively, if the world community is going to achieve the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (*) (United Nations 1992). Let us recall the following articles of the Convention that are relevant to the above issues, especially Articles 4.1 (g) and (i) and Articles 5 and 6. Article 4.1 of the UNFCCC has committed all Parties, \u201ctaking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their specific national and regional development priorities, objectives and circumstances\u201d to: Promote and cooperate in scientific, technological, technical, socio-economic and other research, systematic observation \u2022 and development of data archives related to the climate system and intended to further the understanding and to reduce or eliminate the remaining uncertainties regarding the causes, effects, magnitude and timing of climate change and the economic and social consequences of various response strategies (Article 4.1 (g)); Promote and cooperate in education, training and public awareness related to climate change and encourage the \u2022 widest participation in this process, including that of non-governmental organizations (Article 4.1 (i)).

temperature and precipitation trends; melting of mountain glaciers and associated formation of glacial lakes in some Asian countries; coastal sea-level rise; national or regional climate modelling; uncertainties estimation; trends in frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones; possible influence of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a on the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones; ecosystems assessment, such as the phenological changes in plants and animals (e.g., how will the various local ecosystems in the Asia-Pacific region respond to a 2.0oC temperature rise adopted in Copenhagen Accord?); endogenous knowledge; and financing; \u2022 Education and training or capacity-building programmes and activities in various aspects relating to climate change (e.g., scientific research; greenhouse gases inventory; mitigation; vulnerability assessment; adaptation; technology transfer; and financing), including school and tertiary curriculum on climate change; subregional and regional cooperation, including South-South cooperation; and \u2022 Public awareness programmes and activities, including available human and financial resources (**); methodologies and tools; networking; sharing of data and information; conducting campaigns; case studies and good practices at national, subregional, regional and international levels, especially those relevant to human development and sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region. While recognizing the great efforts made by the national governments in the Asia-Pacific region on all the above- mentioned issues, especially the developing and least developed countries, despite their limited human and financial resources, as reflected in their national communications, it seems that a large amount of work undertaken by the national and international NGOs at the country-level have not been reported in the national communications. We hope that this e-forum will provide a platform for the NGOs, especially the national NGOs, to share their unique experiences and lessons learned with a wider audience, as called for by Article 4.1 (i) mentioned above. Apart from the NGOs, we also warmly welcome contributions from the private sector regarding its research, education, training and public awareness efforts relating to climate change in the Asia-Pacific region, either individually or through public-private partnership. We look forward to receiving your valuable contributions on this sub-theme, and to another useful and lively discussion in the next three weeks. With best wishes, Pak Sum Low AP-HDNet Facilitator Notes (*) Article 2 (OBJECTIVE) of the Convention stipulates that \u201cThe ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.\u201d (**) Under the national communication projects of developing and least developed countries, available funds for supporting public awareness activities are very limited.

His work in Mongolia seems to suggest that \u201cthere is considerable level of awareness about climate change issues, though some of this could have been a result of priority given to certain issues by the media\u201d. Further work will be undertaken in this area. Dear Network Members, A social science perspective on researching climate change It is easy for discussions on research to focus mainly on the \u2018research what\u2019 question identifying an agenda for research. Here, I would like to take a slightly different perspective, step back a little bit and argue that we need to also ask \u2018research how\u2019. There are six main issues with regard to researching climate change and, in my view, a Human Development Report (HDR) can make a significant difference on all six of these: (i) Even as physical science provides the dominant discourse on climate change, how to develop a comparable and robust social science discourse on climate change? While we do need to focus on impacts, vulnerability, or economic justification for decisive actions now, there is also a need to examine governance issues. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 210 (ii) In trying to goad a reluctant audience, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports and other mainstream literature have tended to use large numbers to emphasize the urgency to act. This creates a \u2018large numbers bias\u2019-and triggers a search for ever more convincing numbers (e.g., of people to be affected, square kilometres of land, cubic metres of water, and so on). This bias also leads to the trap of hyperbole to justify policy discussions. As a consequence of \u2018large numbers bias\u2019, anything that cannot be measured gets sidelined or ignored. (iii) The positive aspects of what should we do about climate change cannot be divorced from the ethical and normative issues of who ought to do it, especially in social sciences. These would include how to interpret \u2018equity and common but differentiated responsibilities\u2019 and who should bear the cost of adaptation to climate change. Similarly, the issue concerning definition of responsibility and moral obligations needs to be clarified. (iv) How to engage wider public and how to use deliberative public reasoning for policymaking is also an issue. (v) Another issue concerns the need for maintaining an approach of critical scrutiny. However, in a polarised situation, there is a real risk that anyone expressing critical opinions is tarnished as being a \u2018climate sceptic\u2019. (vi) There is a north-south divide of sorts in priority given to mitigation vs. adaptation issues. Mitigation, such as \u201cbecoming carbon neutral\u201d, is a priority in the developed countries while adaptation is a priority for developing countries. However, mitigation measures have greater visibility and are easier to implement. Also there is a risk that these become the pet themes of educated urban elite who inadvertently become champions of such measures which, they see from their travels to developed world, being implemented there. There is a need to develop ways of prioritizing to avoid spreading scarce resources either too thin or on incorrect priorities which look great but have little real impact.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7e1d368-bb3f-4e3e-89f2-708fece87a5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7e1d368-bb3f-4e3e-89f2-708fece87a5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7bbf8f7595c569bceca2108246dec5191b7bd19096f17c082082cad95c322508"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7a2556a-4543-4cfe-8449-75d3343aa6d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "984f631df1265c240238c57ae0d9cbde5fd1628ef3ba8635b7b0c784c317ac2a"}}, "hash": "5b841ff7ede686ec924f2528bd94a672cd5e8251bf59b16c9ca3b40061ea2091", "text": "On public awareness, our current work on Mongolia\u2019s National Human Development Report (NHDR) suggests that there is considerable level of awareness about climate change issues, though some of this could have been a result of priority given to certain issues by the media.

Dear Network Members, Marine climate change in Australia The following paragraphs describe the development of a Marine Climate Change Report Card for Australia. This summarises current knowledge of marine climate change impacts for Australia, highlighting key knowledge gaps and outlining adaptation responses. The Report Card exists as a hardcopy three double-sided A4 page foldout, a website, and a 289 page book for libraries. The hardcopy version is written in plain English suitable for the general public, while the website and book provide access to state-of-the-art knowledge about climate change and marine systems. The preparation of the Report Card was coordinated by a three-person project team from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation\u2019s (CSIRO) Climate Adaptation Flagship. Contributions came from 70 authors from 35 universities and organizations across Australia. Background In December 2008, CSIRO and the Department of Climate Change held an international symposium \u2018In Hot Water\u2019 to consider options available to Australian science to inform Government, resource managers and the marine community of the range of observed and potential impacts of climate change on Australia\u2019s marine environment. Evidence from the workshop showed convincingly that the marine environment was responding to climate change. Key concerns included waters around Australia becoming warmer and more acidic, increases in strengths of major warm-water currents such as the East Australian current (made famous in the movie Finding Nemo), changes in the productivity of marine ecosystems, and shifts in the distribution and abundance of species. On both sides of the continent, there was clear evidence of ocean warming. This was a message that needed to be disseminated to the Australian public. Australia is a maritime nation with over 90 per cent of its population living within 120 km of the coast and Australian waters generate considerable economic wealth through important industries such as tourism, shipping, fisheries and aquaculture. For some time, a core group of marine scientists had been building an understanding of these impacts, gathering evidence and presenting their findings to colleagues and industry. They built on a shared concern and real interest in the science and options for adaptation, and the increasing number of scientific publications being produced. The Department of Climate Change sought several reviews of literature around which it could shape a response to the issue. The result was a report - Implications of Climate Change for Australian Fisheries and Aquaculture: A preliminary assessment (Hobday et al. 2008).

Both positive and negative impacts could be expected. The report noted the need for fisheries and aquaculture management policies to enhance the resilience of marine biodiversity and the adaptive capacity of the fisheries and aquaculture industries. A communication programme was required to convey all these messages to a broad audience \u2013 resource and environmental managers, the professional and recreational fishing communities, marine user groups, scientists, schools and the public. Inspired by the UK Marine Climate Change Impacts Report Card (www.mccip.org.uk), the Australian Report Card on impacts of marine climate change and options for adaptation was developed. In November 2009 the Report Card became the first-ever Australian benchmark of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems. Led by a three-person CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship project team, the research group included 70 scientists from Australian universities, State and territory environmental agencies, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 212 With growing public scepticism about climate change and the need for a concise, clearly understood and measured message, only by bringing together a broad and extensive team and the right mix of communication tools the public and Government can be confident that the information is robust and balanced. Specific objectives of the Report Card were to: (i) build an information base and consolidate evidence of observed and expected marine climate change impacts in Australia; (ii) transfer this information in an efficient and user-friendly form; and (iii) identify information gaps and focus adaptation efforts. It highlights, for all marine community users and managers, observations of impacts on 17 species groups and climate variables over the past decade, projecting forward to 2030 and 2100 with assessments of likely status. It then offers adaptation responses that can inform policymakers. National print and electronic media coverage focused through the specially-created website (www.oceanclimatechange. org.au), and carried messages reaching target audiences through professional associations (i.e., the Australian Marine Sciences Association) and environmental and marine adaptation networks. All detailed information behind the summary Report Card was made available on the website, which has received 276,443 hits and 9,187 unique visits (27 November 2009-7 May 2010). Of the website, one science blog wrote: \u201cWhilst the majority of the information presented on the website is available in various scientific papers, having it all combined on a common site, and in plain English is a real leap forward in making marine issues accessible to the public\u201d and described it as an \u201cA-plus for marine scientists\u201d (McLeod 2004). The Report Card has been an inexpensive, inclusive, and highly successful tool for climate change scientists to reach out to those Australians interested in the marine environment in a format that provided balanced and reliable reporting of climate change. The success of the marine Report Card has been noted in other sectors. It is being used as a template for a similar Report Card for Australian terrestrial environments and sectors with some of the marine project team contributing to the development of the terrestrial card. Running these projects in tandem should enhance the communication of all aspects of climate change to the Australian public. Regards, Trevor H.

The Facilitator notes that whatever the approach and process adopted for vulnerability and adaptation assessment, they still need to be science-based, and the findings must be peer-reviewed. Dear Network Members, Why should we not establish the truth about climate change too conveniently? (*) Since 2008, we are witnessing the dramatic proliferation of climate change-related efforts in the Mekong region where high profile organizations are proposing various projects to deal with this hot and lucrative issue. Although many types of climate change activities are carried out, I find a similar trend for all of them: centralization and technocratization of environmental conservation and livelihood improvement works under the climate change and adaptation themes. According to the Mekong River Commission\u2019s report (2009), the countries of the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) are recognized as among the most vulnerable to climate change in the world. Their economies, ecosystem sustainability and social harmony are at risk. Notably, most of the affected communities are not living in the urban and modernized cities; they are living in rural areas rich in cultural and traditional ways of life. Under globalization, where the concept of modernity permeates every aspect of life, traditional knowledge, skills, and, ultimately, worldview could be seen as incompetent and backward. Empty participatory process At some project sites in Lao PDR, where international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), UN and government agencies are implementing \u201cadaptation\u201d projects, communities and local authorities are systematically being disempowered through the \u201cdistorted\u201d practice of participatory process. In various adaptation workshops, although being invited, villagers and local government officers are constantly reminded that the climate change impact assessment and the adaptation option selection process are highly technical processes and what they can do in this \u201cparticipatory\u201d activity is simply to provide information that the specialists may need for their reports. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 214 This is a disturbing phenomenon, which is in contrast to the progressive trend of many NGOs and UN agencies\u2019 efforts to ensure sustainability of the projects and increase the communities\u2019 sense of ownership. Empowerment is also promoted by recognizing and respecting the importance and contribution of their traditions and cultures. At the same time, however, communities are equipped with skills in livelihoods improvement that aim at increasing income, conserving the surrounding environment, and reducing social problems. According to the MRC Secretariat\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Jeremy Bird, no-one knows exactly how rising world temperatures will impact on the Mekong basin. The absence of information on climate change vulnerability within countries and across various classes of societies is a major cause of concern. To Bird, \u201cBy improving the knowledge on the potential impacts, it will be possible to increase the ability to help the people of the region with capacity to confront such impacts\u201d (MRC 2009). Obsession with modelling Everyone seems to agree that scientific research on climate change and its impacts is vital to the effort to deal with the issue. In response, international organizations employ modelling techniques as means to project climate change impact scenario. I agree that research is crucial, but, in my opinion, we must not solely focus on this computer generated document too obsessively.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48e33b1f-7d5f-4dc5-866c-17c9fe69cf61": {"__data__": {"id_": "48e33b1f-7d5f-4dc5-866c-17c9fe69cf61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bfe4f43711ac8160fe6de122efe0451619ff5a7344a83fb75fb945c348502eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "2fe73650-28a3-4e3f-ba2f-4cd0f0c9674e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c5cfd685d18b2bbd9273f832413a29f1e683880e0a0ae5cf41c6f3355574472"}}, "hash": "e0fe51e739d1d2cb533eee76335aba35b404ba332f8ab3acebf621e6034dd97b", "text": "Time and again, critical academics and the civil society point out that the inherent simplification aspect of models and the richness and diversity of living nature always create debates on how to interpret ecological and social complexities adequately.

Instead, initially, I would propose at least two ideas as possible means to reverse the trend: \u2022 Promoting community-led participatory research: Community-led participatory research such as Vijai Tai Baan (villagers\u2019 research) or Sala Pum (the Cambodia version of Tai Baan) (**) must be supported, funded, and disseminated. Also, researchers, especially from the community, should be supported to present their findings at local, national, regional, or international venues. Possible research that would take the strategic advantage of the community include review of local adaptation experiences and knowledge, adaptation actions, sex disaggregated data collection on vulnerability to climate change, etc. Ultimately, through this empowerment process of participatory research, the villagers who have participated in the project would then become the excellent advocates. They should be invited and supported to participate in events, forums, and stakeholder consultation meetings. \u2022 Supporting a constructive and functioning Track III diplomacy: We should initiate and seek to support the arrangement of constructive Track III (***) exchanges such as the NGOs organized parallel meeting where climate change adaptation issues can be discussed openly and the marginalized groups can make their voice heard. For example, at the climate change parallel meeting in Bali, civil societies from around the world gathered to discuss reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in a critical and constructive manner and raise awareness of the issues to the public. As Phillip Hirsch, Director of the Australian Mekong Resource Centre at the University of Sydney, puts it, \u201cThe politics of science versus indigenous research is thus based not only on the quality or reliability of information, but also on questions of ownership\u201d (Hirsch 2004). I see the importance of policy advocacy which also targets structural changes. In my view, these two levels of work are not separated but intertwined and must be implemented in collaboration to improve effectiveness. In terms of climate change, any organization that implements policy advocacy must aspire to empower and mobilize groups of people who are affected by climate change to raise their voice and be active as agents for social change, not merely doing it on their behalf. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 215 Clearly, many aspects of climate change knowledge findings require scientific expertise but it is not sufficient. Over-emphasis on pure science-oriented mentality can lead to unwanted consequences as I have described. Therefore, I propose that a more participatory and empowering approach are employed as well, especially in the field of vulnerability assessment, study of adaptation options, and implementation of adaptation activities.

Rao informs a sample survey of company executives/managers that she conducted in Kolkata area last year to assess their awareness on the impacts of climate change, and found that these executives/managers were particularly concerned about the health impacts of climate change. Although the \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs were also \u201caware of the climate change and its impacts\u201d, they \u201cthought that the climate friendly initiatives were only for large companies that could afford them\u201d. These SMEs seem to have been left out in getting \u201cclimate friendly\u201d projects due to the lack of funding, intensive capital, manpower and technical know-how. She proposes two ways to overcome this dilemma: (1) Let the large corporations show the way through forums and expertise advice by enabling the SMEs to follow their examples, so that \u201cwhen the large corporations grow\u201d, \u201cthey can bring along with them multitudes of SMEs in the path of climate change mitigation\u201d. She terms this \u201cinclusive growth to sustainability\u201d; and (2) Green supply chain management, which has been practised elsewhere (e.g., Nestle company in the Philippines, which holds \u201cregular awareness seminars for their suppliers and business partners, help them to go green and even send company experts to visit the supplier premises and provide advice.\u201d). If the above model can be adopted, then \u201cthe SME sector would turn green\u201d and become \u201cclimate friendly within a short span of time.\u201d Dear Network Members, Climate change initiatives and SMEs \u2026 a perspective from Kolkata area As it is well known, in recent times, there has been a very real concern over the adverse impacts of climate change all over the world. Not only does one come across conferences, seminars and policy forums on climate change, and the ways and means as how to mitigate its inevitable adverse effects, but one also encounters newspaper advertisements and TV commercials on corporations dedicated to minimize the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), climate friendly funding possibilities and energy companies going green. All these initiatives bring back hope that, yes, the world is indeed taking steps to minimize the climate change impacts. Last year, I was engaged in an empirical research to assess the awareness to climate change impacts, such as the various initiatives that one can take at the individual and at the corporate levels; the extent of propensity to personally start using solar energy, reducing gasoline use, and using GHG-free items, and to invest in climate change funds and donate to climate change movements.

However, while doing the research I realized that the above findings were fine from the perspective of managers in large and well-established corporations. But in India most of the manufacturing and service delivery of all kinds and, generally, business at large, are carried out by not large and well-established corporations but by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs. In Kolkata area there are only a handful of large companies, while there are hundreds and thousands of SMEs (e.g., leather processing, tanneries, metal working, manufacturing of electrical appliances, textile companies, cosmetic producing companies, soap and detergent companies, food producers of various types, packaging companies, paper producing companies, publishing works, auto parts manufacturers, etc.).

While doing our empirical research for large companies, on the side I did manage to talk to some of the SMEs, generally asking about their business and about climate change. Most of them told me that business was really down (this was 2009). Many finalized orders were cancelled. They were aware of climate change and its impacts, but they thought that the climate friendly initiatives were only for large companies that could afford them. They knew the world was in danger of going through climate change, but what could they do? All climate friendly projects were capital intensive, required extensive funding, manpower and technical know-how. If they had to use emission-free production processes, who would fund them? And what was the point in doing such a thing because their customers were not looking for suppliers to have emission-free processes. They generally felt that to do anything to address climate change was not their business at all, and nobody was telling them to do such a thing and nobody would be interested in helping them anyway. Listening to them I felt that what they were saying was actually true. While we see conferences and seminars and TV commercials and newspaper advertisements on climate change, they all appear to be too big-time, not feasible and achievable at the SME level. But then, it is the SMEs which are, and will be, carrying out manufacturing and service delivery in Asia in the next decade. And together they will emit a large amount of GHGs. So what can we do? I think we can do the following: (1) Inclusive growth to sustainability Nowadays we often hear the phrase \u201cinclusive growth\u201d. In the context of climate change, this means we request the large corporations in Kolkata area together to set up regular forums which will have (a) a pool of funds from all of them put together; (b) a team of climate change experts to guide the SMEs to go for GHG-free processes; (c) regular members/employees from the corporations supervise and monitor progress. It may not be too difficult to set up such a forum because many large companies in Kolkata are aware of climate change and they are incorporating such initiatives in their processes. For instance, a new hotel in Kolkata called \u201cSonar\u201d has made their entire operations green and GHG-free. So someone needs to talk to all such enlightened corporations to develop such forums and then identify and start helping the SMEs. Thus, when the large corporations grow, and may they grow, they can bring along with them multitudes of SMEs in the path of climate change mitigation. This is what I would term as \u201cinclusive growth to sustainability\u201d. (2) Green supply chain management with the climate change context In green supply chain management, we would look at company operations, such as a large organization, in terms of (a) inbound logistics; (b) production; (c) outbound logistics; and (d) reverse logistics. In each of these phases the company has suppliers, business partners, waste handlers, distributors, retailers, re-manufacturers and other service providers, all of whom are usually SMEs, involved with its operations. Such a large company usually has some influence on all of these business partners. So, if the company demands all such business partners to go for green operations, it may work. I have seen the green supply chain concept working wonderfully at the Nestle company in the Philippines. This company holds regular awareness seminars for their suppliers and business partners, helps them to go green and even sends company experts to visit the supplier premises and provide advice. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 218 I think we can somehow make the large corporations in Kolkata area to adopt this model and start the climate friendly initiatives for all of their SME suppliers and business partners. If all companies do their share in this process, the SME sector would turn green and become climate friendly within a short span of time. With best regards, Purba H.

The S4S, partnered with a number of relevant organizations and government ministries and agencies, has undertaken extensive awareness raising activities targeted at various groups (e.g., children, post-secondary students, citizens, professionals in various sectors, tourists, members of parliament, various government ministries and private sector). Different means have been used, such as workshops; in-flight video for Air Seychelles; banner and posters; citizen\u2019s guide on climate change and its impacts on Seychelles; a creole play on climate change and sustainable living (in collaboration with local theatre troupe Comedie des Seychelles); media (television, radio and printing materials); documentary on sustainable living (in collaboration with the Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation); poetry, song, art, public speaking and drama competitions; among others. The impacts of the above activities are being evaluated. The S4S rightly links \u201cclimate change education to education for sustainability\u201d, as \u201cthe behaviours for sustainable living\u201d, which can \u201cdraw upon many of the traditional cultural practices\u201d, \u201care the same as those needed to mitigate, and adapt to, climate change\u201d.

Dear friends, Climate change education and awareness: Experiences from the Seychelles Islands This contribution is on behalf of Sustainability for Seychelles (S4S), a non-governmental organization (NGO) established in 2007 to promote sustainable living in Seychelles. In 2008, S4S was contracted by the UNDP Project Coordinating Unit to write a chapter on climate change education, training and awareness for Seychelles\u2019 Second National Communication (SNC) to the UNFCCC. The chapter included CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 219 a report on any climate change education and awareness initiatives since the first national communication, as well as a strategy for climate change education and awareness which was developed with inputs from a wide range of stakeholders, i.e., government, NGOs and civil societies which participated in a one-day workshop. This strategy was subsequently included by the Seychelles government as a section in Seychelles National Climate Change Strategy, launched in Copenhagen in December 2009. In mid-2009, the Seychelles National Climate Change Committee agreed to allocate a portion of SNC funding towards implementation of the education and awareness strategy. The S4S partnered up with the Sea-Level Rise Foundation, the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Transport, and the Ministry of Education to develop a campaign for raising awareness of climate change issues among various target groups: children, citizens, professionals in various sectors, members of parliament, tourists, and post- secondary students.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a1df637-dc63-455f-81a8-29fa90842e56": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a1df637-dc63-455f-81a8-29fa90842e56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "185a21ba8454270e6916033690edba7891e48f9b47b64d1b22dc7d772eeb3ef7"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa185966-46a0-43f0-844b-e0241eec0191", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c1eb0a81e0ebb92ecda58daca166fc077ba3cc8871c9967273bc30401b933d3"}}, "hash": "bd828f810bbfbdad3cbb40b6a1b2cdedc9e39a094554637e631d3368106ed337", "text": "Sustainability for Seychelles has taken the lead on many of the activities under this campaign such as: Arts-based workshops on climate change for children on school days and during school holidays; \u2022 One-day workshops with presentations and practical activities for post-secondary students in construction, \u2022 education, tourism, business studies, arts and agriculture; One-day workshops for professionals in construction, journalism, and agriculture; \u2022 One-day workshop including presentations and a field trip for members of the national assembly (Parliament) \u2022 with a special focus on renewable energy options for Seychelles; The production of an in-flight video for Air Seychelles, on how tourists in Seychelles can reduce their carbon \u2022 footprint, to be shown on all incoming flights as of 1 July 2010; The production of a banner to be hung in the capital and posters on climate change and sustainable living to \u2022 be distributed to all schools, clinics and other public places (in final production stage now); The production and dissemination of a citizen\u2019s guide on climate change and its impacts on Seychelles, and \u2022 how to mitigate and adapt to climate change at home (also in final production stage); The production and performance of a creole play on climate change and sustainable living (in collaboration \u2022 with local theatre troupe Comedie des Seychelles).

The Ministry also produced and aired a 15-minute documentary on sustainable living in collaboration with the Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation. The Ministry of Education has also been part of this campaign. It has organized a series of activities over the last few years targeting at schools, including poetry, song, art, public speaking and drama competitions, and has organized workshops for children and teachers to help them understand climate change, its expected impacts on Seychelles, and what can be done to help. All of the above activities have been undertaken in a spirit of collaboration, and most of them have been part of a coordinated campaign which is ongoing. At first the different parties met regularly to coordinate, but this became more difficult during the implementation phase and we communicated instead by email to coordinate our efforts. The media has covered many of the activities extensively (on TV, radio and printing materials). Individuals working for the different organizations have led the campaign and networked widely with other organizations, such as the Public Utilities Corporation, the Energy Commission, Seychelles Tourism Board, the Department of Risk and Disaster Management, the media, professional associations, post-secondary schools, as well as various individuals and businesses from the private sector. The Liaison Unit for NGOs in Seychelles also provided some of the funding for workshops to professionals and post-secondary students. Our challenge now will be to try and evaluate the impacts of this campaign in terms of the level of awareness of climate change in different sectors of society, and more importantly in terms of the ways in which people try to mitigate, and adapt to, climate change in their work and at home. We have tried as much as possible to link climate change education to education for sustainability-our thinking is that in many cases the behaviours for sustainable living are the same as those needed to mitigate, and adapt to, climate change. Also, by addressing sustainable living we CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 220 have been able to draw upon many of the traditional cultural practices that are more sustainable and have low-carbon footprints or actually helped people deal with problems such as drought and food security.

Energy security enables better quality education since electricity at night could increase hours of study, improving knowledge in students, and the same for electricity at schools. Beyond the Millennium Development Goal (UN Millennium Project 2005) on Primary Education, a higher and professional/ university education is needed in order to train people to be teachers, medical officers, agricultural experts (Sachs 2005), IT and energy management engineers, to harness technologies for local use and address basic technical needs at the village level. Major problems include the lack of affordable textbooks and laboratory equipment; the lack of written or printed materials in the local languages; the failure of curricula to show connections between science and the natural world; and the meagre science background among teachers. Science is usually presented to the students as a set of abstract concepts to be memorized. A way out of the dilemma may be found by relating science more directly to the natural processes going on around students in their daily lives, by making low-cost laboratory equipment, and by using devices and materials that are normally found in the community. Students could then become directly involved in the systematic procedures of science, learning valuable problem-solving skills. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 221 As noted by Low (2010), the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) has observed that \u201cThe resilience of a community in respect to potential hazard events is determined by the degree to which the community has the necessary resources and is capable of organizing itself both prior to and during times of need.\u201d (UNISDR 2009). We are talking about the resilience of a community, but how they can know about their resilience and the tremendous climate change impacts that are likely to come if there is no knowledge transfer about that? In some areas, they realize that rainy seasons are getting less and less abundant, and this causes droughts, while in other areas, they are more frequent, and this causes floods. How can the communities be resilient to climate change if they do not know about the causes, the consequences and the solutions? Public awareness is one of the most important issues that we have to strengthen and even change to follow up with the technology transfer, capacity-building, policymaking and so on, in order to achieve a sustainable development by enabling people to be capable and self-sufficient when adversities come. Villages have the ability to gather together on the village green for discussions of village issues, this should be the place to enhance public awareness with such relevant knowledge in the different topics regarding climate change and human security. Research on appropriate technologies An appropriate technology is a technology that is designed with special consideration to the environmental, ethical, cultural, social, political, and economical aspects of the community it is intended for. It requires only small amounts of capital; emphasizes the use of locally available materials, in order to lower the costs and reduce supply problems; is relatively labour-intensive but more productive than many traditional technologies; is small enough in scale to be affordable to individual families or small groups of families; can be understood, controlled and maintained by villagers whenever possible, without a high level of specific training; can be produced in villages or small workshops; supposes that people can and will work together to bring improvements to communities; offers opportunities for local people to become involved in the modification and innovation process; is flexible, can be adapted to different places and changing circumstances; can be used in productive ways without doing harm to the environment. It permits local needs to be met more effectively because local people are involved in identifying and working to address these needs; for the same reasons, it is likely to be in harmony with local traditions and values; it means the development of tools that extend human labour and skills, rather than machines that replace human labour and eliminate human skills (Darrow and Saxenian n.d.). As it means an opportunity for public participation in their own developed tools, women are encouraged to participate in the decision-making process to develop these technologies. In other words, appropriate technology approach helps to be on the path to sustainable development. Some examples of the appropriate technology approach have been developed over many years within the programmes of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or government agencies, such as smokeless \u201cchullah\u201d (\u201ckitchens\u201d in an Indian local language); twin-pit latrines; biogas", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4ed6b75-f25e-42fd-9413-38e00c7944e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4ed6b75-f25e-42fd-9413-38e00c7944e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5abdcd613407d95b672e597bd4ed0823d55007b3687bcc03867c83408f068219"}}, "hash": "5abdcd613407d95b672e597bd4ed0823d55007b3687bcc03867c83408f068219", "text": "systems; vermi composting; technologies for rainwater harvesting systems (RASTA n.d.); and so on. Policymakers responsible for the national decisions that influence technological change also need to carefully examine whether their policies are supportive of appropriate technologies. Bottom-up and top-down research National governments should escape from petrol dependence and reinforce their energy policies with renewable energy, researching in this field and promoting training of technical workers on information, installation, operation and maintenance of renewable technologies, using participative methods and contracting specialized organizations for achieving that; including education and scientific research activities. The case of India with its Indian Institutes of Technology, created in the 1950s and 1960s, is an example of good practice for government investments in ways to develop a country (Sachs 2005). Currently, there are more than 30 engineering colleges in India approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE n.d.) and 20 engineering colleges are aided by the Government of India. Now we can see how powerful India is in terms of software and information technology (IT) development. Many examples of appropriate technologies adapted to local needs have been developed as well. In any developing country, in the same fashion, home-grown technologies will be needed to adapt global processes to local needs in areas ranging from energy production and use; construction; natural hazard mitigation; disease control; and agricultural production. Some efforts are needed to create a scientific capacity in low-income regions, since for that is required supports for financing and for infrastructure. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 222 To empower people to face and to adapt to the disasters due to climate change, they should be included in the research team itself when a technology has to be implemented as a solution to mitigate the disasters. Such things like offering basic relevant science education geared to the challenges of local problems, with curricula adapted to employ available materials and common devices to illustrate principles, and providing young people and farmer-inventors with a more scientifically sound basis for their innovation efforts could help to increase the knowledge of the beneficiaries to create a better understanding about the environment itself. Energy market potential mapping Our research work is being focused to map the energy potential of a region by using GIS (Geographic Information System)-based software. The main idea is to obtain an index, the RAI (Relative Acceptance Index), calculated by adjusting several parameters, regarding economic, social and environmental issues, which reflects population necessities and demands related to energy consumption. This index should be useful to detect which technologies would be accepted by the community to use as energy generation systems. A first study is being developed on the acceptance of the solar photovoltaic technologies to obtain electricity by a pilot community (Choudhury 2004). This index is a great challenge where much work has to be done in order to collect such quantity of data from the field, since an important part of it depends on the customs and awareness of the people. This tool could be very useful for governments, international agencies, NGOs, and companies to see at a glance the regions more suitable for introducing a new technology, such as renewable energy, modern agricultural techniques, low-carbon emission technologies, etc. Experiences sharing An effective researchers\u2019 network is needed in order to keep researchers closer and to allow them to share their works and experiences for improving such research activities worldwide. Governments should promote national and international annual competitions with prizes awarded to the innovations most likely to help alleviate poverty and climate change mitigation, etc. With best regards, Paula Pons, Assistant Researcher Binoy K.

To this effect knowledge and information can help to promote awareness CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 224 and ensure that the vast majority of the people around the world are involved in discussions and proactive actions at the local, national, regional and global levels. Changes in attitudes and behaviour have started to occur over the past few years. In offices it is becoming more and more common to minimize copying and printing, to reduce paper use (using both sides of the paper), to maximize electronic means of communications, to have boxes beside photocopiers to collect used papers for recycling, to store electronic files instead of hard copies, etc. Yet, there are areas for improvement.

How to promote a change? Persistent efforts by the organization (e.g., staff association, management) through internal communications, including e-mails, white papers, newsletter articles, and brown bag discussions can help increasing awareness of energy saving and other eco-friendly opportunities. This, in turn, can help to change people\u2019s behaviour also at home. Raising employee awareness can be highly effective in saving energy. Employees who are provided energy use and cost information can reduce their energy usage much more than employees who have installed a power management software but are not provided with energy usage information (DeVetter and Breton 2009). It should be noted that providing people with information that arouses their concern about the dangers of climate change is not likely, in itself, to stimulate effective action. For concern to translate into action, people must see themselves as sharing personal responsibility for the problem and must be informed about specific actions that they can take and support to counter climate change (Patchen 2006). Initiatives on the theme of energy use and climate change, including art expositions/competitions, photography competitions, theatre/movies, etc., can be instrumental to increase awareness among the general public. Many such initiatives do exist in Asia-Pacific. Some have also been linked to the celebrations of the World Environment Day. For example, in 2009, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and Initiatives for Development and Eco Action Support (iDEAS), in collaboration with Sherwi Yondhen Tshokpa (a Sherpa youth organisation based in Khumjung), jointly organised the \u201cClimate Change: Voices of Khumbu\u2019s Children\u201d interschool art and letter writing competition. The aim of the competition was not only to encourage children from the Khumbu region to express their views on the possible impacts of climate change, but also to raise awareness of the effects of climate change among the mountain community of the Khumbu region. It also aimed at bringing the voices of mountain children from Khumbu to the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) in Copenhagen (ICIMOD n.d.). One of the UNEP initiatives supports individuals who are undertaking exceptional personal feats, high-profile expeditions, and other acts of environmental activism to demonstrate their commitment and to raise awareness for the simple idea that \u201cYour Planet Needs You\u201d. The Chinese environmental photographer Luo Hong is a climate hero. The Luo Hong Environment Foundation trains and rewards youth worldwide for environmental protection. In 2008 it sponsored UNEP\u2019s Painting Competition by Children in China, a hugely successful event with about 1.5 million participants. The competition was held again in 2009 (UNEP 2009). But do art expositions/competitions, photography competitions, theatre/movies, etc., help to increase awareness on climate change and promote environmentally friendly behaviour? I believe so. As an example, let us consider the film An Inconvenient Truth, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2007. The online Nielsen survey, one of the largest of its kind to be conducted globally on the topic of consumer attitudes to climate change, was conducted in April 2007 in conjunction with the Environmental Change Institute of Oxford University. The survey polled 26,486 internet users across 47 countries in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. The results indicated that 66 per cent of viewers who claimed to have seen An Inconvenient Truth said that the film had \u201cchanged their mind\u201d about global warming. Eighty-nine per cent said that watching the movie made them more aware of the problem. But more importantly, three out of four (74 per cent) viewers said they changed some of their habits as a result of watching the film (Nielsen 2007). Although only a few individuals may become \u201cclimate heroes or heroines\u201d, every individual has the potential to be an agent for change in his/her daily life.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 226 Dear Network Members, Role of vulnerability assessment in adaptation process and a Cambodian study As the issue on adaptation to climate change has gained more attention in the international negotiation in recent years, the need for more research on adaptation and vulnerability assessment (VA), especially in developing and least developed countries, has also become more urgent. This contribution discusses the role of vulnerability assessment in the adaptation process and highlights an ongoing research activity on adaptation in Cambodia. The concept of adaptation is closely linked to the concept of vulnerability. Adaptation has been defined and framed differently (Preston and Stafford-Smith 2009) and it usually emphasizes hazard, exposure and risk when it refers to biophysical vulnerability and will address social, economic, cultural and political processes when it refers to resilience and adaptive capacity. Adaptation can be generic or specific, autonomous or planned. Nonetheless, it is not always positive and there are always constraints, barriers and limits. The authors raised four fundamental questions relating to the adaptation process, as follows: 1) What are we adapting to?, 2) Who adapts?, 3) How do we adapt?, and 4) What do we want to achieve?. Vulnerability assessment is a central first step in informing adaptive decision-making. Different methodologies have been employed in assessing climate-related vulnerability; however, Preston and Stafford- Smith (2009) viewed climate change assessment as a process of social learning, contributing to education and building shared understanding, priority setting, evaluating decision alternatives, and implementing adaptation policy or measure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1eace579-296c-4813-9be0-12bea1cfd5f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "1eace579-296c-4813-9be0-12bea1cfd5f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "071d126f1e4af3b63b8ab8bbafa82722ba0e3ef189deab6635581b64e644d86d"}, "2": {"node_id": "56634c28-c65f-4ceb-a548-055b9f36d764", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a937ef04c039de1ff55e28dc7f85cb556eed1e71af919420f5d1e4185178678d"}}, "hash": "0e77b7705439805cd44c552b22e22c7d6db0889919fed204d1cb81b055b26d38", "text": "Integrated assessment is known to be able to generate more information.

Preliminary climate VA was undertaken initially as part of the Initial National Communication in 2001 followed by a household survey in 2005 to inform the formulation of the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA). Yet there has been a remarkable progress of VA in the recent years, for instance, not less than half a dozen of Cambodia related VA reports were published in 2009. Though VA plays an important role in the adaptation process, there are biases especially associated with changes of climate as well as socio-economic factors in the future. Furthermore, its quality can be reflected by the employed methodologies and approaches that always lack uniformity. Therefore, it may be worth to evaluate them at some point.

While there is a tacit understanding on the role of education for climate change (ECC) to support mitigation and adaptation strategies, a consensus on the conceptual approach to such an educative endeavour is yet within sight. Accepting the need for ECC raises four questions, namely: For whom is ECC intended and who provides it? 1. What should be included in the content of ECC? 2. How should the intended content be delivered? 3. How do the providers of ECC know if the intended outcomes have been achieved? 4. The framework proposed above is derived from a curriculum design framework for geography education in Chang et al. (2010). The approach uses the backward design idea based on an understanding by design framework (Wiggins and McTighe 2006). To elucidate this idea, the following paragraphs will explore how ECC can be carried out in this context, using examples from Singapore, the country the author resides in. Education being the key role of the state as proposed by Dewey (1916) supposes that the democratic ideal of a nation can best be served by education. While it is a social process, education informs and provides knowledge from which individuals can make informed choices. To this end, it is in the state\u2019s best interest to be a key player in ECC. However, this does not exclude the possible role of other stakeholders in society. In Dewey\u2019s argument, a solely state driven education may result in the exclusion of the \u201cothers\u2019\u201d voice, or worse, the absence of such voice due to socialization. Having said that, many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have increasingly taken on more active roles in ECC, annulling the concern raised above. So the who includes both the state and civil society, within Dewey\u2019s context of an education for an ideal society. While Singapore has just ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2007, there is an antecedent presence of environmental education and action in Singapore, largely motivated by governmental and NGOs alike. The first Singapore Green Plan (SGP) was presented at the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, June 1992. In 2002, a new green plan called SGP 2012 details plans to attain a vision of sustainability for 2012. It is in the 2006 revision of the SGP 2012, that clear goals for carbon intensity reduction have been set, and together with the education efforts, it has set out attain the vision to \u201caim for a population that is not only environmentally aware, but also committed to positive action and crucial community partnerships\u201d (MEWR 2006). Clearly, the Singapore case targets both students, and the general populace, providing ECC for all, thus answering the for whom question raised above. The specific targets of the SGP 2012 in relation to global warming are to reduce the ambient particulate matter 2.5 level to within an average of 15\u00b5g/Nm3 by 2014 and to reduce carbon intensity (i.e., carbon dioxide emission per gross domestic product (GDP) dollar) by 25% from 1990 level by 2012 (MEWR 2006). The action plans include raising public awareness on energy efficiency and climate change and making it mandatory for all air-conditioners and refrigerators to carry energy efficiency labels from mid-2007, while achieving a 25% reduction in carbon dioxide emission per GDP dollar can be seen as a critical step towards understanding global warming and its implications for a small island state like Singapore. The concern is how this action plan will be deployed and how the plan will be evaluated continually in light of the development in the global warming discussion in the international scientific arena. The Singapore Government may have appeared to concentrate on education activities at this time. As early as 1972, a first concerted international effort to promote environmental education emerged at the United Nations Conference on Human Environment at Stockholm. Recommendation 96 of the Stockholm conference called for the establishment of an international programme in Environmental Education as one of the most critical elements to address the world\u2019s environmental crisis. By 1975, the International Environmental Education workshop at Belgrade CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 229 established an Environmental Education Charter which provided the global framework, goals, objectives and strategies for Environmental Education. The goal of Environmental Education was to \u201cdevelop a world population that is aware of, and concerned about, the environment and its associated problems, and which has the knowledge, skills, attitudes,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3acbbd44-7ed9-4f99-a109-c9e62e13e64a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3acbbd44-7ed9-4f99-a109-c9e62e13e64a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aaa1f7246f41049daf5376f0e6e270c35bca0890a6cdd509adfdb84afde40087"}}, "hash": "aaa1f7246f41049daf5376f0e6e270c35bca0890a6cdd509adfdb84afde40087", "text": "motivations and commitment to work individually and collectively towards solutions of current problems and the prevention of new ones\u201d. In addition, the International Charter on Geographical Education (1992) calls for Geographic Education to ensure that individuals become aware of the impact of their own behaviour and that of their societies, have access to accurate information and skills to enable them to make environmentally sound decisions, and to develop an environmental ethic to guide their actions. In particular, the fourth guiding principle of the Belgrade charter states that environmental education should emphasize active participation in preventing and solving environmental problems. This raises the next question of what should be included in ECC. In Singapore, environmental education is infused through the curriculum to attain three main aims: knowledge related to environmental issues, attitudes to develop a greater sense of personal responsibility and concern for the environment and changes in behaviour to include care and concern for the environment. While the National Environment Agency (NEA), a branch of Ministry of Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) has begun to build up a network of environmental champions among students to reach out to their peers and NGOs like the Singapore Environment Council work with schools on programmes such as Schools\u2019 Green Audit Awards (Singapore Environment Council 2006), the approach is still largely informal. How do we reconcile concrete environmental action plans by the government targeted at climate change and the lack of formalized environmental education in Singapore? I would like to propose that in addition to the action plans proposed by the MEWR, environmental education in schools and to the general public should be extended to include the following so as to answer the how question raised above: a) Green schools which design and support opportunities for integrating the concepts and principles of education for sustainability into formal educational programmes from early grade school through the university level. b) Identifying and formalizing a set of essential skills and knowledge for all students that reflect a basic understanding of the interrelationships among environmental, economic, and social equity issues. c) Raising a workforce and public awareness of sustainability issues, conveying information on indicators of sustainable development, and encouraging individuals to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives, such as at work. These measures will only go as far as bringing about awareness. However, such awareness is critical for bringing about the remaking of local and global geographies into a more equal world. But then how do we know if these plans will be successful? The what question implies that in addition to simply knowing about the impacts of climate change and what are the mitigating and adaptation strategies, behaviour that is indicative of such an understanding will truly indicate if the education efforts have been successful. While the mass media has recently focused their spotlight on climate change, the plethora of reports is confined largely to the impacts of climate change and not what people can do to stop or even reverse these changes. Perhaps, the general perception is that there is little an individual can do and stopping climate change is the responsibility of policymakers and NGOs. In fact, the person on the street has as much a role to play in mitigating climate change impacts as governments and industries. It is important to consider how everyday things can contribute to climate change on a global scale and small changes in modern day living can culminate in substantial reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) and hence slow down or halt human induced climate change. The author proposes that there is much that people can translate what they have learnt from ECC as knowledge into behaviour. The author often provides a simple illustration of the carbon miles accrued on a bottle of drinking water. For a Singaporean, a bottle of Swiss Alps mineral water will definitely incur more carbon miles in transportation than a bottle of distilled water produced in Indonesia, other things being equal. Suppose, just for argument, that one gram of carbon mile is saved on each bottle of Indonesian water chosen over the Swiss Alp bottle at the supermarket, and assuming every person in Singapore drinks one bottle of drinking water a day, then a population of 5 million people will save 5 tonnes of carbon miles from this simple informed choice. However, this is just an illustration. The point offered is not to encourage the change in consumption behaviour on this simplistic basis but to consider the power of an informed choice. Often, the content of ECC does not elucidate the measureable impact certain behaviours have on climate change.

In summary, the author proposes that ECC should consider the approach used in curriculum design in its cousin fields of environmental education and geographic education, to examine the questions of for whom is ECC targeted at, by whom is it provided, what is included in the content, how should it be delivered and how do we know if the outcomes have been attained. While this argument is applied for ECC in general and not a formalized curriculum in the original works of Wiggins and McTighe (2006), the four questions will provide a semblance of a checklist in crafting an ECC programme.

Cost-Effectiveness - One of the biggest selling points of green products is its potential energy and resource efficiency. While the initial purchase price may be higher, long-term operational cost savings can convince consumers to buy green. Nonetheless, in the case of green buildings, these cost savings from energy-efficient lights and other features are passed on to the building owners and not the building users. As such, the cost-effectiveness value proposition is irrelevant to users who occupy a green building. Health and Safety - Given the many reports on sick building syndrome and its direct impact on occupants, health and safety is an important choice consideration. Sick buildings with poor indoor air quality has been linked to headaches, eye, nose, and throat irritation, dizziness and fatigue among occupants. In this regard, green buildings are particularly well placed to meet this consumer value. However, the positive health effects on green building occupants may take time to become apparent. Performance - This refers to the performance of the core attribute of a product. For example, consumers expect washing machines to deliver a clean yet gentle wash. What is the core attribute of a building? Occupants would expect a building they occupy to be functional and comfortable. In general, green buildings offer occupants generous access to natural lighting and ventilation. In addition, occupants are also provided with individual control of room temperature and lighting. Symbolism and Status - This is to position green products as status symbols. Rather than having green product perceived to be only for \u201ctree huggers\u2019\u2019 (i.e., strong green supporters), they are today marketed to appeal to the broader segment of consumers. Research has also shown that consumers respond to social pressure and hence would like to be seen as supporting a good social cause, i.e., the feel good factor (Kuusela and Spence 1999). To this end, green buildings provide a good fit in meeting the symbolism and status needs of the user. Convenience - For many consumers today, time is the only true luxury. In a time-poor society, convenience thus plays an immense role in influencing consumer\u2019s choice of product. Green products that help save time are well placed for market growth. For example, energy-saving compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs are more durable and efficient than the traditional energy-intensive incandescent bulbs, and hence offer convenience to building managers through negating the need for frequent replacement. However, for occupants, it may be a source of inconvenience as maximum light emission may take longer than a conventional bulb. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 232 Table 1. Summary of Green Building Benefits to Users Consumer Benefits Cost- Effectiveness Health and Safety Performance Symbolism and Status Convenience High Not applicable X X X Moderate Not applicable Low Not applicable X From Table 1 it is clear that three out of five user-desired attributes are highly achievable in green buildings. To this end, a strategy that draws attention to these occupant benefits will increase the likelihood of user acceptance. Building managers of green buildings should develop a series of activities to communicate these benefits to the users of green building. At the same time, where the other consumer benefits, such as convenience, scores poorly in green buildings, the answer lies in managing user expectation and providing user support. The realisation of comfort and convenience is dependent upon proper usage of green features and minor adjustment to the conventional use of space. Building managers, therefore, play a crucial role in communicating this message to the users. With better understanding, user expectations are properly set up and, hence, better acceptance of the green features. Following the communication of the user benefits of green building and its proper operation, building managers also need to provide actual operational support in helping the occupants learn how to operate in a green space. Additional manpower may be required in the first month or so of moving into a green building for this purpose.

Dear Network Members, Gold, silver, bronze \u2026 and green: The 2008 Beijing Olympics and environmental awareness As we mark the 10th anniversary of the UN Millennium Declaration, the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report (APHDR) serves as an important opportunity to review progress in Asia towards promoting \u2018Respect for Nature\u2019- identified in the Declaration as one of the six \u201cfundamental values (\u2026) essential to international relations in the twenty-first century\u201d (UN 2000). Much progress has been made and \u201cchanges in global awareness, thinking and concern about the environment have been truly fundamental over the UN\u2019s life, probably exceeding even changing ideas about human rights.\u201d (Jolly et al. 2009). In Asia, issues of environmental sustainability have indeed emerged into the public conscience as a central concern. Recent polls show high levels of citizen awareness within Asian countries on climate change and other environmental issues, many of whom surpass developed countries in terms of personal concern over climate change and commitment to take action (World Bank 2009). In China, for example, there is an increasing spirit of environmental rights, a desire particularly among the youth to address ecological change as a matter of human security and well-being of future generations. There is growing awareness that \u201cpreventing the collapse of human civilization requires a transformation of cultural patterns of human behaviour.\u201d (The Worldwatch Institute 2010). Past Cultural Revolution slogans that \u2018Man Must Conquer Nature\u2019 and \u2018Battling with Nature is Boundless Joy\u2019 have been replaced by a new vision launched by the National People\u2019s Congress for China to emerge in the 21st century as an \u2018Ecological Civilization\u2019. A renewed debate has arisen in society over the \u2018balance between humans and nature\u2019, a central concept in traditional Chinese worldviews like Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism (Weller 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "966603cc-6257-4b12-9ddd-6b26a73ec555": {"__data__": {"id_": "966603cc-6257-4b12-9ddd-6b26a73ec555", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a5259f4351f7d5be39847a1c2c86be12aa0993841ccd611e7e3d18e4df3ecf4"}, "2": {"node_id": "624aeef5-ba04-40a5-b585-73cc9f17151c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "118a4892f9668a21c9224f2f9c409eef1440055d6dd84c06d53777c4209d0909"}}, "hash": "8530f47873b5ea8d2159ce1c27c2e1d8ab41c79435d73425b77b4492a5dd310f", "text": "Towards these ends, the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games represented a landmark national event of great historic and symbolic value, and a unique opportunity to raise awareness on issues of climate change, biodiversity loss and water security.

The films were broadcast as public service announcements on China Central TV (CCTV), and the screens used within Olympic facilities, subways and buses, reaching hundreds of millions of people from around the country. UNDP, BOCOG and CCTV also undertook a process to select social and environmental leaders who contributed to Olympic preparations, with recognition and awards publicized locally and internationally through high profile concert events. This also built on cooperation forged with Al Gore\u2019s 2007 Live Earth Concert for which UNDP served as a partner in the Shanghai component of the Live Earth event. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 234 Green Torch Relay Through support of Coca Cola, an official sponsor of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, UNDP and BOCOG identified a group of eighteen local environmental champions on issues of climate change, water and biodiversity who served as Green Olympic Torch Bearers and ran the historic torch relay within China in the name of the environment. Green torch runners were leading civil society figures with a strong track record of advocating environmentalism in China-a courageous female environmental lawyer fighting challenging cases against the Government and private sector on behalf of victims of toxic pollution, gifted authors and advocates of change on issues of water conservation in China\u2019s countryside, local government champions on low-carbon approaches to growth, and visionary wildlife artists and photographers-all of whom are doing their part in galvanizing a renewed respect for nature in society. Low-Carbon and Resource Conserving Technologies A key part of Olympic preparations was the integration of low-carbon and resource conserving technologies into venue design and materials supply. UNDP and BOCOG partnered to design and display a Green Olympics exhibit in the Olympic venue raising awareness of the cutting-edge technologies and design approaches used in venue construction. Through support of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), UNDP also supported BOCOG in provision of six locally-produced electric buses which transported Olympic visitors during the Olympics and were integrated into the public transport system thereafter. This served to raise public awareness on climate change and clean energy solutions to public transport and public health, while also showcasing new clean technologies. Water Conservation Through support of Coca Cola, and in spirit of establishing a longer-term green legacy to the Olympics, UNDP and the Government launched an initiative to improve sustainable use of water in various parts of China towards goals of environmental sustainability and improving human health. Through the partnership a share of proceeds from the sale of Coca Cola Olympic souvenirs went to the initiative, engaging visitors to the Games on ways they could support a green legacy to the Games. Through an increasing focus on outreach, advocacy and awareness, China and other Asian countries are now proactively supporting higher levels of environmental consciousness in line with the Millennium Declaration call for a renewed Respect for Nature. As goes the famous Chinese saying \u201cone generation plants the seed, the other gets the shade.\u201d Actions to support environmental awareness can have strong long-term impacts in the future, shaping the young environmental leaders of the future and setting the foundations for new climate-friendly political constituencies within society to engage national and global policies to combat climate change.

The Facilitator thinks that it would have been useful if the authors can provide some analyses on how successful are these initiatives or activities, and what are the lessons learned. Dear Network Members, Inequities and barriers to sustainable development exacerbated by climate change: A role for quality education Disparities, which are exacerbated by climate change, stand in the way of countries\u2019 achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (McMichael et al. 2008). Climate change, however, also offers a great opportunity for change through the promotion of interventions aimed at positive societal transformation (reduction of disparities). Foremost among these interventions is the implementation of inclusive, more relevant education which is instrumental to bring about a radically changed environmental quality (Dahle 2007). As education to address climate change issues becomes more widespread and refined, UNICEF is considering how equity issues can be addressed and the exacerbation of disparities minimized through a quality education approach to complement governments\u2019 climate change adaptation activities. Dimensions of equity in quality education for sustainable development (*) Equity in education has two key dimensions. The first is fairness, which implies ensuring that personal and social circumstances (e.g., gender, socio-economic status or ethnic origin) should not be an obstacle to achieving one\u2019s educational potential. The second is inclusion, which implies ensuring a basic minimum standard of education for all- for example, everyone should be able to read, write and do simple arithmetic (OECD 2008). While equity in education CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 236 is a worthy goal in itself and links to human rights, equity-enhancing policies and practices, particularly an investment in quality, relevant education can, in the long run, boost economic growth and help reduce poverty (IMF 1998). It also supports long-and short-term environment outcome goals such as climate change adaptation (DFID et al. 2002). Education institutions, programmes and processes can also work to disrupt patterns of inequality, disadvantage and marginalization, helping to minimize or reverse the exacerbation of inequity being caused by climate change impacts. Child-seeking, inclusive and relevant education - i.e., outlined by UNICEF\u2019s child-friendly schooling principles (outlined below) - can help communities and children prevent disparities and adapt to and mitigate climate change impacts.

This vision of quality and access to education is in line with the current thinking around Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). ESD seeks to enable individuals to make informed and responsible decisions and actions, now and in the future. Educating about climate change also enables relevant pedagogy to build the participation, skills and attitudes needed to question the way we think, the values we hold and the decisions we make in the context of sustainable development (UNESCO 2009). The integrated, multifaceted vision provided by ESD is particularly well- suited to addressing climate change in terms of understanding its causes, recognizing its impact, and implementing appropriate responses. UNICEF promotes a model for quality education including content and pedagogy on and for climate change as a pathway to ESD. Currently, UNICEF Education for example, is supporting countries to address climate change through transformative education through child-friendly schooling in the following ways: 1) Supporting education that is relevant and child-centred-including climate change curricula to empower children with the knowledge, skills and values to survive in a disaster situation in the short term and be able to adapt to, thrive, and live sustainably in a changing environment in the long term; 2) Constructing safer schools which are more resilient to natural disasters such as the flooding and high winds caused by tropical storms and providing disaster risk education as part of UNICEF\u2019s emergency preparedness work within the context of the Education in Emergencies cluster. The cluster is currently active in 25+ countries and throughout all UNICEF country offices through the adaptation of the International Network on Education in Emergencies (INEE) (***) minimum standards for Education in Emergencies, which now include an emergency preparedness component advocated for by UNICEF Education. In addition, children\u2019s empowerment (and inclusion) through education on environment and climate change is promoted as a component of the holistic Child-Friendly Schools (CFS) initiative and includes key features such as: the promotion of sustainable facilities in schools, including alternative energies, rainwater harvesting and school gardens. UNICEF Education HQ is currently working closely with members of the inter-agency committee for the Decade for Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) in order to develop a resource pack to support the mainstreaming of climate change and environmental education into national policies and programmes, especially within the education sector. The work is being done in direct support of the goal to provide quality education for all (****). The resource pack will complement the Child-Friendly Schools manual with specific upstream guidance and resources in this field. These materials will be rolled out in conjunction with trainings on child-friendly schooling and in partnership with members of the UN inter-agency committee for DESD throughout UNICEF\u2019s network of regional and country CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 237 offices starting in 2011. In addition to developing a resource pack, UNICEF is working directly with UNDP to develop a joint learning and resources web-based platform and knowledge network that will promote and support implementation of quality education as key for climate change adaptation. The aim is also to share experiences and case studies of good practices. The platform will be linked within GEF/UNDP\u2019s Adaptation Learning Mechanism site.

Suchitra Sugar, Consultant, Education Section Programme Division, UNICEF, New York Notes (*) Sustainable development needs to be described for each of the following dimensions in their interrelation in time (past-present-future) and in space (near-far). Sustainable social development is aimed at the development of people and their social organization, in which the realization of social cohesion, equity, justice and well-being plays an important role. A sustainable environmental development (planet) refers to the development of natural ecosystems in ways that maintain the carrying capacity of the earth and respect the non-human world. Sustainable economic development (prosperity) focuses on the development of the economic infrastructure, in which the efficient management of our natural and human resources is important. It is the finding of balanced ways to integrate these dimensions in everyday living and working that poses, perhaps, the greatest challenge of our time as this requires alternative ways of thinking, valuing and acting.

Clear thinking is needed in addressing the issues of climate change. Policymakers and the public need to understand that action may be needed today to best prepare for the future. For example, in the construction of highways and drainage systems the demand of climate change needs to be considered. This thinking can be aided by simple scoping exercises in workshops. In the UK, the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) organized a number of workshops at the regional level to help identify major climate threats to different sectors. I was a facilitator at some of these, focusing on the economic evaluation of climate threats. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 239 To simply think through the possible impacts on sectors and identify possible adaptation options is in itself useful, but further analysis is also needed. Analysis of the costs and benefits of adaptation requires uncertainty to be taken into account. Uncertainty pervades the analysis of climate risks - and few probabilistic models exist of likely climate change impacts going into the future. In general, the use of scenarios is important to show that the likely implications vary by climate model and also by changes in society that may influence the analysis. In our work, the socio-economic scenario impact on costs and benefits has been shown to be important. However, a few countries have developed such scenarios-some have 2020 sketches, few think ahead to the 2050s or 2080s. It is important that the cost of adaptation be carefully considered in raising awareness on climate change. Some actions are relatively costless, and may have significant side benefits (e.g., using different materials may reduce cooling bills). Other actions come at a high cost-and here it is important that appropriate training in assessing costs into the future be given. In our work in the UK and Africa, we have often used \u201chistorical analogues\u201d-using past weather events to present a picture of what climate change may do in the future. This is useful to do-as it grounds the work in events that stakeholders can engage with. However, it does present some difficulties and ignores the potential benefits of adaptation. Using historical analogues can give significant support to awareness raising, because of the significant costs that can be attributed to such events. For example, in a recent project in Africa, we presented the costs for a number of weather events-including the 1997-98 floods in Kenya. These are shown in Table 1. Costs of US$850 to US$1213 million could be identified. Such numbers help raise awareness and give support to negotiations \u2013 as will be discussed in the next topic. Table 1. Estimated Costs of 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o Floods in Kenya Impact category Cost type Estimated costs $mn Damage to infrastructure Water systems 9 to 45 Road network, communication and buildings 670(1) to 777 Public Health Treatment costs 56 Mortality 2 to 100 Agriculture Loss of crops <1 to 122 Livestock mortality 113 Total 850 to 1213 Note: (1) based on transport alone; Sources: Based on Mogaka et al. (2006); Karanja and Mutua (2000) and own calculations. In terms of education, I was fortunate enough to be able to do an exercise with teenagers in my home town of Bath and ask them to think about the likely consequences of climate change on teenagers-thinking through issues such as cancellation of sporting events due to heavy rain, the impact of hot summers on the activities done, the health implications. Such activities help to give the next generation insights into the risks of climate change. The need for a better informed public and efficient policy is clear. The difficulty is to ensure that appropriate action is taken-so we can avoid constructing in flood zones, act to reduce the impacts without incurring huge costs in the future, and balance the needs of this generation against the needs of the next.

She thus proposes to use \u201cecological footprint\u201d to increase the public \u201cawareness on climate change\u201d. Indeed, the concept of ecological footprint is simple, and it is an indicator for environmental sustainability within the context of \u201cbio-capacity\u201d or the Earth\u2019s \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d (in terms of \u201cthe amount of biological productive land and water required to meet the needs of an individual, community or a population and absorb the waste they generate\u201d).

Other environmental issues, such as land degradation/desertification, toxic chemical pollution and possible synergistic effects of pollutants; and even innovative eco-designs (e.g., green buildings that create energy), can also affect environmental sustainability. Dear Network Members, How and why ecological footprint can be used to increase awareness about climate change In recent years knowledge and awareness about climate change have increased mainly because of national and international efforts. The voice raised by international conventions like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which won the Nobel Peace Prize (jointly with Al Gore) in 2007, should be acclaimed. However, I feel that the debate is more among the scientific experts, the governments, and I wonder how much the general public knows and debates about climate change. I think that in day-to-day life, climate change is not easily distinguished from climate variability, which is happening with or without global warming factors. Thus, it is imperative to make the general public aware of climate change and its impacts in such a way that they can contribute to reduce climate change adverse impacts. People should be at the centre of development and any development agenda will be futile if greater public support is unavailable. To enlighten the public about this scientific related issue, it is important to make the message easily understandable. I would like to propose to use ecological footprint to increase awareness on climate change. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 241 What is the ecological footprint? It is a measure of the demand human activity puts on the biosphere. It measures the amount of biological productive land and water required to meet the needs of an individual, community or a population and absorb the waste they generate (Ewing et al. 2009).

It is a snapshot measure and typically refers to average annual consumption. Results are usually presented on a per capita basis using a standardized unit of area, the global hectare (gha) (Barrett et al. 2004). While any indicator has its weaknesses, I believe that the ecological footprint can go a long way, as it can be applied in varied circumstances at an individual as well as global level. Further, this can be presented as a simple measure as it deals mainly with two aspects, namely, how much earth resources are available and how much resources are consumed. There are many people-friendly ways for the public to comprehend what these footprints are. There are a number of websites developed to calculate even individual footprints. This may also be presented as a bank statement for easy understanding: are we living within our ecological budget or spending more than we can afford?

This interest could then be capitalized and should be fed into educational streams, media institutions and so on for wider knowledge. This can lead to a public debate on the sustainability of the existing lifestyle, and on the strategies to reduce the footprint (Ziaka 2005). Considering the potential that ecological footprints have to increase awareness, the Global Footprint Network, in partnership with Angenius and Mediation & Environment, created an interactive tool for calculating the footprint of the waste collection portion of SITA\u2019s (SITA, is one of the largest waste management companies in France) operations. SITA also uses the ecological footprint as a conceptual tool to help them and their customers understand the ecological value of waste as an opportunity for creating footprint savings. By creating and making awareness of their footprint calculator and embracing the footprint conceptual framework, SITA has successfully emerged as green waste managers and was able to compete for waste management bids in the industry (Global Footprint Network 2010). Students in schools and universities could be given mini projects to find out the ecological footprints of certain areas and certain institutions etc. Some competitions could be also created (Ziaka 2005). In Abu Dhabi, directors of 27 schools have signed a pledge demonstrating their commitment to the Sustainable Schools Initiative. They pledged to reduce their schools\u2019 ecological footprints. The initiative links them with the community through varied activities and promotes environmental sustainability in Abu Dhabi Emirate with concrete deliverables. The schools will work to reduce their ecological footprint as they target to reduce their water and energy consumption and waste, and will build capacity of their teachers through training. Their students will be empowered through environmental clubs and they will take their students \u2018back to nature\u2019 through hands-on field experiences (AMEInfo.com 2009) The media can also be used to increase awareness of people, by creating questions and answers sessions with experts on how to calculate the footprints, how to reduce certain footprints etc. The production of mini soap operas monitoring certain footprints, and the involvement of celebrities in publicity can also help promote awareness. Through these calculations and initiatives, people can be more aware of the interdependence of our lifestyle and its environmental impacts on the rest of the world, regions and cities. Therefore, we can enhance a social movement towards reducing our over-consumptions and contribute to reducing the adverse impacts of climate change.

However, a few contributions have also touched upon multiple issues (e.g., research, education and training by Paula Pons and Binoy K. Choudhury; research and communication by Trevor Booth; awareness and education by Michele Martin; research, awareness and education by Tim Taylor). On research, Prathivadi Bhayankaram Anand emphasized the need for the social science input, especially governance; the need for \u201cmaintaining an approach of critical scrutiny\u201d; and the need to prioritize mitigation and adaptation measures due to scarce resources in developing countries and to avoid \u201cincorrect priorities\u201d. He also emphasized the importance of engaging the wider public for better policymaking. Trevor Booth highlighted the development of a Marine Climate Change Report Card, \u201cthe first-ever Australian benchmark of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems\u201d, including the development of communication programmes to convey relevant messages to a broad audience (e.g., through websites). This has provided useful experience for other Asia-Pacific countries. Sukthawee Suwannachairop stressed the importance of community-led participatory research (or the villagers research) in vulnerability and adaptation assessment, as well as the need to support a constructive and functioning Track III diplomacy, such as to provide the NGOs with \u201cparallel meeting where climate change adaptation issues can be discussed openly and the marginalized groups can make their voice heard\u201d. Paula Pons and Binoy K. Choudhury discussed the need for research (and also education and training) on appropriate technologies that encourage public participation as an important tool for achieving sustainable development, and national policies must be \u201csupportive of CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 243 appropriate technologies\u201d, such as renewable energy technologies, including \u201chome-grown technologies\u201d. They also stressed the importance of tapping the innovativeness of people, particularly \u201cyoung people and farmer-inventors\u201d. Va Dany discussed the concepts of adaptation and vulnerability, the role of vulnerability assessment (VA) in the adaptation process, and methodologies. She introduced an ongoing research study (2009-2012) undertaken by the Royal University of Phnom Penh \u201cto evaluate the linkages of VA and adaptation strategy in the water and health sectors in Cambodia\u201d within the context of national poverty reduction strategies, while strengthening the \u201clocal and national capacity to conduct VA in order to enhance local and national adaptive capacity\u201d. Linda Too observed that \u201cpersonal benefit is a key determinant\u201d for the \u201cvast majority of the consumers/users\u201d in making \u201ctheir purchase decision\u201d, and thus there is a need to nurture green building occupants for \u201cbetter acceptance of the green features\u201d from a green marketing perspective. Apart from environmental benefits, the consumers are also concerned about \u201ccost-effectiveness, health and safety, performance, symbolism and status, and convenience\u201d, all of which could affect their \u201csatisfaction\u201d in staying in the green buildings. Thus, a strategy, with \u201cactual operational support\u201d, \u201cis required to gain user acceptance and support, i.e., to encourage buy-in of green features\u201d. On education and training, Chew-Hung Chang used four important framework questions to \u201cprovide a semblance of a checklist\u201d in crafting an education for climate change (ECC) programme: (1) For whom is ECC intended and who provides it?; (2) What should be included in the content of ECC?; (3) How should the intended content be delivered?; and (4) How do the providers of ECC know if the intended outcomes have been achieved? He also used these questions to gauge the progress of various environmental education activities that have been undertaken by both the government and the non-governmental organizations in Singapore since 1972, including the first Singapore Green Plan (SGP) in 1992 and its new SGP 2012. His ideas of \u201cgreen schools\u201d and green workforce are innovative. He believes that \u201cthe person on the street has as much a role to play in mitigating climate change impacts as governments and industries\u201d, and the consumers\u2019 choice of products could make a significant difference in terms of reducing \u201ccarbon miles\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a53031fc-0910-4d8d-9428-3dac51c2c4d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "a53031fc-0910-4d8d-9428-3dac51c2c4d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a74c0df2a61e2a8e42339d708f95c1f0266bfb56433076370772b1483523c72d"}, "2": {"node_id": "37b05b20-9864-4f41-be88-cc6952125547", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad809408fd674bdcba454a15ce57b2b01005d29cd04f2ec7ee98237c774c9285"}}, "hash": "f3da3140841479680ed354366776314608e447077072b463b9d41a7b99531d60", "text": "Stephanie Hodge and Suchitra Sugar stressed that \u201ccurrent education must be transformed to be inclusive, protective, democratic and child-centred\u201d, and it is important \u201cto uphold a vision of quality and access to education for all\u201d within the context of \u201cEducation for Sustainable Development (ESD)\u201d, which \u201cis particularly well- suited to addressing climate change in terms of understanding its causes, recognizing its impact, and implementing appropriate responses\u201d.

Tim Taylor also emphasized the importance of education that provides \u201cthe next generation\u201d the \u201cinsights into the risks of climate change\u201d. On public awareness, Purba H. Rao found from their survey that both the executives/managers of large corporations and the \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs were aware of climate change and its impacts. However, unlike large corporations, the SMEs found it difficult to get \u201cclimate friendly\u201d projects because they lack funding, intensive capital, manpower and technical know-how. She proposed two ways to overcome this dilemma: (1) \u201cinclusive growth to sustainability\u201d (i.e., let the large corporations show the way through forums and expertise advice by enabling the SMEs to follow their examples); and (2) Green supply chain management that holds \u201cregular awareness seminars\u201d to help suppliers and business partners to go green. Michele Martin shared the successful experience of the various public awareness activities undertaken by Sustainability for Seychelles (S4S), \u201ca non-governmental organization (NGO) established in 2007 to promote sustainable living in Seychelles\u201d. The S4S activities used various means, including workshops, media and art forms, targeting at different groups (e.g., children, post-secondary students, citizens, professionals in various sectors, tourists, members of parliament, various government ministries and private sector), and linked \u201cclimate change education to education for sustainability\u201d, including traditional cultural practices. Elena Borsatti emphasized the critical importance of \u201cchanges in individual attitudes and behaviour\u201d in preserving the environment and combating climate change, and hence the need for \u201cknowledge and information\u201d in raising the public awareness to initiate such changes \u201cat the local, national, regional and global levels\u201d. She cited a number of good environmental practices to reduce waste and save energy, and highlighted various initiatives that \u201cincrease awareness on climate change and promote environmentally friendly behaviour\u201d, including \u201cindividuals who are undertaking exceptional personal feats, high-profile expeditions, and other acts of environmental activism\u201d to publicize environmental causes. Her conclusion was particularly perceptive: \u201cAlthough only a few individuals\u201d may become \u201cclimate heroes or heroines\u201d, \u201cevery individual has the potential to be an agent for change CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 244 in his/her daily life.\u201d Kishan Khoday highlighted the \u201chigh levels of citizen awareness within Asian countries on climate change and other environmental issues\u201d and cited China where \u201cthere is an increasing spirit of environmental rights, a desire particularly among the youth to address ecological change as a matter of human security and well-being of future generations\u201d. The growing environmental awareness in China was best captured in the green 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. He highlighted the significance of four key activities supported by UNDP: (i) Olympic Film and TV Campaign to publicize environmental themes; (ii) Green Torch Relay by \u201ca group of eighteen local environmental champions\u201d who served as Green Olympic Torch Bearers; (iii) Low-Carbon and Resource Conserving Technologies were integrated \u201cinto venue design and materials supply\u201d; and (iv) Water Conservation initiative \u201cto improve sustainable use of water in various parts of China towards goals of environmental sustainability and improving human health\u201d. Tim Taylor highlighted the important linkage between \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cawareness of climate change in the eye of the public\u201d.

Opening Message Dear Network Members, Global climate change negotiations have started more than twenty years ago, and indeed scientists have observed climate change for decades before the negotiations leading to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which began in 1990. However, the world\u2019s attention has been focused on these negotiations since the Bali Action Plan was adopted in 2007. In Copenhagen, the expectations were that these negotiations would be ended and that all world leaders would then give their final approval of the \u201cagreed outcome\u201d. The travesty of the multilateral, intergovernmental process which occurred in Copenhagen did not allow this to happen, and the negotiations were then extended, with the hope that they will be ended in Mexico in December 2010. Contrary to what is propagated in the mainstream media, the Copenhagen Conference of the Parties (COP) did not fail because of the failure of the multilateral process. Rather, it failed because it did not respect the intergovernmental, multilateral process usually followed within the United Nations. Agreement was reached among a very limited number of countries, and indeed in the months leading up to Copenhagen, agreement was promoted through a limited group of countries that became part of \u201chigh-level meetings\u201d, \u201ccircles of commitment\u201d, and other groupings and meetings outside of the UNFCCC process. Sovereign equality of States is the first principle of the UN Charter, and this was trampled upon in Copenhagen. It is now disconcerting to note that in many statements, some countries, in particular developed countries, are indicating that the negotiations might not end in Mexico but could be extended to the 17th COP session in South Africa in 2011. Developing countries, through the Group of 77 and China, have made it clear that they seek a concrete legally-binding outcome in cancun, Mexico, one that would be balanced, comprehensive and equitable in nature. The Bali Roadmap is made up of two parallel processes. The first, handled through an ad hoc Working Group on the further commitments of Parties included in Annex I of the Convention under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP) started in 2006, based on the legal mandate given in Article 3.9 of the Protocol. It provides for negotiations on the commitments for subsequent periods of these Parties, started seven years before the end of the first commitment period in 2012, to ensure that there would be no gap between the first and the second commitment periods. The Protocol is the quantification of the legally-binding commitments for emission reductions of developed country Parties (Annex I countries) under the Convention, in terms of \u201cquantified emission limitation or reduction commitments\u201d (QELRCs). The United States, a Party to the UNFCCC, signed but did not submit the Kyoto Protocol (KP) for ratification under its internal ratification process. The US has also made it clear that they will not ratify the KP. Under the ongoing negotiations, it became evident that some developed countries, which are Parties to the KP, are intending to get out of their obligations under the KP and to define these obligations only under the Convention. Other Annex I countries, if they continue with the KP, would like to see comparable obligations between them and the US as an outcome of these processes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa77b898-32d1-484f-842d-1c835f945d7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa77b898-32d1-484f-842d-1c835f945d7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c887b32935fbfc558b508126376f2fb15b01d260a0c004dfb7cbc31cfc63ebde"}, "2": {"node_id": "928db482-304c-4628-a759-2c2ee3406501", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5dc63ffac689e41af29a60938c5ccd1e1e8ecb581eb30e049fc4b69ff0b422e7"}}, "hash": "6659de156c0fe9f2a78f150bc48c2463a1efdae7f97771eaf7fc5dfe534def93", "text": "The second process is that of the Bali Action Plan (BAP), which launched a process for the \u201clong-term cooperative action for the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention\u201d in 2007, with the objective of arriving at an \u201cagreed outcome\u201d at the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) which took place in Copenhagen in 2009.

The BAP has no legal basis under the Convention. The only new issue in the BAP is the paragraph dealing with developing countries\u2019 \u201cnationally-appropriate mitigation actions\u201d (now known as NAMAs), which, together with the enabling means and support provided by developed countries to developing countries, would be subject to measurement, reporting and verification (MRV). The two main objectives of developed country Parties are to get developing countries, starting with a group they refer to as \u201cmajor developing economies\u201d, but also to be extended to all developing countries, to undertake mitigation actions, even targets or commitments, and to subject these actions CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 247 to measurement, verification and reporting at international levels. The \u201cmajor developing economies\u201d are made up of the biggest economies in the developing world, namely, China, Brazil, South Africa, and India (even if the latter, by all criteria, can be included among the least-developed economies), known under the acronym BASIC countries since late 2009. Under the Convention, the only legally-mandated reporting and reviews are related to mitigation commitments of developed country Parties, and their obligations to provide financial and technology support and enabling means, including for adaptation, to developing country Parties. Developing country Parties have no binding commitments for mitigation under the UNFCCC, unlike developed country Parties, and their obligations related to mitigation are on the formulation, implementation, publication, and regular updating of national programmes containing measures to mitigate and measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change (Article 4.1-b of the Convention). The \u201cfirst and overriding priorities\u201d of developing countries are \u201ceconomic and social development and poverty eradication\u201d, and the extent to which they will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention \u201cwill depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology\u201d, taking into account these overriding priorities (Article 4.7). It is also important to keep in mind that the objective of the Convention consists not only of its ultimate objective, but provides the parameters under which this ultimate objective is to be reached, that is \u201cwithin a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner\u201d (Article 2). This understanding of the context in which the current negotiations are being undertaken is crucial for the evaluation of the ongoing global climate change negotiations, and their implications for future generations. Developing countries are fighting for their rightful share of the remaining environmental and developmental space much of which have been occupied by developed countries since the industrial revolution through their unrestricted growth which led to an accumulation of the long-lived greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and caused climate change. Developed countries are focused on striving to guard the benefits that they have derived from this over-occupation of the atmosphere, and limiting the economic consequences to them of any equitable sharing of this environmental and developmental space. They start by offering financial \u201cfast-track\u201d financing and other financial amounts that are totally inadequate to meet the needs of developing countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, develop in a sustainable manner and contribute their equitable share in mitigation, while struggling to provide a decent living standard for their populations. This financing is to be channelled by voluntary contributions through existing financial institutions, subject to the conditionalities which have rendered such financing ineffective in the past, without the recognition that the provision of financial resources is a commitment that the developed countries have agreed to under the Convention, except by some lip service to it. Financing under the Convention is a commitment of developed countries, and is not development assistance nor bilateral aid, although these channels can provide supplementary sources of financing. Moreover, most of the financing for climate change have been related to mitigation whereas adaptation is an urgent and crying need for all developing countries. Developing countries have contributed least to the problem of climate change and yet they are the most exposed to its adverse effects. Meeting costs of adaptation for countries that are \u201cparticularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change\u201d is likewise a commitment of developed countries under the Convention (Article 4.4), and yet much of adaptation financing is seen as some kind of \u201csocial responsibility\u201d or supplementary financing to mitigation, in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4eba31e-6217-4872-9b0d-e19f24ef2121": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4eba31e-6217-4872-9b0d-e19f24ef2121", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9801043cfd62de37546cd8f77f6a9085994700cc6dfb4f16696bccfcb64245f"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a788c4c-59f3-44e9-b0ab-66fb1c35dbb4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7ab1eba1a49adf31711514c0614d10a040c2e4eabbd9ad402642aa1ea2ac394"}}, "hash": "5e9d6f2e8020102ceca82dd23d6722a7dfddd6f4975e7b340088976f0ed017aa", "text": "particular as it does not lend itself to any kind of \u201cglobal benefit\u201d. The Convention specifies \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d situations in countries in its preambular paragraph 19, and states that \u201clow-lying and other small island countries, countries with low-lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods, drought and desertification, and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change\u201d. These cover situations that could be found in all developing countries. References to \u201cmost\u201d vulnerable are judgmental in nature, and are not found in the Convention. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 248 Very little transfer of technology has taken place, even under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a mechanism through which developing countries undertake mitigation project activities whose \u201ccertified emissions reduction units\u201d are added to the assigned amounts of developed countries. This means that reductions made in developing countries can be bought to allow developed countries to emit a similar amount, which accounts for the CDM to be considered as a \u201cflexible mechanism\u201d, used by developed countries to allow them some flexibility to reach their mitigation targets. Developing countries are seeking to address these gaps in implementation of the Convention under the AWG-LCA, while maintaining the integrity of the KP intact. It must also be noted that the KP targets of developed countries are very low, even compared to the findings of the second assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1996. Given the remaining atmospheric space, developing countries are seeking targets that would limit the temperature increase from 1 to 1.5\u00b0C under the AWG-KP process, even while regional differences would mean that this limit would be higher in some regions, especially Africa. Moves by some developed countries to abandon the Protocol, clearly stated by them under the ongoing negotiations, mean that the negotiations will go on until an outcome is reached under the AWG-LCA. In the contributions under this sub-theme, network members might address topics such as: The implications of a \u201cbelow 2\u00b0C\u201d limit of temperature increase to countries in the Asia-Pacific region, both \u2022 in scientific and technical terms as well as its impacts on the economic and social development of present and future generations; All relevant activities that are taking place in the region to demonstrate that Asia-Pacific countries are \u2022 contributing their share to the global effort to address climate change and its adverse effects; Financing and technology needs assessments in countries in the region in order to undertake both mitigation \u2022 and adaptation activities; How can developing countries in the region make a difference in the ongoing negotiations; \u2022 What would another failure in Mexico mean to developing countries in the region; and \u2022 What would consist of a \u201csuccess\u201d in Mexico and how countries in the region could influence this success. \u2022 The well-being, indeed for some even the existence of future generations of developing countries in the region, as in much of the developing world, is at stake in the ongoing negotiations. The financial and technological implications are enormous, but little compared to what is being spent in other activities in the developed world. Much remains to be done, and countries in the region are in a position to do something about it. I am looking forward to rich and meaningful discussions under this sub-theme.

She sees the direct impacts of climate change on individuals and communities as exacerbating factors of existing vulnerabilities, in particular on women, children, the disabled, the poor, and the elderly. Human rights of these vulnerable groups including those for participation in decision-making, access to education, adequate health services and housing, are critical elements for climate change adaptation. She cites the work done in UN agencies in using HRBA in the development assistance as a means of integrating human rights considerations in responses to climate change and its adverse effects through adaptation. More than the mere reflection of human rights in current negotiating texts in climate change, she promotes the need \u201cto ensure that human rights are in fact respected and protected in the actual implementation of climate change policies and programmes, to the benefit of people, especially the most vulnerable\u201d, as is being done by the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) of the United Nations. Dear Network Members, Global negotiations from Copenhagen to Mexico: Implications for future generations and the need for a human rights-based approach Climate change and the impact on human rights When the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution last year (Human Rights Council 2009 (*)) calling attention to the many impacts of climate change on human rights, and warning that its effects \u201cwill be felt most acutely by those segments of the population who are already in a vulnerable situation\u201d, it was making a statement of fact about the crisis. But when it affirmed that \u201chuman rights obligations and commitments have the potential to inform and strengthen international and national policymaking in the area of climate change,\u201d it was issuing a call to action, and reminding us of the urgency of applying a human rights-based approach (HRBA) to the global response to the crisis. Responding to that call will require clear thinking, and urgent action. Here is what I mean. A human rights-based approach (HRBA) A HRBA underlines the need to bring the human dimension to the centre of the climate change debate, with a focus squarely on rights-holders. Yes, climate change has a negative impact on States and economies. But, more fundamentally, the threat is to individuals and communities. Applying a HRBA therefore requires an assessment of how climate change-related threats affect individuals and communities, especially the most vulnerable, among them women, children, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and people living in poverty. Let us face it, climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, which, in turn, are determined by factors such as discrimination, health status, and restricted access to food, water, housing, and land. A HRBA recognizes that human rights, including the ability to participate in decision-making processes, access to education, adequate health services and housing, are critical elements of effective climate change adaptation. In other words, it is not only about deserts and glaciers, political negotiations and conferences. It is about people, and their ability to live, as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) tells us we are born, \u201cfree and equal in dignity and rights\u201d (Article 1). This analysis takes account, as well, of duty bearers. The climate change crisis, after all, is not an accident of nature. A human rights approach begins with the recognition that both the causes of climate change, and options for responding to it and mitigating its effects, are matters of human choice-choices that are in the hands of governments, companies, and other actors at the local, national and international levels. In practical terms, a HRBA can be used to guide policies and measures of response and mitigation. It can inform assessments, and strengthen processes, ensuring access to essential information, effective participation, and the provision of effective remedies. Thankfully, CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 250 a forthcoming Guidance Note for UN country teams (UNCTs) on Integrating Climate Change Considerations in the Country Analysis and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) integrates a HRBA, requiring that UNCTs consider in what ways, and to what extent, anticipated changes in climate will impede economic and social development at relevant levels, including consideration of poverty reduction, strengthening human rights and improving human health and well-being. For our part, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is working to support the development of UNCT capacity to mainstream human rights in UN programmes. For example, human rights and gender equality were mainstreamed in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of programmes in the UNDAF for the Pacific sub-region for 2008-2012 (United Nations Development System Fiji and Samoa 2007) (**).

More concretely, the UN system participated in the drafting of an Early Recovery Framework shortly after the tsunami on 29 September 2009 in Samoa, which intends that future early recovery efforts \u201cpremised on rights based principles will integrate environmental standards and mitigation measures for climate change and disaster risk reduction\u201d (Office of the UN Resident Coordinator 2009). Global negotiations and the way forward \u2013 \u2018Delivering as one\u2019 on climate change The UN will continue to play an essential role in supporting the international community\u2019s efforts to combat climate change as the world prepares for the 16th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 16) in cancun. And there are encouraging signs that our collective support will have a strong human rights foundation. References to human rights and to Human Rights Council Resolution 10/4 are included in the latest UNFCCC text to facilitate negotiations among Parties (UNFCCC 2010). The UN Development Group task team on climate change and environmental sustainability, and the UN system Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), have led an initiative on \u201cdelivering as one\u201d (***) on climate change in the run up to Copenhagen. Its Statement of Purpose notes that climate change impacts are \u201cdisproportionately affecting the poor and vulnerable, those who have the weakest capacity for resilience\u201d, and that \u201cclimate change in all its dimensions must be addressed within the broader context of sustainable development, which includes economic advancement, poverty eradication and environmental protection, elements that are essential to the realization of human rights and the achievement of the MDGs and other internationally and nationally agreed goals and aspirations\u201d (CEB n.d.-b). The CEB has itself emphasized that \u201cupholding human rights in all their aspects has to be a core component of adaptation action\u201d (CEB n.d.-a), and identified OHCHR as a specific actor with regard to monitoring climate impacts and vulnerability (CEB 2008). We are ready to do our part. OHCHR will continue to contribute to specific UN system initiatives, and to press the case that \u201chuman rights standards and principles should inform and strengthen policymaking in the area of climate change, promoting policy coherence and sustainable outcomes\u201d (OHCHR 2009). We will continue to draw attention to the importance of ensuring that references to human rights in the agreed outcome text at COP 16 be consistent with relevant international human rights instruments. And we will continue to advocate for a human rights-based approach to the global response to climate change. But the real challenge will be to ensure that human rights are in fact respected and protected in the actual implementation of climate change policies and programmes to the benefit of people, especially the most vulnerable.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 252 Maria Melinda Ando wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note (Bernarditas Muller): In her contribution, Maria Melinda Ando disputes the claim that population control and reduction would be an adequate response to the challenge of climate change. She begins by citing the lessons learned from the International Conference on Population and Development and its Programme of Action of 1994 and the shift to a people-centred, rights-based and women-empowerment approach to development. The contribution correctly argues that growing populations are not synonymous with higher emissions if one considers per capita emissions, and that the focus on population growth ignores other driving factors for high-energy use such as consumption patterns. The contribution also notes that fertility rates are already declining in many developing countries and that in China, these have reached below replacement levels. It affirms that other mitigation policies focused on reducing energy consumption would have a greater impact on climate change than reducing birth rates, especially on the lowest-level energy consumers. Maria Melinda Ando also recalls that the greater responsibility for historical emissions is on countries that have the lowest population levels as stated in scientific findings for the causes of climate change. \u201cEquitable and just climate change strategies should not displace responsibility for carbon emissions upon those least responsible for them\u201d, the contribution concludes. Dear Network Members, Justice, equality and rights (and not population reduction): The answer to climate change Two years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, 179 governments signed the International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action (ICPD POA) in Cairo in 1994. The ICPD POA marked a historic global paradigm shift, from a population control development approach to one that is people-centred, rights-based and considers women\u2019s empowerment as a cornerstone of development. However, the renewed international concern over climate change has resulted in setbacks. Arguments that overpopulation is the main driver of climate change, and that population reduction is more cost-effective and politically feasible than other means of carbon emission reduction, are gaining new ground. It is thus critical that ongoing and future climate change negotiations, including at the next gathering of the Conference of the Parties in cancun, Mexico at the end of the year, consider lessons learned from ICPD.

Climate change measures that do not take account of these other factors are likely to fail. Silliman also notes that 1/6 of the world population live in countries with extremely low rates of consumption, including energy consumption, and therefore have minimal impact on climate. Yet, most of these countries have higher rates of population growth. Hence, they are targeted by population control advocates, who argue that it is the large and growing populations of these countries that threaten climate change. However, according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the largest emissions of greenhouse gases (both historical and current) originate in developed countries. Industrialized countries with 20 per cent of the world\u2019s population are responsible for 80 per cent of the accumulated carbon build-up in the atmosphere.

Equitable and just climate change strategies should not displace responsibility for carbon emissions upon those least responsible for them. The emphasis on reducing birth rates also overlooks that in many countries, including in the Asia and the Pacific, fertility rates are already declining. In some countries with large populations, such as China, the total fertility rates are already below replacement level. Additionally, a focus on population reduction ignores that corporations and the military industrial complex contribute significantly to climate change and environmental degradation. Moreover, according to Silliman (2009), history shows that \u201cpopulation control strategies have inevitably led to abuses, coercion and the violation of women\u2019s fundamental rights.\u201d Despite the promise of ICPD, the 2009 ICPD+15 CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 253 monitoring study by the Asian Pacific Resource and Research Centre for Women (ARROW) reveals that these violations persist on the ground (Thanenthiran and Racherla 2009). Fertility levels were considered as \u2018too high\u2019 in 9 of 12 Asian population policies examined, and policies aimed at lowering them focused narrowly on birth control. The burden of contraception mostly fell on women. A case study in Bogor, Indonesia (Habsjah 2009) shows that the population control approach, both in policy and practice, still prevails. Forced to reach numeric targets, family planning workers resort to mass campaigns which have serious implications on women\u2019s rights. A climate change agenda centred on population reduction would no doubt exacerbate this situation, and erode gains made by rights-respecting policies and programmes. Silliman (2009) further asserts, \u201cAs a matter of human rights, women\u2019s right to control their own fertility should not be sacrificed to protect the environment. Nor is that sacrifice necessary. Cutting CO2 emissions through new energy-saving technologies and changed consumption patterns would do a great deal more to protect the climate. For example, increased public transport, fuel-efficient cars and a reduction in the number of automobiles would have a greater, more immediate impact on reducing climate change than reducing birth rates, especially the birth rates of the lowest level consumers.\u201d Furthermore, it must be recognised that when women have greater access to education and employment, more say in household and community decision-making (including over their own fertility), access to quality sexual and reproductive health services (which includes quality contraceptive services as one aspect), and are assured of the future prospects of their children, fertility rates inevitably decline. Finally, population control strategies may also crowd out other important development agendas related to women\u2019s health and rights, as well as exclude those who fall outside the ambit of \u2018married women of reproductive age\u2019 favoured by such policies and programmes, such as adolescents, sex workers, women with disabilities, and people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identities. Additionally, Silliman (2009) observes that it may endanger funds for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies since developed countries may opt to limit their climate change strategy to fund family planning in developing countries. Furthermore, she observes that population reduction may also \u201cundermine efforts by developing countries to incorporate legitimate demographic concerns in national climate adaptation plans.\u201d Going to Mexico and beyond, our agenda to address climate change must not only challenge the seemingly solid links between climate change and overpopulation, it must also integrate concepts of social justice, gender equality and human rights. Climate change solutions must not only ensure that those most responsible for carbon emissions have the greatest responsibility in solving the climate change problem. These measures must also address the gender dimensions of climate change.

In the run up to COP 15, concerns about equity and fairness remained in the background, overtaken by issues of effectiveness of technology transfer, climate finance mechanisms, and enforceability of emission reduction targets. However, the most formidable challenge at COP 15-and indeed the roadblock to successful negotiations-was the issue of fairness. The accepted wisdom in the build up to Copenhagen was that, after nearly twenty years of the UNFCCC, international environmental law on climate change had already reached a level of normativity, and thus focus should be on improved systems of compliance rather than debating basic principles. The re-emergence of Asia at the centre of the world economy, and as a primary source of future carbon emissions, challenged these assumptions. At COP 15, the US and many other developed countries were interested in persuading large developing countries such as China and India to commit to emission reduction targets because of Asia\u2019s large share of future emissions. However, as China and India have low per capita emissions levels, and as developed countries have high per capita emissions levels-both historical and future emissions-this sparked an unresolved argument about fairness. For some policymakers and civil society activists, decades of debate have come down to this fundamental question: How much should a person consume? The India-based research institute, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), hosted a side event on 12 December 2009 proposing methods of redressing the fairness deficit by focusing on the aforementioned question. TERI proposed a climate regime based not only on national emission levels and future emissions, but also based on the premise that every global citizen holds an equal right to consumption (TERI 2009). Thus, historic patterns of consumption in developed countries should be balanced with the right of citizens in developing countries to adequate levels of energy consumption for sustainable human development. As all people enjoy an equal right to human development, it is unfair to constrain per capita energy consumption increases in poor communities to compensate for the historic and ongoing overconsumption of a relatively small group of rich citizens and industries. By taking this logic further, one has to move beyond the developed and developing country dichotomy. While large emerging economies like China and India will produce the majority of future emissions, such emissions will come mainly from those provinces and states witnessing rapid urban industrial growth. These areas are also the main focus of voluntary energy intensity reduction initiatives. But significant internal disparities exist in per capita energy consumption and emissions in China and India, both between urban and rural areas, and between different provinces/states. The rural poor and less developed provinces/states have unmet needs for energy consumption towards achieving MDGs and national development goals. Thus, combining equity with sustainability is not only central to agreement on the global level, but it is equally important at the national and subnational levels, as countries seek to balance global and national energy intensity reduction targets with the right of the poor to increased consumption and development. As illustrated at COP 15, the discourse on resource consumption and climate change is increasingly focusing on the gap between the rich and poor, both between and within countries. Thus, there is growing urgency and momentum for finding coherence between equity and sustainability in new climate governance regimes (Meadowcroft 2009). Fairness in climate governance is being defined both globally and locally as a principle of retributive justice (fairness as redress for past emissions by the wealthy) and as a principle of distributive justice (fairness as need-based or capacity-based burden-sharing for the benefit of the poor). However, understanding the interplay between institutions at global, national and subnational levels of governance is still limited (Gunningham et al. 1998; and Young 2002), with current systems described as \u201cnested structures of rules within rules, within further rules\u201d (Ostrom 2007). Thus, we need to explore new institutional capacities through which climate regimes can be made fair, and through which fairness of climate-related decision-making can be improved at global and local levels. Judicial institutions will be of particular importance in resolving tensions between global and local regimes and in crafting new jurisprudence on the balance between environment and development. For instance, in 2007, the US Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) issued the first climate decision in the US. A group of NGOs and coastal local governments argued that the Government\u2019s failure to regulate emissions was partly the cause of increased storms, loss of land to sea level rise, and so on. Among other findings, the court held that under the US", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ebf3409-9a0a-4605-ac78-7bd7814f82a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ebf3409-9a0a-4605-ac78-7bd7814f82a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cff37688ac4e377744d77bff63ee27d290f499c7b4cd95d8c4740761c154850f"}, "3": {"node_id": "31cedce1-595f-47af-8105-d262cc10070e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b872303f6a7badc52e7b9d44f337d7e54fd26f2c87097bb3506d27771f3bcd5"}}, "hash": "32a70bb13d9f30b54a74739be7eb850570392c7dc6a3a585cd3ae9de2b5534ea", "text": "Constitution, climate change impact was a justiciable harm for which legal rights could be claimed CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 256 in court and that the EPA was empowered to regulate CO2 emissions, now an important basis for planned emission control regulations by the Obama administration. Similar trends as to the expanding role of the judiciary in sustainable development are evident in Asia. In China, new environmental courts and tribunals have been established in seven provinces in the past two years. India\u2019s National Green Tribunal Act was approved on 2 June 2010 and seeks to establish a system of local courts across the country for the effective management of conflicts related to environmental and natural resources. India\u2019s regime will be the most extensive network of environmental tribunals in the world (Pring 2009). Green tribunals can address a host of pollution concerns in local communities, and given the importance of climate mitigation and impact policies for local communities, could well emerge in the future as a key element of climate change policymaking at the subnational and national level. The emergence of a proactive judicial role in Asia will serve as an important element of emerging climate governance regimes at national and subnational levels and could well shape the nature of engagement with global climate policy. As we move towards COP 16 and beyond, the focus of climate policymaking and implementation will need to go beyond the age-old system of international relations driven by political negotiations among nation-states, to also engage emerging systems of local climate governance and access to justice as a means of balancing global and local climate policy and putting concerns of equity and fairness at the centre.

Secondly, the Accord, in its paragraph 5, requires the developing countries to include in their national communications information on their nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) to be submitted every two years, whereas no such provision is contained in Article 12.5 of the Convention. The Accord also states that least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS) have no such time limits. However, the contributor points out that the inadequate financing received by these developing countries makes it unlikely for them to spend \u201cmore than three years in most cases, depending on the local operational cost and project management cost\u201d, thus effectively setting a deadline for these countries\u2019 submissions as well. Because the preparation of national communications is \u201cnot only a reporting process, but also a national capacity-building process\u201d, this time limit is likely to deprive many developing countries of much-needed capacity-building. The contributor also correctly observes that the Bali Action Plan provides for support and enabling means for NAMAs for all developing countries and not only to specific groups among them. In conclusion, Pak Sum Low also notes that paragraph 10 of the Copenhagen Accord on the establishment of the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund as an operating entity of the financial mechanism puts in question the role of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) as the only operating entity and channel of financing for climate change projects, including the preparation of national communications, but whose operations have given rise to many concerns among the developing country Parties of the Convention. Dear Network Members, Copenhagen Accord and national communications for Non-Annex I Parties Much has been analyzed regarding the shortcomings of the Copenhagen Accord, including the lack of emission reduction targets for Annex I Parties both in 2020 and 2050, and the limit on the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius rather than well below 1.5 degrees Celsius as demanded by small island states and least developed countries (LDCs). Bolivia even calls for limiting the temperature increase to 1 degree Celsius. The impacts of temperature increase are likely to have regional variations. Apart from temperature increase, other parameters such as changes in precipitation patterns, frequency of occurrence and intensity of extreme events, combined with other environmental, as well as socio-economic and even policy factors, are likely to cause further impacts. It is important for Non-Annex I Parties (developing and least developed countries and some countries with economies in transition) to analyze and assess the implications of the Accord before they decide whether or not they should formally (fully or partially) associate with it based on their national circumstances. There are elements in the Accord that are not consistent with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Here I will focus on the issue relating to national communications for Non-Annex I Parties. Article 12.5 of the UNFCCC states that \u201cEach developed country Party and each other Party included in Annex I shall make its initial communication within six months of the entry into force of the Convention for that Party. Each Party not so listed shall make its initial communication within three years of the entry into force of the Convention for that Party, or of the availability of financial resources in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 3. Parties that are least developed countries may make their initial communication at their discretion. The frequency of subsequent communications by all Parties shall be determined by the Conference of the Parties, taking into account the differentiated timetable set by this paragraph.\u201d CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 258 It is clear from the above Article that it is the Conference of the Parties (COP) that has the authority to determine \u201cthe frequency of subsequent communications by all Parties\u201d. For Non-Annex I Parties, the current standard national communication cycle is three years based on Article 12, with funding provided by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC. Under the \u201cexpedited procedures\u201d (or \u201cexpedited financing\u201d), an eligible country is provided with a fixed amount of funding by the GEF. For example, up to US$350,000 for the preparation of the Initial National Communication (GEF 1997), and up to US$420,000 for the Second National Communication, including US$15,000 for national stocktaking workshop (GEF 2003). It is unknown how the above funding limits were derived. With such limited financial resource, it is unlikely for the national communication cycle to last for more than three years in most cases, depending on the local operational cost and project management cost.

Based on available data, not a single Non-Annex I Party had submitted its initial national communication within two years. Indeed, many Non-Annex I Parties even took longer than three years to complete their initial national communications. National communication requires reports on greenhouse gas inventory; policy and technical measures to mitigate climate change; vulnerability and adaptation assessment; technology transfer; education, training and public awareness; and capacity-building. It is not only a reporting process, but also a national capacity-building process. Thus, a two-year national communication cycle is likely to deprive some of the much-needed capacity-building activities for Non- Annex I Parties. For LDCs, the two-year national communication cycle is not applicable, as Article 12.5 of the Convention does specify that \u201c...Parties that are least developed countries may make their initial communication at their discretion\u2026\u201d. This implies that there is no time limit for LDCs to submit their initial national communications. This also applies to subsequent national communications unless otherwise decided by the COP. However, with the limited amount of funding through the GEF \u201cexpedited procedures\u201d (or \u201cexpedited financing\u201d), even the LDCs cannot go beyond three or four years to prepare their national communications despite the fact that they are allowed to do so, otherwise they will also run out of their limited fund after three or four years (depending on the local operational cost and project management cost). Indeed, paragraph 5 of the Copenhagen Accord states that \u201cLeast developed countries and small island developing States may undertake actions voluntarily and on the basis of support\u201d regarding mitigation actions and hence the communication of information on nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) for Appendix II. Thus, it seems that as far as the Copenhagen Accord is concerned, LDCs and small island developing states (SIDS) may not undertake NAMAs unless they have received support. This seems to imply that LDCs and SIDS can be \u201cexcused\u201d from providing information for Appendix II if they have not received any support for \u201cvoluntary action\u201d. Of course no one will object if the LDCs and SIDS would like to provide information on NAMAs for Appendix II even if they have not received any financial and technical support. The above \u201cexemption\u201d for the LDCs and SIDS under the Copenhagen Accord seems to be different from the language used in paragraph 1(b)(ii) of the Bali Action Plan, which states that \u201cNationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country Parties in the context of sustainable development, supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity-building, in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner\u201d. This paragraph provides that the NAMAs of all developing country Parties are to be \u201csupported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity- building\u201d, not only the LDCs and SIDS. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 259 COP 15 has mandated the continuation of the two-track negotiation processes under the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) and the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex 1 Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP) until COP 16 (and perhaps further as may be decided by COP 16?). It would be interesting to see how the elements of the Copenhagen Accord can be \u201charmonized\u201d with, or \u201cincorporated\u201d into, the outcomes of the AWG-LCA and the AWG-KP at COP 16. It is also interesting to note that paragraph 10 of the Copenhagen Accord states that \u201cWe decide that the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund shall be established as an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention to support projects, programme, policies and other activities in developing countries related to mitigation including REDD-plus, adaptation, capacity-building, technology development and transfer.\u201d.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 260 Mukul Sanwal wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note (Bernarditas Muller): Mukul Sanwal provides new perspectives on an old debate in climate change negotiations and proposes an innovative approach that operationalizes equity as the main outcome for the 16th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in cancun, Mexico. He suggests that the shared vision for long-term cooperative action, the overarching element of the Bali Action Plan process leading to cancun should \u201censure policy space\u201d for the economic growth of developing countries within the context of a new sustainable development framework. This would be necessary because current emission reduction pledges under the Copenhagen Accord, including developing country pledges that are more than those of developed countries, are largely inadequate to meet the 2\u00b0C limit of temperature increase envisioned in the Accord. Equitable sharing of the remaining carbon space requires a science-based determination of necessary mitigation actions from each country, with the allocation criteria to be negotiated that would be directly linked to outcomes. Carbon budgets would be established at multilateral levels and taken as the bases for domestic mitigation actions. This would shift the debate from the focus on developed country targets alone to the establishment of equitable sharing of carbon space that would allow developing countries to grow in a sustainable manner. Mukul Sanwal justly observes that \u201ceradication of poverty requires equitable access to atmospheric space\u201d to be enabled not only with the provision of financial resources but more importantly through transfer of technology. In summary, he states that equitable allocation of the remaining global carbon budget could be agreed at international levels and should be used as the basis for the formulation and implementation of national carbon budgets, accompanied by a timetable for joint research and development and transfer of technology.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8a19c88-2502-4490-9e0c-e8037a8078a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8a19c88-2502-4490-9e0c-e8037a8078a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0313ce3b7b8de58cad45fe107ecb57a40122df65cce82ddf61026478d23499ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "78d60fc6-7b85-4233-bec7-6ebe0bffd17e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c92a461311661df162f296b17eb487109b279cf7307c0fcb790d888d16600750"}}, "hash": "3bcb237d2769b48531820ad6ff72691eb0293d2471c6f6ac9b7c4b9d73b8da47", "text": "Dear Network Members, Cancun must focus on operationalizing equity: The shared vision requires a focus on national carbon budgets Equity is central to the multilateral negotiations on climate change, but even after twenty years of discussion the concept has yet to be operationalized.

A new agenda is needed because the global goal of keeping increase in temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius requires 14 Giga tonnes (Gt.) of emissions abatement by 2020, whereas the firm pledges made after the Copenhagen Conference amount to only around 9 Gt, with developing countries contributing more than the reduction commitments of the developed countries. Moreover, the countries with per capita emissions and incomes below the global average, and this includes India, collectively would need at least as much carbon budget as the developed countries are about to take up from now until 2050, if they are to develop their infrastructure necessary for the eradication of poverty, and merely reach average global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 4 tonnes per capita by 2050, that is recognized as a legitimate aspiration in the Copenhagen Accord. The key global climate policy-or equity-issue is that without developed countries sharply reducing their emissions immediately, other countries cannot get their fair share of the carbon space for economic growth, if the global goal of limiting rise in global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius is to be met. Since the available carbon space is part of the global atmospheric commons, every country\u2019s fair share of carbon space is proportional to its share of the global population. Consequently, the climate negotiations must recognize that both global temperature and GHG concentration targets are needed as the basis for long-term cooperation to meet the climate challenge. Post Copenhagen, emissions of GHGs cannot be seen only in terms of environmental damage, as they also have a development dimension, and global policy requires agreement on allocation criteria directly linked to outcomes that can be measured. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 261 As climate change is caused by the cumulative stock of emissions and not just present or future flows, allocating national carbon budgets provides a much more scientific approach to specifying mitigation action at the global and national level, compared to the current method of first determining peaking years and/or specifying the annual emissions percentage reduction with respect to 1990 levels to be achieved in some milestone year towards mid- century. It also provides a better basis for comparing the adequacy of national mitigation actions. Recent research in developed countries emphasizes the importance of such an approach in monitoring, review and verification (MRV), which is one of the most contested issues in the current negotiations. For example, the United Kingdom already has a legislation establishing a national carbon budget. A recent report of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (National Academy of Sciences 2010) suggests that the policy goal must be stated as a quantitative limit on domestic GHG emissions over a specified time period-in other words a GHG emissions budget. It rightly concludes that national shares of global emissions need to be agreed at the multilateral level as the basis for developing and assessing domestic strategies. A carbon budget based approach also enables a review of long held developing country positions that have been seen as hindering progress in the multilateral negotiations. Developed country overuse of the carbon space, or two-thirds of their cumulative emissions, has occurred after 1970 (Kanitkar et al. 2010), and such emissions should be considered as their current, rather than historical, responsibility for the overuse of the atmospheric resource. Climate change came onto the global agenda in the UN Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm, in 1972. Even after discounting historical emissions, the allocation of the remaining carbon space can be made to developing countries so as to ensure their fair share of carbon space by 2050, enabled and supported by development and transfer of innovative technology. More specificity can also be provided to the allocation criteria by limiting future energy use per capita to that of mid-level developed countries. The new agenda would reflect the greater responsibility developing countries are prepared to take in accordance with their respective capabilities. Moreover, a sustainable development framework points towards evolution of the long held policy that our per capita emissions will never exceed those of developed countries. That would essentially be a defensive reaction specifying what we will not do. The shift to determining a carbon budget responds better to the Copenhagen Accord, and the internationalization of mitigation actions. Eradication of poverty requires equitable access to atmospheric space, and the gap cannot be met only through financial resources, as it requires transfer of technology as the basis of long-term cooperation on mitigation and adaptation.

Limiting the magnitude of future climate change. Washington, DC: NAS. 4. Closing Message Dear Network Members, There is a widespread perception among observers of global climate change negotiations that the processes have grown extremely complex from the time that the UN Framework Convention itself was negotiated in 1991. Indeed, experience in the implementation of legal obligations of all Parties under the Convention resulted in the recognition that there are wide-ranging implications of any action taken to address climate change and its adverse effects. Negotiations have therefore expanded to cover these implications, such as global trade and economic impacts of mitigation and adaptation actions, and their impacts on sustainable development and the well-being of present and future generations. Scientific findings have evolved as well as concrete manifestations of climate change impacts, providing the incentive for deeper public involvement and concern. Climate change has become the \u201cdefining challenge of our time\u201d and expectations from climate change negotiations have been heightened. The previous sub-themes have covered essential components of these negotiations and this might explain why contributions to the general theme of these negotiations are not as numerous as on the other sub-themes. The five contributions received nevertheless correctly focused on the fundamental principles that underlie the negotiations and have made important inputs to these discussions. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the contributors: Marcia V.J. Kran, Maria Melinda Ando, Kishan Khoday and Usha Natarajan (joint contribution), Pak Sum Low, and Mukul Sanwal. Kishan Khoday and Usha Natarajan underlined the principle of equity, the primary basic principle of these negotiations. They called for \u201cgreater coherence between issues of equity and sustainability in global policy formulation\u201d to address climate change and its adverse effects. Equitable sharing of environmental and developmental space indeed forms the basis of the negotiations on all the main elements of mitigation, adaptation, provision of financial resources, development and transfer of technology, and capacity-building. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its first principle provides that \u201cthe Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities\u201d. This principle permeates each Article of the UNFCCC, and forms the key to the balance of common but differentiated responsibilities. From this principle flows the commitment of developed country Parties, responsible for historical emissions that caused climate change, to \u201ctaking the lead in modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions\u201d (Article 4.2a), referring to production and consumption lifestyles. From this principle also flow the obligations to provide financing and technology transfer from developed country Parties to developing country Parties. These form the basic elements under ongoing climate change negotiations. Equity also underlay the contribution of Marcia V. J. Kran calling for a human rights-based approach to the negotiations and to national policy formulation on climate change and its implementation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4078e5b4-8e76-4d7e-84c6-7958336c0189": {"__data__": {"id_": "4078e5b4-8e76-4d7e-84c6-7958336c0189", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ed7192fb731ecddec9a2cc2d136a28bf2ac0b9b9b7728aac6cf185483205325"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9bbb4c7-fb1f-474c-8aac-e50d9a4abff9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9704fd75919f62b22603744f7dfd116dc69cde7b5818131524c9c8247b4bf50"}}, "hash": "fdf459b4ee2ccf0413c223dd7add14df0008c2202c722199934170dd7f6629f9", "text": "People are at the centre of our concerns, as is stated in the first of the Rio Principles on sustainable development.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 263 High populations are not synonymous with high-energy consumption, Maria Melinda Ando correctly observed in her contribution. Once again, equity should be observed, as the problem of climate change has its origins in historical emissions of greenhouse gases by countries with much lower populations than developing countries of today. More effective responses to climate change could be achieved by controlling consumption rather than by controlling birth rates, the contribution rightly stated. The conclusion encapsulated the crux of the negotiating positions of developing countries in these negotiations, that \u201cequitable and just climate change strategies should not displace responsibility for carbon emissions upon those least responsible for them\u201d. Pak Sum Low\u2019s contribution touched on one of the most sensitive issues under these negotiations, and that is the inconsistencies between the Copenhagen Accord and the UNFCCC, in particular as relates to the provisions on the preparation of national communications of non-Annex I Parties. The exclusive and non-transparent manner in which the Copenhagen Accord was concluded among a small group of countries caused the breakdown at the final plenary of the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) of the UNFCCC in Copenhagen in December 2009. The great majority of developing countries were excluded from representation in the discussions leading to the Copenhagen Accord. This travesty of the multilateral intergovernmental process led to the rejection of the Accord that was then taken note of instead of being adopted by the COP. This means that the Accord has no legal standing in the current negotiations. However, developed country Parties of the Accord are pushing for its integration in the current process. While about half of the developing country Parties of the UNFCCC supported, endorsed or associated with the Accord, many of them did so subject to conditions stated formally in their letters of endorsement or association. These conditions are mainly related to the provision of the necessary financial resources and development and transfer of technology in order to allow developing countries to take nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) that can then be reported through national communications. Pak Sum Low pointed out that the conditions put forward by the Copenhagen Accord are inconsistent with the provisions of the UNFCCC, and that these work to the detriment of the interests of developing countries. Once again, we are faced here with an issue of equity. Developing countries, starting with the big developing ones, but also extending to the second and third levels of developing economies, are being required to undertake NAMAs where they have no such obligations under the Convention. Moreover, any mitigation action to be undertaken voluntarily by developing countries should be accompanied by the necessary financing and transfer of technology in accordance with Convention provisions. In addition, financing obligations of developed countries under the Convention cover not only mitigation actions but also all the necessary conditions that would allow these actions to be formulated, published, and regularly updated, as well as implemented. Mukul Sanwal proposed a shift in the approach to negotiations that would render operational the element of equity as a concrete outcome for cancun. Given the reality of the Copenhagen Accord, it must now be taken into account in the negotiations. As it stands, however, the pledges from those countries that have supported the Accord, as reflected in the appendices, remain totally inadequate to meet the objective of reaching a temperature increase \u201cbelow 2\u00b0C\u201d contained in the Accord, not to mention the intention of assessing the implementation of the Accord by 2015, \u201cincluding in relation to temperature rises of 1.5\u00b0C\u201d. There is in fact nothing in the Accord that links the expressed goal of \u201cbelow 2\u00b0C\u201d with the listing of either emission targets for Annex I countries or NAMAs of non-Annex I countries. In his contribution, Mukul Sanwal stated that in order to achieve equity in sharing the global carbon space, a global carbon budget must be agreed at international levels with allocation criteria based not only on the responsibility for historical emissions alone, but also with a closer base year of 1970, and take into account present and future emissions as well. It would shift the debate from a stalemate to a proactive approach that would reflect the willingness of all countries to do their fair share for achieving the objective of the Convention, including its ultimate objective, given the necessary financial resources and in particular development, transfer and access to technology.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cannot be seen as damaging the environment alone, Mukul Sanwal pointed out, but also as an engine of growth. Developing countries should be allowed to have their rightful share of the remaining global budget in order to achieve sustainable development. In climate change negotiations, developing countries have referred to their emissions as \u201csurvival emissions\u201d as opposed to \u201cluxury emissions\u201d of developed countries that would like to maintain their lifestyles. Movement in the negotiations must come from both sides, and developing countries have the obligation to pursue economic and social development in a sustainable manner, at the same time the developed countries should adopt production and consumption lifestyles that would likewise be environmentally sustainable. Technology development and transfer is crucial to sustainable growth. The balance of obligations carries the key to a successful outcome in cancun. In this manner, equitable sharing of the atmospheric space could be achieved, one that would fully serve the objective of the Convention. All five contributions to this sub-theme focused on the fundamental element of equity in negotiations. For this reason, developing countries, including those in the Asia-Pacific region, call for an equitable, comprehensive, concrete, and legally binding outcome of the climate change negotiations in cancun. As this is the last sub-theme that I have the honour to facilitate in this year\u2019s Asia-Pacific Human Development Network discussions, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all contributors for the very enriching and interesting exchanges from which I have benefited and learned.

Sub-theme 8 Folklore, Traditional Knowledge, Idiomatic Expressions, Proverbs and Quotes CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 266 1. Opening Message Dear Network Members, We would like to thank you all for the rich interaction we had in the past few months. The discussions were lively, intense and covered a range of issues. They have generated a rich body of material (available online at http://hdru. aprc.undp.org/ext/HDRU/e_discussion_climate_change.php) that can be referred to and used more widely. For the next three weeks we would like to invite you to share folk tales, examples of traditional knowledge, idiomatic expressions, proverbs and quotes relevant to climate change. Folklore in the form of tales, sayings, songs, music, rhymes and poetry can be highly illuminative of the human-nature relationship. Such material can provide a peek into society, as it is or as it can be imagined. Folk belief systems have also served the purpose of resource conservation in direct or indirect ways. The concept of sacred resources, for example, is evident among many tribes. In Aka of West Kameng district, in Arunachal Pradesh, India, it is believed that the interference to sacred resources will result in loss of life as it is the abode of a supernatural force called Ubro or Ubram. The highest mountain peak in the Aka inhabited area, called Wojo phu, is considered as sacred mountain. Extraction of any resources from that mountain, and even hunting, is strictly prohibited. The Akas believe that the breaking of such taboo will lead to nose and mouth bleeding, finally leading to death. So, even today this mountain has a huge dense forest cover (Chaudhuri 2008). The need to respect the environment, and promote awareness and an environmental-friendly lifestyle has been considered while discussing sub-theme 6. Indeed many cultures have similar sayings that encourage such environmental- friendly behaviour. The material could be on tapping traditional knowledge, customs, practices and ideas that imply respect for water and land, conservation, sustainability, biological diversity, nature, earth, natural resources etc. It does not have to use terms like \u2018climate change\u2019 as such, as it is quite a new phenomenon.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5712efa8-2750-4ed2-a736-55a7af36294c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5712efa8-2750-4ed2-a736-55a7af36294c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a3b892938800d4c96d0eaf3067ab44c3f07ec2fa3ee31e491c91b18a2406fe8"}, "2": {"node_id": "04410af1-c617-4798-a210-b2c21670826a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "357caf515c738ce09f525d9ed6ee1ada64f33b17ffdcfd19a2cde51a57b93775"}}, "hash": "3ac0f749682847c4043bbf4080e8b9d45e2d8e828a97f1f2361a8b196c5a2335", "text": "For material in local languages (e.g., idiomatic expressions), the following information could be indicated: a) Local Term; b) Language; c) Country (origin); d) Translation; e) Comments/short story behind the use of the term (if any).

Online Discussion Jayati Ghosh wrote: Facilitation note (HDRU Team): Jayati Ghosh shares an old Italian folk tale which has a clear \u201canalogy with climate change and the other ecological disasters created by the global pattern of economic growth\u201d. Taking the folk tale as a departure point, the contributor highlights that everybody is \u201cadversely affected by the results of (...) ecological imbalances\u201d and there is a need \u201cto shift from an obsession on growth (\u2026) to a more rational organization of society, economy and of the relation between humanity and nature\u201d. Dear Network Members, The bell tower in the lake The playwright Dario Fo tells this old Italian folk tale: \u201cMany years ago, way up on the crest of that steep cliff that rises from the lake, there was a town called Calde. As it happened, this town was sitting on a loose splinter of rock that slowly, day by day, was sliding down towards the precipice. It was a splendid little town, with a campanile, a fortified tower at the very peak and a cluster of houses, one after the other. It\u2019s a town that once was and now is gone. It disappeared in the fifteenth century. \u2018Hey\u2019, shouted the peasants and fishermen down in the valley below. \u2018You\u2019re sliding, you\u2019ll fall down from there\u2019. But the cliff dwellers wouldn\u2019t listen to them, they even laughed and made fun of them: \u2018You think you\u2019re pretty smart, trying to scare us into running away from our houses and our land so you can grab them instead. But we\u2019re not that stupid.\u2019 So they continued to prune their vines, sow their fields, marry and make love. They went to mass. They felt the rock slide under their houses but they didn\u2019t think much about it. \u2018Just the rock settling. Quite normal\u2019, they said, reassuring each other. The great splinter of rock was about to sink into the lake. \u2018Watch out, you\u2019ve got water up to your ankles\u2019, shouted the people along the shore. \u2018Nonsense, that\u2019s just drainage water from the fountains, it\u2019s just a bit humid\u2019, said the people of the town. And so, slowly but surely, the whole town was swallowed by the lake. Gurgle\u2026 gurgle\u2026 splash\u2026 they sink\u2026 houses, men, women, two horses, three donkeys\u2026 heehaw\u2026 gurgle.

This misses the essential point: that the issue is really linked to an economic system-capitalism-that is crucially dependent upon rapid growth as its driving force, even if this \u201cgrowth\u201d does not deliver better lives for the people. So there is no questioning of the presumption that rich countries with declining populations must keep on growing in terms of GDP, rather than finding different ways of creating and distributing output to generate better quality of life. There is no debating of the pattern of growth in \u201csuccessful\u201d developing countries, which has in many cases come at the cost of increased inequality, greater material insecurity for a significant section of the population and massive damage to the environment. Once such questions are asked, it becomes clear the interests of people in the centre are not inevitably opposed to those of people in the periphery, since both are now adversely affected by the results of such ecological imbalances. Instead, it means that it is now in all of our interests to shift from an obsession on growth that is primarily directed to increasing capitalist profits, to a more rational organization of society, economy and of the relation between humanity and nature.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 269 Dear Network Members, Living in sync with nature: Calling back spirits, conserving biodiversity, and combating climate change Concept of Kwan For Lao people, Kwan are components of the soul. The kwan have been variously described by Westerners as: \u201cvital forces, giving harmony and balance to the body, or part of it\u201d (Khampradith et al. 2010). It is an ancient belief in Lao PDR that the human being is a union of 32 organs and that the kwan watch over and protect each one of them. For the Karen, indigenous peoples of the South-East Asian countries of Thailand and Myanmar, the concept of kwan is understood and used quite differently, although there are some similarities. The Karen and the Lao people share the same believe that the present of kwan is vital to a healthy life and if kwan is/are missing they must do something to restore the equilibrium-calling back the kwan. The Karen elaborates the concept further by explaining that the kwan are natural spirits and every human has 32 kwan. To the Karen, these natural spirits exist also in physical bodies of animals and plants. The 32 kwan reside in various livings i.e. rat, pig, snake, tree, plant, bird, etc. For one to have a healthy life, these animals and plants must be present in their surrounding environment. Healthy life is a reflection of healthy ecosystems; therefore, one must protect the environment. This is a traditional scheme aiming to inspire one to conserve biodiversity. What genius! Healthy ecosystems provide a range of natural services that people rely on.

Inspired by Christianity\u2019s notion of stewardship, a certain group of Karen (like the habitants of the Karen village Ban Mae Lankhum at Chiangmai, Thailand) believes that \u201cNature and all things on the earth do not belong to humans but to God.

Before he went back he assigned \u2018Meukhaklor\u2019 to protect and keep eyes on everything on the earth. Meukhaklor was the ancestor of all humans. Later, the ancestor spirit became the guardian spirit of the forests (Seghorjar), the guardian spirit of the mountains (Khorjorghorjar), the guardian spirit of the water (Teeghorjar) and the guardian spirit of the earth (Horkhoghorjar).\u201d (Chaitap n.d.). Because of these beliefs, villagers perform natural resource use-related ceremonies to ask permission through the spiritual leader. Conserving biodiversity = Combating climate change Conserving nature can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., mitigation) and help us adapt to the impacts of climate change. Ecosystem resilience is the key to adaptation of species and habitat to climate change, which, in turn, will maintain and conserve biodiversity. Conserving and managing nature can help people adapt to climatic changes. Climate change adaptation approaches should focus on maintaining or restoring ecosystems. Ecosystem-based approach that conserves biodiversity and sequesters carbon is an innovative and effective way for mitigating emission and adapting to climate change. Such ecosystem-based adaptations should be mainstreamed into climate change strategies of national frameworks such as National Climate Change Strategies and the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). Ecosystem- based approaches to climate change will increase the resilience of natural systems and are based on existing practices and local knowledge. These offer the most effective and least costly adaptation solutions that are more feasible than engineering options that rely heavily on technical capacity, routine maintenance and large-scale infrastructure.

Dear Network Members, Dreaming of sustainability: The Jiva, the serpent and climate change in Melanesia \u201cIndigenous peoples are custodians of some of the most biologically diverse territories in the world. They are also responsible for a great deal of the world\u2019s linguistic and cultural diversity, and their traditional knowledge has been and continues to be an invaluable resource that benefits all of mankind. Meanwhile, their belief systems, cultures, languages and ways of life continue to be threatened, sometimes even by extinction\u201d (UN 2009). So reads the first UN Report on the State of the World\u2019s Indigenous Peoples. There are an estimated 370 million indigenous peoples in the world, located across more than 90 countries. Indigenous issues have received increasing attention since the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007 (UN 2009). The regular meetings of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues at UN Headquarters have also contributed to raising awareness on indigenous matters. The connection between climate change and traditional knowledge has received increased attention in recent years (Macchi 2008). Earlier this year, from 19 to 22 April, the World People\u00b4s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth convened in Bolivia in the wake of the Copenhagen climate conference. This global gathering of indigenous peoples, UN representatives and government leaders highlighted the need for new visions of the balance between human development and nature, and the central role of traditional knowledge in providing alternative paradigms of progress. As noted at the conference, \u201cthe only way we can contribute to the future of humanity and our planet is through recuperating our origins, strengthening our cultural practices and our forms of collective organization for the sustainable use and management of natural resources, guaranteeing the rights of indigenous peoples, and promoting traditional knowledge and notions about living in harmony with Mother Earth\u201d (World People\u00b4s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth 2010). Traditional knowledge is central to preservation of cultural diversity and the wealth of wisdom that has accumulated in indigenous societies over millennia. It is vital to preservation of a plural and diverse world from both ecological and cultural perspectives. A region of special importance in this regard is the Melanesian culture in South-East Asia and the Pacific, covering the province of Papua in Eastern Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia. The first human presence in this region is estimated at 40 to 60,000 years ago, during an Ice Age when sea levels were low and land masses connected (Neidjie 2002). Original human populations migrated out of the Horn of Africa around 50 to 70,000 years ago, crossing the Arabian Peninsula, the southern coastlines of India, and South-East Asia. Indeed, studies show genetic markers between Australian Aborigines and tribal communities in southern India dating back to this time (Wells 2002). The Melanesian region is the world\u2019s most culturally diverse area, hosting only eight million people, but a remarkable 25 per cent of the world\u2019s remaining 4,000 indigenous languages (Knauft 1999). Climate change has shaped basic elements of human existence, culture and traditional knowledge in Melanesia for tens of thousands of years and continues to resonate in current discourse on livelihoods and environmental impacts in the area (Gerritsen 2008). An example of the infusion of environmental knowledge and climate change into local traditions is the Dreamtime tradition of Australian Aborigines, considered to be the longest continuous human culture in the world (Wolf 1994). In Aboriginal mythology, Dreamtime is the sacred creation moment out of which original ancestral beings formed the earth, with the climate, land, plants and animals of today made in their image. While the Dreamtime refers to the original creation act, the Dreaming is a living and continuous process that sustains all life, a connection of individuals and communities to the living spirit of Creation in nature. Every activity or event in life leaves a metaphysical residue CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 272 in space and time, a seed of potency within the earth referred to as the \u2018jiva\u2019. The ecosystem carries jiva within it, a symbolic manifestation of the original creators and a metaphysical constant running throughout space and time, constituting the sacredness of the earth. While specifics of the Dreamtime mythology vary by tribe, a common element particularly in Northern Australia is the seminal role of the Serpent, associated with fertility and abundance of the environment.

It is a creator of human beings, having life-giving powers that send conception spirits to all the waterholes. It is responsible for regenerating rains and also for storms and floods when it acts as an agent of punishment against those who transgress the law or upset it in any way. It swallows people in great floods and regurgitates their bones, which turn into stone, thus documenting such events\u201d (Chaloupka 1993). The Rainbow Serpent, seen in rock art from around 6,000 years ago, is regarded by experts to be the world\u2019s oldest continuous religious symbol (Dean 1996). It is suggested that the local symbolism of the serpent could be modelled on the pipefish, found on the coastlines of the Arafura Sea in northern Australia and Indonesian Papua. It became a common element of the local environment and a symbol of destruction and recreation following the destructive changes brought on by rising sea levels at the end of the last Ice Age and the formation of rich coastal estuaries which became a source of life for communities (Chippindale et al. 1996). Sea level rises and climatic shift created great social stress as sustainability of food and water was affected. These problems led to the emergence of the Rainbow Serpent as a symbol of creation and destruction, and of unity among Aboriginal societies facing a common challenge of environmental change. Over the generations, these stories have been passed down through a strong oral and pictorial tradition, conveying a vision of the individual\u2019s role as a custodian of the environment and sacred sites that are understood to resonate with jiva. This is a worldview where the ecosystem is seen as critical to sustaining the physical, mental and spiritual elements of human development and well-being (Horton 1996). Traditional knowledge not only dealt with the metaphysical but also had practical relations as a science, governing daily relations with the environment. Seasonality governed traditional life, which operated on the basis of a traditional calendar based on six seasons and a complex understanding of ecological processes. To some extent, personification of the environment has helped give expression to these societies\u2019 deep understanding and relationship with nature. A sense of nature and its wonder is entrenched in cosmology and social affairs, resulting in a very personalized response to ecological change and sustainability. In the Gagugju area of Australia\u2019s Northern Territory (Kakadu National Park), a group of elders has kept the jiva story alive. \u201cI feel it with my body, with my blood. Feeling all these trees, all this country. When this wind blow you can feel it. Same for country, You can feel it. You can look. But feeling \u2026 that make you. Feeling make you. Out there in open space, he coming through your body, because tree just about your brother or father and tree is watching you \u2026 While you sleeping you dream something. Tree and grass same thing.

It is no less the case in Cambodia, where people have been dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods. Even now, the majority of the population lives in rural areas, practicing farming-most of which is rain-fed, and counting on seasonal flow changes of the Mighty Mekong and Tonle Sap Lake. For centuries, people in Cambodia have devised a variety of ways to adapt to the natural conditions and engage in productive activities, making most of what is granted by nature. Predicting seasonal floods, droughts and insect infestations etc., has also been of major interest and importance for those who have been living side by side with these phenomena for ages. People in Cambodia have devised various ways to do so. And with probably no less certainty than science? Examples from Mondulkiri Mondulkiri is one of the four north-east provinces of Cambodia. It is one of the largest provinces in Cambodia (14,682 km2), but with the least population (some 56,000 people). The ethnic Phnong consists of the majority (52.24 per cent), while the rest being lowland and other ethnic groups (Try et al. 2009). The province is known for its rich natural resources, with large areas of forests and conservation areas. However, recent years have witnessed rapid changes in the province\u2019s landscape as a major part of the land has been converted into economic land concessions, mining and large scale agroforestry plantations.

The Phnong have long practiced traditional farming and used forest to support their livelihood and cultural system. They are mostly animist, believing in powerful spirits that inhabit a wide range of natural objects or sites. Many ceremonies are observed to ensure good relationships with these spirits, including sacrifices and libations. Their main farming activity is non-irrigated shifting cultivation (Miir) of upland rice and other crops. Forest is burned before cultivation and ceremonies are performed before and after the farm is cleared. This type of slash and burn, when it allows sufficient time in-between for the forest and ecosystem to regenerate, is not considered destructive to the natural environment (Maclnnes 2007). As their agricultural practices depend largely on natural environment, the Phnong people have developed their own ways of predicting natural phenomena, borrowing wisdoms of the fellow wildlife which habituate the same forest - such as the Bengal Monitor, King Cobra, Long Ant, and Wild Rooster (see Bourdier 2009). The Phnong believe that there will be drought when a King Cobra lays eggs close to a stream. If the tails of young Bengal Monitors are whiter around April before the onset of the wet season, then that means there will drought during the upcoming supposedly wet season. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 275 When more black colour is observed in Bengal Monitors\u2019 tails in the months of April and May, then the Phnong people would predict more rain, which may possibly lead to flooding. In some parts of Mondulkiri, locations of the nests of Long Ants are also believed to indicate possibility of floods: the higher on a tree and the further away from water they build their nests, the more likely that there will be flood. Similarly, when Wild Roosters lay their eggs on tree stumps or other higher ground and not directly on the ground, then you can expect a flood will come (*). People also learned to observe behaviours of rains, dry spells and air flows. When a long (2-3 weeks) drought in otherwise normally wet season, followed by continuous rains with wind for 4-10 days, then they would expect a lot of insects would come to annoy them, taking their crops away. Recent changes Floods, droughts and insect infestations have been annual seasonal events which people have learned to predict, expect and prepare for. But since the 1990s onwards, the Phnong people have come to observe more frequent occurrences and increased intensity of these events, negatively affecting their upland crops. Sometimes insects destroy the entire harvest of one village, which was a hardly seen phenomenon earlier. Some people attribute this to longer spells of drought and changes in weather (more heat and rain), while others blame increased commercial activities in the province, that have led to land clearing/deforestation, changes in water regime, loss of habitat, increased use of pesticides in certain areas. Changes in the patterns of rains and droughts lead to not just crop failure but also competition for water uses for household and agriculture during droughts. Livestock and humans, especially children, fall ill during extreme temperature changes. If these changes continue, the century-old traditional knowledge of the Phnong and other forest dwellers may someday become invalid. The Phnong are already feeling that things are increasingly becoming unpredictable for them. This in turn will disrupt their traditional farming and cultural practices, which for a long time has been dependent upon predictable rainfall patterns and amount. Such increasing unpredictability is also reported from other provinces in the lowland. A villager who research changes in their own environment over time in Stung Treng (through Sala Phoum project (**)), recently reported: \u2018Last year during the drought we experienced flash floods, this year the rains came early.....before the (monsoon) rains and the farming season were regular, now you cannot trust them, people are changing their habits as a result. Migration from our homelands has increased sharply and cultural ceremonies such as those for calling the rains are being abandoned\u2019. (Mr. Ton: Sala Phoum village researcher, Wetlands Alliance Project Area, NE Cambodia) These are just small examples from limited parts of Cambodia, but where and before we do not notice, there are more cultural and intellectual heritages possibly being at risk across the country.

Dear Network Members, Wealth and fragility of Cambodian fishermen As mentioned in Mr Try Thuon\u2019s contribution, in Cambodia, people have lived with and adapted to diverse phases and behaviours of the natural environment. Fisheries, both inland and coastal, have traditionally been a main productive activity for Cambodians. Fish is no doubt the main staple food along with rice and it provides over 75 per cent of animal protein in the Cambodian diet (SCW 2006). The major part of Cambodian fisheries is capture fisheries, which depend on natural supply of fish from the rivers, lakes and the sea, rather than fish farming (aquaculture). Small-scale family fishing, which the great majority of fishing population is engaged in, is an important source of income in addition to supplementing nutrition. The important role that natural capture fisheries plays in our culture and economy has not changed much since the time of the Angkor civilization. The impressive stone reliefs of Angkor temples celebrate the wealth and importance of fish and fisheries a millennium back. The availability, migratory movements and species of fish and other aquatic resources vary quite significantly from place to place, and from season to season. Over centuries, Cambodian people have learned to adapt to such variability by developing appropriate hardware, techniques, and resource management regimes and their own migration patterns. Exercising ingenuities in pursuit of fish Cambodian fishermen\u2019s ingenuity to take advantage of the natural harvest is demonstrated by the wide variety of fishing techniques and gears they use.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9bcfc82b-1816-40b6-a932-e6e7b3e4080a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9bcfc82b-1816-40b6-a932-e6e7b3e4080a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a49eeaf7aab17a035817e104a25093dff0f1a511a0d32706f8262b5fe3216cc"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ab1845c-085f-4013-b3cb-3bc97ff24f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a705afac88864bd835f9922442e1ca0a227e97d56772a26e2e17197c606cb18"}}, "hash": "7ba6fedc87581fcda6e768c602c474e6f2f8bbc1a95d95b7e5413665137b5e94", "text": "The range of cultural traditions, together with the different topographic settings in which they have existed, has led to differences in the fishing equipments developed by the various communities/ethnic groups through their interactions (Try 2004).

According to a study conducted in 12 out of 24 provinces, around 200 different types of fishing gears were identified (Deap et al. 2003). These gears are designed for specific fish habitats, water conditions and levels, and often specific species groups. People also adapt how they fish according to seasonal conditions. The traditional gears/ fishing methods are also used selectively in order to avoid overfishing (UNDP 2006). In addition to adjusting their hardware, people also adjust places of living in pursuit of fish.

In October, when the water starts to recede and flow back from Tonle Sap Lake to the Mekong and further downstream towards the South China Sea, fishermen start preparing to migrate with the flow. Some fishermen even migrate from Phnom Penh up north to Stung Treng along the Mekong close to the Lao border, and stay there for the whole fishing season. Fish and fishermen in daily dicta Cambodian\u2019s cultural imaginations also flourished around fisheries. We have a number of proverbs that make reference to fish, fishing and related activities, or seasonal water level changes of the fishing ground. For example: The water rises, fish eat the ants; the water recedes, the ants eat the fish. (Life is a permanent up and down. Don\u2019t be too proud about your power as you will lose it one day. Don\u2019t despair, then one day things will change to your benefit.) (KCD 2009). And another:The one who climbs in the tree is busy with picking; the one who shells does not eat; the one who stays unoccupied may satisfy his hunger. (Society is full of inequity and too frequently, some are rewarded for nonproductive behavior while others do not, even by working hard.) (KCD 2009). As suggested by this proverb, most of ordinary fishermen in Cambodia are poor. Often fisher folks who live on water bodies in floating huts or houses-on-stilts do so as they have no land to farm. Those who are engaged both in fishing and farming prefer to be identified as farmers rather than fishermen, as the latter implies that one is poor. Where there is water, is there fish? The lives of poor fishermen are at the mercy of changing environmental conditions. Another Cambodian proverb goes: \u201cThere is water, there is fish\u201d. But would it always be the case? Here\u2019s a story of a young fisherman: Mr. Trie Tearn, 21 years old and born in Koah Kapi, Koah Kong Province, is a muddy crab fisherman along the mangrove forest and small streams around Koah Kapi\u2019s island. He feels that \u201cOn our island, there is a crucial change in temperature. Fishery products, mainly muddy crabs in the mangrove forest, are becoming harder to catch. I believe it is because the sea water has also become hotter and the muddy crabs are moving deeper and deeper in the water\u201d (*). From May to October, the sea water level goes down during the day. If the water gets too warm, muddy crabs move down deeper, out of the reach of Mr. Tearn\u2019s otherwise effective traps. Sometimes the tide rises during the day but the water temperature still remains hot. These changes were not felt before, and he feels that they are affecting the behaviours of fish and other marine species. In general, the catches from his community are decreasing. In recent years, fishing communities both inland and coastal areas are feeling changes in the environment. Some say it is climate change, but others say it is the direct consequence of destruction of coastal mangroves or construction of hydropower dams upstream, if it is inland. Increasing use of modern equipment is blamed also for overfishing. Probably these are all contributing factors to the changes that people are feeling. Whatever the causes, the fact remains that delicate changes in the environment and ecosystems, which lead to decrease or unpredictability of aquatic/marine resource availability, directly affects already fragile livelihoods of our Cambodian fishermen.

Although the perception of dragons has evolved, they are still an important element in the Chinese culture and \u201can important part of Chinese New Year celebrations\u201d. Dear Network Members, Dragons as guardians of the weather in ancient China For the ancient Chinese, dragons were perceived to be real, of supernatural ability. They were also the embodiment of \u201cyang\u201d energy (representing masculine power and associated with the weather). Based on Chinese beliefs of living in harmony, there must be enough \u201cyang\u201d in nature and in one\u2019s life to balance the feminine \u201cyin\u201d energy (associated with the earth). By extension, dragons were also a symbol of the power of emperors. This perception of dragons has evolved to modern times where they are viewed by the Chinese to be \u201ca symbol of power, strength, success, luck and honour\u201d and an important part of Chinese New Year celebrations (Cole n.d.). CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 279 Ancient Chinese legends feature 4 distinct dragons as listed below: The Fire Dragon (associated with the colour red) guards the natural elements (including the wind, fire, sky, \u2022 and lightening). The Earth Dragon (associated with the colour green) guards the earth, agricultural crops and mountains. \u2022 The Metal Dragon (associated with the colour gold) guards precious metals and gems. \u2022 The Water Dragon (associated with the colour blue) guards \u201crain, waterfalls, wells, seas, and all sources of \u2022 water\u201d (Cole n.d.). Water was of extreme importance to ancient Chinese society for their survival due to the annual flooding of major floodplains to support the cultivation of rice and other important agricultural crops. Rivers also provided a major means of transportation and trade. Any prolonged period of drought was seen as a sign that the heavenly beings had withdrawn their favour from the ruling emperor and thus the emperor would face challenges to remain in power. The worst floodings in ancient China were usually attributed to a dragon being upset (Bast n.d.). In addition to the dragons listed above, there were also four main Dragon Kings who ruled over particular water bodies and were responsible for water-related weather occurrences (Cole n.d.): Dragon King of the East Sea: ruler of the East China Sea. \u2022 Dragon King of South Sea: ruler of the South China Sea. \u2022 Dragon King of the West Sea: ruler of the Indian Ocean and beyond. \u2022 Dragon King of the North Sea: ruler of Lake Baikal. \u2022 When villages suffered consequences of extreme weather patterns (e.g., droughts or floodings), \u201csacrifices and religious ceremonies were conducted in hopes of appeasing the appropriate dragon\u201d (Cole n.d.).

Closing Message Dear Network Members, We would like to express our sincere thanks to Jayati Ghosh, Sukthawee Suwannachairop, Kishan Khoday and Usha Natarajan (joint contribution), Try Thuon, Tep Boonny and Kumi Careme (joint contribution), and Sumitra Sundram for their interesting and informative contributions to the sub-theme Folklore, Traditional Knowledge, Idiomatic Expressions, Proverbs and Quotes. Jayati Ghosh shared an old Italian folk tale with a clear \u201canalogy with climate change and the other ecological disasters created by the global pattern of economic growth\u201d. But this folk tale was only a departure point to highlight the need \u201cto shift from an obsession on growth (\u2026) to a more rational organization of society, economy and of the relation between humanity and nature\u201d. \u201cThe interests of people in the centre are not inevitably opposed to those of people in the periphery, since both are now adversely affected by the results of such ecological imbalances\u201d. Tep Boonny and Kumi Careme highlighted that \u201cchanges in the environment and ecosystems\u201d negatively affect the \u201calready fragile livelihoods\u201d of the Cambodian fishermen. Their contribution, in which a few proverbs from Cambodia were presented, focused on the natural capture fisheries and indicated that \u201cthe range of cultural traditions, together with the different topographic settings in which they have existed, has led to differences in the fishing equipments developed by the various communities/ethnic groups through their interactions\u201d. Kishan Khoday and Usha Natarajan highlighted the importance of traditional knowledge as it is \u201cvital to preservation of a plural and diverse world from both ecological and cultural perspectives\u201d. They focused on the Melanesian culture in South-East Asia and the Pacific, and as an example of \u201cthe infusion of environmental knowledge and climate change into local traditions\u201d, \u201cthe Dreamtime tradition of Australian Aborigines\u201d was considered. They also considered the belief in the Rainbow Snake which \u201csymbolizes the regenerative power in nature and serves as a main character in Dreamtime mythology\u201d. People\u2019s beliefs and practices were considered also in other contributions. Sukthawee Suwannachairop shared some of the beliefs of the Karen community (indigenous peoples living in Thailand and Myanmar) for which \u201chealthy life is a reflection of healthy ecosystems\u201d and therefore \u201cone must protect the environment\u201d. The contributor concluded that as ecosystem-based approaches to climate change can \u201cincrease the resilience of natural systems and are based on existing practices and local knowledge\u201d, they could be mainstreamed \u201cinto climate change strategies of national frameworks\u201d. Try Thuon focused on Mondulkiri, \u201cone of the four north-east provinces of Cambodia\u201d, and considered people\u2019s beliefs and practices to predict the \u201cnatural phenomena, borrowing wisdoms of the fellow wildlife which habituate the (\u2026) forest\u201d. People have learnt to predict, and prepare for seasonal events such as \u201cfloods, droughts and insect infestations\u201d. However, since the 1990s the frequency and intensity of these events have changed and people feel that \u201cthings are increasingly becoming unpredictable\u201d. Thus, this has a negative effect not only on \u201ctheir traditional farming\u201d but also on their \u201ccultural practices\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c25f2fdd-88a0-444c-bbda-383cdbaa9a17": {"__data__": {"id_": "c25f2fdd-88a0-444c-bbda-383cdbaa9a17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29ca48d9ae1bb6126858bafcfd30430a576fb711f3518215c18eee561859a32e"}, "2": {"node_id": "390590d5-9091-4ef5-a412-a11f7298637c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df11794bb15c4649ff3826506cbb31b0d801216fc575971a2cce768784a8d2e7"}}, "hash": "9196759c6b3c1abd2dfac19d1366501cebff5215d933c543b90b44e54437ec67", "text": "Sumitra Sundram shared information on how dragons were perceived in the ancient Chinese society for the protection of \u201cnatural elements\u201d, \u201cearth, agricultural crops and mountains\u201d, \u201cprecious metals and gems\u201d and \u201call sources of water\u201d.

The focus of evidence is from countries of Asia-Pacific. However, given widespread gender-linked gaps in justice systems, and similarities of legal challenges posed, the paper is expected to be relevant also for other similarly placed countries. Asia-Pacific has some extreme forms of discrimination and violence, not seen elsewhere, that prosperity has not been able to eliminate. Despite being one of the world\u2019s most economically dynamic regions with broad policy consensus around \u2018inclusiveness\u2019, exclusion on the basis of gender has continued to persist not just in fact, but also in law. The motivation of the paper draws from a conviction that all human beings are equally valuable, and that gender by itself is not a legitimate basis for legal discrimination. It is based on the premise that men and women must be able experience substantive equality in justice systems; mechanical equality is not adequate. Women, much more than men, are excluded from the rule of law. Barriers operate, one, in the content of laws and legal practices; and two, in restricted access to justice systems. The substantive content of laws itself can be a source of discrimination. Laws may be discriminatory, have gaps or be contradictory. Women\u2019s access to formal and customary justice systems remains restricted and inadequate enforcement mechanisms continue to be of serious concern.

It influences not only outcomes like physical security, equal earning opportunities, fair inheritance and property rights, or equality in family relations, for example, but also, at a much deeper level, the attitudes people hold. Equality in law is critical to back greater equality in economic power and political voice, which, in turn, can shape laws themselves \u2013 a synergistic relationship. The aims of this paper are two-fold: to uncover barriers to equality along gender lines in legal systems\u2013patent and latent; and to propose possible ways to redress legal discrimination to promote human rights and freedoms. Asia-Pacific has some extreme forms of discrimination and violence, not seen elsewhere, that prosperity has not been able to eliminate. Despite being one of the world\u2019s most economically dynamic regions with broad policy consensus around \u2018inclusiveness\u2019, exclusion on the basis of gender has continued to persist not just in fact, but also in law. Hence the focus of evidence is from countries of Asia-Pacific. However, given widespread gender-linked gaps in justice systems, and similarities of legal challenges posed, the paper is expected to be relevant also for other similarly placed countries. The motivation of the paper draws from a conviction that all human beings are equally valuable, and that gender by itself is not a legitimate basis for legal discrimination. It is based on the premise that men and women must be able experience substantive equality in justice systems; mechanical equality is not adequate. Yet women, much more than men, are excluded from the rule of law. The situation is aggravated through added disadvantages like poverty, other forms of exclusion, including other gender identities.1 With about 60 per cent of the world\u2019s poor living in the region,2 women of Asia-Pacific are more vulnerable to poverty than men \u2013 not just because they have lower incomes, but also because their economic opportunities and political voice are constrained through restrictions on mobility, employment choices, control over assets and incomes. After a brief discussion of the legal approaches to equality in section one, section two provides selected snapshots of the Asia-Pacific where, despite growing prosperity and stated policies of inclusiveness, gender-linked inequalities are pervasive and can take on unacceptable forms. Since laws are not crafted or enforced in isolation, section three focuses on multiple influences \u2013 both negative as well as positive \u2013 that shape the region\u2019s legal systems. Sections four and five uncover the two broad types of barriers to gender equality within justice systems \u2013 barriers in law and restricted access. The final section six presents three strategic avenues for simultaneous action: fixing institutions \u2013 laws, legal practices and modes of access; changing attitudes of those who create, uphold, and use laws; and three establishing ongoing assessments to reveal inequalities, encourage and monitor progress. 1.2 Legal barriers to gender equality In much of the Asia-Pacific, several laws and legal practices allow, even encourage, discrimination to prevail and persist. Barriers to gender equality operate in two broad ways: (a) barriers in the content of law, and, (b) barriers of access to legal institutions and justice through them. The substantive content of law itself can be a source of inequality in the presence of discriminatory provisions \u2013 patent or latent. Laws may be inconsistent; for example, constitutional provisions of equality may not be consistent with unequal labour or inheritance laws. In other cases they may be absent altogether, like when marital rape is not recognized in law. Moreover, access to justice systems, whether formal or customary, can also be highly restricted. Such barriers, rooted in gender, prevent 1. Gender Equality In Law 5 1. Gender Equality In Law women from getting to the institutions of justice, like the police stations and courts, in the first place. Even when they do find their way to these institutions, finding equal treatment cannot be taken for granted. While legal equality may require an even-handed application of principles of the rule of law \u2013 supremacy of law, equality before the law and predominance of the legal spirit3 \u2013 gender equality in law requires something further. It requires uncovering gender biases and taking cumulative historical disadvantages into account. Women and men have different starting points and face different social, economic, political and institutional circumstances that shape rights, opportunities and capabilities. Sometimes equality is assumed to be at work in laws intended to treat everyone alike, but when examined against the backdrop of gender-linked discrimination, inequality can become explicit. Even with \u201cneutral\u201d laws in place, courts may view women through a gender-stereotype prism, influencing judgments. 1.3 Legal approaches for gender", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "682861ce-6982-4d05-adf6-08edfe052270": {"__data__": {"id_": "682861ce-6982-4d05-adf6-08edfe052270", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs: Overcoming Gender Barriers in Legal Systems", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69805ba73d1ce62afd27aff36a2230810e0be7a8d2499a58647887f8eb5a8387"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c76b92a-ad9d-4008-a036-37236805d687", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32efddd9160794a0aa357ff60303d22ff939bc745e1b775ef07cce783f96644b"}}, "hash": "b84006c2108fc94e33d3a88952d0bb18de1ae75f05dce99d6827fe16e13a9d9a", "text": "equality The concept of equality is an area of much debate. Its application to gender is based on the notion of equal value of all human beings. Three main approaches on equality in law4 can be identified that are relevant for gender: The traditional approach is about \u201cnon discrimination\u201d that entails equal treatment of all. It is based on the \u2018sameness\u2019 principle. Typically, it ignores gender differences between men and women and does not aim to achieve equality of outcomes. A law that treats women differently, for example, provisions for affirmative action, may be considered an infringement of equality. The protectionist approach sees women and men differently. It is also based on the notion that \u201clikes should be treated alike\u201d5 but considers biological differences and justifies differential treatment of men and women, often perceiving women as \u201cweaker\u201d in need of protection. The objective of law then is to protect women. For example, labor laws may prevent female workers from working in night shifts6 to protect them. The effect is often to restrict the victim rather than the perpetrator. The corrective approach is consistent with the principle of substantive equality. It takes into account historic discrimination against women and seeks remedial measures. Over the past few years several progressive legal initiatives \u2013 legislative and judicial \u2013 have in fact been taken in many countries of the region, demonstrating commitments to advancing women\u2019s legal rights. Promoting gender equality in the legal systems requires recognition that women, men and persons of other gender identities, can experience laws and legal systems differently.7 It requires ensuring equality of access and results.8 This means going beyond mechanical equality in law that may ignore the different circumstances faced by people that are directly linked to gender. Thus, under the corrective approach, it includes redressing historical and systemic legal disadvantages, and is consistent with temporary special measures in favour of the systematically disadvantaged. Without such a consensus, the highly unequal conditions for men and women will continue as the gender snapshots from Asia-Pacific indicate in the section 2. 6 Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs 2.1 Growing prosperity does not automatically redress gender gaps Asia-Pacific, recognized as the world\u2019s fastest growing region, allows some extreme forms of gender gaps to continue. The inadequate attention to gender equality in law finds reflection in the region\u2019s poor record on gender overall, including some extreme forms not seen elsewhere. Opposing forces operate: progress is certainly visible, but is interrupted by reversals as \u201ctradition\u201d is used to erect barriers. In fact, in parts of South Asia, girls cannot even take being born for granted and pregnancy can be a life-threatening situation. Travel, assets, inheritance, work outside the home, etc., when mediated through male relatives, can become barriers of daily life. Assessments of the gender gaps in important aspects of life, as well as economic and social rights overall, become important. Some of the barriers women face in everyday life can bee seen in Figure 1. South Asia\u2019s rankings can be close to or lower than those in sub-Saharan Africa, such as life expectancy, adult literacy, secondary education, and participation in the paid labour force. Political participation of women shows the largest male-female gaps in all parts of the world.

The percentage of countries with high discrimination in one or other category increased. In East Asia and the Pacific, the percentage which was zero in 2004, increased to seven in respect of high economic discrimination. The percentage of countries between medium to high levels of discrimination remained as high at 59 per cent in 2007, though it was a decline from the 63 per cent of 2004. In South Asia, the share of countries with high economic discrimination increased from 33 per cent to 44 per cent in the corresponding period.10 The social rights situation in Asia-Pacific is worse than that of economic rights, and is observed to be declining. The share of countries with high social discrimination increased overall. In South Asia, the figures increased from 33 per cent in 2004 to 56 per cent in 2007.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa1320f3-18cd-4ed7-a42a-1dbe01489e0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa1320f3-18cd-4ed7-a42a-1dbe01489e0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs: Overcoming Gender Barriers in Legal Systems", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9971d395bb6435c586140ebcac19d008b974ef43c235f2447abab3739d47fbb"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fab2b54-d97a-4a00-b6aa-4e3cf931d941", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94693e8b0522c382f184c4754e9575d35f4414287bba499133fc6c11a5c3d418"}}, "hash": "1f33a04e0f86704ec2072a5d5810dea3f54718e3887714d2619176bd1d6140b3", "text": "In East Asia and Pacific, while the share of countries with high social discrimination increased marginally, the share with medium to high discrimination rose from 52 per cent in 2004 to 62 per cent in 2007 (Figure 4).11 Figure 4: Discrimination in Women\u2019s Social Rights Source: UNDP 2010. 1000.0 900.0 800.0 700.0 600.0 500.0 400.0 300.0 200.0 100.0 0.0 East Asia & Pacifc Europe & Central Asia Latin America & Caribbean Middle East & North Africa South Asia Sub-Saharan Africa World 1.00 1.02 1.04 1.06 1.08 1.12 1.10 1.14 1.16 1980\u201385 1985\u20131990 1990\u201395 1995\u20132000 2000\u201305 World Eastern Asia Europe Oceania Asia Sub-Saharan Africa Latin America and the Caribbean 2005 1990 India Cambodia China Indonesia High Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births) Medium Low Negligible 10.5% 10.5% 2004 2007 2004 2007 2004 2007 2004 2007 2004 2007 2004 2007 7.4% 18.5% 74% 20% 32% 32% 16% 4% 34.6% 38.5% 23.1% 9.4% 15.6% 53.1% 22% 17% 41.4% 34.5% 6.9% 75% 12.5% 12.5% 12.5% 87.5% 33% 55.6% 11.1% 11.1% 33.3%", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2408934f-76c7-4168-a2d5-ae33c2aa63e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2408934f-76c7-4168-a2d5-ae33c2aa63e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs: Overcoming Gender Barriers in Legal Systems", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1a1d24871ea13b97329d0e74f5a32a5827cdb0e883edd8fc83eb57a1ad97b80"}, "3": {"node_id": "b0ceb723-65b0-4d19-9f49-9d2ea3a37e69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f9cc3c1a73282f3dafa3790566aa3232f667486655aa4093516cdf61d0c8b63"}}, "hash": "9c19fc978473ea43e5e6c513dfef78297faf258c5dda566880f359a7468b5897", "text": "55.6% 40.4% 48.9% 10.6% 8.5% 48.9% 42.6% 57.9% 21% Developed regions East Asia & Pacifc Latin America & Caribbean Middle East & North Africa South Asia Sub-Saharan Africa 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 9 3. Multiple Influences on Law A network of competing and complementary factors affects laws and legal institutions. Laws are neither made nor enforced in isolation: domestic and international factors, past and present, operate. Customs and traditional practices, religious interpretations, domestic constituencies that advocate for equality, external influences like colonial pasts and evolving international legal standards\u2013together matter. These factors, both positive and negative, shape ideas of equality, and influence how a particular law evolves and interpreted. We briefly examine some of these key factors as they impact gender. 3.1 Customs and traditional practices Customs are considered the oldest form of law-making in as much as they refer to those \u2018rules of human action which are established by usage and regarded as legally binding\u2019.12 Customary practices are awarded constitutional recognition in some countries. Customary law may operate in many ways: it could be unwritten and un-codified custom law enforced in a de facto manner by village leaders; codified and enforced by mainstream courts; or broadly recognized in the constitutions, with courts determining its impact on other laws. Tensions between customary laws or traditions on the one hand, and formal law on the other, can allow leeway for varied interpretation to the legal disadvantage for women. In an assessment of formal laws for CEDAW compliance in five Asian countries, it was observed that only three of them had express constitutional provisions granting primacy of formal laws over customary practices (Table 1). Virtually all countries of the Pacific region recognize customary law in their constitutions13 and lack explicit constitutional provisions giving precedence to formal 3.

In Pakistan in 2002, a local jirga pronounced the \u201cpunishment\u201d of gang rape on Mukhtar Mai, whose 14-year-old brother was accused of molesting a woman in an upper class family \u2013 as a cover-up to the fact that the boy had been sodomized by men in that family. An anti-terrorism court convicted six men in the Mukhtar Mai case and sentenced them to death in 2002. The convicts appealed in Lahore High Court. The Court, in its 2005 order, acquitted five accused men and commuted the death sentence of sixth accused to life imprisonment. The Federal Government decided to appeal against the acquittal. In the meantime, the Federal Shariat Court decided to overrule the decision of the Lahore High Court and the accused were arrested again. The very next day, the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal Shariat Court did not have the authority to overrule the decision, and decided to hear the case.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0ceb723-65b0-4d19-9f49-9d2ea3a37e69": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0ceb723-65b0-4d19-9f49-9d2ea3a37e69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs: Overcoming Gender Barriers in Legal Systems", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1a1d24871ea13b97329d0e74f5a32a5827cdb0e883edd8fc83eb57a1ad97b80"}, "2": {"node_id": "2408934f-76c7-4168-a2d5-ae33c2aa63e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c19fc978473ea43e5e6c513dfef78297faf258c5dda566880f359a7468b5897"}}, "hash": "5f9cc3c1a73282f3dafa3790566aa3232f667486655aa4093516cdf61d0c8b63", "text": "In April 2011, the Supreme Court upheld the verdict of Lahore High Court in Mai\u2019s gang rape case.

It gives judges and magistrates, themselves products of patriarchal societies, wide space to interpret laws which may not only be detrimental to the legal interests of women, but also deter them from approaching the institutions of justice in the first place. Courts struggle to manage the simultaneous operation of customary laws and practices, constitutional provisions, longstanding notions of women\u2019s subordinate status and emerging expectations around women\u2019s rights to equality. For example, Tuvalu\u2019s traditional practice of moetolo where a man enters the traditional house (fale) and rapes a woman, while others are sleeping or pretending to sleep, often results in a charge only of trespassing15 even if the rapist is taken to court. In fact such crimes are mostly unreported, and if they are, the court may maintain that someone would have tried to stop it if in fact rape was being committed. Why the watchers did not interfere is ignored \u2013 did they believe that a woman\u2019s role is to please men, a belief often shared by judicial officials? In Pakistan, at times, custom and law can be used as an instrument to consolidate power at the cost of vulnerable women and men (Box 1). Nevertheless, not all customs are automatically more regressive than modern or secular laws. The Inheritance Law of Bhutan, for example, guarantees equal inheritance for sons and daughters, but traditional inheritance practices may also be observed. For most Bhutanese, these practices stipulate that daughters inherit family land. As a result, 60 per cent of rural women hold land registration titles \u2013 a higher figure than anywhere else in South Asia. Bhutan\u2019s inheritance practices favouring daughters also account for the large number of women who own shops and businesses.16 3.2 Discrimination through interpretation of religion Religion-based rules have made their way into the legal codes of many countries. Recognition of religion in constitutions has made it a potent legal and political force, with consequences for how women experience the justice system. In many societies, religion is used by some 11 3. Multiple Influences on Law vested interests through varied interpretations. Religion may be used to curtail women\u2019s freedoms and rights within the sphere of family laws \u2013 marriage, property and inheritance. Most of the Asia-Pacific countries confer some form of constitutional recognition to religious values. In the Pacific 72 per cent of the countries have constitutional provisions recognizing Christian principles. The situation in South Asia is also similar with 67 per cent of constitutions having incorporated provisions on religion. By contrast, in East Asia only 37 per cent of the constitutions recognize religion (Annex: Table 1). Most members of the Pacific\u2019s religious hierarchy have adopted an orthodox and patriarchal interpretation of religion. The Vanuatu Family Protection Act 2008 was designed to protect women from violence. Some Christian churches and traditional chiefs maintained the law contradicts ni-Vanuatu customs and the Christian and Melanesian values in the preamble of the Vanuatu Constitution. The Supreme Court ruled in late November 2008 that the new law is consistent with Vanuatu\u2019s Constitution.17 In Pakistan the debate over the role of religion in shaping women\u2019s legal rights is unending. Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 aimed at upholding women\u2019s legal rights by discouraging polygamy and preserving their rights to divorce. The Ordinance drew criticism from religious leaders and had to be protected through a Fundamental Rights Bill, the first amendment to the Constitution. The amendment specified that the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance was not open to judicial review.18 The politicization of religion under the 1977\u20131985 military regime19 affected women\u2019s freedoms and rights in Pakistan. An \u201cIslamization agenda\u201d was introduced including the draconian Hudood Ordinance in 1979.20 The harsh Zina Ordinance required rape victims to produce four male witnesses as evidence for the alleged crime or face adultery charges. A bill to amend the discriminatory law was introduced in the National Assembly of Pakistan in 2004 which led to a split among the Assembly\u2019s members. Conservative groups felt that the law made in the \u201cname of Islam\u201d should not be abolished. Liberal groups contended that customs and laws that discriminate against women must be repealed.21 The law was finally overturned in 2006 through the Women Protection Bill.22 In India there are constitutional provisions on equal rights for all.

But even though discussions around a uniform civil code for all communities are vibrant, efforts to actually enact such a code have not been successful.23 Communities have the freedom to follow their own personal laws and many discriminatory legal practices are grounded in religion. Religion also plays an important role in shaping the legal systems of East Asia. In Thailand, Buddhism has considerable influence in the way society views the role and status of women. Buddhist female monks are not considered equal to male monks. Thailand\u2019s National Buddhist Monks Committee still considers nuns as only \u201cchurchwomen\u201d and not monks. Consequently, nuns do not have rights nor receive the same benefits as other members of this committee.24 3.3 Colonial pasts impinge upon the present Asia-Pacific countries continue to carry the external marks of their colonial pasts. Outdated legal codes persist in the legal systems of many of the former British colonies. For example, the Penal Code, the Evidence Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure based on British legacy form the basis of the criminal justice systems in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka even today.25 Pre-colonial India based its law in religious texts considered sacred. Different communities followed their own divinely inspired laws.26 The function of the state was restricted to enforcing laws rather than making them since the laws were already considered complete. Judicial procedures were not highly institutionalized. A typical legal proceeding in pre-colonial India was likely to be conducted by a village headman or a committee or panchayat, consisting of local men of status. The plaintiff and defendant would conduct their case while members of the village council assessed the circumstances and rendered verdicts.27 The colonists believed that their legal system and laws should serve as a model for others regardless of local values systems and norms.28 As a consequence, many 12 Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs discriminatory legal norms and practices took root in the criminal systems: rape laws with narrow definitions including the exclusion of marital rape, and considering consent from the view of the offender. British colonies also inherited laws criminalizing sodomy and sex work, some of which still remain in force.29 Colonization influenced the Pacific also. The traditionally matrilineal societies \u2013 Fiji, Republic of Marshall Island, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands \u2013 turned patrilineal. Women no longer had the same rights to assets or inheritance. In Pohnpei in Federated States of Micronesia, German Law codified land legislation that favoured patrilineal inheritance. It awarded \u2018each adult male a piece of land\u2019, so land is now commonly transferred from father to son.30 3.4 National demands for legislative and judicial reforms Countries in Asia-Pacific have themselves pursued legal reforms in response to growing demands from internal constituencies, new national priorities and to better conform to international standards and commitments. While some reforms have brought in more gender equality, progress has been mixed.31 Legislative changes and judicial precedents have contributed to reform. Legislative reforms: In South Asia, Sri Lanka\u2019s Penal Code of 1883 has undergone many amendments since 1995 taking account of some criminal law offences with adverse impacts on women. To curb violence against women, the Penal Code included provisions on sexual harassment, grave sexual abuse, incest, sexual exploitation of children, trafficking, etc. In addition the revised Penal Code provisions 1995, imposed \u201csevere sentences, mandatory imprisonment and fine\u201d on perpetrators. Award of mandatory compensation to victims of sexual assault is also introduced. Section 364 of the Penal Code (as amended by Act No. 13, 22 of 1995 and 10, 16 of 2006) increased imprisonment for rape offences. Before the amended law the perpetrator faced zero to 20 years of imprisonment. With the new amendment, the minimum sentence for rape has been increased from zero to seven years.32 Over the years, Pakistan has also undertaken legislative initiatives to uphold the legal rights of women. Through Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act 2006, some of the discriminatory provisions of 1979 Hudood Ordinance have been changed. Gang rape is criminalized, ten years minimum sentence for rape is prescribed for perpetrators and the coercive circumstances under which consent can be obtained from the victim has been expanded. Most importantly, rape has been brought under the purview of the Penal Code. This eliminates the previous requirement for four male witnesses to validate a woman\u2019s allegation of rape and allows convictions to be made on the basis of forensic and circumstantial evidence.33 In East Asia, legal reforms have focused on enacting new laws and changes in existing discriminatory legislation.

Viet Nam has enacted the comprehensive Law on Gender Equality in 2006 that guarantees women\u2019s rights in the public and private spheres by eliminating discrimination against women and girls and promoting gender equality.34 Indonesia has reformed its discriminatory Citizenship Act (1958) in 2006, conferring on Indonesian women the right to pass on their nationality to the children irrespective of their marital status or spouse\u2019s nationality.35 In countries of the Pacific too new legislative initiatives have been introduced to redress legal discrimination against women. Papua New Guinea reformed its criminal law through the Criminal Code (Sexual Offences and Crimes against Children) Act 2002. The Act dramatically changed its sexual assault regime. A number of new offences have been introduced, for instance, and offences graded according to the gravity of harm, integrating the many ways in which women are sexually violated. Harsher sentences have been introduced, marital immunity that had previously prevented husbands from being prosecuted for a charge of rape was removed, and the common law practice of requiring corroboration as evidence was abolished.36 Judicial precedents: Judicial rulings can have impacts, positive and negative, on women\u2019s legal interests. Bangladesh\u2019s High Court gave a landmark 2009 judgment in the first application of its sexual harassment guidelines. The affected female students of Jahangirnagar University challenged the sexual harassment inquiry set-up by 13 3. Multiple Influences on Law the university in the High Court and got a verdict in their favour. The Court held that University\u2019s decision to exonerate the perpetrator and expel the students was \u201cwithout lawful authority\u201d.37 The Court\u2019s ruling is significant in two ways: one, it reinforces the importance of common law in providing legal protection to victims of sexual offences; and two, it sets a precedent which can act as a deterrent for future perpetrators. In addition, the Court, during the case hearing, observed that rigid rules of corroboration and standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d are not always required to substantiate allegations of sexual harassment. This points to a positive emerging trend within the region \u2013 realization among the legal fraternity, judges in particular, of the importance of having flexible rules of evidentiary requirements for sexual offences. Judicial precedents may also stand in the way of achieving substantive equality for all. In 2008, the Sri Lankan Supreme Court, in a rape case, concluded that the minimum mandatory sentence for rape and other sexual offences was tantamount to interference with judicial discretion by the legislature. The Section 364(2) (e) of the Penal Code (as amended by Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995) prescribes a minimum mandatory sentence of 10 years the offence of rape. The Court observed that the minimum mandatory sentence is in conflict with Articles 4 (c), 11 and 12 (1) of the Constitution and that the High Court is not inhibited from imposing a sentence that it deems appropriate in the exercise of its \u201cjudicial discretion\u201d notwithstanding the minimum mandatory sentence.38 In the Pacific region, there are numerous cases where judges have protected and upheld women\u2019s freedoms and rights through just rulings and progressive precedents (Box 2). 3.5 International legal standards for gender equality International agreements can be important benchmarks to guide gender equality and internal support groups. Countries of Asia-Pacific have pro-actively used them to influence domestic legislation. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) offers a comprehensive framework for gender equality based on the principles of equality, non- discrimination and state obligation.39 The Convention\u2019s substantive equality framework is applied outside as well as inside the home. In its preamble the Convention explicitly acknowledges that \u2018\u2018extensive discrimination against women continues to exist\u2019\u2019 and emphasizes that such discrimination \u2018\u2018violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity\u2019\u2019. Article 1 of the Convention defines discrimination as \u2018\u2018any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex\u2026. in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field\u2019\u2019. Articles 2\u20134 cover the general obligations of States Parties.

Source: Kiribati Court of Appeal 2006. 14 Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs Outside the Middle East and North Africa, Asia-Pacific has the highest percentage of CEDAW states parties with some form of reservation. It is also second only to the Middle East and North Africa in the percentage of countries that have not signed the CEDAW Optional Protocol, a complaint mechanism meant to strengthen enforcement of CEDAW.43 In the Pacific, a study of nine countries on compliance with CEDAW within their laws found rates ranging from 18 per cent to 44 per cent, with Fiji having the highest ranking.44 Nevertheless, the CEDAW has been instrumental in some countries to reform civil and criminal laws. For example, the 2003 Fiji Family Law Act removes systemic discrimination against women and children in a manner consistent with CEDAW. Vanuatu\u2019s 2008 Family Protection Act is the only stand-alone legislation combating domestic violence in the Pacific which was guided by CEDAW and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.45 Viet Nam is using CEDAW in its comprehensive review of legal normative documents that has followed the adoption of its 2006 Law on Gender Equality. In Cambodia, the Ministry of Justice is spearheading a CEDAW review of legislation on domestic violence, trafficking, domestic workers and marriage.46 In Nepal, although marital rape is still not a criminal offence, a judgment of the Supreme Court held that an exemption from marital rape conflicts with CEDAW. The Court used CEDAW and reasoned that if an act is an offence by its very nature, it is unreasonable to say that it is not an offence merely because different categories of individuals commit it. The Court ruled that marital rape is a denial of a woman\u2019s independent right to existence and self respect.47 International instruments also aim to redress specific gender issues such as the conditions of female combatants. Women have been active participants in several armed conflicts and political upheavals \u2013 in Nepal\u2019s Maoist movement, as volunteers in the Iraqi army, in the independence struggle of Timor-Leste, and in Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil conflict. They undergo intense physical, psychological and emotional experiences, and also pick up a variety of skills some of which are transferable to productive civil life. But post-conflict rehabilitation efforts that predominantly focus on civilians, refugees and other displaced population miss out on the special needs and enormous potential of females. Gender comes in the way when women and girls tend to be counted among camp followers and refugees rather than ex-combatants eligible for full rehabilitation packages. Both sexes share the same danger, insecurity and living conditions as females function not just in \u201csupport\u201d roles but also for all other activities like intelligence, combat, bombings and suicide missions, logistics and administration. To redress grievances of female combatants, the Security Council Resolution 1325, passed in 2000, aims to remove barriers to equal participation in peace building.48 The Resolution encourages \u2018all those involved in the planning of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration to consider the different needs of female and male ex-combatants\u2019.49 There are other international instruments which address different aspects of discrimination against women. For instance Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) address discrimination on the basis of sex. Thus, international instruments can support national efforts towards greater equality. Nevertheless barriers remain embedded in laws that govern justice systems. It is to these barriers that section four turns. 15 4. Barriers of Laws Laws in Asia-Pacific continue to fall short of fully embracing notions of equality for all citizens. While some progress has been made, this section examines barriers in the substantive content of laws themselves that come in the way of women\u2019s full enjoyment of equal legal rights. Laws, as constructed, may be inconsistent or have gaps. In some cases they may be absent altogether when a systematic gender-linked circumstance is not recognized. Such barriers in the provisions of laws can be patent or latent. 4.1 Patent barriers Across the region, many discriminatory laws hold women (and other disadvantaged people) back.

General constitutional provisions on non-discrimination open doors for wide interpretation. An obvious place for locating an overt barrier in national legal systems is the constitution \u2013 the basis for securing further rights across legal systems. Most countries in the region provide only general constitutional guarantees of equality and non- discrimination for various groups, including women. South Asian countries, with the exception of Nepal, refer to the biological sex, rather than the broader definition of gender, which include socialized roles and behaviours. Discrimination is not defined, and the prohibition mostly applies to the state, excluding the growing private sector. The lack of constitutional definitions on gender equality allows laws and court systems wide latitude in interpretation, including in ways that can perpetuate discrimination. Most East Asian countries prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sex and mention equality in their constitutions. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam have gone further in defining the specifics of gender equality and non-discrimination in their constitutions. Both have consequently been able to assign penalties for discriminatory acts through legal provisions.50 Malaysia also added the word \u201cgender\u201d in its constitutional provision that led to the review of its legal system (Box 3). China\u2019s constitution stipulates that men and women should enjoy equal rights in all spheres of life but does not clearly define discrimination.51 It lacks specific legal provisions on some issues integral to achieving gender equality such as a guarantee of equal pay for equal work despite persistence of wage gaps.52 In countries of the Pacific, most constitutions have a general equality provision with specific definitions of discrimination in which citizens are entitled to certain BOX 3. Constitutional Provision on Gender Discrimination Paves the Way for Legal Review in Malaysia In 2001, Malaysia added the word \u201cgender\u201d to a constitutional provision against discrimination that includes religion, race, descent and place of birth. This seemingly simple change prompted a broad review of all legislation, including laws on domestic violence, marriage and divorce, and land. While there is still no clear definition of \u201cdiscrimination against women\u201d in Malaysian law, the change has eliminated any legal argument that gender-based discrimination is permissible.

Barriers of Laws 16 Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs basic rights, regardless of their religion, race, place of origin, political opinions, colour, religion or creed and so on. Apart from Fiji, no constitution specifically protects discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.53 However, Vanuatu\u2019s example of criminalizing discrimi- nation exists where the 1981 Penal Code makes discrimination a criminal offence \u2013 an unusual provision in the Pacific region.54 But no one in Vanuatu has been known to have been prosecuted for a breach of Section 150 despite the high level of discrimination against ni-Vanuatu women in both conventional and kustom law systems. Legal provisions discriminate on the basis of gender. One of the most glaring examples of how legal systems in Asia-Pacific drift from the principles of equality is in nationality rights, part of the foundation of citizenship itself. Women cannot take equal citizenship for granted as they may lose their right to retain nationality in case of a marriage to a foreign national. Figure 5 shows that 43 per cent of countries in South Asia deny women, married to foreign nationals, their right to acquire, retain or renounce nationality. In the Pacific, 36 per cent of the countries follow similar discriminatory nationality laws. East Asia\u2019s record in upholding women\u2019s nationality rights is better than South Asia or the Pacific as 22 per cent countries discriminate against women married to foreign men. Based on the patriarchic notion that men are the automatic \u201chead of the family\u201d, it is assumed that everything should flow through them. Some countries deny female citizens the right to determine the nationality of children born from a foreign spouse. While foreign spouses of women do not have the right to obtain citizenship, male citizens do not face similar constraints. Source: UNDP 2010.

Barriers of Laws Malaysia\u2019s constitutional provision on citizenship, for example, states that a Malaysian woman married to a foreigner can only confer her Malaysian nationality on her child if the child is born in Malaysia. A Malaysian man married to a foreigner, however, can confer his Malaysian nationality on his child regardless of the place of birth.55 To redress this legal inequity, Pakistan has amended discriminatory nationality law through 2000 amendment of its Citizenship Act 1951. The amended law allows women married to foreign nationals to determine the nationality of their children.56 Patent discrimination can also prevail through different notions on acceptable sexuality for women and men, even in the presence of explicit constitutional equality. The case of the Philippines may be seen in Box 4. Overt legal discrimination is not perpetuated against women and girls only, but also against people of other gender identities. Most of the legal systems in the Asia- Pacific criminalize same-sex relationships (Figure 6). Such relationships are considered unlawful in majority of the countries in West and South Asia. Higher courts of India and Nepal, however, have issued rulings that decriminalize same-sex relations and uphold the fundamental rights of sexual minorities.58 In East Asia, 25 per cent of countries discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. The situation in the Pacific is far more unequal. About 64 Figure 6: Same Sex Relationships are Unlawful in Many Countries of the Region Notes: East Asia: In Indonesia, it is legal except in provinces or districts that have enacted local laws based on Sharia law (e.g. South Sumatra Province); West and South Asia: For India, such relationships are legal in the National Capital of Delhi, as a result of Naz Foundation Case 2009.

Absence of laws on gender-based violence. Even when well- intentioned principles provide a framework for gender equality, gaps in legal systems occur on issues related to women. An area in Asia-Pacific where gaps in laws are longstanding is violence against women.

Thus there are clear signs of positive change. Most Asia-Pacific countries have little to offer in legislation on sexual harassment at the workplace, despite surveys in the region suggesting that 30 to 40 per cent of women workers report some form of harassment \u2013 verbal, physical or sexual.60 Most countries in the Pacific fail to provide legal protection to female workers as around 73 per cent of them have no legislation on sexual harassment at the workplace. The record of East Asia and South Asia in upholding female workers rights is better \u2013 46 and 43 per cent respectively (Annex: Table 3). Is the bringing up of the next generation only the mother\u2019s responsibility, even at the cost of losing wages and curtailing other activities? Most South Asian countries do have provisions on maternity leave, while paternity leave is still not widely accepted. In East Asia only a few countries have provisions for paternity leave. Malaysia and the Philippines grant seven days to fathers of newborns.61 In the Pacific none of the nine countries examined by a CEDAW legislative indicators study met the standard of 14 weeks of paid maternity leave recommended by CEDAW and the ILO. CEDAW recommends that it be paid and the ILO specifies the 14 weeks.62 Some countries are making progress to fill legal gaps in particular areas. The 2002 Acid Attacks Crime Repression Act and Acid Control Act in Bangladesh aims to stop the practice of disfiguring women by throwing acid on them and goes so far as to prescribe death penalty for perpetrators.63 To address its large number of dowry- related murders, India added a separate definition of BOX 4. Discriminatory Legal Notions on Sexuality in the Philippines The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines 1987 upholds equality before the law for all citizens. However its 1930 Penal Code followed discriminatory notions on sexuality. Articles 333 and 334 of the Revised Penal Code in the Philippines define sexual infidelity differently for men and women. A wife is criminally liable for adultery with a man who is not her husband. On the other hand, a husband\u2019s adulterous act with a woman not his wife is not a crime. The husband can be criminally liable for the crime of \u201cconcubinage\u201d only if he is caught with another woman \u201cunder scandalous circumstances\u201d or when he cohabits with another woman in the conjugal dwelling or in any other place.57 Source: Cheema 2010. 19 4. Barriers of Laws \u201cdowry death\u201d in its Penal Code. When the death of a woman occurs within seven years of marriage due to burns or bodily injury, and it is shown that she was treated with cruelty or harassment by her husband and/or relatives before death, the law presumes that the husband and/or relatives were the cause of her death.64 Another legal milestone in the region is the Anti-Violence against Women and Their Children Act (R.A. 9262) of the Philippines, passed in 2004. It covers domestic violence and supersedes Penal Code provisions for crimes where an intimate relationship is alleged. The Act encompasses physical, sexual, psychological and economic abuses. It considers violence against women and their children a public offense, which means that a complaint may be filed by any citizen who is aware of the crime.65 In the Pacific region, as well efforts are evident to fill legal gaps through law-making, despite resistance from opposing forces (Box 5). Protectionist labour laws can hold back female workers. Labour laws may impose protectionist measures aimed to keep women away from certain jobs deemed unsafe. Such discriminatory laws are often justified on the basis of male- female differences. This can limit paid work opportunities for female workers and cause hostility when employment laws stipulate equal work opportunities for both male and female workers. While certain conditions may warrant this kind of regulation \u2013 for example, maternity \u2013 others simply deprive individuals of opportunities and choices or reinforce prevailing gender stereotypes about women\u2019s capabilities outside the home.66 A number of Pacific countries and territories, for example, restrict women\u2019s employment choices by banning them from night work and sectors like mining.67 In Papua New Guinea and Samoa women are also prohibited from undertaking manual work.68 Similar discriminatory provisions exist in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam.

Figure 7: Most Pacific Countries Need to Enact Laws against Domestic Violence 20 Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs cannot assign a female employee to heavy or dangerous work, or work requiring contact with toxic substances, which has adverse effects on her ability to \u201cbear and raise a child\u201d.69 Sri Lanka had restrictions on female overseas workers with young children. Legal protections on working conditions should be available to all workers to promote of decent work, regardless of gender. Some countries are starting to reverse discriminatory employment legislation. Although the Fiji Ministry for Employment still has discretion to limit the types of work that women do, it removed restrictions from legislation some years ago in response to lobbying from women\u2019s organizations.70 Diversity can undermine women\u2019s rights. Where individual communities are legally bound to follow their own personal laws influenced mainly by religion, women\u2019s legitimate rights to free marriage, property and inheritance can be adversely affected. This is particularly so in countries of South Asia like Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, where marriage and divorce laws endeavour to meet the complicated requirements of Hindu, Muslim and Christian communities. In India, people from Hindu, Muslim and Christian communities may be married under their community law, under an optional civil law or under the 1954 Special Marriages Act for inter-religious marriages. One side-effect of the civil law, flowing from the requirement of a month or more notice period in the office of registrar of marriages, is enabling radical religious groups or objecting relatives to track these notices and harass couples in cases of mixed marriages.71 Divorce regulations in South Asia also vary by community. The Islamic procedure, where the divorce is through pronouncing the word talaq three times in the presence of two witnesses, is allowed in Afghanistan, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Nepal and Sri Lanka. Bangladesh and Pakistan have restricted this in favour of reconciliation. Since post-divorce maintenance laws for Muslims are also influenced by Islamic traditions, a woman may not be entitled to maintenance beyond the conventional three-month period of Iddat, if she is pregnant, until the birth of her child or till she remarries.72 While this was quite progressive in the past, the growing social fragmentation of modern societies means that it often results in female deprivation. The law of divorce for Hindus in India was based on establishing \u201cwrongs\u201d, where the spouse who seeks divorce had to prove cruelty, adultery, desertion or other grounds listed in the statute. While Christian men can seek divorce on the grounds of adultery or other reasons; Christian women can only file based on adultery. Hindus in Bangladesh and Pakistan cannot obtain divorces since they are considered prohibited under Shastric Hindu scriptures.73 In the Pacific, formal legislation forbids multiple forms of marriage, even though these were historically accepted BOX 5. Domestic Violence Declared A Criminal Offence in Vanuatu In 2008, the Vanuatu Parliament passed the Family Protection Act after more than 10 years of intense lobbying and campaigning by the Vanuatu Women\u2019s Centre, the Vanuatu National Council of Women and other women\u2019s NGOs. In passing the bill, the Government side voted unanimously for it but the opposition walked out of Parliament. Many people and groups were consulted in preparing draft legislation, including churches and the Malvatumauri (House of Chiefs). The law recognizes domestic violence both as a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment and a civil offence that allows for protection orders. Any person in a domestic relationship is entitled to a protection order. The Act makes it illegal to use culture, custom or the payment of bride price as a defense. It removes various legal impediments that prevent successful prosecution. The police have extensive powers and can arrest without a warrant. They are required to bring an arrested person to court within 48 hours. Source: Jalal 2009; The Family Protection Act 2008. 21 4. Barriers of Laws in most parts of the sub-region until the spread of Christianity. This results in a different kind of problem. In Fiji, some 27 percent of Muslims also enter into Muslim marriages that are not technically legal.74 Women then do not have legal protections on issues such as divorce, property and custody of children.

Thus, while there is protection for \u2018the fine customs and practices of the ethnic minority people\u2019, \u201cbackward\u201d marriage and family customs like underage and forced marriages, polygamy and snatching wives are restricted. 75 4.2 Latent barriers Less explicit subtler inequalities prevalent in legal systems also need to be examined as they also contribute to exclusion. These may be invisible or dismissed as insignificant. Some are justified on the basis of perceived gender roles or social norms. Inconsistencies give room for discrimination. Loosely defined provisions on equality in constitutions or the recognition of multiple systems of law without establishing a clear hierarchy may cause hidden barriers to equality through allowing legal inconsistencies. In the Pacific, virtually all countries have their constitution as the supreme law, but recognize customary laws as well.76 Which should take precedence when they conflict is unclear. Some constitutions allow exceptions to the principle of non-discrimination for customary laws. For example, the Constitution of Solomon Islands 1978 stipulates that \u2018this section (protection against discrimination) shall not apply to any law so far as that law makes provision\u2026. for the application of customary law\u2019.77 This means that even though statutes derived from the constitution may not discriminate against women, customary forms of discrimination can still legally take place with constitutional backing. Another hidden barrier that undercuts women\u2019s legal rights is the persistence of discriminatory notions about sexuality and gender roles in some legal systems. Indonesia\u2019s Marriage Law No. 1 of 1974 distinguishes the role of a husband from that of a wife. The husband is considered the \u201chead\u201d of the family and the wife regarded \u201cmother\u201d of the household.78 Concepts such as the \u201chead\u201d of the family do not have legal recognition in all countries, but are widely used in official surveys and statistics. Such narrow definitions of gender roles within marriage can curtail women\u2019s choices and freedoms. Narrowly defined law can limit scope. This is another subtle legal barrier that produces legal discrimination. Countries may have a specific law against domestic violence, but may stop short of prescribing adequate penalties for perpetrators, negating its stated intent. In Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, for example, domestic violence is recognized in its 2004 Family Law, but there is no penalty contemplated. In case \u2018violence is not serious\u2019, the law insists upon mediation through family members, close relatives or a village mediation unit rather than prosecution of the perpetrator.79 Viet Nam\u2019s Penal Code considers a women\u2019s ability to defend herself \u2013 not the issue of whether or not she has given consent. Prior sexual conduct can be used to establish consent80 though it may not be there. When a law omits certain perpetrators from its purview, such an exclusion may restrict women\u2019s ability to seek legal remedies. The Philippines\u2019s 1995 Anti-Sexual Harassment Act prohibits harassment in the workplace where only supervisors, employers and managers with \u201cauthority and influence\u201d are penalized for acts of harassment. The law is silent on sexual abuses by co-workers.81 In the Pacific, although countries have legislated against sexual assault, but many fall short of adequate protection for the range of sexual violations perpetrated against girls and women. And most fail to prescribe adequate penalties for sexual assault crimes.82 This can imply that sexual assault is not a serious offence. Social norms and gender stereotypes can be potent barriers. Social norms and prevailing stereotypes on gender also influence notions about men and women that are reflected in legal systems. Patriarchal societies of the Asia-Pacific are premised on a social notion of male superiority. Violent behaviour in the home may be treated as \u201cnormal\u201d male behaviour not requiring legal intervention. In Viet Nam the Confucian concept that men are responsible for 22 Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs the \u201ceducation\u201d of their wives and children underpins acceptance of physical violence. Similarly despite of its 2006 Law on Gender equality, women may be denied their due inheritance rights as in some rural ethnic groups where parents may refuse due inheritance share to their married daughters83 though marriage does not debar sons, in spite of general equality in inheritance. In the Pacific customs and traditions may stand in the way of women\u2019s legitimate rights to own land and inherit property.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c19ceb1-f654-415d-a215-342a7c001b2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c19ceb1-f654-415d-a215-342a7c001b2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs: Overcoming Gender Barriers in Legal Systems", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fe3e1167647e5b07d852850558d112f9b8a5f9ed49a157ddec43c5d1a0f1465"}, "2": {"node_id": "e41861db-8197-4d22-96f2-3038409cc86f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enforcing-rights-and-correcting-wrongs-overcoming-gender-barriers-legal-systems", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9794a0f6c6e0e44a5d867ba2ff221d3e5eac45ea1c1b6f0f39ddfc2fbfe7f9f"}}, "hash": "7c67713a503a01a2524add8d40136a47d18cfa45313607bf0937c301966be5ae", "text": "The Custom Policy in Vanuatu, for example, provides that the \u201ctrue custom owners\u201d of land are men whose lineage is directly linked to the community living within the borders of the land.

This means that women in Vanuatu may own land, if at all, only as a very last resort.84 Influenced by social norms, child marriages continue to be widely practiced in Bangladesh.85 This contradicts the legal provision of minimum marriage age of 18 years for girls.86 Some legal practices can have negative effects. Although justice systems across the region have tried to remove overtly discriminatory statutes, they still allow certain discriminatory legal practices like forgiveness and settlement. In the Philippines, marital rape is a criminal offence under its 1997 Anti-Rape Law. However the legal provision of \u201cforgiveness\u201d extinguishes the criminal dimension of the offence and its penalties.87 Article 266-C of the Law stipulates \u201cin case it is the legal husband who is the offender, the subsequent forgiveness by the wife as the offended party shall extinguish the criminal action or the penalty\u201d. A similar legal practice is observed in Pakistan. Under Article 306(c) of the 1860 Pakistani Penal Code, if a man murders his wife and they have children, her children cannot ask for qisas (essentially the death penalty) for her murder. In these circumstances, the maximum sentence that can be given when a man murders his wife is fourteen years. Many see a father financially compensating (diyat) his children for the loss of their mother as a \u201cmockery\u201d.88 Such legal practices prevail in the Pacific also. Most countries observe customary reconciliation practices of forgiveness \u2013 I-bulubulu in Fiji or ifoga in Samoa. The parties involved in \u201csettlement deal\u201d are the rapist\u2019s and survivor\u2019s families. Such practices are used by the police and courts not only to justify reduced sentences if convicted, but also in some cases not filing charges at all. \u201cForgiveness\u201d ceremonies can take place without the complainant\u2019s actual participation (Box 6).89 There have been several legal initiatives to redress such cases of discriminatory legal practices. Pakistan has legislated against the despicable customary law practice of vanni \u2013 the giving away of women as compensation for pardoning of the offender. An amendment incorporated in Section 310 of the Penal Code has made vanni a criminal offence, punishable by imprisonment of up to 14 years and a minimum sentence of not less than seven years.90 In the Pacific Vanuatu has taken the lead by legislating BOX 6. A Harmful Customary Settlement Public Prosecutor Vs Tabisal, Vanuatu The accused had pleaded guilty of raping a nine-year old year. He paid the local chiefs customary settlement of three pigs and six mats in total valued at 74,000 vatu. Neither the rape survivor nor her parents shared in the compensation. In court, the charge was reduced from rape to unlawful sexual intercourse. The High Court said that the offence was very serious because of the girl\u2019s tender age. However, because the accused was a \u201cfirst offender\u201d and had made a customary settlement, he was sentenced for only three years. Source: Jalal 1998. 23 4. Barriers of Laws against forgiveness ceremonies. Family Protection Act 2008 stipulates that the payment of bride price has no bearing on guilt or punishment in domestic violence cases.91 Section 10 (2) states \u201cit is not a defence to an offence that the defendant has paid an amount of money or given other valuable consideration in relation to his or her custom marriage to the complainant\u201d. Judicial rulings can be regressive as can legislation. Judicial rulings can reflect biases against legislative reforms and may consider them as infringement of judicial discretion. Reversals may result from internal efforts towards legal equality.

This section explores gender-based barriers of access to legal institutions like courts, and also barriers inside courtrooms. Globally, four billion people \u2013 most of the world\u2019s population \u2013 are excluded from the rule of law96, with gender being an important contributory factor. Women, more than men, may not be able to access justice mechanisms to seek redress.97 5.1 Barriers to reaching courts A number of factors may restrict women\u2019s full access to formal and customary justice systems. The most obvious is opportunities to travel \u2013 courts may be too far and social norms may limit female mobility without facilitation or permission from a male relative, sometime the very person against whom a woman is seeking redress. Women\u2019s disproportionate household responsibilities can leave limited time for complicated legal processes and frequent interactions with the lawyers. They may face physical threats in pursuing action against husbands, other family members, or even the broader power structure. Fear of losing children or economic sustenance can be very real. Norms that require women to remain silent may be internalized, when they come to believe themselves as being of less value less and deserving less.98 The sheer costs of access to police stations, lawyers, travel and stay can be a deterrent. This is even more so for the poor. In respect of customary mechanisms, women may be excluded through factors such as ineffective enforcements of decisions (mandatory or voluntary), elite capture, procedures contrary to national and international standards. Lack of well understood minimum standards for mediators may also curtail women\u2019s expectations within customary justice systems, and deter them from access.99 At times, factors like custom and tradition explain why some women never access justice systems. A survey carried out by the Cambodian Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs found that even though over 22 per cent of married women report experiencing violence within their homes,100 up to 89 per cent do nothing, despite new national laws to protect them from such violence. Those who do report can face customary expectations of violence being a private issue and a prerogative of men.101 To overcome access barriers, countries have taken steps to bring judicial mechanisms closer to women. In Afghanistan, the Government has introduced mobile courts as a practical solution to improve overall access. Teams of experienced judges, prosecutors, lawyers and administrative officials make periodic visits to more remote or insecure places that may be too small to justify permanent staffing.102 India has taken a step forward on the issue of sexual harassment by requiring workplaces that employ women to set up commissions that are at least 50 per cent female to receive and act on complaints.103 Malaysia has pioneered one-stop centres in hospitals that provide easy access to medical care, social services and specially trained police units for victims of domestic or sexual violence.104 5.2 Barriers inside courtrooms Even when women do find their way to legal institutions, finding equal treatment cannot be taken for granted. Judicial practices may also be influenced by discriminatory social norms that undervalue women\u2019s rights or concerns, or treat them less than seriously. The onerous court procedures are also a factor. Most countries in the Asia-Pacific have a fault-based divorce system. This requires proof of a matrimonial offence such as adultery, desertion for a required number of years, willful refusal to consummate marriage, habitual cruelty, etc., which can force women to face indignities. In a study conducted to assess national laws compliance with CEDAW, all five Asian countries grant divorce on certain grounds only (Table 2). In addition, parties must hire lawyers, file court cases and bring witnesses to court to 5. Barriers of Access 25 5. Barriers of Access provide supporting evidence \u2013 a tremendous burden for anyone, and more so for poor and rural women. Divorce laws that are gender-neutral may fail to take into account the unequal gendered circumstances.

This places women at a disadvantage because they have less education and access to jobs and assets, or may have been economically dependent on the men they want to divorce.105 These barriers are compounded by unfair distribution of marital property and limited capacity to enforce maintenance awards, which are often inadequate to begin with. Their share in marital assets is often linked to women\u2019s measurable financial contribution to family resources.

It took until late 2008 for a Fiji court, drawing on a new law on the more equal division of property, to finally take into account domestic contributions and award a wife of 37 years half the marital assets.106 Court systems continue to inflict procedural indignities that can leave women doubly victimized. In sensitive cases such as rape and domestic violence, women may still be expected to narrate their experiences in graphic detail, including to male personnel, in cultures where public discussion of sexual acts is unacceptable. Some lower courts in India still insist on archaic tests on a woman\u2019s hymen as \u201cproof \u201d of rape or to raise the issue of whether or not she is habituated to sexual relationships107 \u2013 neither of which is relevant to establish non-consensual acts. Courts may demonstrate reluctance to uphold judgments or pursue crimes against women. Some of it is due to a lack of appropriate orientation and gender-sensitization or sanctions against judicial personnel for neglect or bias. The absence of training for police and court officials on gender and the specifics of gender-based crimes can be telling. On crimes that involve gender-based violence there is an unwillingness to exercise powers of arrest, file charges and pursue criminal prosecutions. Considered low priority, such cases may be assigned to less experienced judicial personnel. Untrained police and court personnel may rely more on stereotypes than on current knowledge of why gender-based violence occurs and the serious damage it can cause.108 In Fiji, before enforcement mechanisms were tightened for maintenance payments after divorce, 50 per cent of maintenance awards were not paid or enforced, a further 35 per cent of orders were enforced only intermittently and just 15 per cent of fathers paid maintenance regularly under maintenance orders.109 Pacific courts rarely award prison sentences that reflect the seriousness of domestic violence as a crime, despite the fact it can easily be a repeated offense.

In practice, courts hesitate to imprison a male breadwinner in the perceived interest of the victim and family. Yet there is some anecdotal evidence of higher rates of prosecutions in Pacific countries and territories \u2013 Fiji, Vanuatu, Cooks Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands \u2013 where the police have dedicated units investigating and prosecuting violence against women, domestic and sexual assault. Together with \u201cno drop\u201d policies (so even if the victim is unwilling to pursue prosecution after filing criminal charges, charges will not be dropped), there seems to be better detection and prosecution, even though systematic research is unavailable.110 Discriminatory rules of evidence may undermine women\u2019s voice in courts. In Pakistan, the value of a woman\u2019s testimony in court is considered half that of a man\u2019s in financial matters and future obligations.111 Many Pacific Island countries and territories continue to require proof of resistance in sexual assault cases and allow the admission of past sexual history.112 These requirements not only discourage rape victims from reporting due to the heavy social sanctions against speaking out, they also interfere with prosecution even after the victim has somehow managed to reach a court from reluctance to relive the experience through a trial. Sometimes the legal system is deliberately used to harm women. Though running away from home is not a crime in Afghanistan, many girls and women are in prison, some for as long as 10 years now, for having done so.113 Courts in India and Sri Lanka have allowed the defense of \u201cgrave and sudden provocation\u201d to continue as a hangover from common law.114 Under Indian Penal Code 1860: Section 300 (on murder) sub section (d) exception 1 stipulates \u201cCulpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident\u201d.115 Such a defense mitigates the seriousness of crimes such as murder \u2013 the concern here being \u201chonour killings\u201d. Despite an amendment in the Pakistan Penal Code, the mitigation of sentences for such killings has continued.116 27 5. Barriers of Access 5.3 Mixed experiences in customary justice systems Customary justice systems are pre-existing methods of resolving disputes within the communities.117 They may include state sanctioned Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) processes as well as non-state local justice systems. ADR mechanisms are set up to address shortcomings of formal courts and are considered to have some value in bringing justice closer to people by being less expensive, less time-consuming and enforcing decisions quickly through community consent. They may decide on petty matters, such as a dispute over lost livestock, but they can also act on serious issues such as adultery and murder. Being closer, such systems may be more accessible to women than formal justice systems. The jirga system that operates in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, and the shalishi system in rural Bangladesh are informal mechanisms that decide by consensus and impose punishments (Box 7). But such systems may also produce discrimination through their very processes. In India, community justice mechanisms connected to caste have carried out some violent sentences against members of Dalit communities for \u201ccrimes\u201d such as marrying someone from another community. They commonly serve the interests of local elites, backed by community sanction, and so attempts to rein in their influence have generally not been successful.118 Jirga decisions may be prone to gender bias \u2013 few women participate in them as they are often run exclusively by older men. According to a sample survey in 2007 conducted by the Afghan Centre for Socio-economic and Opinion Research, women comprised only two per cent of representatives on local jirgas. Elderly men constituted 65 per cent of the membership. Other members included mullahs, local leaders and commanders.119 BOX 7. Two Cases of Local Dispute Resolution: Pakistan and Bangladesh The Musalihat Anjuman system in Pakistan is a state sanctioned Alternative Dispute Mechanism. It was constituted under the 2001 Local Government Ordinance. It resolves conflicts through arbitration and mediation. This justice mechanism system encourages parties to identify issues, explore areas of compromise and generate options to resolve the dispute amicably. Bangladesh\u2019s shalishi mediation councils are a type of traditional alternative dispute resolution system that is often used at the local level.

There is no single strategy that can work in isolation \u2013 the exclusions are numerous and fed by multiple sources as seen above. Principles particularly important for gender equality and have been articulated at the level of constitutions are: equality before the law, non- discrimination, and state obligation towards eliminating it.120 While this may seem to beg the question of what is equality, it needs to be interpreted in line with the third approach to equality \u2013 the corrective approach \u2013 consistent with CEDAW. Not only more direct forms of inequality in law, but also all legal exclusions that curtail rights and opportunities on the basis of gender must be systematically identified and eliminated. Indirect discrimination which flows from assumptions that men and women already have equal opportunities, when in fact they do not, is no less important that the more explicit kind. Towards this end, three strategic avenues for simultaneous action are proposed: fixing institutions \u2013 laws, legal practices and modes of access; changing attitudes of those who create, uphold, and use laws; and establishing ongoing assessments to reveal inequalities, encourage and monitor progress.121 All countries of Asia-Pacific have in fact made commitments to establish gender-equal societies. There are specific national machineries and plans for this (Annex: Table 4). This can provide opportunities to address institutional gaps, change attitudes and put in place ongoing assessments. 6.1 Fix institutions Legal reforms towards gender equality must address the substance and the construction of laws. This includes legislation, constitutions, formal law, common law, customary law, legal practices, rules and procedures. Reforms should also address systems of judicial practices and institutions designed to uphold laws, taking into account the surrounding cultural norms that shape. The structures that implement the law are no less important \u2013 courts, court administration and law enforcement agencies. So also are cultural norms that influence justice \u2013 social and economic conditions, attitudes of law enforcement agencies, judges, magistrates, court officials, police and the community. A gender-based audit can greatly assist this process. What are the possible entry points to fix institutions? Enshrine constitutional provisions on gender equality. The principles of substantive gender equality, non- discrimination and state obligations should be well defined and enshrined at the level of constitutions. Any form of discrimination can then be challenged in courts on the basis of these constitutional provisions. Change discriminatory laws. Legal provisions that curtail freedoms or choices of people needs to be reviewed and changed. Formal and customary laws and practices should be covered. Those causing direct harm should be prioritised \u2013 discriminatory penal code provisions, unequal nationality laws, unwarranted requirements of proof, and protectionist labour laws. Fill legal gaps. In view of absent or inadequate legislation against domestic violence, sexual harassment at workplaces and insufficient maternity leave provisions, countries need to identify gaps and pass suitable laws. Promulgate tougher laws. Tougher laws with stiffer penalties are required to combat pervasive violence against women. Legal provisions that insist upon mediation 6. Redressing Gender Barriers: Enforcing Rights And Correcting Wrongs 29 6. Redressing Gender Barriers: Enforcing Rights And Correcting Wrongs rather than prosecution of offenders, stipulate forgiveness clauses, or omit certain perpetrators should be repealed. Review harmful customary practices. Use constitutional means with primacy to formal laws where possible to address harmful customs. Specific laws can also be made to eliminate practices that curtail women\u2019s freedoms and opportunities in the region. Uphold equality within personal laws. Go beyond the public sphere to review gender-inequitable personal laws that influence rights and duties of women in domestic sphere. Narrowly defined gender roles within marriage, limited maintenance rights, unequal access to marital property and unjust inheritance practices need to be prioritised. Strengthen enforcement mechanisms. Ensure dedicated personnel capacity where possible, including a larger share of female personnel, and organize obligatory gender training for all law enforcement agents \u2013 judges, lawyers, magistrates, mediators dispensing justice at community levels, and police officials. This requires adequate human and financial resources. Do not take the ability for gender- analysis for granted.

New ways of thinking that give legitimacy and acceptance to the equal value and dignity of all human beings needs to be promoted. Well-designed advocacy and social mobilization campaigns can raise public awareness and get people to recognize the value of thinking in new ways. Entry points that can be leveraged are inside judicial systems, across the political spectrum, and in society. Inside the judicial systems. Pre-service legal education with required gender sensitization can be supplemented by in-service gender-training of law enforcement officers \u2013 police, judges and others. Focus on legal inequalities that disadvantage women, a better understanding of legal neutrality and equality, and the potential for a strongly positive role of judicial interpretation can make a difference. Across the political spectrum. The legislature has a role through drafting and passage of laws. Political leaders make police, magisterial and judicial appointments and also allocate budgets to courts, prisons, police and legal aid initiatives to assist the poor. Being responsive to voter from constituencies can also pay political dividends. These can be useful entry points. In society. Social mobilization has been used to serve several aims. It can be used to create and reinforce ideas of equality and to persuade people of ways it can enrich quality of lives. Educate people through campaigns on legal facts and provide guidance on better using legal institutions. Places where social norms are consolidated and transmitted such as schools, the media, religious organizations and community groups make key entry points. 6.3 Establish ongoing assessments Ongoing reviews of laws and institutions of justice should be put in place to ensure systematic assessments aimed at revealing inequalities as well as other limitations. These assessments can feed into efforts to close gender disparities. International legal instruments on gender equality and national legal reforms are useful assessment tools. International legal instruments. International instruments such as CEDAW, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the ILO\u2019s Migrant Workers Convention, and the UN MDGs are useful global norms on gender equality. Countries can and have used CEDAW to reform their civil and criminal laws. The effectiveness of legislative and judicial reforms at the national level can benefit from international standards. National reforms. Not just legislative change, but progressive judicial precedents too can be useful correctives in support of historically disadvantaged groups. Judicial precedents can take much less time\u2013one has only to convince the judge, as against the much longer and less certain process of legislative change. 30 Enforcing Rights and Correcting Wrongs 6.4 Addressing gender as a barrier Law is devised by human beings and cannot claim perfection; equally, human beings can change it.

On the ground in 177 countries and territories, we o\ufb00 er global perspective and local insight to help empower lives and build resilient nations. Exclusion on the basis of gender has continued to persist not just in fact, but also in law. The aim of this paper is to uncover patent and latent barriers to gender equality in the justice systems of Asia-Pacifi c. Based on background research done for the Asia-Pacifi c HDR on Gender, Power, Voice and Rights, this paper looks at possible ways to redress legal discrimination for accelerating human development. The paper testifi es that Asia-Pacifi c has some extreme forms of discrimination and violence despite being one of the world\u2019s most \u2018inclusive\u2019 and economically dynamic regions. Legal Barriers operate, both in the content of laws and legal practices; and, in restricted access to justice systems. The substantive content of laws itself can be a source of discrimination \u2013 laws may be discriminatory, have gaps or be contradictory. The less explicit subtler inequalities can also contribute to exclusion. Women\u2019s access to formal and customary justice systems remains restricted and inadequate enforcement mechanisms continue to be of serious concern. Specifi c barriers, rooted in gender, prevent women from getting to courts or fi nding fair judgments once there. What are some of the important remedial measures for enforcing rights and correcting wrongs? The paper explores three strategic avenues: One, fi xing institutions \u2013 laws, legal practices and modes of access; two, changing attitudes of those who create, uphold, and use laws; and three establishing ongoing assessments to reveal inequalities and monitor progress.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bc035a9-adde-4d7b-9ed5-a0aee7175f61": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bc035a9-adde-4d7b-9ed5-a0aee7175f61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68b1cb600f55b1f8b7efbf37b42d66cb27b1b424530f5d079e3c8d51b6b713a4"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f98ce90-b5dc-45c3-9f79-8c4c3027df2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77bb8aab29a3e74e72ec5a5d3ae58e487cafe71cf65a3ae3e7417e90ce492c57"}}, "hash": "5f6f3d165773aacb46a5c500542eeb38ac82f16b345de1ffa917da34fea07eb5", "text": "The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) promotes regional cooperation for inclusive and sustainable economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific, a dynamic region characterized by growing wealth, diversity and change, but also challenged with persistent poverty, environmental degradation, inequality and insecurity. ESCAP supports member States with sound strategic analysis, policy options and technical cooperation activities to address key development challenges and to implement innovative solutions for region-wide economic prosperity, social progress and environmental sustainability. ESCAP, through its conference structure, assists member States in forging a stronger, coordinated regional voice on global issues by building capacities to dialogue, negotiate and shape development agenda in an age of globalization, decentralization and problems that transcend borders. A key modality for this strategy is the promotion of intraregional connectivity and regional integration. ADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 947 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance. UNDP is the UN\u2019s global development network, an organization advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life. UNDP is on the ground in 166 counties, working with them on their own solutions to global and national development challenges. UNDP\u2019s network links and coordinates global and national efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, including the overarching goal of cutting poverty in half by 2015.

Back in 2000 the year 2015, which is the target date for the Millennium Development Goals, seemed some way off. Now two thirds of the way towards the finishing line, it is beginning to look uncomfortably close. The year 2010 is therefore an appropriate point to take stock \u2013 to assess some of the likely outcomes on present trends, identify some of the weakest areas of performance, and identify priorities for action. Since 2004, an ESCAP/ADB/UNDP partnership has regularly produced reports carefully tracking progress of the Asia and Pacific region towards the Goals. They have developed a consistent monitoring system for judging whether countries and subregions are on-track or off-track to meet the indicators for the 2015 Goals \u2013 presenting the results in a series of distinctive colour-coded \u2018traffic-light\u2019 charts. Each of the reports has focused on a particular theme, such as MDG consistent national development policies or institutional reforms to make the development process fairer and more inclusive, or the impact of the food, fuel and financial crises on the likely achievement of the goals. This 2010/11 report takes a slightly different approach. As before, it refreshes the signals to reflect the latest information from the United Nations MDG database to assess which countries and subregions are likely to miss or achieve the Goals. But rather than addressing a new theme, this more concise report attempts to encapsulate and update the discussions and recommendations of the earlier reports. While this has the merit of brevity, it also of course has the disadvantage of excluding some detailed discussion. Readers who wish to consider the issues more closely are encouraged to consult some of the previous Asia-Pacific MDG reports. The report Paths to 2015 emphasises the inter-relationships between MDGs by identifying some overall priorities and opportunities that countries can consider for achieving all the goals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97ab15e3-e019-430b-924d-85604d62a653": {"__data__": {"id_": "97ab15e3-e019-430b-924d-85604d62a653", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acce1dba68a363ab7ef739ebf3858df06c928b11ae14c1dcb2d6e787ffe0a883"}, "2": {"node_id": "23d6a84e-c0ec-407c-aed2-c4a5cf12c663", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02a5f016f04102ea3640a472c085cb9812d5ee0ef5890a6455b52500dcff76bb"}}, "hash": "060c7ec44e39a7adb43c0ccdb9599abb8159d2bd8e9b94b5edefe9e40e06b2fb", "text": "Then it focuses specifically on three areas: hunger and food security; health and basic services \u2013 areas where the Asia-Pacific region as a whole appears to be falling short; and on improvement of basic infrastructure which is often neglected but is critical", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0509479d-5e62-45d5-82af-3ba658576a17": {"__data__": {"id_": "0509479d-5e62-45d5-82af-3ba658576a17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09d8b4078d940a2b7d99d39ea9faa95898ad6e75597466b6eeaf3a2c14830469"}, "3": {"node_id": "d6eb5e2a-d96a-4798-b2da-f31daf391337", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d965a6df7428007a2fa071abaa51a574f11f98af1399575bafed9a2c9e69c4d8"}}, "hash": "b542c1f2d6fd6838f38257808ef8b4cfd8f718d478e43d76fc990b614ad10a2e", "text": "if the region is to achieve the MDGs.

This report is being produced to coincide with the United Nations High-level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs in September 2010 in New York. The Asia-Pacific region is home to more than 60 per cent of humanity, so what happens in the region will have a critical bearing on global MDG achievement. Asia and the Pacific has much to be proud of, but needs to redouble efforts to reduce poverty and vulnerability affecting hundreds of millions of people living in the region.

Between 1990 and 2008, the countries of the region reduced the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day from 1.5 billion to 947 million, and the region is on track for the poverty goal. Moreover, for some other indicators the Asia-Pacific region as a whole has already achieved the targets \u2013 for reducing gender disparities in primary, secondary and tertiary education enrolment, for example, for preventing a rise in HIV prevalence, for stopping the spread of tuberculosis, for reducing consumption of ozone-depleting substances, and for halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water. On the other hand, the region is still lagging in some major areas. It has been slow in reducing the extent of hunger, in ensuring that girls and boys reach the last grade of primary education, in reducing child mortality, in improving maternal health provision and in providing basic sanitation. Seven drivers for achieving the MDGs Each country focusing on the MDGs has to address its own specific needs and opportunities. And each of the social sectors relevant for the MDGs, such as health and education, also has its own specific issues. But across the region and across sectors there are a number of common concerns and priorities. This report singles out seven overall opportunities to strengthen the environment for achieving the MDGs. Strengthening growth by stimulating domestic demand and intra-regional trade \u2013 Given the importance of economic growth in MDG achievement, countries affected by the crisis need to recover quickly and expand their economies. But in an era when western markets are likely to import fewer goods, countries in the region will also need to rebalance their growth, basing it more on domestic consumption and greater levels of intra-regional trade. Such change would also present an opportunity for accelerating MDG progress which depend on greater spending on social services and basic infrastructure. Making economic growth more inclusive and sustainable \u2013 Economic growth also needs to be inclusive \u2013 derived more from economic activities such as agriculture that benefit the poor, and especially women. The fruits of growth also need to be better allocated so as to contribute to achieving the MDG targets. Governments will want to set their sights on \u2018green growth\u2019 that can decouple economic development from environmental pressures. Strengthening social protection \u2013 Countries will be better placed to achieve the MDGs if they offer a minimum social floor that addresses extreme poverty and hunger and income insecurity. A comprehensive social protection programme will help minimize the risks and vulnerability from economic crises and natural calamities. It will also act as a \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 for vicious inter-generational cycles of poverty and hunger as well as reducing widening disparities between the rich and poor. This should involve a targeted and gender-responsive outreach to the informal sector. Reducing persistent gender gaps \u2013 Greater investments in women and girls have multiplier effects across all the Goals. Collection and analysis of gender-specific data should be followed by the legislative and other changes needed to ensure that women have greater Paths to 2015 The Asia-Pacific region has made striking progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Nevertheless, on present trends many countries are likely to miss a number of the targets. This report focuses on opportunities for making more rapid progress \u2013 identifying some of the most promising paths to 2015. 2 PATHS TO 2015 OVERVIEW: Paths to 2015 control and ownership over assets, have equitable access to employment and all public services, and are fully represented in public and political life. Ensuring financial inclusion \u2013 Most of the billion or so poor people in Asia and the Pacific have little access to financial services. Nowadays there are many more opportunities for achieving greater financial inclusion for them. Governments can play their part by improving infrastructure and the regulatory environment while encouraging better service provision by NGOs, community-based groups and the private sector. Supporting least developed and structurally disadvantaged countries \u2013 While most of the resources for achieving the MDGs must come from within the countries, many of the poorest countries will continue to rely on overseas development assistance and South- South cooperation. Exploiting the potential of regional economic integration \u2013 Regional economic integration can make the region more resilient to further crises and bolster the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "113e697e-ffb0-4b79-8958-4b5c1f55c790": {"__data__": {"id_": "113e697e-ffb0-4b79-8958-4b5c1f55c790", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fa43630f964e4374a3d0b0edac2a3f88364390259dc4a0a14a520f4068c3359"}}, "hash": "0fa43630f964e4374a3d0b0edac2a3f88364390259dc4a0a14a520f4068c3359", "text": "capacity of the poorest countries to achieve the MDGs. Agreements on economic integration, for example, could enable smaller countries in particular to extend their markets and reap efficiency gains. Opportunities for fruitful cooperation exist in finance and other areas. The report also looks more closely at some of the key issues for goals on which the region is falling short: reducing hunger and building food security, improving basic services, and strengthening basic infrastructure. The report highlights the opportunities for building food security, stronger basic services and improved basic infrastructures. Reducing hunger and building food security Despite rapid economic growth and falling levels of poverty, Asia and the Pacific still has widespread hunger and malnutrition. About one person in six suffers from malnourishment and one child in three is underweight. To ensure that poor people have access to the food they need to lead healthy and productive lives, experience across the region suggests five overall policy priorities. Creating jobs and increasing incomes \u2013 The main response should be to ensure that people have the decent jobs and incomes that will enable them to buy the food they need. Despite higher economic growth, employment growth has slowed considerably. Governments will want to ensure that growth is more employment intensive while expanding employment programmes for the poor and vulnerable. Boosting agricultural production \u2013 Over the years there has been a decline in national public investment in \u2013 and international support for \u2013 agriculture. Consequently there has been a deceleration in the growth of agricultural output and productivity. Asian governments and the international community now need therefore to redirect their attention to agriculture which has vast unexploited potential for growth. Maintaining stable and reasonable food prices \u2013 Food prices should be within range of poor consumers, but it is also important to have prices that offer sufficient incentives to farmers. At the same time governments may need to address imbalances in food markets that give greater power to buyers and retailers than to food producers and consumers. Providing safety nets for the poor \u2013 Governments should ensure food security for the poor who are unable to earn their livelihoods, through subsidies, public food distribution systems, or food-for-work programmes. Implementing feeding programmes \u2013 These can include school feeding programmes, for example, or programmes for pregnant women, babies, pre-school children, or the elderly, sick or infirm. Improving health and other basic services If the least developed countries are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals they will need to offer reliable basic services, especially for health and education. Most governments have been determined to improve provision of services but still fall short in terms of coverage and quality, particularly in rural areas. Investing more in basic services \u2013 Governments have been allocating more resources to education though as a proportion of GDP but this is still lower than the global average. Expenditure on health, however, has stagnated. While many governments may be concerned about deficits they probably have more fiscal policy space than they realize to invest in better services. Improving governance \u2013 Governments will be concerned to ensure higher quality of services. At present the quality of services is undermined by a number of issues related to governance. These indicate the need for effective decentralization, achieving greater policy coherence, reducing corruption, strengthening regulations, generating better data, increasing 3 MDG PRIORITIES In ASIA AnD THE PACIFIC OVERVIEW: Paths to 2015 accountability and stakeholder participation. Ensuring social inclusion and equal access to social services \u2013 In principle services are available to all, but in practice certain groups tend to be excluded on gender or many other characteristics \u2013 for example, caste, creed, ethnicity, sexual identity, socio-economic standing, disability, age, HIV status, or geographical location. Exclusion must therefore need to be tackled on a broad front, including through greater community mobilisation, and in some cases, affirmative action or decriminalization where certain laws could obstruct the delivery of health services. Diversifying the range of service providers \u2013 In the past the principal providers have been governments \u2013 particularly for health, education, water and sanitation. More services are now being provided by community organizations and the private sector, but governments still need to ensure access for the poor. Priorities in health While governments need to strengthen provision across the whole range of public services, many will need to pay special attention to the health goals \u2013 where progress has been particularly slow. Maternal health needs special attention as an unacceptable number of women perish from preventable and treatable complications related to pregnancy. Despite the stabilizing of HIV prevalence in the region, access to prevention and treatment services still falls", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73a6a6c5-dc74-4e82-b762-22d2714ceaaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "73a6a6c5-dc74-4e82-b762-22d2714ceaaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82a39b9580f22dff9915032c2e4cf35a95be707ea9e3975b5e3138f07620cd0a"}}, "hash": "82a39b9580f22dff9915032c2e4cf35a95be707ea9e3975b5e3138f07620cd0a", "text": "well below universal targets. This will require increasing public health expenditure, while seeking new health insurance models and increasing the number of primary health care workers. In addition, health service delivery can be improved by involving community groups of key affected populations. Strengthening basic infrastructure The MDG framework has few specific goals, targets or indicators for infrastructure \u2013 thus the focus has been on development outcomes while less attention has been paid to some of the basic conditions for achieving them. Asia and the Pacific region needs stronger basic infrastructure, particularly road transport, water supplies, sanitation, electricity, information technology, telecommunications and urban low-income housing. Among the priorities for improving infrastructure are: Mobilizing finance \u2013 For the period 2010-2020 the required infrastructure investment would be $7.7 trillion or about $700 billion per annum. For this purpose, some countries may be able to access capital markets and tap into regional savings, though poorer countries will have to rely more on multilateral development institutions. Stimulating the private investment \u2013 Over the past two decades, more than 70 per cent of Asia\u2019s investment in infrastructure has been made by the public sector. Now more spending will need to come from private sources. Governments could, for example, offer fiscal incentives while multilateral development institutions can help guide negotiations for public-private partnerships. Raising standards of quality and maintenance \u2013 Except for railways, Asia also lags in the quality of infrastructure, much of which suffers from a lack of commitment to repairs and maintenance. And in a region prone to disasters another important factor is the planning and implementation of measures for risk reduction. Many of the problems are related to governance, including corruption. Governments can increase transparency by using competitive bidding rules, for example, and automated e-billing systems. They will also need to improve qualification and certification in the construction industry and enforce regulations more strictly. But one of the best ways of improving quality and accountability is to actively involve local communities, and particularly women, who can not only contribute inputs but also feel greater ownership and be committed to maintenance. Building greener infrastructure \u2013 More attention must be given to infrastructure that maximizes equitable socio-economic benefits, while minimizing environmental impacts and the use of resources. For example, well planned and integrated public transport systems reduce costs for the urban poor while putting cities on trajectories of green growth. Extending regional infrastructure \u2013 There is a clear gain to public welfare from regional infrastructure that helps enlarge markets, reduces the costs of trade and uses regional resources more efficiently. One estimate suggests that completing regional connectivity in energy, transport and telecommunications would boost Asia\u2019s net income by $13 trillion over the period 2010- 20 and beyond. Tilting the balance As the MDG target date 2015 approaches, it seems likely that the picture across Asia and the Pacific will be mixed \u2013 with some disappointing failures, some narrow misses, and some striking successes. But the final MDG story is yet to be told. All countries still have five years to choose the most promising paths \u2013 and tilt the balance decisively on the side of success. 4 PATHS TO 2015 CHAPTER I O ne of the greatest MDG successes in Asia and the Pacific has been with poverty reduction. Between 1990 and 2008, countries in Asia and the Pacific reduced the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day from 1.5 billion to 947 million \u2013 all the more impressive given that over the same period the region\u2019s population increased by some 800 million. As a result the region as a whole is on track to achieve the target of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty. Moreover, for some other indicators Asia and the Pacific has already achieved the targets \u2013 for reducing gender disparities in primary, secondary and tertiary education, for example, for beginning to reduce HIV prevalence, for stopping the spread of tuberculosis, for reducing consumption of ozone-depleting substances, and for halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water. On the other hand, Asia and the Pacific region is still lagging in some major areas. It has been slow, for example, in reducing the extent of hunger, in ensuring that girls and boys reach the last grade of primary education, in reducing child mortality, in improving maternal health, in providing basic sanitation. Table I-1 summarizes for 21 indicators the overall status based on the most recent internationally comparable data set, which covers the period up to 2008.

The region\u2019s 14 least developed countries, for example, have made slow or no progress on most indicators \u2013 performing well only on gender equality in primary and secondary education, and stopping the spread of HIV and TB. It is a major concern that in most subregions progress is slow for reducing child mortality and improving provision for maternal health. There are similar differences between subregions. The greatest progress has been in South-East Asia which has already achieved nine of the 21 assessed indicators and is on track for another three. The North and Central- Asian countries as a group have already achieved eight of the indicators. The same group of countries, excluding the Russian Federation, have achieved ten of the indicators \u2013 though they are progressing slowly on another three and making no progress on a further six, including those related to poverty, HIV and TB. The Asia-Pacific region includes the world\u2019s two most MDGs in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 where we stand The Asia-Pacific region has made impressive gains in many MDG indicators, especially in reducing poverty. But it is lagging on some important targets, particularly on reducing hunger and in achieving higher standards of health. To reach the goals, from now to 2015, countries in Asia and the Pacific will need to step up their efforts and focus on some key priorities. 5 MDG PRIORITIES In ASIA AnD THE PACIFIC CHAPTER I: MDGs in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 where we stand Table I-1\u2013 Country groups on-track and off-track for the MDGs Source: Staff calculations based on the United Nations MDG Database populous countries \u2013 China and India \u2013 so the region\u2019s overall achievement on poverty, as on other indicators, will be swayed by their performance. To illustrate this, Table I-1 also shows the performance of different country groupings that exclude Asia\u2019s two giants. Thus \u2018Asia and the Pacific excluding China and India\u2019 on some indicators has performed worse than the region as a whole: it has progressed only slowly in reducing the number of people living with less than $1.25 per day, and regressed on HIV prevalence. Starting from a low base on many MDG indicators, South Asia has made good progress on seven indicators but is progressing only slowly on many others. Given the weight of India in subregional aggregates, it is also useful to consider \u2018South Asia without India\u2019. This grouping is on track for poverty, but progressing slowly on the provision of clean water supplies, and regressing in HIV prevalence and forest cover. As a group, the Pacific Island countries have been successful in indicators related to tuberculosis, protected areas and the consumption of ozone-depleting substances. But they have been regressing or making no progress in eight indicators and advancing only slowly in another five, those for infant and under-five mortality and providing access to antenatal care. Papua New Guinea is home to almost 70 per cent of the Pacific Island countries\u2019 population, so estimates for the subregion are inevitably affected by this country\u2019s performance. Table I-1 therefore presents estimates for the Pacific Island countries excluding Papua New Guinea. This subgroup shows better progress on gender equality in education and is also moving forward, albeit slowly, on expanding access to improved sanitation facilities and safe drinking water. However, it should be noted that the accuracy of Pacific Island aggregates for many indicators is hampered by a shortage of data. Disparities in progress between groups of countries in the region are mirrored at the country level (Table I-2). For example, whereas South-East Asia as a whole is on track \u2013 or has achieved the target \u2013 for 12 of the 21 indicators considered in this report, Cambodia manages this for only ten indicators, and Lao PDR for only nine \u2013 a result of insufficient progress in child malnutrition and primary completion, for example. At the other end of the spectrum, while South Asia as a whole is on track for, or has achieved only nine indicators, Sri Lanka is on track, or has achieved, the targets, for 14 of the 19 indicators for which it has data.

Countries measuring MDG progress using different data sources, or using different indicators, may arrive at different conclusions. Take the goal of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger for example. The assessment of progress in this report uses the internationally determined income poverty line ($1.25 a day), while many national assessments tend to be based on nationally determined poverty lines. Thus, countries such as Lao PDR, Nepal and Turkey, which are shown in the report as slow or regressing on the goal of poverty reduction, would be on track on the basis of data estimated from nationally determined poverty lines. Similarly, countries such as Mongolia and Pakistan are shown here as early achiever on income poverty, although they would be on slow or regressing on the basis of their national poverty lines data. Moreover, even in countries where significant progress has been made towards the MDGs, there are often disparities within the country \u2013 between urban and rural areas, between rich and poor, between women and men, and girls and boys. Although many countries do not regularly report sex-disaggregated data that would help track the gender dimensions of MDG targets and indicators, the available data on outcome indicators of poverty, such as education, nutrition, health and child mortality, and evidence from case studies suggest gender disparities (Figure I-1). Close to 100 million women in Asia are estimated to be \u2018missing\u2019 because of discriminatory treatment in access to health and nutrition or through pure neglect \u2013 or because they were not allowed to be born in the first place.1 The scale of deprivation Compared with other developing regions Asia and the Pacific is generally ahead of Africa, but behind Latin America and the Caribbean (Statistical appendix, Figure A-1). But because of its larger population size, on most indicators, the Asia-Pacific region has the greatest numbers of people affected. In the case of sanitation, for example, the region has more than 70 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people who are affected \u2013 which in 2008 amounted to almost 1.9 billion. This is illustrated in Figure I-2 for this and other selected indicators. Indeed even on indicators for which Asia and the Pacific has made significant progress, it still has a large number of people who live in deprivation. When it comes to providing people with access to clean water, for example, the region is an early achiever yet still has 469 million people deprived.

This was prior to the global economic slowdown which started in 2008 so the data do not yet register the effect of the crisis. In the Asia-Pacific, for example, the economic, food and fuel crises are being felt through lower economic growth, lower government revenues, higher debt burdens, a decline in the value of offshore investments, increases in the cost of living, job losses and reduced remittances,2 preventing some 21 million people from escaping poverty. While there are insufficient current data, it nevertheless is possible to make a rough estimate of the effects, based on the impact of the crisis on economic growth \u2013 which is now becoming clearer. The historical relationship between economic growth and changes in MDG indicators can be used to project the likely effects in future. The methodology for this is summarized in the Statistical appendix.

All of these estimates assume that historical trends roughly continue. But history is not destiny. All countries in the region still have the opportunity to accelerate progress to 2015 and achieve many more of the goals. As a guide to how they might do so, the following chapters highlight some of the paths they can take.

And each of the social sectors relevant for the MDGs, such as health and education, also has its own specific issues. But across the region there are a number of common issues and priorities. Subsequent chapters will look more closely at some of the key issues for goals on which the region is falling short: reducing hunger and building food security, improving basic services, and strengthening basic infrastructure. All countries in the region accept their responsibilities as developmental states for achieving the MDGs. This chapter presents seven opportunities for strengthening the overall environment in which they can do so. It should be noted that this and subsequent chapters of the report draw heavily on the preceding regional MDG reports \u2013 which can be consulted for the analytical and empirical details that underpin the sections that follow.1 Strengthening growth by stimulating domestic demand and intra-regional trade Achieving all the MDGs will depend on accelerating growth and making a strong recovery from the economic crisis. Many countries will be aiming to do this by rebalancing their economies so as to be more resilient, based less on exports and more on boosting domestic demand and greater consumption of Asia- Pacific goods and services.2 For the MDGs this policy change presents a major opportunity since many of the policies that will help achieve the MDGs will also boost local demand. These include increasing spending on basic social services and social protection and basic infrastructure, and boosting the income of the poor, who, compared with wealthier households, are more likely to spend extra income than save it. While increasing domestic demand, it will also be important to boost South-South and intra-regional trade and investment flows with more inclusive patterns of regional integration that benefit the LDCs. Since 1986, intra-regional exports have risen from 23 to 41 per cent of developing Asia exports, but much of this is in the form of production networking in a limited number of parts and components with the final goods being destined for western markets. In fact only around one-fifth of exports go to East and South-East Asia; the remaining four-fifths go to the rest of the world \u2013 nearly 60 per cent of which are headed for the EU, the US and Japan. So the slump in imports in these major markets, which is likely to continue for some time, will definitely affect the region. In future, a more diversified pattern of trade would have to be built up including on goods which have a ready market in the region and which are also more likely to be consumed by the poor, such as processed food. Greater intra-regional trade would require integrated markets, lower tariff and non-tariff barriers, concerted investment in physical infrastructure, more robust transportation networks", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83272b05-fa4b-437a-9d1a-a6bcbae2b884": {"__data__": {"id_": "83272b05-fa4b-437a-9d1a-a6bcbae2b884", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7dd35a3b71e1897d1db83811d19f0242019511dc38168c2cd98f899f96e88c49"}}, "hash": "7dd35a3b71e1897d1db83811d19f0242019511dc38168c2cd98f899f96e88c49", "text": "and information platforms, and better regulatory structures. Regional growth would also benefit from a balanced and development- friendly outcome of the Doha Round that corrected existing asymmetries in global trade and enhanced market access. LDC products should have duty- and quota-free market access on a lasting basis. Seven drivers for achieving the MDGs Achieving the MDG would make a real difference to the lives of millions of people across Asia and the Pacific. This chapter indicates opportunities for strengthening the overall environment in which the Goals can be achieved \u2013 enabling them to accelerate progress towards 2015. 10 PATHS TO 2015 CHAPTER II: Seven drivers for achieving the MDGs Making economic growth more inclusive and sustainable Economic growth not only needs to be derived more from the region\u2019s own consumption, it also has to be more inclusive \u2013 with the fruits shared more equally among different social and economic groups. This too would require a deliberate change in course \u2013 both in the growth pattern and in government policies. In the absence of countervailing policies, across the region the national income share of the top 20 per cent of the population has steadily increased while that of the bottom 20 per cent has decreased. Similarly, for most countries in Asia and the Pacific, the \u2018Gini indices\u2019, which are the standard measures of inequality, are not only high but have been increasing.3 If inequality could be reduced, or at least held constant, then the MDGs could be achieved more rapidly.4 The key here is to derive more of the growth from economic activities that benefit the poor - especially women. This will require, for example, greater focus on agriculture which provides primary income to over 50 per cent of Asia\u2019s population.5 It will also mean promoting productive employment in the informal sector \u2013 by ensuring that small enterprises have the support and credit they need to expand and provide decent work. Enabling greater female labour force participation and better access to economic assets has shown great benefit, especially in South Asia.6 It is also necessary that Governments act decisively to ensure that growth offers greater opportunities for the poor and deprived. This involves greater employment generation and more resources devoted to investments in education, health and other basic services. Governments must make more efforts to raise resources and reorient prioritize budgets towards the MDGs.7 It is also vital that growth be more sustainable. Even inclusive growth will eventually grind to a halt if it unduly stresses the region\u2019s natural resources. Already, unsustainable agricultural and industrial production have been liquidating the natural resource base, degrading land and water quality, reducing biodiversity, and destroying vital natural ecosystems. At the same time, the region\u2019s cities are coming under ever greater strain as a result of rural-urban migration: Asia and the Pacific already has fifteen of the world\u2019s largest cities and over the next ten years the region\u2019s urban population will grow by a further 1.1 billion.8 A shortage of available land in many small island developing states, in particular, is leading to greater density in urban areas that lack adequate infrastructure. Added to this is the potential adverse impact of climate change on human health, on food security, on coastal infrastructure, and on the livelihoods of communities that depend on natural resources. In response, governments across Asia and the Pacific will need to progressively set their sights on a more environmentally sustainable development that can decouple economic growth from environmental pressures \u2013 for example, by enhancing the efficiency of natural resource use, reducing energy intensity, preserving biodiversity, cutting the generation of waste and adapting to the effects of climate change. This need not, however, necessarily mean slower growth or fewer jobs, since integrating clean energy and climate- resilient policies into development planning and fiscal policies will also drive the economies forward and create quality jobs. In this regard, it will be important that governments also develop sound green jobs policies as part of the shift towards a low-carbon, environmentally friendly, climate-resilient economy. Many governments have already set out on this path. Thus, while mitigating the impact of the global economic crisis, some have incorporated environment-related elements into their stimulus packages. The Republic of Korea\u2019s \u2018green new deal\u2019 package, for example, allocates over $38 billion for green projects that will create close to one million green jobs over a four year period, and China has focused 20 to 30 per cent of its package on low- carbon production. China has also earmarked $440 billion to support wind and solar energy.9 Strengthening social protection Countries will be in a better position to achieve the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f2f3d9f-02e7-4c2a-88d2-0caf47741e18": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f2f3d9f-02e7-4c2a-88d2-0caf47741e18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31138889e9f377f4360fdac2eb7ef8957408b2eccf564fcd1bc8f7a4818cc049"}}, "hash": "31138889e9f377f4360fdac2eb7ef8957408b2eccf564fcd1bc8f7a4818cc049", "text": "MDGs if they can offer a minimum social floor that addresses extreme poverty and hunger and income insecurity. A comprehensive social protection programme will minimize the impact of economic crises and natural calamities as well as consolidating development gains, while also acting as a \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 for vicious inter-generational cycles of poverty and hunger. At present, across most of Asia and the Pacific the coverage of social protection is low, typically confined to workers in government and the formal sector. This means that in most countries more than half of the workforce is left without protection, and in most countries this involves more women workers than men. According to ILO, in East Asia more than half the workforce is in unstable \u2018vulnerable employment\u2019 while in South-East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia, the proportion rises to 60 per cent or more. Only 30 per cent of Asia\u2019s elderly receive pensions. Only 20 per cent of the unemployed have access to 11 MDG PRIORITIES In ASIA AnD THE PACIFIC CHAPTER II: Seven drivers for achieving the MDGs unemployment benefits or labour market programmes. And households in Asia have the world\u2019s highest rates of out-of-pocket health care expenditure. In these circumstances households try to protect themselves by building up savings.10 Particular attention also needs to be paid to households impacted by HIV which are among the most vulnerable to external shocks. To some extent social protection could be extended in the short term by improving the management and delivery of existing programmes and ensuring better targeting. But many countries will need new services. Across the region there are good examples of what can be achieved, from Thailand\u2019s universal health care scheme to conditional cash transfer schemes in Cambodia and Indonesia, to well developed school feeding programmes in India and Bangladesh.11 Reducing persistent gender gaps Gender inequality is neither just and sustainable, nor morally defensible. Investing in women and girls is in itself a breakthrough strategy for achieving the MDGs and almost any investment made in women and girls will have multiplier effects across all the Goals.12 Countries across Asia and the Pacific will therefore need to act on multiple fronts to ensure that women can exercise their rights and realize their full potential. This should be based on better data on critical areas such as violence against women, on how gender norms affect men and women, and on the different status of men and women in households. Analysis of these data should be accompanied by close monitoring, along with the changes in policy and legislation \u2013 as well as in attitudes, perceptions and behaviour \u2013 needed to ensure that women have greater control and ownership over assets and resources, have equitable access to employment, and have access to, and benefit from, all public services. Although the region has progressed on some gender indicators, it - particularly South Asia, still has many disparities \u2013 in life expectancy, educational attainment and labour force participation \u2013 which are being passed relentlessly from one generation to the next. In Bangladesh, for example, women earn only 50 per cent of what men earn for similar work, and in Mongolia only 80 per cent.13 Similar imbalances are evident in agriculture. In most regions of the world, women head 20 per cent of farms, but in Asia and the Pacific the proportion is only 7 per cent, even though agriculture accounts for over half of the region\u2019s female employment.14 Furthermore, the share of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector in South Asia and Western Asia is only around 20 per cent, the lowest rate among the world\u2019s regions. Women tend to be predominant in many of the informal and insecure jobs. Girls too have historically been less likely than boys to be sent to school \u2013 in some cases because parents consider them a less worthwhile investment. And while educational disparities have been falling at the primary level, they persist in a number of countries at the secondary level. Parents may also be reluctant to send girls to school if they are worried about their security. And in households affected by the economic impact of HIV, girls are more likely than boys to drop out of school \u2013 as shown by studies from China, Cambodia and Indonesia.15 Women\u2019s persistent lack of power is also reflected in low representation in national legislatures. In Asia women occupy only 18 per cent of legislative seats and in the Pacific only 15 per cent. Similarly, they generally have less influence over local policies and plans \u2013 on food security, for example, and on health and other basic services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36db5389-7b2b-4cbb-8544-b12caa44bc8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "36db5389-7b2b-4cbb-8544-b12caa44bc8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee5f51d0724e913a9dd4ae4516645d6e3342d8a7b789b400a981fdd3762cc556"}}, "hash": "ee5f51d0724e913a9dd4ae4516645d6e3342d8a7b789b400a981fdd3762cc556", "text": "Gender discrimination costs lives. Close to 100 million women in Asia are estimated to be \u2018missing\u2019 because of discriminatory treatment in access to health and nutrition, pure neglect, or pre-birth sex selection.16 The region\u2019s highest girl to boy under-five mortality ratios are found in China (1.41), India (1.10), Pakistan (1.08), Micronesia, Nepal, and Tonga (1.07). And in South Asia more women die in childbirth \u2013 500 for every 100,000 live births \u2013 than in any other part of the world except Sub-Saharan Africa. The proportion of deliveries attended by skilled staff is still as low as 18 per cent in Nepal, 20 per cent in Lao PDR, 39 per cent in Pakistan, and 46 per cent in India \u2013 compared with 97 per cent in Thailand.17 Many women are also subject to domestic violence, especially when societies are under stress.18 In some countries in the Pacific, for example, around two-thirds of women have been assaulted by male partners19 and the proportion can also be high in a number of countries in South and South-East Asia.20 Nearly half the countries in South Asia and more than 60 per cent of those in the Pacific do not have laws on domestic violence. Moreover, victims rarely report episodes since enforcement is often slow and ineffective. Gender-based violence is also associated with higher risks for HIV transmission and is a key driver of the epidemic in Papua New Guinea. In Asia, between 1990 and 2007 the female proportion of adults living with AIDS nearly doubled \u2013 to 29 per cent.21 12 PATHS TO 2015 CHAPTER II: Seven drivers for achieving the MDGs Ensuring financial inclusion Most of the billion or so poor people in Asia and the Pacific have little access to financial services. Instead they rely largely on cash or the informal economy, and for credit look to friends, family or moneylenders. Lacking insurance, they cannot protect their meagre assets and incomes against shocks such as illness, drought or theft. And without transactional banking services, their financing is insecure and expensive and they cannot participate fully in the economy either as consumers or potential entrepreneurs.22 Nowadays, however, there are many more opportunities for widening financial inclusion. Governments can play their part by improving infrastructure and the regulatory environment. But they can also encourage service provision by NGOs, community-based groups and the private sector. This should enable micro-insurance and micro-finance institutions, for example, to tailor their programmes better to the needs of the poor. Service providers can also take advantage of advances in information technology. They can, for example, extend mobile phone banking to enable customers in remote areas to send money, receive remittances and pay for purchases. They should also be able to use pre- paid smart cards to pay for such services as electricity. The Reserve Bank of Fiji, for example, recently announced that it will be working closely with two mobile phone companies to provide \u2018mobile money\u2019 for all. And India is issuing a unique biometric ID that poor families can use to open bank accounts and receive cash transfers. Offering financial services to the poor not only allow them to escape from poverty. It can also make good business sense. Companies that cater more effectively to poor consumers can be very profitable. In the Philippines, for example, a company, which provides prepaid phone services mainly to low-income consumers, has become the most profitable of the country\u2019s largest corporations.23 Supporting least developed and structurally disadvantaged countries Measures for faster MDG achievement should be financed as much as possible from domestic resources. However, poorer countries, particularly the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries, and the small island developing states, will need to be assisted through external resources such as official development assistance (ODA). ODA, whether bilateral and multilateral, has played a key role in supporting the economic development and social progress of many developing countries in the region and it continues to make a significant contribution to achieving the MDGs. With changing circumstances, the role of ODA is also changing and it should now primarily be used for supporting the development efforts of the least developed countries (LDCs), the landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and the small island developing States (SIDS) \u2013 which depend on external resources for financing a good part of their development process. In particular, ODA for these structurally handicapped countries should be used to build their economic and social infrastructure, especially for investing in basic services such as water, sanitation, energy, transport, shelter, health and education. ODA can also have a catalytic role \u2013 in helping these countries expand their productive capacities, promote FDI and trade,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "270e6e58-d54c-406f-b9d1-3e2bd93f778b": {"__data__": {"id_": "270e6e58-d54c-406f-b9d1-3e2bd93f778b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7ec4b01603c53da0beac90cbc5a1bd68c33982fa17f6baa5410fd470689e34c"}}, "hash": "e7ec4b01603c53da0beac90cbc5a1bd68c33982fa17f6baa5410fd470689e34c", "text": "adapt technological inventions and innovations, foster gender equality, ensure food security, and reduce income poverty. At the same time, it will be important to improve the quality of ODA and increase its development impact \u2013 by building on the fundamental principles of national ownership, harmonization, and managing for results. This includes especially aligning aid by sector with internationally agreed development goals and country priorities. Although Asia and the Pacific has around 60 per cent of the world\u2019s deprived people, the region finds it difficult to attract aid from the traditional donors, particularly for MDG sectors. Asia receives the lowest per capita assistance of all regions \u2013 $12 compared with $45 for Africa \u2013 which calls for better allocation of flows according to needs (Figure II-1). Therefore there is a need to re-focus ODA flows \u2013 both in terms of regional and sectoral priorities. Some of the greatest concerns are in the small island developing states of the Pacific. Here it can also be misleading to consider ODA on a per capita basis because of their diseconomies of scale and very small populations. Geographically isolated and with limited resources they face high development costs and rely strongly on aid to overcome vulnerabilities to external shocks. Any reduction in technical assistance is likely therefore to impede development progress. This subregion in particular should be looking to boost external assistance. In future, technical assistance will also need to re-engage more strongly with agriculture both to build longer term food security and to support the incomes of the rural poor. 13 MDG PRIORITIES In ASIA AnD THE PACIFIC CHAPTER II: Seven drivers for achieving the MDGs All these programmes would be more effective if recipient countries improved their institutions and governance structures. But there is also a need for donors to increase the predictability of their support, reduce fragmentation and invest with long-term national goals in mind. For this purpose, the development partners should enable receiving developing countries to take the lead in their own development policies and developed countries should align their technical assistance programmes with national development plans to harmonize their activities and make them more open and accountable. For example, Pacific island leaders and development partners have recently reaffirmed their commitment through the Cairns Compact and are working together to improve coordination and accountability.24 South-South economic assistance \u2013 Most ODA still comes from the DAC countries. Within the Asia- Pacific region, the largest developing country sources include China, at about $1.4 billion, India at about $1.0 billion, the Russian Federation with around $0.2 billion. Southern or new sources of assistance in the region are primarily helping their neighbours. For example, China mostly helps Cambodia, DPR Korea, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Pakistan, Philippines and Viet Nam. Similarly, India assists Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal, while Thailand provides assistance mostly to Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Maldives and Viet Nam. Much of this aid thus goes to LDCs where it is likely to be used in support of the MDGs \u2013 generally going into sectors such as infrastructure, energy, agriculture, health, and education. For example, China and India have helped in building roads, bridges, hospitals, educational institutions and hydro-electric plants in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan. Thailand has many cooperative programmes in the areas of agriculture and health with Malaysia, Indonesia and Timor-Leste. Malaysia has provided assistance to Viet Nam for research relating to rubber. Such flows can help establish institutions, improve capacities and ultimately boost the incomes of the poor.25 Another priority has been health. Malaysia, for example, has provided assistance for setting up clinics in Cambodia, while India has built hospitals in Afghanistan, Nepal, Maldives and Lao PDR. South- South assistance also focus on education and training \u2013 setting up educational institutions in the recipient country, funding vocational programmes to develop skills that help improve productivity and incomes, and offering scholarships for students from recipient countries to study in the assisting country. China, India, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand all have several such programmes. These instances of cooperation, especially in social sectors, are clearly positive examples of South-South and regional cooperation. Exploiting the potential of regional economic integration Beyond South-South cooperation in sharing development experiences and capacity building, regional economic integration offers many other opportunities \u2013 particularly for smaller economies \u2013 by enabling them to extend their markets and reap efficiency gains Figure II-1 \u2013 net ODA receipts per person in 2008, uS$ Source: OECD-DAC, 2010. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 Oceania 177 Africa 45 Europe 42 All developing countries 24 America 16 Asia 12 South and Central Asia", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bc71a91-cf37-48b3-91c1-75533f3bd34e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bc71a91-cf37-48b3-91c1-75533f3bd34e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b1e86ba1846a35e4eefed6c087ccbb0135b6686307af63b83dcb858513e927a"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ae5bfbd-9179-4626-b223-94719aae5999", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2159e1628e4e9859f5716b094dc617224734ec0d6d3fc55f8f85f16a9ad914f3"}}, "hash": "056857c560da73a533025f3cdfdfff27f48a6010938345a49fe12d8e4656ba71", "text": "10 Far East Asia 4 LDC ESCAP 39 LLDC ESCAP 74 SIDS ESCAP 135 US$ 14 PATHS TO 2015 CHAPTER II: Seven drivers for achieving the MDGs from specialization and economies of scale and scope. This could make the region more resilient to future crises and bolster the capacity of many of the poorest countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. When it comes to exploiting the potential of regional economic integration, Asia and the Pacific has lagged behind other regions. Thus far, for historical, political and topographical reasons, the region has been better connected with Europe and North America than with itself. Meanwhile, Europe, North America, Latin America and Africa have all moved to deeper forms of regional integration, with customs unions and even monetary unions. Asia and the Pacific which has some of the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing economies, could be an even greater economic powerhouse if it too developed a more integrated regional market. But it would need to do so using a development paradigm that is more inclusive and sustainable.26 The process of regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region is led by sub-regional groupings such as ASEAN in South-East Asia, SAARC in South Asia, BIMSTEC in South and South-East Asia, and the Pacific Islands Forum in the Pacific \u2013 which have evolved regional trading and investment arrangements. The region has developed a complex network of overlapping regional and bilateral trading arrangements. The time has come to consolidate these into a unified Asia-Pacific market. With growth poles such as China and India, along with other economic powerhouses like Japan, a unified Asia-Pacific market could be the centre of gravity of the world economy.27 For this purpose the countries of the region can accelerate progress on two current proposals: the East Asia Free Trade Agreement that brings together the ASEAN+3 grouping, and the Comprehensive Economic Partnership of East Asia under East Asia Summit (EAS) frame work that, in addition to the ASEAN+3 grouping, includes Australia, India, and New Zealand.28 An integrated economic space needs to be complemented, however, by improved physical connectivity as well as by better trade and investment facilitation. Migration policy too could encourage integration if source and destination countries could arrive at bilateral agreements. Yet another area for fruitful regional cooperation is in developing a regional financial architecture. This could provide more efficient intermediation between the region\u2019s large savings and its unmet investment needs for infrastructure and other developmental gaps.29 So far the cooperation in the area has been largely limited to the Chiang Mai Initiative that has now been multilateralized as a reserve pool of $120 billion for meeting the temporary liquidity needs of ASEAN+3 countries.30 At the 66th session held in Incheon in May 2010, the member States of ESCAP mandated the ESCAP secretariat to assist in development of the elements of a regional financial architecture.31 Towards 2015 The opportunities outlined in this chapter are by no means exhaustive, but if used vigorously, they can help countries accelerate progress towards many of the goals on which they are currently falling short. The next chapter looks more closely at one of the region\u2019s most vulnerable areas \u2013 hunger \u2013 and highlights opportunities for building food security.

Around one person in six suffers from malnourishment, and one child in three is underweight. Asia and the Pacific has about two-thirds of the world\u2019s hungry people. This failure has a huge cost, primarily in lives lost and in sickness and disease, but also in stifling both human and economic potential. Lack of progress on child nutrition, which is slowing children\u2019s physical and mental development, is crippling other critical development efforts to control disease, boost education and spur economic progress.1 The two main", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae6ee2eb-114a-45c3-9b0c-453045b9a0e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae6ee2eb-114a-45c3-9b0c-453045b9a0e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f542034c0873ff095d5e6dbcf1ba9a81120e44448cf7fc433c744282faafadea"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb7dc989-f6aa-42d9-9166-feb01da7c5cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "124840e79c9d63fc280fbbe4529b35199cd0c629a34b598f6e77fb792168b572"}}, "hash": "4140ab44432a476e6b7ba1c43cc8d48dbc16e39444f12245a2caf450407a25ea", "text": "MDG indicators on hunger and malnutrition are the proportion of the population undernourished and the proportion of under-five children who are underweight. For the region as a whole, between 1990-92 and 2004-06, the proportion of undernourished \u2013 those consuming less than the daily minimum energy requirement \u2013 fell only slightly. Between 1990-92 and 1995-07 it fell from 20 to 17 per cent but by 2004-06 had dropped by only one percentage point, to 16 per cent (Table III-1). Even this reduction was largely offset by population increase, so the total number of hungry people barely changed. FAO\u2019s most recent estimates put the number of hungry people in Asia and the Pacific at 642 million in 2009 \u2013 an increase of about 75 million during 2006-09. This is the highest number in the recent decades. For children who are malnourished \u2013 weighing less than they should for their age \u2013 the drop in the proportion was somewhat greater, from 40 to 31 per cent, nevertheless this still left almost 100 million children malnourished. Reducing hunger and building food security Despite rapid economic growth and falling levels of poverty, Asia and the Pacific still suffers from widespread hunger and malnutrition. In future, countries across the region will have to pay greater attention to food security, and ensure that poor people have access to the food they need to lead healthy and productive lives. % of population Millions 1990-92 2004-06 1990-92 2004-06 Asia and the Pacific 20 16 585.7 566.2 East Asia 15 10 183.3 136.3 South-East Asia 24 15 105.7 84.7 South Asia 25 23 286.1 336.6 Central Asia 8 10 4.0 5.8 Western Asia 38 13 6.1 2.1 Pacific Islands (a) 12 13 0.5 0.7 Latin America and the Caribbean 12 8 52.6 45.3 Near East and North Africa 6 8 19.1 33.8 Sub-Saharan Africa 34 30 168.8 212.3 Developing World 20 16 826.2 857.7 World 16 13 845.3 872.9 Table III-1 \u2013 undernourishment in Asia and the Pacific and other global regions Note: (a) Due to limited data, the Pacific Islands includes Papua New Guinea only.

Jha (2010). 16 PATHS TO 2015 CHAPTER III: Reducing hunger and building food security For undernourishment the greatest advance was in East and South-East Asia. South Asia, on the other hand made scarcely any progress, and the number of hungry people increased substantially, from 286 million to 337 million. In several countries in South Asia, more than one-fifth of the population are undernourished. In the Pacific Island states the level of hunger varies from 5 per cent in Kiribati to 9 per cent in the Solomon Islands.2 The subregional pattern is similar for child malnutrition. The worst-performing subregion is South Asia which has an underweight prevalence of 41 per cent and is home to half the world\u2019s underweight children. Several countries in the subregion have the world\u2019s highest national underweight prevalence \u2013 worse than countries such as Ethiopia at 35 per cent.3 In this region, the problem is less a lack of food than poor food quality and food safety, along with inadequate sanitation causing energy-draining diarrhoeal diseases and women\u2019s low social status and early marriage which leads to low birth weights. But it is striking that despite rapid economic growth, South-East Asia still has one- quarter of its children malnourished. Children in rural areas are nearly twice as likely to be underweight as those in urban areas.

In the longer term, as most developed countries have shown, hunger falls with rising levels of economic development. Experience across the region suggests five overall policy priorities for tackling hunger: i) creating jobs and increasing incomes; ii) boosting agricultural production; iii) maintaining stable and reasonable prices; iv) providing safety nets for the poor; and v) implementing feeding programmes. Creating jobs and increasing incomes The main hunger response should be to ensure that poor people have the jobs and incomes that will enable them to buy the food they need.

To counter this trend and foster decent employment governments can try to ensure that growth is more employment intensive, particularly where the poor work. This will mean, for example, promoting employment-intensive sectors such as agriculture and small and medium enterprises. At the same time they can establish or expand employment creation programmes specifically for the poor and the vulnerable. Fortunately in recent years many Asian governments have been adopting such strategies. India, for example, as well as directing investment into high employment sectors has also implemented targeted employment programmes for the poor and vulnerable such as the National Employment Guarantee Scheme, which provided employment to 46 million households in 2009.5 Close to half of those employed were women and more than half were from marginalized groups.6 Other ways of raising incomes of the poorest, currently being developed in a number of countries in the region, are conditional cash transfer programmes along with other poverty alleviation schemes. Reducing poverty will make a vital contribution to reducing hunger. But it will not be sufficient on its own. Except in the Pacific Island group of countries, the fall in poverty has generally been greater than the fall in hunger. This underlines the importance of tackling hunger on a broad front with additional interventions specifically related to food production and consumption. boosting agricultural production Food insecurity depends to a large extent on food production and availability. A worrying trend is that over the last decade, while food output has increased, there has been a deceleration in the growth of agricultural output and productivity. To some extent this reflects declining levels of investment. Most capital investment in agriculture comes from the private sector, especially from farmers themselves. Nevertheless public investment in agriculture is important for attracting private-sector investment. Governments can invest in irrigation, research and rural infrastructure, technology generation and dissemination, natural resource conservation and standard setting and monitoring \u2013 which can help increase productivity, reduce transaction costs and improve the competitiveness of agriculture.7 In recent years, however, governments have been spending less on agriculture and have directed more investment to the main growth sectors \u2013 manufacturing and services (Figure III-1).

It also declined in absolute terms falling between 1984 and 2004 from $8 billion to $3.4 billion (in 2004 dollars). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the bulk of agricultural ODA went to Asia, especially India, in support of the green revolution.9 It could be argued that declining aid flows are limiting agricultural growth and productivity. The first priority is therefore to redirect attention to agriculture, since many Asian countries have vast unexploited potential for agricultural growth. One of the easiest ways of raising farm yields and accelerating growth is to adopt already available improved technologies. Both public and private investments in agricultural research and extension are necessary to provide a continuous stream of yield-enhancing technologies that can be profitably adopted by farmers. The green revolution has run its course; new scientific breakthroughs, such as those in biotechnology, are now required to raise yield potentials. This is especially important because land and water are increasingly scarce in Asia and future agricultural growth will increasingly have to come from sustainable agriculture technology. Addressing the supply-side factors requires more investment in irrigation and farm-to-market roads, crop diversification, improved marketing, policies to encourage larger farm sizes and mechanization, increased market access and trade in agriculture, and greater incentives for food production. At the same time it will be important that women are supported fully to develop their capacities since more than half the region\u2019s women work in agriculture.10 It will also be important to offer sufficient incentives to farmers. This not only benefits farming households but also other rural households by encouraging investment in agriculture and creating additional employment in rural economies. For this purpose, governments in the region have used a variety of instruments \u2013 such as fixing minimum support prices for food grains, providing subsidies on key farm inputs such as irrigation water, fertilizers, seeds, and credit. They have also held buffer stocks of food grains and regulated the foodgrains trade. Some argue that these measures distort incentives, but they are nevertheless critical for ensuring food security in Asia and the Pacific. Indonesia, for example, returned to self-sufficiency in 2009 as a result of active support to agriculture in recent years. Maintaining stable and reasonable food prices Countries need to strike a balance. While food prices should be at such a level as to encourage production, they also need to be within the range of the poor. High prices hurt the vast majority of urban and rural households who purchase most of their food. The people hit hardest are poor people who on average spend about two thirds of their budget on food. Rich households, on the other hand, spend only about one third of their income on food so they can afford to pay more. To some extent domestic food prices will reflect international prices, especially in countries that are net food exporters. In Asia and the Pacific while 13 countries are net exporters of cereals, pulses, meat, dairy, vegetables and fruits, 31 countries are net importers Figure III-1 \u2013 Agriculture\u2019s share of public expenditure, percentage Source: Fan and Saurkar, 2006.

FAO has estimated that, as a result of the food and energy crises, the total undernourished population in the region increased from 566 million in 2004-06 to 642 million in 2009.11 During 2006-08, soaring cereal prices increased household food costs substantially. On average, in Asia and the Pacific, food costs for poor households increased by 43 per cent, but for rich households only by 18 per cent. As a result, the purchasing power of poor households decreased by 24 per cent, in Asia and the Pacific, while for rich households it decreased only by 4 per cent. In the Philippines and Pakistan, for example, it has been estimated that a 30 per cent increase in food prices led to increases in the number of people living below the national poverty lines of about 9 million and 22 million respectively.12 Keeping food prices low and stable requires a reliable and consistent supply of food grains. For food-deficient countries, this will mean making efforts where possible to increase domestic production which can be supplemented with imports to build adequate stocks. To guard against food price volatility and sudden shortfalls, some governments in Asia and the Pacific have traditionally held national stocks", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28fe06b3-bbbd-4c78-8517-f113d58b4c89": {"__data__": {"id_": "28fe06b3-bbbd-4c78-8517-f113d58b4c89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e25b48a5a2de479305be1d150d87dc452ab405141fffe57f068764fca4cc7b7"}}, "hash": "9e25b48a5a2de479305be1d150d87dc452ab405141fffe57f068764fca4cc7b7", "text": "of rice and other staple foods. It is also important to ensure that food markets work efficiently. Many countries, particularly geographically large ones with insufficiently developed infrastructure, can face considerable variability in food prices. In India, while the average monthly price of rice in October 2009 was Rs. 21 per kilogram, the price across 78 consumption centres ranged from Rs. 10 to Rs. 31.13 Another concern is that much of the power in food markets rests with buyers and retailers who can pay low prices while charging high prices to consumers. Policy makers will therefore need to promote competitive yet equitable market mechanisms such as improving transport, storage, and other necessary infrastructure, and encouraging the private sector to develop efficient food markets. Regional cooperation can help promote food security, for example through food reserves. One option to deal with such a risk is a regional rice bank. A permanent East Asian emergency rice reserve is being discussed by the 13 countries of ASEAN+3 as a follow-up to its ongoing East Asia Emergency Rice Reserve Pilot Project \u2013 a system for sharing rice stocks. Another positive initiative is the agreement, since 2007, to establish the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Food Bank which needs to be strengthened and operationalized on an optimal scale and could also foster inter-country partnerships and regional integration. Regional agreements to avoid export restrictions and cooperation to build up production capacities can also help.14 Providing safety nets for the poor When the market fails to provide food of sufficient quantity or quality for the poor, governments can take responsibility to ensure food security for the poor through subsidies or public food distribution systems.

These subsidies have made important contributions but have often proved difficult to operate successfully due to suffering from selection bias, leakages and poor food quality. They are also expensive to maintain and operate. Between the early 1990s and the 2000s the cost of the public distribution system in India rose from 2.5 to almost 6.0 per cent of government expenditure.15 Costs for such programmes and the price of food for the poor can be reduced, for example, by only offering nutritious but lower cost cereals that the poor can afford. When resources are very limited, however, it may also be necessary to have more precise targeting \u2013 while taking care not to exclude the homeless and illiterate. Measures also need to be in place to ensure well managed storage and distribution and to reduce leakage, fraud and corruption. In addition, the government has to handle its relationship with farmers carefully by setting a purchase price that is fair for producers as well as consumers. Direct distribution of food is sometimes combined with other programmes involving nutrition, education, and health services. For example, the Vulnerable Group Development Programme in Bangladesh seeks to integrate food and nutrition security with development and income generation. Participants receive a monthly allocation of wheat in exchange for attending training on income-generating activities, participating in basic literacy, numeracy, and nutrition training, and making savings deposits. An alternative to distributing food is to offer subsidies through \u2018food stamps\u2019 \u2013 a term that can cover a range of food-linked income-transfer schemes. These include tokens or discount cards or electronic transfer cards. Food stamp programmes have lower costs than food distribution systems. They can also be more efficient in addressing hunger than cash transfers, as they can only be spent on food items. However, these programmes also require strong supporting architecture within both the government and the private sector. Many governments also have targeted interventions through food-for-work programmes. These schemes too are self-selecting since only the poor are usually willing to undertake the manual labour required.

In 2009 alone, WFP assisted more than 4.4 million people in this way, thus providing food to vulnerable Afghans as they built or repaired community assets, including roads, bridges, reservoirs and irrigation systems. These projects are agreed upon in consultation with the government and local communities.16 Food-for-work programmes suffer, however, from many of the same problems associated with public distribution systems, including leakage through corruption, and wastage from poor storage, and can be even more expensive. Implementing feeding programmes One reason why poverty reduction may not translate into better levels of nutrition is that the poor do not necessarily spend any extra income on food. One study of 13 countries found that the extreme poor also spend significant amounts on other items.17 Moreover, as incomes increase, people buy greater varieties of food that do not necessarily offer more calories or nutritional benefits. Another issue is that, even if the household overall has sufficient food, it may not be reaching the family members in greatest need, particularly women and children. In addition to policies on production, prices and distribution, governments also have to consider targeted interventions for especially vulnerable population of society. These usually involve direct feeding programmes for three specific groups: women of childbearing age, young infants and children, and populations in need of emergency food assistance, such as refugees. In general, these programmes hinge on the delivery of a basic package of services for enhancing nutrition supported by necessary primary health care. The essential nutrition components are breastfeeding, growth monitoring, oral rehydration, immunization, nutrition education, micronutrient supplementation, and treatment and rehabilitation of the severely malnourished. In addition to supplements for children, such as Vitamin A, for example, governments have also introduced food fortification programmes like salt iodization. School feeding programmes distribute prepared food to children in school. Food-for education programmes distribute free foodgrains to low-income families if their children attend primary school. The grain can be used to feed all family members or be sold to meet other expenses. Both school feeding and food-for- education programmes provide immediate sustenance for the hungry while empowering future generations by educating today\u2019s children. 21 MDG PRIORITIES In ASIA AnD THE PACIFIC CHAPTER III: Reducing hunger and building food security As well as improving nutrition such programmes bring many secondary benefits. School feeding programmes can improve attendance, especially for girls, reduce drop-out rates and even improve children\u2019s performance and behaviour.18 And programmes for pregnant and lactating mothers can reduce the number of low birthweight babies and maternal mortality rates and, along with pre-school feeding programmes, help children develop normally both mentally and physically. Another vital contribution to good child nutrition is exclusive breastfeeding along with other basic health services like disease control, and safe water. These programmes can also incorporate strong communications components to empower families \u2013 especially women with the information they need to make best use of the available food. One of the best ways of addressing these issues is through education, especially for women, since better educated women are in a stronger position not only to understand nutrition issues but will also have more power within the household to ensure that everyone is fed adequately.19 Released from hunger Releasing people from hunger not only fulfils a basic human right but also contributes towards the achievement of all the other MDGs. Well nourished adults will, for example, be more productive and better able to work their own way out of poverty. And well nourished children will grow up healthier and take greater advantage of opportunities to learn at school and fulfil their aspirations. At the same time, reducing hunger also depends to a large extent on simultaneously addressing most of the other Goals. Educated women, for example, will get better employment that will allow them to buy more nutritious food. And children who grow up with better water supplies and sanitation will be less vulnerable to diarrhoeal and other diseases that prevent them from absorbing vital nutrients. This underlines the importance of taking an integrated approach that considers the MDGs both individually and as a whole. The next chapter therefore broadens the discussion to consider how all the goals, and particularly those related to health, can be supported by stronger basic services.

The region as a whole is on track to achieve the goal of stopping the spread of HIV and tuberculosis by 2015, but is off track for many of the other health targets \u2013 notably reducing infant and child mortality and improving provision for maternal health. Although HIV prevalence is stabilizing, the region is not on track to achieve universal access to prevention and treatment for HIV infection for those who need it. In education, the performance has been somewhat better and many countries are close to achieving universal primary enrolment (Table IV-1). Many are also close to gender parity at the primary level, and at the secondary level girls may well be ahead of boys. But while the quantity of education has increased, the quality is less impressive. School buildings are often inadequate, books are scarce, teachers can frequently absent, class sizes may be large and the curricula may fail to meet children\u2019s needs. Discouraged, and under pressure to work, many children attend irregularly or drop out of school, and Asian students often get low scores in international standardized tests. Despite advances in expanding access to primary schooling, as many as 14 per cent of primary school age children in South and West Asia \u2013 18 million \u2013 were not in school in 2007. In the Pacific the proportion was 16 per cent \u2013 over half a million in the Pacific. Girls were at a disadvantage in both cases, but particularly in South and West Asia. (Table IV-1) Investing more in basic services Addressing shortfalls in social indicators will mean investing more in public services. Figure IV-1 compares spending on education and health in Asia and the Pacific with that in other global regions. Despite budget pressures, governments should have the funds to increase investment. Indeed countries have largely maintained or increased expenditure on health and Improving health and other basic services If the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific are to achieve the MDGs they will need to offer reliable basic services such as health and education to the people. Most have been determined to improve their provision but many still fall short in terms of coverage and quality, especially in rural areas.

Nevertheless, given that many countries are falling short on MDG achievement, they will clearly need to invest more. When public expenditure is low, households try to make up the difference through private spending. For health services, for example, while people in richer countries are able to arrange health insurance or other forms of pre-paid plan, in developing countries in Asia and the Pacific a high proportion of private expenditure is \u2018out-of-pocket\u2019: around 90 per cent in India, Nepal and China. About 78 million people in Asia and the Pacific end up with less than $1 a day after they have paid for health care \u2013 and can suffer catastrophic expenditure during pregnancy and childbirth.1 One reason why government expenditure on the MDGs might fall short is a concern about fiscal deficits. As fiscal prudence is essential, the necessary response to this is maximizing revenues through improved tax collection by imposing new innovative taxes and then by increasing allocations to the social sectors that are essential for achieving the MDGs.2 For many countries in the region,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "533af652-716c-4ec7-9a99-1fd27f6d445b": {"__data__": {"id_": "533af652-716c-4ec7-9a99-1fd27f6d445b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3426af2d24b8420f1ad5ab39229d02c87c83ca64f1569ff97fd7300da931f93c"}}, "hash": "3426af2d24b8420f1ad5ab39229d02c87c83ca64f1569ff97fd7300da931f93c", "text": "tax to GDP ratio is rather low and may be increased. Improving governance If they are to increase expenditure, however, governments will be concerned about achieving higher service quality. At present the quality of services is undermined by a number of issues, some related to governance. These could be addressed by: Improving efficiency \u2013 Governments can allocate budgets wisely so as to spend more where services are more urgently needed, such as on teachers in rural areas, and on high productivity inputs such as medicines and textbooks.3 They may also be able to ensure that services better match demand, especially from the poor, by moving away from overly-centralized systems of both financing and service provision, and decentralizing more functions to local administration. Achieving greater policy coherence \u2013 MDG outcomes depend not just on expenditure through sectoral ministries, such as health or education, but also on broader policies on poverty alleviation, on infrastructure, and on other services such as water and sanitation with which several other ministries and levels of government may be involved.

Reducing corruption \u2013 At present a significant proportion of social investment drains away in corruption. Health and education personnel often have high absentee rates, especially in rural areas and there can be kickbacks and bribes to public officials in procurement processes whether for new construction or supplies. Setting standards, strengthening regulations and enforcement \u2013 Standards of delivery of services such as in education, health and water supply can fall if standards are not set and enforced. Government bodies often have weak authority and poor procedures for regulating the quality of private services and supplies such as of pharmaceuticals, for example, or of medical practices. Weaknesses in legal systems also make it difficult to enforce contracts or pursue cases of medical negligence. Increasing voice and accountability \u2013 In principle, people in many countries in the region are entitled to free primary education and primary health care. In practice the services are usually much better for the privileged, particularly in the urban areas. This is because health policies, for example, are typically conceived, directed and implemented by a small group of professionals in ministries of health \u2013 with inadequate involvement of civil society including people living with HIV and key affected populations, professional bodies, consumer organizations, or members of parliament. In addition teachers, doctors and health workers are often discouraged by poor rural services for transport, housing, electricity and water, and may not wish to live and work in remote areas.4 Ensuring better provision of decentralized services \u2013 Basic services are generally provided by local and provincial governments who often lack capacities. While capacity development is essential, national governments also need to ensure that quality standards are maintained and set up adequate monitoring and evaluation systems. Regular feedback from beneficiaries can help identify deficiencies and spur better service provision by encouraging such measures as the Bangalore Citizen Report cards system.5 Generating better data \u2013 Improving services will also mean gathering data for evidence-based policy making. National data may not be disaggregated by region or by gender or by coverage of vulnerable groups. And some sensitive data related to issues such as violence against women may not be collected at all.

Discrimination may be based on gender or many other characteristics \u2013 caste, creed, sexual identity, ethnicity, disability, age, socio-economic standing, geographical location, or even membership of stigmatized groups such as sex workers or drug users. And if the poor fail to register births their children may find it more difficult to access basic services.

Bangladesh, for example, has been addressing this issue through a stipend programme for girls that has improved their enrolment in schooling and reduced drop-out rates. Demand-led approaches can also offset the exclusionary impacts of user charges \u2013 as is evident from the experience of health equity funds in Cambodia. Poor families are also generally excluded from formal banking and financial transactions because they lack collateral. Migrants \u2013 Faced with massive rural-urban migration some countries in Asia and the Pacific region are struggling to maintain basic services in urban areas, especially for migrants who are particularly vulnerable. While some countries strictly regulate such migration, others do not have any policy to manage migration or properly provide for migrants.6 Physically challenged people \u2013 They may be considered economically unproductive and face discrimination in employment. People living with HIV \u2013 People living with HIV and key affected populations \u2013 such as sex workers, people who use drugs or men having sex with men \u2013 may not have access to prevention and care services. Or they may fear police harassment or be discouraged because they believe that health-care workers will not respect their rights and will discriminate against them. Moreover, each form of exclusion compounds the others and tends to sustain intergenerational cycles of poverty. Poorer groups, for example, usually get lower than average returns from education as a result of discrimination in the job market. And unhealthy workers are likely to be less productive and will earn less. On the other hand, even creating more jobs will not boost people\u2019s incomes if they lack the necessary education, strength or skills. Exclusion needs therefore to be tackled on a broad front, addressing multiple deprivations and barriers, whether in access to public services, or the distribution of assets or of political power.7 These problems will not be solved by markets alone, but will demand government responses and community mobilization, including in some cases affirmative action and changes in laws that hamper access. The development of effective partnerships between government and civil society organizations is also crucial. One problem is that some social inequalities go unobserved officially because of a lack of relevant data and analysis. Good data can stimulate action. India, for example established a commission on the social, economic and educational status of the Muslim community. The government has now published the commission\u2019s data and is implementing its recommendations.8 Analysis should also respond to qualitative findings \u2013 such as the need for poor women in rural areas to consult female doctors. Diversifying the range of service providers Users of services are also likely to have stronger influence if they can choose from a range of providers. In the past the principal providers in many countries have been governments \u2013 particularly for health, education, water and sanitation. But increasingly, as government budgets have become stretched, more services are being provided by NGOs which, along with the private sector and other civil society organizations, have acquired greater knowledge and expertise. However governments should ensure that the poor have access to services from these providers.9 Community based organizations can be better placed to deliver basic health and education services to poor and vulnerable groups. Often they use microcredit to link income-generating activities with health, education and sanitation services. One of the best- known models is that of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh which has been widely replicated. Another innovation is public-private partnerships such as that of Chiranjeevi Yojanain in Gujarat, India which offers poor and socially excluded women free maternity services at private hospitals. There are also good examples of how peer-led community groups such as those involving sex workers in Sonagachi, West Bengal, India, or drug user groups such as Mit Samphan in 26 PATHS TO 2015 CHAPTER IV: Improving health and other basic services Thailand, which have been able to organise themselves to do outreach and deliver health services to their constituencies. Programmes are also being supported by many international funders \u2013 including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Fund for Children, and the Turner Foundation. For these kinds of collaboration, governments have important roles to play to ensure collaboration and harmonization, set standards and establish appropriate incentives and legal environments. Priorities in health While governments need to strengthen provision across the whole range of public services, many will need to pay close attention to the health", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3eac5e2a-5697-437f-b759-cfea428c0ddb": {"__data__": {"id_": "3eac5e2a-5697-437f-b759-cfea428c0ddb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7eeb6935fa6aed53452d3bb769107137a4edb219b580dcb7f843dc528e441d3"}}, "hash": "a7eeb6935fa6aed53452d3bb769107137a4edb219b580dcb7f843dc528e441d3", "text": "goals \u2013 where progress has been particularly slow. Asia has a large share of global deaths and illnesses \u2013 more than 40 per cent of the world\u2019s under-five deaths and maternal deaths, and 52 per cent of stunted children.10 Asia is also responsible for 55 per cent of unmet needs for family planning, 56 per cent of newborn deaths and 15 per cent of the number of people living with HIV.11 Of the health targets one of the priority areas is child mortality. South-East Asia is on track for this, but all the other subregions are progressing too slowly. This is mirrored at the country level: out of the 47 countries for which trend data are available, 34 are off track. The recent financial crisis will have had an impact and it is proving difficult to reduce neonatal mortality, which is intrinsically linked to maternal survival and health. Still, the picture is not all bleak since most countries are making some progress. Of the countries with under-5 mortality rates in the early 1990s of around 100 per 1,000 live births or higher, quite a number, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Mongolia and Nepal, have made impressive progress, and are close to their targets, while the Maldives has, in the meantime, reached its target. A significant problem in the Pacific region is the increase in incidence of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. Many of these health problems are due to preventable factors such as poor diet, physical inactivity and alcohol and tobacco use. Pacific Island countries have carried out awareness-raising programmes but still have much work ahead if they are to encourage widespread change towards healthier choices. In addition to education, governments need to ensure adequate treatment programmes and facilities without cutting services to meet other health care needs. With respect to HIV, the picture is mixed. There has been some success in bringing down incidence and prevalence \u2013 as in Cambodia, Thailand and parts of India. But the incidence is increasing in some countries in South-East Asia as well as across the region among men who have sex with men. Some countries have scaled up anti-retroviral treatment but regional coverage is still lagging behind the global average. And even when HIV medicine is free, people may still face high fees for diagnostic tests, medication for opportunistic infections, and nutritional supplements.12 Another major health concern is maternal mortality. When mothers die during childbirth, their newborns are unlikely to survive and their young children will also be at risk. Measuring maternal mortality is challenging as it is often under reported or misreported. Nevertheless it is clear that many countries in Asia and the Pacific are unlikely to reach the target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015 unless they can accelerate progress. As indicated in Figure IV-3, the problems are most severe in the least developed countries where levels of maternal mortality are close to those in Sub-Saharan Africa. A study of maternal mortality rates published in The Lancet in 2010 suggested that progress had been somewhat more rapid than suggested by the MDG database, but nevertheless even these numbers are unacceptably high (Box IV-1). Reflecting the urgency of the problem in April 2010 the UN Secretary-General announced a Joint Action Plan for accelerating progress on maternal and newborn health. A major determinant of a mother surviving is whether or not the birth is attended by a skilled health professional \u2013 doctor, nurse or midwife \u2013 who can avert a significant proportion of maternal deaths. All the women should have access to life saving emergency obstetric care, including Caesarean sections though poor mothers are less likely to have this option. In 11 countries out of the 43 in the region for which data are available, less than half of all births were attended by trained health professionals. The situation was particularly stark in countries such as Lao PDR, Timor-Leste, Nepal, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, where less than one birth in five was attended by a skilled professional. In addition to a shortage of such workers they are also poorly distributed. Reducing maternal mortality will also need adequate antenatal care, which is particularly weak in South Asia. Moreover the risks of dying during pregnancy and 27 MDG PRIORITIES In ASIA AnD THE PACIFIC CHAPTER IV: Improving health and other basic services Table IV-2 \u2013 Progress required for off-track countries to meet the under-5 mortality target Note: *Cumulative number of deaths from 2009 to 2015.

There are also high unmet needs for family planning in countries such as Afghanistan, Timor- Leste, and Papua New Guinea that have very high fertility rates. Health outcomes are a function of many factors, economic and political, social and cultural. Generally speaking, the richer countries will have higher standards of health as a result of improved housing and overall living conditions. Many of the deaths of young children, for example, can be prevented by having better access to clean water and sanitation. And better road infrastructure and public transport would make health facilities more accessible. Indeed economic growth might be expected to improve all the MDG indicators. This has been analyzed for Asia and Affected population in 2015 on current trend (thousands)* Average annual change needed to reach target (per 1,000 live births) Affected population in 2015 if target reached (thousands)* Country 28 PATHS TO 2015 CHAPTER IV: Improving health and other basic services the Pacific by calculating the percentage change in each MDG indicator for each 1 per cent increase in growth. The beneficial effect appears to be greatest for poverty, with more than 1 per cent decrease in the incidence of poverty. But the growth effect is slower for health \u2013 with a 1 per cent increase in growth only improves health indicators by around half of a per cent.13 If governments use the additional resources generated by growth to prioritize spending on urgently needed sectors such as health, rising growth levels can bring about better health outcomes in the future. While overall growth can thus lead to better health outcomes, it is clear that relying on growth alone will not do. Countries across the region will need to pay particular attention to improving health service delivery. This will involve establishing a balance between state and private-sector provision. In some cases, particularly for primary health care, the government will be the main provider, but in others the government should serve more as the policy coordinator and regulator \u2013 establishing a framework within which the government services, the private sector and NGOs can operate efficiently. Increasing public health expenditure and staffing levels Generally health expenditure is higher in richer countries \u2013 both as a proportion of GDP and of total government expenditure. But national wealth is clearly Figure IV-3 \u2013 Maternal mortality rates and number of deaths Source: Staff calculations based on the United Nations MDG database. A study of maternal mortality rates in 181 countries published in The Lancet in April 2010 indicated that significant progress had been made towards MDG 5. Between 1980 and 2008, worldwide maternal deaths fell by nearly 35 per cent, from 526,300 to 342,900. Globally, however, only 23 countries are on track to achieve a 75 per cent decrease in maternal mortality rate by 2015. In Asia and the Pacific the progress has been uneven. A number of countries including China have made rapid progress, and in the Maldives between 1980 and 2008 the decline in the rate was 8.8 per cent per year.

Bhutan and Cambodia, for example, devote more than 10 per cent of GDP to health, while others may devote 4 per cent or less. Clearly, much depends on the priorities and commitment of governments. Low public investment in health combined with a high incidence of disease means that too few staff are having to cope with the expanding needs \u2013 resulting in overcrowded government hospitals with long queues, and extended waiting times for specific treatments. Countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR and Nepal still have limited physicians, and skilled health personnel to attend births (Table IV-3). In the Pacific, the Philippines and South Asia in particular, these shortages are exacerbated by the emigration of skilled health workers to developed countries. Nevertheless the priority may not only be to increase the number of doctors \u2013 who often gravitate to urban areas. More immediate problems may derive from shortages of nurses, paramedics or skilled birth attendants. Ensuring that staff, and particularly female staff, can work in rural areas and in difficult locations will therefore require appropriate systems of incentives. Achieving universal health care More countries in the region are now considering ways of offering universal health care. This can be achieved in a variety of ways and in multiple combinations. The most basic requirement is to guarantee health treatment for the poorest through different forms of social safety net that can be funded entirely out of general taxation \u2013 as in Thailand\u2019s universal health care scheme.

Physicians per 10,000 population % of births attended by skilled personnel 30 PATHS TO 2015 CHAPTER IV: Improving health and other basic services At the same time countries can also move towards universal health schemes that are based at least partly on the pooling of risk across the population through the purchase of insurance. Thus while some European countries provide health care based on residence rights, others have much more pluralistic delivery systems based on obligatory health insurance, with contribution rates related to salaries or incomes, and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries jointly. In Asia, some countries have attempted to provide such a universal health scheme: Public health insurance \u2013 In the more advanced countries where a high proportion of workers are in the formal sector, users of health services can pool risks through public health insurance. Private health insurance \u2013 Even in countries with basic universal provision people with high incomes often prefer to use the private sector in the hope of getting faster or better quality care. Private schemes are becoming more popular in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 particularly among middle- and high-income households. A variant on this is a public-private partnership where the government subsidizes private health insurance premiums for the poor. Community-based health insurance \u2013 Rather than having a national system there can also be community- based health insurance schemes in which premiums for the poor might be paid by the local authority. In 2009, the State Government of Tamil Nadu (India) introduced the Insurance Scheme called \u201cChief Minister Kalaignar\u2019s Insurance Scheme for Life Saving Treatments\u201d for the poor and children. In the first half of 2010, over 88,000 people had benefitted from this scheme and the state government had released a sum of Rs 2500 million as claim amount.14 On top of insurance and subsidies, however, users are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db2c6fd6-beea-4cf7-a09b-0478a46321b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "db2c6fd6-beea-4cf7-a09b-0478a46321b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dfdc40f3610be573098db47f174c15aac61093ed3d408f8a3bee14c307c51021"}}, "hash": "dfdc40f3610be573098db47f174c15aac61093ed3d408f8a3bee14c307c51021", "text": "still likely to be paying for some services, and particularly drugs, from out-of-pocket expenditure. China for example, in 2005 introduced a New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System which by 2007 covered around 80 per cent of the rural population. Of the annual cost of 50 yuan ($7) per person, 20 yuan is provided by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and 10 yuan comes in the form of a patient contribution. Universal coverage for health care is usually attained in countries where public investment in health is at least 5 per cent of GDP. In 2007, 17 developing countries in Asia were spending less than this. WHO has suggested appropriate percentages for the Asia-Pacific region: total public health expenditure should be at least 4 per cent of GDP; for private expenditure, it recommends that over 90 per cent of the population should be covered by some form of prepayment; and out-of- pocket spending should not exceed 40 per cent of total health expenditure.15 In addition, the vulnerable sections of the population should be provided with health safety nets. One estimate suggests that the essential interventions should cost about $34 per person per year.16 While some of this can come from general taxation it might also be possible to earmark some tax collection for health to ensure that the funds are used for this purpose. Assuming that the Asian LDCs could mobilize about 5 per cent of per capita income for health spending, this would amount to $25.7, leaving a gap of $8.3 per person per year, or a total of $2.4 billion, that might need to be met from overseas development assistance or south-south cooperation within countries of the region. The 2008 Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia stated that a comprehensive response to AIDS in the region would cost about $6.4 billion per year. But a targeted response which can halt and reverse the spread of the HIV epidemic might need only $3.1 billion \u2013 an investment of $0.50 to $1.00 per capita per year.17 While increasing expenditure on public health services governments will also want to minimize costs, particularly for drugs, which should as much as possible come in cheaper generic forms. Some countries like India have been able to develop capability to produce highly affordable generic drugs through adapting intellectual property right regimes and price regulations. The responsibility for these and other measures rests with national governments, but they should also be able to take advantage of regional cooperation. In some cases, this might involve transferring resources from richer to poorer countries, but countries across the region can also learn from one another through the exchange of best practices which reduce costs and improve delivery of health services. 31 MDG PRIORITIES In ASIA AnD THE PACIFIC CHAPTER IV: Improving health and other basic services Endnotes 1 WHO, 2009. 2 ESCAP (2010b). 3 ESCAP/ADB/UNDP, 2005. 4 Wan and Francisco, 2009. 5 Ravindra, 2004. 6 IOM, 2005. 7 Wan and Francisco, 2009. 8 Government of India, 2008. 9 ESCAP/ADB/UNDP, 2005. 10 UNICEF and WHO, 2010. 11 WHO, 2009. 12 UNDP (2010b). 13 ESCAP/ADB/UNDP, 2010. 14 See http://www.newkerala.com/news/fullnews-104256.html 15 WHO, 2010. 16 Jung and Tran, 2008. 17 Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008. A new era for public services Improving public services will thus require a greater commitment not just to spend more but to spend wisely \u2013 to increase both efficiency and equity. This will mean opening up services to a wider range of providers \u2013 and to greater public participation and scrutiny. However, another important constraint on service provision, particularly in the rural areas, is the lack of adequate infrastructure, particularly transport communications and power supplies. The final chapter turns therefore to this often neglected subject whose development underpins the achievement of the MDGs. 32 PATHS TO 2015 CHAPTER V T he MDG framework only has a few indicators for infrastructure \u2013 for water and sanitation which are part of MDG 7 and for information and communications technology in MDG8. It thus tends to focus on development outcomes rather than on some of the basic conditions for achieving them. Even when governments responded to the global economic crisis with stimulus packages that invested in infrastructure they did not generally link these specifically with the MDGs. Economic analysis has established a close relationship between investment in infrastructure and economic growth but has not examined the impact on poverty or other MDG outcomes. However the linkage has been explored in a number of empirical studies. One worldwide study, for example, shows that growth and investment are associated with reductions in poverty, infant mortality,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b1206a7-a1a0-4ebc-aeca-e58106fa87cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b1206a7-a1a0-4ebc-aeca-e58106fa87cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "543197b72605480a24281bf936e788242ff087a87883c6af229a0244741c001e"}}, "hash": "543197b72605480a24281bf936e788242ff087a87883c6af229a0244741c001e", "text": "income inequality, illiteracy and water pollution.1 But this and similar studies do not prove the direction of causality. Does infrastructure investment generate economic growth and reduce poverty or do higher growth and lower poverty create a larger resource space for infrastructure investment?2 It seems likely that the causality runs both ways. Indeed the linkage between the two is intuitive. Although all infrastructure would in some way help in achieving the MDGs, some forms are more directly connected, and these may be considered as \u2018basic\u2019 infrastructure. Better rural road transport, for example, should expand access to markets for marginal and small farmers and thus reduce rural poverty, while also allowing better access to schools and health centres. Better power supplies would mean that households would not need to rely so much on unhealthy wood burning stoves (Box V-1). Similar MDG benefits can be expected from other forms of infrastructure, as summarized in Table V-1. Which investments will be the more effective, however, will depend on local circumstances. For remote rural areas the priority might be roads or telecom services, while in urban areas it might be water supply and sanitation. It is, however, clear that there is huge room for improvement. For many forms of infrastructure, Asia and the Pacific as a whole lags behind Latin America (Table V-2). Some 930 million Asians are without electricity, only 3 Asians in 10 have access to a telephone, and half the region\u2019s roads are unpaved.3 Even within Asia and the Pacific there are marked disparities. Among the subregions, North-East Asia is the most advanced while the landlocked Central Asian republics and the Pacific Island countries are some way behind. In fact, the lack of physical infrastructure is considered a major impediment to the growth of Pacific economies, where there is a clear need to improve transport facilities and maritime and aviation infrastructure. The most advanced developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region are the Republic of Korea, China, India and the faster-growing countries in South-East Asia. But disparities are also evident within countries. Transport development, for example, tends to be more advanced in coastal areas that are integrated into regional production networks, and less extensive in remote regions that are home to indigenous groups and other marginalized populations. And more generally, services and MDG outcomes are typically better in urban areas. Strengthening basic infrastructure Achieving the MDGs in Asia and the Pacific will require stronger basic infrastructure, particularly better road transport, water supplies, sanitation, electricity, information technology, telecommunications and urban low-income housing. 33 MDG PRIORITIES In ASIA AnD THE PACIFIC CHAPTER V: Strengthening basic infrastructure box V-1 \u2013 Energy for All 1 Note: Energy for All uses the IEA 2009 data that show that 809 million Asians lack access to electricity. This report cites ADB\u2019s Asian Development Outlook 2009 figure of 930 million so we use that here for consistency. 2 See www.energyforall.info Modern energy is an essential input for achieving all of the MDGs, so much so that increasing access to affordable, reliable energy is now widely considered the \u201cmissing MDG\u201d. Yet in the Asia-Pacific region alone, some 930 million people do not have access to electricity, and nearly twice that number depend on burning biomass for cooking and heating.1 ADB\u2019s Energy for All Initiative is developing new approaches for scaling up access to clean, modern energy among the poor. This includes improving the delivery of energy services to deprived communities through ADB investments, extending policy support to governments to design and implement universal electrification programs, and building capacity and promoting knowledge exchange among a wide range of practitioners. ADB is also pursuing regional cooperation through the Energy for All Partnership, a multi-stakeholder platform launched in 2009.2 The Energy for All Partnership brings together the private sector, financial institutions, governments and civil society to share intelligence and collaborate on projects, with a target to expand access to modern energy to 100 million people in Asia and the Pacific by 2015. There are now many proven methods for extending much-needed energy services to the poor. ADB\u2019s Energy for All is focused on replicating effective models and scaling up existing initiatives. In Viet Nam, for example, an ADB-supported credit facility will build on the country\u2019s ongoing domestic biogas program and enable an additional 40,000 households to access cleaner cooking fuel from household biogas digesters. Access to cleaner fuels such as biogas can reduce disease burden and improve maternal and child health which are among the MDGs. Where appropriate, targeting investment to expand existing initiatives can hasten progress toward energy for all.

For the period 2010-2020 it has been estimated that the required investment would be $7.7 trillion, or about $700 billion per annum \u2013 58 per cent of which would be in East Asia and the Pacific, 36 per cent in South Asia and 6 per cent in Central Asia. Of the total, two- thirds would be for new infrastructure and the balance for replacing existing facilities. More than half the investment would be required for energy, and 30 per cent for roads (Table V-3). Considering that much of the investments would be needed to meet large existing gaps \u2013 such as providing electricity to over 22 percent households in the region currently without access or expanding the paved road networks for rural populations \u2013 of the $7.7 trillion, a significant proportion would be for basic infrastructure for supporting the MDGs. A crucial task facing policymakers is to make infrastructure investment more MDG-supporting. The key challenge is to mobilize finance. In the short term it should be possible to include essential low-cost rural infrastructure projects in ongoing fiscal stimulus packages. If such projects are labour- intensive they can also provide employment safety nets. For this purpose, poorer countries may have to rely more on grants or concessional financing from ODA or multilateral development institutions. But other countries will be able to access capital markets and tap into regional savings. With combined foreign exchange reserves of nearly $5 trillion, the region could now develop an ambitious architecture for mutually beneficial deployment of foreign exchange reserves. This architecture could include an infrastructure development fund.4 If it mobilized just 5 per cent of the region\u2019s reserves it would have start-up capital of $250 billion. The fund could also borrow from the region\u2019s central banks. By co-financing viable projects with other sources such an architecture could expedite investment in infrastructure development, especially cross-border connectivity projects linking poorer parts of the Asia-Pacific region with the region\u2019s growth centres.5 Stimulating the private sector Over the past two decades, more than 70 per cent of Asia\u2019s investment in infrastructure has come from the public sector. The public sector will still need to shoulder the main responsibility for improving the delivery of basic infrastructure for areas that are commercially unviable. But with rapidly increasing demand if the region is to take a leap in infrastructure spending for basic infrastructure more finance will need to come from private sources.

Although the chief benefit of expanding private sector involvement in infrastructure is likely to be to release more public-sector funds for MDG achievement, attempts to create more public-private partnerships in promising areas of basic infrastructure should continue. For this to happen, it will also be important to stimulate the interest of the private sector by developing appropriate regulatory frameworks. Governments may also offer fiscal and other incentives to private-sector investors, while multilateral development institutions can help steer governments and private investors through the difficult commercial and cost-sharing negotiations for public-private partnerships. Managing the debt component of these projects can benefit from swap arrangements to alleviate foreign exchange risk. Raising standards of quality and maintenance Just as important as the extent of infrastructure is its quality. Except for railways, Asia also lags in this respect. A recent study, based on the World Economic Forum\u2019s business survey, which rates infrastructure giving a maximum score of 7 points, found Asia to be 1.9 points behind the G7 countries (Table V-4). Asia\u2019s weakest performance is in electricity for which it is furthest behind the global average. Among Asia\u2019s sub-regions, East Asia ranks the highest and South Asia the lowest. Nevertheless, some countries in the region perform well. Singapore\u2019s ratings for ports and air transport, for example, are close to the maximum score of 7.6 The quality of infrastructure is also affected by the commitment to repairs and maintenance. Older infrastructure may decay and eventually fall into disuse \u2013 and will be particularly vulnerable at times of disaster. This is usually because governments are more interested in building new infrastructure, for which they can claim credit, than in maintaining assets created by previous administrations. Moreover, while new major infrastructure is typically created by the central government, the task of maintenance generally falls to local administrations which have fewer financial or human resources to fulfil this responsibility. High- quality infrastructure does not necessarily require sophisticated technology; more important is that it should be simple to maintain. Low-quality infrastructure will disproportionately affect the poor, who are, for example, the main victims of fatalities occurring on poor quality roads. Also, there is a vast gap in quality between urban and rural areas \u2013 and the resulting quality of social services, including water supply, education and health. As a consequence, progress on the MDGs has slowed in rural areas. In many countries, most of infrastructure investment related to the MDGs is likely to come from the public sector. But this can only be effective if it is accompanied by reforms in governance and also by efforts to increase capacity, especially in local government in countries that have achieved extensive decentralization. Another priority is fighting corruption. Governments can increase transparency by using competitive bidding rules, widely publicizing project information, using automated e-billing systems, and subjecting projects to random quality checks. They will also need to improve qualification and certification in the construction industry and enforce regulations more strictly.

They can also participate in appraisals and audits and in collecting fees and charges. In some cases, this can be accompanied by increasing involvement of NGOs \u2013 in such areas as developing water supplies, solid waste disposal, and school and health facilities. With relatively low overheads NGOs may be able to work at lower costs. Infrastructure investment decisions also need to be well coordinated \u2013 for example, planning rural road networks along with main arterial roads. This will also mean investing simultaneously in both hardware and software \u2013 ensuring, for example, that a water supply facility will subsequently have operating staff. This may be achieved through investment coordination boards \u2013 which can also ensure that road projects allow adequately for maintenance costs, and that electricity schemes build maintenance costs into power tariffs. In order to track progress, it will be important to establish appropriate indicators. Most of those commonly used, such as the percentage of the population with access to safe water, measure outcomes. Tracking investment, however, will need more and better indicators of outputs, such as the length of water and drainage pipes installed. building greener infrastructure It will also be important for future investment in basic infrastructure to pay much closer attention to the environmental impact \u2013 and the implications of climate change.

This can bring benefits not just to the local economy but also for health and the environment by reducing the use of wood burning stoves. Nevertheless some power sources, such as large hydropower projects, have often had serious consequences both for the environment and for local communities. Other forms of infrastructure can have less obvious environmental implications. Thus piped water supply in urban areas will have the environmental benefit of reducing groundwater extraction but would also require better waste water treatment as greater water flows add to pollution through drainage systems. More attention must be given to services that maximize equitable socio-economic benefits, while minimizing environmental impacts and the use of resources. Governments will want to enhance the complementarities between basic infrastructure investment and environmental protection and minimize the conflicts. Investment in low-income housing, for example, will not be a green initiative without adequate water supplies and sanitation. In fact, there are many promising green options. For example, public transport systems that are well planned and integrated with non- motorized transport can reduce costs for the urban poor while establishing cities on trajectories of green growth. This will also mean promoting the use of green energy and technology along with energy conservation and demand management.

It is also important however, that the physical links between countries are accompanied by harmonization of standards such as railway signalling systems or customs codes. All these would contribute to faster poverty reduction and progress on the MDGs. One model for Kyrgyzstan, for example, shows that regional cooperation on integration projects for transport, transit and facilitation would nearly double the incomes of the poor.9 At the regional level, governments should press ahead with agreements for pan-Asian connectivity \u2013 through, for example, an Asian Infrastructure Fund and other aspects of a regional financial architecture, and a pan- Asian Infrastructure Forum for sharing the experience with cross-border projects. Cooperation between countries in exchanging knowledge and best practices can also play an important role in helping expand access to basic infrastructure. Tilting the balance In recent years countries across the region have made some progress in building new infrastructure. Seen through an MDG lens, however, the results can at best be considered patchy \u2013 with futuristic new airports and smart private hospitals on one side and potholed rural roads and crumbling village health clinics on the other. The challenge now is to change the criteria of success \u2013 to achieve higher standards of basic infrastructure that can underpin the Millennium Development Goals. As the MDG target date of 2015 approaches, it seems likely that the picture across Asia and the Pacific for the Goals themselves is also likely be mixed \u2013 some disappointing failures, some narrow misses, and some striking successes. But the final MDG story is yet to be told. All countries still have five years to choose the most promising paths \u2013 and tilt the balance decisively on the side of success.

The comparison between these three global regions is encapsulated in Figure A-1 for six indicators. In these charts, the size of the bubbles is in proportion to the population currently affected (on a logarithmic scale). The sloping line divides each chart into two parts: if the bubble is above the line, since 1990 the values on that indicator have increased; below the line they have decreased. The colours correspond to those of the on- or off-track progress symbols. The remainder of this appendix discusses for some key indicators where progress so far has fallen short for the targets to be met by 2015, and what is required in terms of deviation from current trends to still do so. It then provides estimates on the extent of reduced human suffering resulting from the accelerated progress and the achievement of the goals. Achievements in $1.25/day poverty Figure A-2 illustrates the differences in the progress among countries in reducing extreme income poverty. The arrows represent the percentage of population living below $1.25 (PPP) per day in the latest year for which data are available. The other end of the line represents the data point for the earliest year since 1990. Data on these and other indicators are provided in Tables A-6 through A-13 in this appendix. In the early 1990s, every six to seven out of 10 persons in China, Turkmenistan, Viet Nam, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal were living on less than $1.25 per day. Whereas the first four of these countries managed to reduce the prevalence of poverty to fewer than six to seven out of 10 persons, and have in the meantime reached the poverty reduction target, Bangladesh and Nepal progressed much slower and still have poverty rates of around 50 per cent. On the other hand, countries such as the Philippines, India and Lao PDR had somewhat lower poverty rates in the early 1990s, have made even slower progress. Thus extreme poverty in these countries remains prevalent. Whereas at the same time, in a number of Central Asian countries such as Georgia and Uzbekistan poverty rates actually increased. The greatest challenge is for Uzbekistan, which needs to reduce poverty by 2.5 percentage points per year to reach the target; this rate is lower than the historical rate achieved by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5331a156-19e8-44a9-b7c1-87a6c5602728": {"__data__": {"id_": "5331a156-19e8-44a9-b7c1-87a6c5602728", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72dbe0cc7b21e060cf477745ae85e960d41ccf3ad9535b71a108d7127ef8ac93"}, "3": {"node_id": "b9120e08-134a-4389-8cd1-f7313348426d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a0a58e7da56f0cbacfa89a3ce81a5d4e539c8462c2b6f6563c603e42d55fea1"}}, "hash": "f364d08482d4892ccd13d0ad9313bdf7ab974b3947c37d7ee643f6a2f3d98a4f", "text": "six of the 11 early achievers and on track countries. Table A-1 also illustrates the scale of opportunity to reduce human deprivation if currently off track countries still manage to hit the target. On present trends, the currently off track countries would be home to 577 million poor in 2015. This figure would be reduced by 163 million (or 28 per cent) if the countries manage to accelerate progress to the required rate of progress (including reversing the trend for the regressing countries). The contribution of 131 million to this reduction in regional total by India is particularly notable. Achievements in primary enrolment There were only four countries (out of the 32 with data) in the early 1990s with net primary enrolment rates of less than 70 per cent: Bhutan, Pakistan, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste; the progress on current trends of each of these countries is too slow for the target to be reached by 2015. Perhaps even more worrying is the situation in the Marshall Islands, which saw primary enrolment rates regress from well over 80 per cent to below 70 per cent. These Pacific Island countries, together with Pakistan, face the greatest challenge to still meet the target by 2015, having to increase primary enrolment by at least three percentage points per year. On current trends, almost 17 million children in off track countries would not be attending school in 2015; this number would be reduced to almost four million, a difference of 13 million if the off track countries manage to hit the target by 2015. The payoff of Pakistan reaching the target would be tremendous. On present trends, the country would have over seven million children out of school in 2015. This number would be reduced by 5.6 million if Pakistan is able to achieve the target.

As can be seen, as many as 892 million people in the Asian-Pacific region are projected to remain in extreme income poverty if current trends continue, including both countries that have made progress and reached the target as well as those that are off track. Accelerated progress in the off track countries alone would reduce the poverty rates in these countries by as much as 28 per cent, or as much as 18 per cent of all the poor in the entire region, compared to the scenario of business as usual. Similarly, if accelerated progress takes place in expanding primary enrolment in the off track countries, as many as 13 million additional children in these countries would have access to primary education, about half of the children who would remain out of school in the whole region if current trends continue. Impact of the global economic slowdown As shown so far, unless accelerated progress takes place, quite a number of countries will miss the target in 2015. The general view is that the challenge to reach the targets in these countries has been compounded by the global economic crisis that started in 2008. Since the most recent year for which data are available in the global MDG database is 2008, it is only possible to project the likely impact of the economic slowdown on the progress towards achieving the MDGs. Such projections, however, have their own difficulties. Chief among such difficulties is an accurate understanding of the determinants, including economic growth, of the various MDGs. Human development outcomes are influenced by a wide range of factors, including initial social and geographical conditions, policy interventions and, indeed, economic growth. Despite such constraints, it is possible to explore how progress towards achieving the MDGs might be different in the context of the global economic crisis. To the extent that economic growth can create the necessary conditions for achieving the human development outcomes, such projections can provide an indication of how the progress towards various goals might be impacted. 43 MDG PRIORITIES In ASIA AnD THE PACIFIC STATISTICAl APPEnDIx Figure A-4 \u2013Progress in expanding access to basic sanitation Source: Staff calculations based on the United Nations MDG database.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4436c013-6fad-4c55-ad75-486c0e30cf3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4436c013-6fad-4c55-ad75-486c0e30cf3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2010/2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17d0cebdba14237fdf098bd0b0d951202606f4c6706b0781ac9754bbd0ba56b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "be05c36c-3397-4531-bc35-a7af6a42aaf0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2010/2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b240144e559a9427bdd5236d07886c223816845dc91b4619e22f897d6509ae23"}}, "hash": "c3c69956051630bc8b0893fe0adb6d1f3532ce2fa873b9d46079605d8baea701", "text": "| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Cambodia Nepal India Lao PDR Kiribati Pakistan Afghanistan Micronesia (F.S.)
