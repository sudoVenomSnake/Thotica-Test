These instruments are all geared toward upholding the right of women everywhere to reproductive and sexual freedom, health and dignity. Due to 11 CHAPTER 02 | Overview: HIV and Women in the Asia-Pacific Region the gender and social norms that circumscribe women\u2019s options and behaviour in much of the region, however, it is not uncommon for the sexual and reproductive rights of HIV-positive women to be abused. Abuses include: forced abortion and sterilization of HIV-positive women; denying positive women access to labour and delivery and other health care services; denying positive women access to contraception including barrier methods; an ongoing lack of female-controlled HIV prevention methods; and community disapproval for having sexual relationships and/or bearing children when HIV- positive (http://www.icw.org/files/SRHR-ICW%20 fact%20sheet-06.doc ). The Inter-agency Task Team on the Prevention of HIV Infection in Pregnant Women, Mothers and Children developed a global strategy for universal access to prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT). The strategy provides guidance on the standard of care for providing these services, urging the adoption of a comprehensive package of care based on the United Nation\u2019s four elements strategy that links and integrates maternal, newborn and child health care services. It gives priority to HIV-positive pregnant women needing access to these services. It also notes the importance of male involvment in protecting these rights. It encourages couples counselling as a means to improve the use of family planning, increase HIV testing and counselling, facilitate disclosure of HIV status, and improve adherence to treatment. This is a critical element in family centered care, which integrates care for the benefit of the family and includes services such as nutritional support, child health, and family planning services (The Inter-agency Task Team on Prevention of HIV Infection in Pregnant Women, Mothers and Children, June 2007). mobility and Trafficking Various factors contribute to women\u2019s increased vulnerability to HIV resulting from mobility and trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region. Generally speaking, economic need drives labor trafficking and internal migration (Azad, n.d.). Push and pull factors account for the high prevalence of trafficking and sex work in Asia. Impoverished or, abused women may be lured or pulled from rural areas to urban centres for opportunities in employment, education, or simply a better life. On the other hand, some women are pushed into mobility to escape an unstable home life, to support or supplement their families\u2019 income, or to avoid an impending forced marriage. Girls who are 12 or 13 years old have told interviewers they were lured by promises of jobs and marriage (Jafri, 2002). According to the Institute of Migration, women account for almost 50 percent of all migrants globally (IOM, 2006). Furthermore, women from Asia make up the largest percentage of unskilled migrants in those countries that receive labour (You and AIDS, 2006). In South and Southeast Asia, members of society most affected by trafficking are those occupying the lowest rungs of the societal ladder (Shah, Brar & Rona, 2002). Although women and girls are trafficked for various purposes such as marriage, sweat shop labour, factory work, domestic work, and construction work, sexual exploitation remains the single largest category of trafficking crime throughout the region.Being in an unfamiliar environment, they are less likely to be able to exert control over protective behaviours such as engaging in sex, choice of partner, and whether a condom or other protection is used. Forced or voluntary removal from home can expose women and girls to more violence, including sexual violence, and other forms of unprotected sex, which in turn increases their vulnerability to HIV (UNAIDS, 2001; UNIFEM, 2004). Though lack of adequate data remains one of the fundamental weaknesses in exploring the linkages between trafficking and mounting appropriate responses, recent study (Jay Silverman et al, 2007) by Harvard School of Public Health in Katmandu show a very strong association between trafficking, HIV and multiple layers of gender inequality.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecd6823b-517e-497e-87d9-7477f2a0baf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecd6823b-517e-497e-87d9-7477f2a0baf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d223da1a186737943e290de204cd11de3143d85b2d881ee7be6f1c4355ba0075"}, "2": {"node_id": "eae9cc81-3f16-48f9-a390-2d79e9576502", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a4a92b3a2abf8ed01ce3f7c190f2f90e18234b323d76cfe8758c0a129ba577b"}}, "hash": "2c66fa89dbf27ac0d01ff4b6070c551032932e097a0041b63e453a88e3602421", "text": "The study showed that about 38 per cent of women trafficked into sex work were found to be HIV-positive.

It was found that each additional month of captivity in brothels increased their risk of HIV infection by 3 to 4 %. Similarly a regional rapid assessment study by UNDP in South Asia (HIV and Human Trafficking, UNDP 2007) showed an alarming trend in trafficking of girls and women, and HIV. In particular, the study recommends greater dialogue and collaboration between the anti- trafficking community and AIDS community, as HIV and human trafficking share many common contextual as well as consequential factors. It also addresses the need for laws, policies and programmes that address both human trafficking and HIV-related issues in a comprehensive, gender-responsive and rights- based manner. Injecting Drug use and Partners of Injecting Drug users Injecting drug users contract HIV mainly by sharing contaminated needles and other drug equipment. To understand the HIV epidemics in the Asia-Pacific region, it is critical to understand the nexus between injecting drug use (IDU), sex work, high numbers of concurrent sexual partnerships and the use (or non-use) of condoms. While drug use brings a risk of HIV infection separate from the risk of HIV transmission though unsafe sex, the nexus between IDU and unsafe sex is thought to be a key driver of the epidemic in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Viet Nam, as well as parts of India. In all of these countries there is an overlap between injecting drug use and sex work, such that male drug users are frequently buyers of sex, female drug users are increasingly selling sex to support their drug use and female sex workers are increasingly injecting drugs (UNAIDS, 2006). Adding fuel to this potentially explosive situation is the infrequent use of condoms in these relationships and the sometimes extreme stigmatization of sex workers and injecting drug users in many, if not most, countries in the region and the criminalization of these behaviors. Harm reduction programmes, including opioid substitution therapy and the exchange of used needles and syringes for clean ones, have been shown to be effective in reducing HIV transmission (Van Den Berg, et al. 2007). For example, Viet Nam is pilot testing a methadone programme for future scaling up. Harm reduction programmes have been acknowledged as an appropriate approach in several countries in the region including India, Laos, Pakistan and Viet Nam. However, budget limits and competing issues prevent widespread application. The illegality of both sex work and IDU presents enormous challenges for meeting the treatment and support needs of injecting drug users living with HIV and their partners. Yet data highlighting the urgency of the problem, and the need to make sex workers who inject drugs a major focus of HIV prevention activities is still inadequate. sex Work In some countries, as many as 15 percent of men in the general population and 44 percent of men in mobile populations reported buying sex in 2004 (MAP, 2005). The recent Commission on AIDS in Asia report (2008) estimates that on average, in Asia, there are ten male clients for every sex worker. This means that the number of clients of sex workers is ten times more than the number of actual sex workers. Given these rates and the relatively high HIV rates among sex workers in the region, a significant proportion of new HIV infections are contracted during paid sex. According to the 2006 UNAIDS annual report, HIV prevalence among female sex workers in Viet Nam increased from 0.06 percent in 1994 to six percent in 2002. In Indonesia, according to the report, the rate of HIV infection among female sex workers is 3.1 percent nationally but varies significantly from region to region; in Jakarta, for example, prevalence reached 6.3 percent in 2003. In China it is estimated that sex workers and their clients account for around 20 percent of the total number of people living with HIV (UNAIDS, 2006). Rates among male sex workers are less well known, since this activity is even more stigmatized and criminalized, but in one city in China health authorities claim that HIV prevalence among male sex workers is as high as five percent. 13 CHAPTER 02 | Overview: HIV and Women in the Asia-Pacific Region As noted above, the increasing use of injecting drugs by sex workers in the region and their clients makes sex workers more vulnerable to HIV. Sex workers also experience relatively high rates of sexually transmitted infections.

Sexually transmitted infections facilitate HIV infection and are often used as proximate indicators for HIV. Violence is also part and parcel of the sex trade for many women. Sex workers in Papua New Guinea regularly experience gang rape \u2013 or line ups \u2013 at the hands of clients or the police. There is important evidence that HIV prevention programmes for sex workers are effective, and that sex workers can be active participants in these programmes. Examples of effective programmes in the region include the Thai 100% Condom Use programme, which has been replicated in a number of countries in the region. The famous Sonagachi project in Kolkata, India also shows how working with sex workers, supporting them to organize to protect each other and themselves, can have a big pay-off in terms of infections prevented (UNAIDS, 2000). Violence Violence is the most extreme form of gender inequality and often stems from gender norms that make male violence against women a socially acceptable way to control an intimate partner. In the context of the HIV epidemic, gender-based violence makes women and others (for example men who have sex with men, in some settings) more vulnerable to infection, reduces their capacity to protect themselves, and reduces their ability to access treatment, care and support. A WHO-sponsored study with data from more than 24,000 women interviewed in 15 sites in 10 countries found that 15 to 71 percent of women reported having experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Women living in more rural settings in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Peru and Tanzania reported the greatest levels of violence (WHO, 2005). In India, 40 percent of women have experienced violence, and half of the 26 percent of women who suffer severe physical abuse report being beaten during pregnancy (ICRW 2001). In Bangladesh, 40 percent of women reported sexual violence by a sexual partner (ICRW, 2002). Violence contributes directly and indirectly to women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV (Maman, 2000; WHO, 2005). Individuals who have been sexually abused are at immediate risk of HIV infection, but they are also more likely to engage in unprotected sex, have multiple partners, and trade sex for money or drugs (Heise, Ellsberg, and Gottemoeller 1999). A Cambodian study found that among 1,000 female and transgendered sex workers, more than 50 percent had experienced violence \u2013 mostly in the form of rape \u2013 at the hands of law enforcement officials (Jenkins et al., 2005). Many of these rapes occurred without the use of a condom, exposing both the perpetrator and victim to higher risk of HIV transmission. In Cambodia, few rapes are reported by victims, often because of fear that the perpetrator might retaliate (LICADHO, 2006). Despite increased recognition of the relationship between HIV and gender-based violence in Cambodia, more emphasis is needed on the relationship between gender-based violence and HIV within the context of marriage (Duvvury & Knoess, 2005). A small Bangladeshi study that examined vulnerability to HIV infection found that in half of the 48 non-sex worker IDUs interviewed for the study, about 20 percent reported having been raped. In half of those cases the perpetrator was their husband (Azim et al., 2006). Violence is thought to be an important contributor to the HIV epidemic in Papua New Guinea, where violence and fear are part of everyday life for many of the poor, particularly in Port Moresby. According to a recent report (Tobias, 2007), sexual violence and rape \u2013 particularly of young women \u2013 is extremely common, in part due to the low status of women, leading to an HIV rate among young women aged 15-19 that is four times higher than the rate among boys in the same age group. The National AIDS Council in Papua New Guinea reports that \u201cpatterns of male sexual behaviour, including a high incidence of rape, line ups [gang rape], sexual assault and weak law enforcement\u201d are important contributors to the epidemic (Human Rights Watch, 2005, cited in Tobias, 2007: 10).

To effectively prevent the spread of HIV and to mitigate the consequences of living with HIV, it is critical to adopt a holistic approach and comprehensively address the factors that increase vulnerability to HIV and to do so on multiple levels and with multiple interventions. There are many opportunities to build on current efforts and create new strategies to improve prevention, care and treatment programmes, policy and research. This section is a compilation of all of the suggested directions for gender- responsive efforts in the Asia-Pacific region that are included in the each of the key topic discussions in Part 4 of the Guide. The number in parentheses after the topic indicates the location of the detailed discussion in Part 4. PREVEnTIon (4.1) Creating an Enabling Environment \ufffd Work towards changing gender norms \ufffd and invest in gender transformative interventions that tackle gender inequality. These include HIV prevention education programmes using community-based, participatory processes that allow for critical analysis and reflection among community members in order to trigger transformations in gender roles and norms. Systematic, wide-scale programming \ufffd\ufffd using proven techniques such as Stepping Stones or other participatory learning and action methodologies to engage communities in meaningful, resolution- oriented debate on the issues (Jewkes et al., 2007). Other examples include the DISHA project, which works directly with youth and communities to transform gender norms and empower young women and young men to live more productively and safely (International Center for Research on Women, 2004).

Community Capacity Enhancement (CCE) is another example of participatory action and learning metrologies with proven success in PNG and Cambodia. Programmes working specifically with \ufffd\ufffd men of various ages to shift expectations and norms around gender and the treatment of women. Two excellent examples are Program H, first developed in Brazil and now adapted for use in India (Pulerwitz et al., 2006); and Men as Partners, developed and tested in South Africa to combat the dual and synergistic epidemics of gender-based violence and HIV (White et al., 2003). These programmes have fostered constructive roles for men in sexual and reproductive health. The challenge now is to take the principles behind these successes and replicate them effectively on a large scale (see Section 4.10 for a fuller discussion of this issue). \ufffd\ufffd Prepare for the introduction of new prevention technologies such as microbicides and vaccines. Demand-side issues: consider marketing microbicides as health and hygiene products rather than putting the emphasis on disease prevention. Supply-side issues: anticipate and plan how to overcome upstream resistance to these products, relating to policy-maker and health 21 CHAPTER 03 | Suggested Directions for Policy and Programmes provider concerns about efficacy, and also their potential resistance to the empowering impact on women these products could have. \ufffd Encourage the use of female initiated HIV \ufffd prevention methods such as the use of the Female Condom. Encourage additional research into improving the products usability or bringing down its cost. \ufffd\ufffd Encourage and fund greater data collection and analysis. There is a need to synchronize data collection efforts among all agencies, improve and expand the scope of collecting data and conduct rigorous analysis to improve the understanding of the epidemic to promote formulations of evidence based policies and programmes. suggested Directions for Policy and Programmes \ufffd The Global HIV Prevention Working Group \ufffd recommends a combination approach to prevention, using a range of evidence-based strategies. By employing all appropriate tools-from delayed sexual activity to condom promotion, from voluntary counselling and testing to programmes for injecting drug users-combination prevention can help reduce new HIV infections and help stop the epidemic. Based on its analysis of the gap between current access to HIV prevention and the level of resources required to reverse the global epidemic, the Working Group has specifically recommended that: \ufffd\ufffd Funding: In 2007, the Working Group suggested that 56 percent of the fund- ing needed to provide a comprehensive response to HIV be spent on prevention efforts. For 2008, estimates now indi- cate $22 billion is needed to scale-up a global, comprehensive response to HIV. Although global spending has increased 12 percent since 2006, the Working Group predicts that only $10 billion will be made available for HIV programs in developing countries (Global HIV Preven- tion Working Group, 2007). \ufffd\ufffd Scale-Up: Prevention scale-up must be a central priority, focusing on cost-effec- tive, high-impact interventions, including behaviour change programmes, volun- tary counselling and testing, STI control, condom promotion and prevention of parent-to-child transmission, among other proven strategies. \ufffd\ufffd Prevention and Treatment: Prevention and treatment programmes should be carefully integrated as they are brought to scale. \ufffd\ufffd Capacity Building: In addition to fund- ing for prevention interventions, donors should provide extensive additional sup- port to build long-term human capacity and infrastructure. \ufffd\ufffd Policy Reforms and Aid: Policy reforms and international aid should address the social and economic conditions-such as gender inequality, stigma, and poverty- that increase vulnerability to, and facili- tate the rapid spread of, HIV. \ufffd\ufffd Prevention Research: Research into new prevention strategies and technologies should be significantly accelerated. The Commission on AIDS in Asia (2008) classifies all interventions as (i) high-cost/high-impact, (ii) low-cost/ high-impact, (iii) low-cost/low-im- pact, and high-cost/low-impact. The Commission further recommends prioritizing interventions that are proven to be highly effective. Exam- ples of high impact prevention activ- ities include interventions aimed at high- risk behaviour groups and poli- cies/programmes aimed at prevent- ing mother-to-child transmission as well as limiting exposure to HIV risk for women in stable relationships. It is estimated that focussing on these groups can prevent over 80 percent of new HIV infections (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3d01eef-253a-4006-b063-cdc3e14afb34": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3d01eef-253a-4006-b063-cdc3e14afb34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b50c72a332c7514a7572d41f2f9e500920f522727aed8dd757f12dfbcdd5db4d"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb6f63b6-a966-4884-a464-aec656f40745", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c926ae9909574a3ce74926ba07540a1e9ecf4e855c04866eb3970381fdb1bfd3"}}, "hash": "36c2be36e4a2da8c8a81902244f6f1d942447c516dd60e35b1f2a61fec0f2aa6", "text": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 22 \ufffd\ufffd Prevention of parent to child transmission : The integration of PPTCT into sexual, reproductive, maternal and child health and home-based care programmes is the best way to use existing services and providers, and reach the maximum number of people living with or affected by HIV.

The need to respect the human rights of HIV-positive women should be a core component of the curricula.

Promote access for women and girls through the integration of HIV counselling, testing and treatment services with other sexual and reproductive health services. Involve positive women in design, implementation and monitoring of such services. \ufffd undertake a gender assessment to ascertain \ufffd the particular treatment and care barriers faced by women and socially marginalized groups of women living with HIV, including: lesbians, bisexual women and transgender people; sex workers; injecting drug users; female prisoners; women with disabilities; indigenous people; undocumented immigrants, refugees and internally displaced people; and women in conflict situations \u2013 and support these groups to mobilize regular and reliable access to ARVs, adequate training of health care workers who work with HIV- positive women, improved reproductive health services, and the need to include HIV- positive women in the development of HIV prevention, care and treatment programmes. \ufffd Develop programmes that reach out \ufffd to women for counselling, testing and treatment. For example, offer HIV-testing and counselling in a range of settings aside from antenatal clinics such as workplaces, universities and prisons. \ufffd Train and employ HIV-positive women and \ufffd girls, and positive women\u2019s organizations, to promote and distribute ART, and to become pre and post-test counsellors. \ufffd link up testing and treatment facilities \ufffd with existing support groups or encourage new groups to form so that people who test positive can join a group and get support from the start. \ufffd Counselling and Testing: \ufffd Provide training in pre-and post-test \ufffd\ufffd counselling to health personnel in all lo- cations where HIV testing takes place (in- cluding prisons).

Policies can support creative public-private partnerships and linkages (formal or informal) with community-based organizations and/or networks of HIV- positive people. In addition, programmes have been developed to encourage men to engage more actively in the care of family members living with HIV (e.g. Esu-Williams, 2004). Nurture emergence and support contin- \ufffd\ufffd uation of community home-based care programmes. Draw on best practices from the region (notably Cambodia and Thailand) and Africa, where successful partnerships have been forged between the public healthcare services and com- munity-based or faith-based organiza- tions to provide a continuum of care to clients and their families. Ensure linkages between testing, treat- \ufffd\ufffd ment and home-based care. Ensure home-based care programmes \ufffd\ufffd are working with and supporting fam- ily caregivers, linking them to available information, prevention education and equipment. Ensure that home-based care is providing \ufffd\ufffd the support necessary so that education- al opportunities for children \u2013 especially girl children \u2013 are not lost. Foster the participation of men and boys \ufffd\ufffd in home-based care, within the family and the community. \ufffd Promote and protect the property and \ufffd inheritance rights of women affected by HIV and AIDs. Property and asset ownership and control have an empowering effect on women living with and affected by HIV, enhancing their resilience and ability to manage their lives effectively despite their desperate circumstances. Securing women\u2019s property rights can help positive people live with dignity and contain the spread of HIV. In countries where national social \ufffd \ufffd security schemes exist, ensure it reaches marginalized populations, including those infected and affected by HIV. \ufffd\ufffd Address gender norms .

Efforts should be made to harmonize land, marriage, and inheritance laws, and to ensure consistency between those laws, the provisions of the national constitution, and the obligations of the state with respect to international human rights treaties. Finally, legislation promoting the registration of all marriages and joint titling should be areas targeted for reform. \ufffd Advocate for adoption of Gender-sensitive \ufffd legislative Frameworks, Promoting Judicial Capacity and Effective litigation. Even where laws are favourable to women\u2019s concerns, inadequate interpretation and enforcement renders them ineffective. Correcting this situation requires working with those who implement these laws and deliberate legal matters and as well as enhancing the accessibility and effectiveness of the judicial system itself. \ufffd Invest in public awareness and building \ufffd understanding of the issue. Sound laws and gender-sensitive judicial systems must go hand in hand with a high level of public awareness of women\u2019s property and inheritance rights and of how national law or international human rights frameworks can protect and promote those rights. Women themselves often lack adequate knowledge about courts and other legal mechanisms available to defend their rights, as well as the means to employ such mechanisms when needed. Raising awareness of women\u2019s property and inheritance rights is the first step in creating an environment in which women can actively engage with both customary and formal structures to realize and protect their rights. \ufffd Invest in creating temporary shelters and \ufffd accommodation for women and children who are evicted or who may want to leave their residence. This should be done on a priority basis by governments as the need for a safe place to stay makes women vulnerable and open to exploitation. suggested Directions for Programmes \ufffd Replicate and scale up programmes \ufffd such as community-based paralegal services to help women access and realize their rights.

Policyies that encourage decriminalization help to ease the way for the provision of HIV information and services for those involved. These measures should pave the way for an increase in condom use by clients, thereby dramatically reducing the onward transmission of HIV to non-sex worker clients. Promote greater condom use by empowering sex workers and by involving other actors in the sex industry. Many past efforts to encourage condom use by sex workers have targeted information and commodities at the sex workers themselves. This approach can have some success, but given that the ultimate decision about whether or not to use a condom often resides with the male client, condom promotion efforts need to also be targeted directly to the clients themselves. This is especially relevant in countries such as Indonesia and Myanmar where women can be arrested for possession of a condom and in red light areas that experience high turn over of sex workers.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates are extremely high among sex worker populations, and effective screening and prompt treatment of these infections can have a significant impact on HIV transmission risk. It is likely that in the Philippines, for example, widespread, routine STI screening and associated HIV services for sex workers has contributed to slowing the growth of the epidemic there (MAP 2005). The provision of STI services to sex workers provides the additional opportunity of making HIV testing and counselling (including prevention counselling) available. suggested Directions for Programmes \ufffd Respond to the needs of injecting drug \ufffd users within HIV programming for sex workers. Typically programmes to reduce needle-related HIV transmission and sex-related HIV transmission have been developed and implemented separately, or in parallel. However, because there is such an important overlap between these activities, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, and because of the importance of this overlap as a driver of the epidemic here, it is necessary to develop programmes and policies to address the HIV risks associated with these behaviours together.

Because of the complexity of the issue, policies and programmes around trafficking need to be multi-sectoral, integrated and holistic (Shah et al., 2002). They need to address both the issues that drive illegal human trafficking, and the effects of migration that compromise the safety of women. Interventions need to be grounded in legal provisions and macro-economic and social policies that protect human rights and provide poor women (and their families) with assets and legal protections.

Programmes to reduce the HIV vulnerabilities that result from mobility and trafficking must simultaneously work with mobile groups and the local communities with whom they interact. There is a risk that implementing programmes just for mobile populations can easily lead to stigma and discrimination against mobile people, while giving the false impression to those in local communities that they do not have to worry about HIV.

In 2007, women accounted for 24 percent of all HIV positive individuals in Asia, an increase from 19 percent in 2000. As indicated in the 2006 UNAIDS annual update, some promising developments have been made in the fight against the global HIV epidemic, including scaling up the availability of anti-retroviral treatment in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet little progress has been made overall in reducing the spread of HIV in Africa or Asia (UNAIDS, 2006). UNAIDS estimates that only 10 percent or fewer of injecting drug users and other vulnerable populations are benefiting from current prevention interventions in Asia. (Global HIV Prevention Working Group, 2003). Significant structural and socio-economic factors across the region increase women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV infections. These factors include: High poverty levels, with more than 35 \ufffd\ufffd percent of the population living below the poverty line; Low levels of literacy; \ufffd\ufffd Porous borders that facilitate migration and \ufffd\ufffd contribute to human trafficking; High degrees of stigma regarding sex, \ufffd\ufffd sexuality and HIV; Commercial sex and unprotected sex with \ufffd\ufffd multiple concurrent partners; Male resistance to condom use; \ufffd\ufffd High prevalence of sexually transmitted \ufffd\ufffd infections and low status of women, leading to an inability to negotiate safe sex (World Bank, 2007). While the Asia-Pacific region is experiencing various levels of an AIDS epidemic certain patterns of HIV transmission are emerging. For example, HIV infection rates among women across the region are rising and being married is emerging as a key risk factor in many countries (United Nations, 2004). As of early 2003, the most common form of HIV transmission in Indonesia has been from HIV-infected persons (regardless of how they acquired their infection) to their spouses or regular sex partners, and this is likely to continue as the predominant pattern of HIV transmission there (World Health Organization, 2003). India, which bears a staggering HIV burden with an estimated 2.5 million people living with the virus, shows a similar pattern: a large proportion of women with HIV in India appear to have acquired the virus from regular partners who were infected during paid sex. In Nepal, the HIV infection rate among housewives between 2005 and 2006 had risen by 100 percent according to Nepal\u2019s National Centre for AIDS and STDs. In other countries in the region such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Viet Nam, Laos, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka, prevalence is low among the general population but significantly higher among those who engage in high-risk behaviours such as injecting drug use and sex work. As HIV prevalence rises among women of reproductive age in Asia-Pacific, an increasing number of their infants are contracting HIV through parent-to-child transmission. Indeed, the increasing number of children infected with HIV in Asia and the Pacific is alarming: at the end of 2005, there were an estimated 16,000 children living with HIV in Thailand (UNAIDS, WHO, UNICEF, 2006). According to UNICEF, 30,000 babies are born HIV-positive each year in India (UNICEF, 2003). Yet the availability of financial resources, human resources, and health system infrastructure available to promote prevention of parent-to-child transmission (PPTCT) varies greatly across the region (Preble & Piwoz, 2002). 43 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics More and more women in the Asia-Pacific region are infected with and affected by HIV. The epidemiological patterns showing the vulnerability of women in long-term unions and their children suggest that gender roles and gender dynamics play a key role in the epidemic. Dominant gender norms that privilege men\u2019s pleasure, regard sexual violence as normal, and encourage multiple concurrent sexual partnerships as a key expression of masculinity, leave both women and men vulnerable. Thus, any measure to contain the spread of HIV and deal with its effects for both women and men must be based on a critical understanding of gender dynamics, and be prepared to tackle these dynamics head on. Gender-related vulnerabilities must be understood in the broader context of deeply embedded social norms that lie at the heart of women\u2019s inability to deal effectively with the risks and needs created by the epidemic. The role of effective prevention policies cannot be over emphasised. Prevention of HIV infection is far more cost effective for countries than providing treatment and other services to HIV positive individuals and their families.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5390702-8829-4c1e-a0ad-8af2dc718a72": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5390702-8829-4c1e-a0ad-8af2dc718a72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5543d72675f0f8fc427262c89baddaae1ec9d7e4c709cfad859370dcebd0503"}, "2": {"node_id": "dce05bf6-2282-456b-93f2-aadacd62e856", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ad22ecc6b2d57ce14ea780a3a347a2270f45a08e0b9bd52b9ce2a083a0a9064"}}, "hash": "de89e09cfa6f611ac28f5d8451e986571298d06f108f38b7ed2bafa14df13423", "text": "Investing 1 USD in prevention can save up to 8 USD on treatment (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008).

In most societies, gender norms make men responsible for productive activities outside the home while women are expected to be responsible for reproductive and productive activities within the home. Over 25 years of research on women\u2019s roles in development also demonstrates that women have less access to and control over productive resources than men, as evidenced through persistent gender gaps in education, employment, income, ownership of land and Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 44 housing, and access to credit (UN Millennium Project, 2005). Predictably, the inequality that characterizes the social and economic spheres of society is often mirrored in sexual interactions, creating an unequal balance of power in sexual relations. As a result, many women have less control than men over whether, when, where, why, with whom and how sex takes place. This inequality in sexual decision-making is perpetuated by gendered norms of femininity and masculinity that curtail women\u2019s sexual autonomy and expand men\u2019s sexual privilege, place greater emphasis on male pleasure over female pleasure, and cast women in the role of passive recipient rather than active agent. The complex interplay of social and economic gender differences and inequalities, combined with the unequal balance of power in sexual relations that favours men, significantly increases both women\u2019s and men\u2019s vulnerability to HIV. For adolescent girls, age compounds this inequality and the impact of gender norms. In most societies young people have less power to shape their destinies than their older counterparts. Girls are at the bottom of the power totem pole, just when they are experiencing key life transitions such as marriage, initiation into sexual activity (often with older men) and motherhood. Four key gender-related structural factors contribute to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 vulnerability to HIV infection. Prevailing norms of femininity 1. and masculinity In many societies in this region, the ideal of feminine identity and sexuality is to be ignorant about sex, passive in sexual interactions, and to be either virgins or mothers - making it difficult for women to be informed about risk reduction or to proactively negotiate safer sex (Carovano, 1992), and placing them at increased risk of sexual violence (Weiss & Gupta, 1998; Heise & Elias, 1995). Similarly, norms of masculinity that require men to be more knowledgeable and experienced about sex put men, particularly young men, at risk of infection. These norms prevent them from seeking information or admitting a lack of knowledge about sex or protection, and pressure them into experimenting with sex in unsafe ways to prove their manhood (UNAIDS, 1999). Gaps in Education 2. and Access to Information Gender gaps in education, which favour boys in most regions of the world and persist at both the primary and secondary school levels throughout the Asia-Pacific region, are of grave concern in general, and particularly in relation to HIV vulnerability. Recent analysis of survey data among 6,700 respondents in Karnataka in southern India showed that post-secondary education significantly correlated with lower HIV prevalence among girls and women (Becker, ML, et al. 2007). Access to comprehensive information on sex and HIV prevention is also critical, and girls are generally less likely to have access than boys. For example, analysis of data from 23 developing countries found that levels of knowledge about HIV are almost always higher among men than among women, with 75 percent of men on average having accurate knowledge of HIV transmission routes and prevention as compared to roughly 65 percent of women (Gwatkin & Deveshwar-Bahl, 2001). Economic Vulnerability 3. Women\u2019s lack of access to and control over economic assets, such as land and housing, makes them particularly vulnerable in the AIDS epidemic and can fuel a vicious intergenerational cycle of disease and poverty. Without a guarantee of property and inheritance rights, a woman widowed by the AIDS-related death of her partner is at risk of losing her home, inheritance and possessions either because the law of her land does not give her the right to own or inherit land or housing, or because of \u201cproperty grabbing\u201d by relatives and community members.

Control over land and housing can give women greater bargaining power within households, which may translate into greater leverage to negotiate HIV prevention behaviours. In addition, control over land and housing protects women against the risk of domestic violence, thereby indirectly reducing vulnerability to HIV (Panda, 2002). Violence Against Women 4. Violence against women is pervasive (WHO, 2005) and contributes both directly and indirectly to women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV (Maman, 2000). Individuals who have been sexually abused are at immediate risk of HIV infection and are also more likely to engage in unprotected sex, have multiple partners and trade sex for money or drugs (Heise, Ellsberg, & Gottemoeller, 1999). A recent national survey in Bangladesh showed that among married men, those who reported physically abusing their wives were significantly more likely to have reported STI symptoms or diagnosis in the past year than men who did not report violence (Silverman et al., 2007). More importantly, data from around the world also show a significant association between the experience of partner violence and HIV infection. A recent study among women visiting a VCT (voluntary counselling and testing) centre in Bangalore, India found that among those women reporting violence, a majority (67 percent) also reported testing HIV-positive (Chandrasekaran, et al. 2007). These findings corroborate other studies from Africa. Data from a Tanzanian study suggest that for some women, the experience of partner violence could be a strong predictor of HIV. Maman and colleagues (2002) found that among women who sought services at a VCT centre, those who were HIV-positive were 2.6 times more likely to have experienced violence in an intimate relationship than those who were HIV negative. GEnDER-bAsED REsPonsEs To HIV PREVEnTIon \u201cA gender-based response to HIV focuses on how different social expectations, roles, status and economic power of men and women affect and are affected by the epidemic. It analyses gender stereotypes and explores ways to reduce inequalities between women and men so that a supportive environment can be created, enabling both to undertake prevention and cope better with the epidemic\u201d (UNAIDS, 2001) There are three main models for HIV prevention: (1) behaviour change models, which include the controversial \u2018ABC\u2019 campaigns, as well as programmes that encourage safer injecting practices and replacement therapy among drug users; (2) structural models, which include mandating condom use in brothels, harm reduction programming including needle exchange, primary and secondary education for girls, and programmes addressing gender- based violence, gender norms and the economic empowerment of women; (3) medical or technical models, such as expanding HIV testing, adult male circumcision, HIV vaccines and the development of female-controlled methods such as vaginal microbicides. Evidence suggests that the most effective programmes employ a range of these models in strategic combination, based on the specific epidemiological, cultural and social context in question. Behaviour change models. Behaviour change HIV prevention programmes can target individuals, families, communities, entire societies or, ideally, a combination of these levels. Programmes based on these models tend to be message based \u2013 providing information to key populations (or the general population, depending on the nature of the epidemic) to enable people to make healthier behaviour choices. Such programmes should seek to generate individual motivation to avoid risky behaviour, build skills to use prevention commodities appropriately and to negotiate for safer sex or injecting practices of intimate Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 46 partners. They may work at a community level to generate frank and open discussion about sexuality and drug use, and seek to influence gender norms. The social structure factors mentioned above can limit the effectiveness and reach, so they are most effective when used in combination with structural models (HIV Prevention Working Group, November 2007). Structural models. In 2000, the journal AIDS dedicated an entire issue to structural factors, defined as \u201cphysical, social, cultural organizational, community, economic, legal or policy aspects of the environment that impede or facilitate persons\u2019 efforts to avoid HIV infection\u201d (Sumartojo et al., 2000).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b6de3f9-713c-47e3-a877-e432f93b6d17": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b6de3f9-713c-47e3-a877-e432f93b6d17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8fb8ba6c09e3ef012c31cc634de34ec07e30984a259eaeda8dfcab171765f3b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ca991b6-e5b4-43a1-9b21-b4ca380df5b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9ed0aa7eaab684afae9e5aaddcf149116099ae510b48f8ab618352f5773d240"}}, "hash": "f50c29d0495b8ced073047a951880cb12978561baae21470f434dd3cddfbee49", "text": "The same volume suggested that structural factors may act \u201cas barriers to or facilitators of an individual\u2019s HIV-prevention behaviours\u201d and have a direct bearing on \u201can individual\u2019s ability to avoid exposure to HIV\u201d (Sumartojo, 2000).

Instituto Promundo in Brazil, for example, has worked to change gender norms and attitudes among socially marginal groups of boys (Horizons, 2004); and the \u2018Stepping Stones\u2019 project in sub-Saharan Africa has worked with groups of young people to elicit change in gender relations. Medical or technical models. Given the AIDS epidemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on women, there is a critical need to develop prevention options that women can use with, or when necessary without, their partner\u2019s knowledge. Improving prevention options for women requires both broadening current prevention strategies and developing new technologies that enhance women\u2019s ability to protect themselves. As part of a comprehensive prevention package, microbicides and expanded access to improved female condoms would dramatically enhance women\u2019s ability to protect themselves from HIV (Global Coalition on Women and AIDS, 2005). There have been recent trials and discourses on using male circumcision in the prevention of HIV, and WHO and UNAIDS recommend that circumcision be added to the current list of interventions to reduce the spread of HIV, particularly in the context of a generalized or generalizing epidemic (perhaps less relevant in those Asia/Pacific countries where the epidemics remain concentrated) (WHO/UNAIDS, 2007). Given the global health imperative of curbing the AIDS epidemic, it is especially vital to rapidly introduce new HIV prevention methods after they prove effective in trials, and avoid delays in making lifesaving health interventions available to those who need them in poor countries (Global HIV Prevention Working Group, 2006). HIV testing plays a critical role in comprehensive HIV prevention programming by linking behavioural interventions (and other HIV prevention services) with HIV and AIDS care and treatment. HIV counselling and testing and referral programmes need to be integrated as part of a comprehensive strategy for HIV prevention (Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum, 2003). The expansion of HIV testing is increasingly heralded as an important innovation in HIV prevention, often linked to programmes offering provider-initiated testing, as opposed to client-initiated efforts (WHO/ UNAIDS, 2007). The gender effects of provider- initiated testing are not yet known, and need further investigation as such programmes roll out, but could include positive and negative effects. Potential positive effects would include more men being tested \u2013 and being tested before their wives or long-term partners. This could benefit women, who otherwise are often the first to be tested (often in the context of antenatal care) and consequently are often blamed for \u2018bringing\u2019 the infection into the home. However, there is a danger that if provider-initiated testing programmes do not include comprehensive, one-on-one counselling with these men, they could increase negative consequences for women, such as violence, abandonment and stigmatization. A common theme among communities and nations that have recorded prevention successes is the necessity of a \u2018combination\u2019 approach; this means multiple interventions and modalities, 47 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics including interventions targeting those at high risk and broad campaigns for general awareness (Valdiserri et al., 2003).

Another example is the Inner Spaces Outer Faces Initiative (ISOFI) which worked with staff designing and implementing programmes at various levels, and uses reflective practices and participatory learning and action (Kambou et al., 2007).

By employing all appropriate tools-from delayed sexual activity to condom promotion, from voluntary counselling and testing to programmes for injecting drug users-combination prevention can reduce new HIV infections and help stop the epidemic. Based on its analysis of the gap between current access to HIV prevention and the level of resources required to reverse the global epidemic, the Working Group has specifically recommended that: Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 48 \ufffd\ufffd Funding: In 2007, the Working Group suggested that 56 percent of the funding needed to provide a comprehensive response to HIV be spent on prevention efforts. For 2008, estimates now indicate $22 billion is needed to scale-up a global, comprehensive response to HIV. Although global spending has increased 12 percent since 2006, the Working Group predicts that only $10 billion will be made available for HIV programs in developing countries (Global HIV Prevention Working Group, 2007). \ufffd\ufffd Scale-Up: Prevention scale-up must be a central priority, focusing on cost-effective, high-impact interventions, including behaviour change programmes, voluntary counselling and testing, STI control, condom promotion and prevention of parent-to-child transmission, among other proven strategies. \ufffd\ufffd Prevention and Treatment: Prevention and treatment programmes should be carefully integrated as they are brought to scale. \ufffd\ufffd Capacity Building: In addition to funding for prevention interventions, donors should provide extensive additional support to build long-term human capacity and infrastructure. \ufffd\ufffd Policy Reforms and Aid: Policy reforms and international aid should address the social and economic conditions-such as gender inequality, stigma, and poverty-that increase vulnerability to, and facilitate the rapid spread of, HIV. \ufffd\ufffd Prevention Research: Research into new prevention strategies and technologies should be significantly accelerated. ClAssIFyInG HIV InTERVEnTIons by CosT AnD ImPACT The Commission on AIDS in Asia (2008) classifies all interventions as (i) high-cost/ high-impact, (ii) low-cost/high-impact, (iii) low-cost/low-impact, and high-cost/ low-impact. The Commission further recommends prioritizing interventions that are proven to be highly effective. Examples of high impact prevention activities include interventions aimed at high- risk behaviour groups and policies/ programmes aimed at preventing mother-to-child transmission as well as limiting exposure to HIV risk for women in stable relationships. It is estimated that focussing on these groups can prevent over 80 percent of new HIV infections (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008). \ufffd\ufffd Prevent parent to child transmission : The integration of PPTCT into sexual, reproductive, maternal and child health and home-based care programmes is the best way to use existing services and providers, and reach the maximum number of people living with or affected by HIV. Comprehensive, quality facility services are the foundation of a successful PPTCT programme. However, they must be linked to community-based resources and initiatives for maximum coverage and impact-especially home-based care, faith-based programmes, traditional practitioners, PLWHA support groups and adolescent-friendly services and information (Israel & Kroeger, 2003).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f69df36-c8b5-4ff0-8c00-5c77ad11620d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f69df36-c8b5-4ff0-8c00-5c77ad11620d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "731c5b315fbdfd20032532bcac56cb9f1d3086aa5ee082abe1653acb8ae54ea1"}, "2": {"node_id": "316dc8e1-1c2f-4ec6-8714-550e9062feb6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e426b06d10ef0ca46e03ee6ba8e4d0a841651df5cec5a2498335d21d6ca85cf"}}, "hash": "e188aa17974f1dd7f63d5f6822d3b495e8f1a873f8fb1d637cd99cebd526d417", "text": "The United Nations recommends a three-pronged approach for effective PPTCT: Preventing infection in women of \ufffd\ufffd reproductive age; Preventing unwanted pregnancies in \ufffd\ufffd HIV-positive women; and Offering PPTCT prevention interventions \ufffd\ufffd to women who are both HIV-infected and pregnant. 49 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics \ufffd Tailor HIV prevention messaging and \ufffd programming to meet actual needs and match actual behaviour with a focus on \u2018healthy sexuality\u2019 rather than disease prevention, including: Peer education on safer sexuality, geared \ufffd\ufffd toward frank, open, honest and fun discussion around sex and how to make it safer; and Peer groups including heterosexual \ufffd\ufffd women, heterosexual men, as well as groups of self-identified homosexual men and women, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1fee2bae-7fde-4f17-921c-f0bda6e777e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1fee2bae-7fde-4f17-921c-f0bda6e777e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ee490da4bccf3049279086271dabad91befa27bd8f210c34960f833cbeee84a"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e34e023-e831-4db8-a48f-70a3c6418371", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e1f8c41f46386219740807bac82841c8aa78a66124392f9eb53369b78aa38ca"}}, "hash": "cedf76a283e2964bf14d166879c56e7cf46eae7a2f93fc271ec2a99f8505751a", "text": "other sexual minorities.

Similarly, the integration of treatment with primary care, STI diagnosis and treatment, family planning and other reproductive health services forms part of a comprehensive package that in turn responds to the multiple needs of men and women and helps remove the stigma of stand-alone services. Where integration of services is not possible, referral systems can be made linking primary care (including antenatal, family planning and general outpatient clinics) to VCT and other relevant HIV/AIDS services. oVERVIEW oF THE IssuE Indeed in this region, as elsewhere in the world, women and girls are increasingly at the centre of the epidemic. While the prevalence among men is still higher than among women in most populations in Asia-Pacific, this is beginning to change. The percent of HIV positive women has risen from 19 in 2000 to 24 in 2007 (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008). In China, HIV prevalence among women has grown from 25 percent in 2002 to 39 percent in 2004, and exceeds one percent among pregnant women (UNAIDS, 2006). In Thailand, around 70 percent of the young people now living with HIV are girls and women between the ages of 15-24 (UNICEF, 2005). Since 2003, women account for 47 percent of the new infections in Fiji, according to the Ministry of Health. Recent figures from India indicate that 40 percent of people living with HIV in India are women (NACO, 2006). The increasing number of women living with HIV underscores the critical need to ensure access to healthcare and HIV-specific treatment for women and girls, including counselling and testing, and anti-retroviral treatment (ART). WHO\u2019s 2001 announcement of its global \u201c3 by 5\u201d initiative (to provide ART to three million people living with HIV by 2005), marked the beginning of treatment scale-up in many countries. Thailand, which began a large-scale ART programme in 2000, is on its way to universal access to treatment. In April of 2004 the Government of India launched a free ART programme and phased scale-up has begun. In Indonesia and Myanmar, there is high political and administrative commitment to start ART programming, and treatment programmes are rolling out. Viet Nam, which is one of the 15 priority PEPFAR countries1, currently has 10,500 people on ART, and an additional 700 women receiving treatment to prevent parent-to-child transmission of HIV (see http://www.pepfar.gov/ pepfar/press/81650.htm for PEPFAR\u2019s Viet Nam country profile). Review of the gains and limitations of the 3 by 5 campaign led to the current \u2018Universal Access\u2019 initiative. In September 2005, the UN General Assembly member states committed to develop and implement national HIV/AIDS plans leading to universal access to treatment by 2010. The main objective of the Universal Access initiative is to formulate comprehensive, integrated plans for the scale-up of prevention, treatment, care and support. Despite these initiatives, WHO estimates there is a huge gap between the need and availability of ART in the Asia-Pacific region. According to one report, nearly 900,000 people living with HIV in the Southeast Asia sub-region urgently need antiretroviral treatment but barely seven 1 PEPFAR stands for the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the largest HIV/AIDS aid programme in the world. It was first described in the 2003 State of the Union Address in which President G.W. Bush asked Congress to \u201ccommit $15 billion over the next five years, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS\u2026\u201d The program, which strongly emphasizes treatment, has 15 focus countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, but also including Guyana, Haiti and Viet Nam. See www.pepfar.gov for more information. 57 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics percent of them are receiving it. Four countries, namely India, Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand, account for an overwhelming majority of the antiretroviral treatment gap (WHO, 2004). Access to ART varies significantly across the region and between men and women. It is estimated that, on average, women make up less than 40 percent of those accessing ART in the region (UNAIDS, 2006). However, the number of new infections among women is steadily rising. As long as access to ART is not universal, diligence will be necessary to ensure that the number of women receiving ART corresponds to the percentage they represent in the population of people requiring that treatment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df6b3be4-18d9-4944-a43e-48d3acf4b550": {"__data__": {"id_": "df6b3be4-18d9-4944-a43e-48d3acf4b550", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9fd8c2cc06d26856ea7c871f5b4565cb835d8b2fc2b2ae7a38ed3ee4ca9969be"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4f878d6-b7b7-498f-93bd-0ae5314daf01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "255cda7ed3dcff437b389b0784c64d54ca429b7fa2772e687470021def7e4c1e"}}, "hash": "4b2d5696befcaad045865cb00959f2ecd33e1829b2cb6ed76cb0c0c54b734f23", "text": "Gender inequalities underlie many of the factors that constrain women\u2019s access to treatment.

Therefore, the test may take place without counselling or the consent of the woman involved. If the test result is positive, the woman may be blamed for bringing HIV into the family. This is the case even when the husband is known to be positive. This can result in rejection or violence towards women by their spouses or in-laws (Paxton & Welbourn, 2004). Fear of their partner\u2019s reaction was reported by women in Tanzania as the most common barrier to disclosure (Maman et al., 2001). A recent study on the links between women\u2019s property rights and HIV in South Asia (Swaminathan, Bhatla & Chakraborty, 2007) documented that disclosure of status often results in both violence in the marital home and the eviction of HIV-positive women. Gender-related differences in health seeking behaviour between men and women can also affect treatment access. Such differences have been reported from a survey on the socio- economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India (UNDP, NACO, NCAER, 2006). With regard to opportunistic infections, men reported more episodes of illness being treated than did women. Only 4.4 percent of the illness episodes in men were left untreated, while for women the rate was double, at 9.7 percent. The same study reported that the primary reason women did not seek treatment was financial constraints, followed by lack of family support for seeking treatment. Constraints on women\u2019s mobility also limit their ability to access even free treatment. Women may be required to obtain permission (and often accompaniment) from a husband, in- law or parent in order to seek health care, a task especially difficult if women have not disclosed their HIV status (ICW, 2004). Efforts to improve access and adherence to treatment will also require tackling prevailing gender norms that create the barriers to access, particularly the stigmatization of HIV-positive women. Research in India and Viet Nam has revealed that stigma and discrimination against HIV-positive people and those perceived to be infected are common in hospitals and act as a barrier to seeking and receiving critical treatment and care services (UNAIDS 2001; HORIZONS 2007). Particularly vulnerable to stigma are marginalised groups such as sex workers and injecting drug users. Research on the services available for HIV-positive drug users found that women reported that available services did not adequately support their specific needs. Many expressed feelings of being invisible and discriminated against, even within the community of people living with HIV. These women also articulated their concerns about disclosing their HIV status and drug use to existing or new partners, family and friends, their children, colleagues and employers (ICW, 2006). Prevention of parent-to-child transmission (PPTCT) is, or should be, an important component of any HIV treatment programme. An unfortunate consequence of this is that women living with HIV have been reproached as \u2018vectors of HIV transmission\u2019 (De Bruyn 2002). They sometimes experience pressure from health care providers not to become pregnant, and those who do, may be coerced into having abortions, or may feel pressure to use PPTCT measures such as giving birth via a caesarean section and not breastfeeding their babies. Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 58 Yet in communities where breastfeeding is the norm, women may fear that if they avoid breastfeeding, others will assume that they are HIV-positive. This perception often prohibits women from adhering to PPTCT regimes. Efforts to integrate general reproductive health care services with PPTCT efforts are increasingly seen as a way to improve access to treatment. Access to treatment involves not only access to ARVs, but also empowering women with knowledge about their rights, choices around contraception, condom negotiation and safe delivery practices- all of which are key goals of enhanced reproductive health. A recent WHO press release on the situation in the Asia-Pacific region, quoted a UNFPA HIV adviser as saying: \u201cLinking HIV prevention efforts with reproductive healthcare can strengthen and improve access to both.

Ensuring that men play a more positive role in women\u2019s efforts to access needed services will also be key (Askew & Marge, 2003). Other factors also create significant barriers to effective access. For example, food security is an important aspect of treatment because many anti-retroviral (ARV) medications must be taken with food and because good nutrition is critical for maintaining overall good health. Poor health associated with opportunistic infections and other health problems related to having HIV force many women to abandon or decrease income generation activities. Transportation to and from health care visits often presents a difficult hurdle for women in need of treatment. These economic constraints create formidable barriers to adherence to treatment regimens among women. In a cultural context where it is often unacceptable for women to address a man directly, as is common across the Asia-Pacific region, particular consideration of these issues in providing treatment services in a manner that meets the needs of women is critical. Women often are not asked for their consent before HIV testing and sometimes do not even know they are being tested for HIV or are not given their test results. A study in India on HIV- related discrimination, found that many women experienced discrimination in health care settings. Over half of the women interviewed said they did not receive counselling before testing for HIV, and those who were coerced into testing were more likely to be denied care (Paxton et al., 2005). moVInG ToWARD GEnDER-EquITAblE TREATmEnT PPTCT programmes and integrating HIV/AIDS services with other public health services, including reproductive and sexual healthcare, are two important components of an effective gender-responsive treatment programme. Such programmes must also address the gender- 59 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics related barriers and stigma that continue to stand in the way of women\u2019s access to testing and treatment. Governments, health facilities, NGOs and faith- based organizations now have access to a number of successful strategies2,3 and tools4 to address stigma and, with the involvement of people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA), to take these efforts to scale. These strategies reduce stigma by addressing the three drivers of stigma that are consistent across contexts and susceptible to immediate action: (1) lack of awareness and knowledge about stigma and discrimination and their harmful effects; (2) fear of HIV infection through casual contact with infected people because of lack of information and knowledge about the real means of transmission; and (3) the mindset that links HIV positive people with behaviours considered improper or immoral. Incorporating stigma reduction activities in HIV- related programming is likely to enhance the effectiveness of prevention, care and treatment efforts. sTIGmA, DIsCRImInATIon AnD TREATmEnT ACCEss In Asia, stigma reduction interventions using these methodologies have been conducted in India5 and Viet Nam at both the institutional and community levels. The interventions have demonstrated that it is possible to improve attitudes towards people living with HIV and AIDS and decrease discriminatory behaviours. In addition to addressing stigma, it is also important to provide counselling at all stages (including at the beginning of ARV treatment), to inform clients of their rights and obligations, and to help support effective long-term adherence (Attawell & Mundy, 2003; CHANGE, 2004). Sensitization and meaningful involvement of the community will also be critical in ensuring access and adherence to treatment. WHO and UNAIDS have highlighted the need for community preparedness for ART (Obermeyer, 2003), emphasizing that, unless approaches are informed by local conditions and an understanding of community culture, beliefs and behaviours related to illness, programmes could face unanticipated community responses. Myths, misperceptions and fears about ART generated within a community can spread quickly, resulting in low treatment uptake, adherence problems and/or people dropping out of treatment programmes. These myths and misperceptions may especially impact women, as has been shown in relation to uptake of PPTCT efforts in Botswana and Zambia (Rutenbery et al., 2002). Communication about all aspects of HIV, including treatment options, is essential. Women and men must understand how HIV is transmitted and where they can go for testing and treatment.

PRomIsInG PRACTICEs The importance of involving the community in ensuring access to treatment and moving towards a supportive environment has been tried in certain programmatic efforts. UNDP has rolled out a large-scale effort in Cambodia. This effort works with 44 communes to mainstream HIV in partnership with the provincial rural development committee, improve delivery of services to those with HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), develop outreach health and HIV services, and train communities and groups to provide services. As part of Cambodia\u2019s Leadership for Results programme, groups tried several approaches to support treatment efforts. One group set up support visits to a village of 60 people, which is made up only of people living with HIV (UNDP 2004). Another group organized an inter-regional ARV referral system for provinces where these drugs are not available, and set up a housing system for people who travel to Siem Reap for treatment. This programme treated over 150 people at its inception. The box below gives details of a programme in which communities reached out to people living with HIV, reducing stigma, increasing acceptance and enabling treatment. Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 62 CommunITIEs REACHInG ouT To PlWHA: ExPERIEnCEs FRom CAmboDIA In Cambodia, where people are still recovering from the trauma of the Khmer Rouge regime, community conversations enhancement (CCE) have brought villagers together to provide emotional support for each other in the face of another crisis: HIV/AIDS. For people who are still learning to trust each other again, who formerly regarded HIV/AIDS as a shameful, taboo subject, and who were not accustomed to speaking openly about sex and gender, CCE has produced an enormous shift in attitudes. It has been implemented in seven provinces so far, and plans are underway to bring the methodology to twice as many communities and to incorporate it into the national strategy on HIV/AIDS. Reacting on Cambodia\u2019s greatest successes, Daouda Diouf, who helped implement CCE there, spoke of a new link between communities and health care providers. People in villages where community conversations have taken place are now asking themselves, \u201cWhat can we do to help people who are undergoing treatment for HIV and AIDS?\u201d With the help of health care workers who have participated in the conversations, these communities have set up support systems for villagers returning from hospitals to help them remain vigilant in taking their ARV medications. According to Diouf, this is an important achievement, because many people who formerly shunned PLWHA now actively support them. Support for PLWHA has taken many forms. In Battambang, a monk\u2019s temple is being used as a centre for care and support. In addition to food and counselling, monks offer spiritual support, an important element in this deeply religious country. Furthermore, in every community Diouf encountered villagers contributed money after the sessions to support PLWHA and their families or to pay for testing. Finally, and perhaps most important, in places where revealing one\u2019s positive status formerly meant encountering stigma and discrimination, community members now reach out to HIV-positive people\u2013literally. \u201cPeople were hugging them,\u201d said Diouf, referring to a meeting at which several HIV-positive individuals came forward to tell their stories. Communities are also ensuring that future generations and neighbouring villages can learn from their successes. They have developed their own methods of documenting the community conversations process, including written stories, songs and maps of the changes they have undergone. By tracking this evolution, they preserve a record for themselves and provide important lessons for other communities. This documentation also provides a basis for scaling up the process to other communities and regions. Cambodians participating in CCE have also gained insight into what they can accomplish: they plan to reach twice as many communities next year, using the same amount of money they previously allocated for the initial programme. These stories of success have shown that, one community at a time, Cambodians are making a difference in raising the standard for care and taking a stand against stigma and discrimination.

Lacking money for more sophisticated testing, the Initiative\u2019s protocol for providing ART is also based primarily on direct observation: patients with visible conditions such as wasting or severe diarrhoea receive therapy. The accompagnateurs factor women\u2019s caring responsibilities into their treatment in various ways, including by providing money to help pay school fees when possible. They also try to be aware of the circumstances under which the women became infected. \u201cWe realize that gender inequality is at the root of a lot of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, because of the limited ways women can protect themselves,\u201d said Dr. Joia Mukherjee of Partners in Health, the US NGO that, along with the Haitian organization Zanmi Lasante, runs HEI. \u201cMany women we see were domestic servants when they were young girls and were abused by their employers. Others had to do sex work for food or security,\u201d said Dr. Mukherjee. Many of them came home to their villages to die, she added, but thanks to HEI, they are still alive.

The societal expectation is that women will provide this care regardless of the personal costs. This assumption is also built into many health systems and care programmes. There is an urgent need to better understand the needs of informal women caregivers in order to ensure that they are supported and linked into comprehensive care and treatment programming, and given the material and emotional supports and resources they need. Approaches that combine these strategies with efforts to redress imbalances in gender norms, foster the participation of men and boys in care giving, and seek to empower women economically will have the greatest and most sustained impact. oVERVIEW oF THE IssuE The challenges for women and girls in the HIV epidemic do not stop at the risk of infection. Equally profound and intractable are the myriad impacts the epidemic has on women whose partners, family members and/or children are sick, dying or deceased as a result of AIDS and related opportunistic infections. When HIV enters the household, women and girls provide the care. Globally, up to 90 percent of care related to illness is provided in the home by women and girls. This is in addition to the many tasks they already perform, such as taking care of children and the elderly, cooking, cleaning and, in subsistence areas, fetching water and firewood (Global Coalition on Women and AIDS, 2004).

The UN Secretary-General\u2019s Task Force on Women and AIDS in Southern Africa, for example, found that two-thirds of caregivers in the households surveyed were female, and almost a quarter of them were over 60 years old (UNAIDS, 2004). In Vietnam, women and girls make up 75 percent of caregivers for people living with HIV (Ogden, Esim & Grown, 2006). Traditionally, women in Papua New Guinea, as in most other societies, provide most of the care for children, the infirm and the sick. They are also recognized as the main caregivers, within families, for people with HIV (Luker, 2004). In Thailand, elderly mothers serve as the primary caregivers for a large proportion of people living with HIV. (Wassana, 2004). These women, many of whom will themselves live with HIV and AIDS, frequently face at least three types of stigma: the stigma of being female, the stigma of being a widow, and the stigma of living with or being closely-associated with HIV. They also bear their burden of care with an ever- dwindling base of economic and social resources.

In addition, as the epidemic spreads, female responsibility for care- giving reduces girls\u2019 and women\u2019s participation in productive and economic activities (including education). This in turn further constrains women\u2019s social and economic opportunities, thrusting these women into a cycle of poverty, disempowerment and vulnerability to infection (World Bank, Gender and Development Group, 2004; Ogden, Esim & Grown, 2006). An analysis of the intersection of gender roles, and care and support activities is important because it sheds light on the debilitating and disproportionate burden borne by women. It is also important because it draws attention to the ways in which contemporary gender roles in the context of the epidemic compromise women\u2019s ability to care for themselves and, in many instances, their children. The 2004 joint report by UNAIDS, UNFPA and UNIFEM, \u2018Women and HIV/AIDS: Confronting the Crisis,\u2019 articulates that in addition to the many tasks women already perform in the home, women are also deeply involved in work at the community level, often as volunteers. This has been dubbed the \u2018care economy\u2019 (Elson 2002) because of the role it plays in underpinning and enabling other family members to participate productively in the market economy. Despite its critical contribution to the overall national economy and society in general, however, the value of the time, energy and resources required to perform this unpaid work is rarely recognized by governments or communities. 71 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics The devastating effect of HIV on women\u2019s work is even less recognized. Poverty reduction strategies and national AIDS plans seldom take women\u2019s caregiving into account; it remains unpaid and therefore undervalued in economic terms. Even as prevalence rates come down in countries such as Thailand or Uganda, the impact of HIV will continue for years afterwards in terms of the large number of orphans, wages lost to caregiving and death, and resources spent on health care. The social services that will ease some of this burden are a critical complement to HIV/AIDS treatment. CREATInG An EnAblInG EnVIRonmEnT support family care providers and \ufffd \ufffd ensure that women and girls do not lose opportunities for education, social life and employment due to the cultural imperative that they alone should provide care for family members sick and dying due to AIDS. Policies can support creative public-private partnerships and linkages (formal or informal) with community-based organizations and/or networks of HIV- positive people. In addition, programmes have been developed to encourage men to engage more actively in the care of family members living with HIV (e.g. Esu-Williams, 2004). Nurture emergence and support \ufffd\ufffd continuation of community home-based care programmes. Draw on best practices from the region (notably Cambodia and Thailand) and Africa, where successful partnerships have been forged between the public healthcare services and community-based or faith-based organizations to provide a continuum of care to clients and their families. Ensure linkages between testing, \ufffd\ufffd treatment and home-based care. Ensure home-based care programmes \ufffd\ufffd are working with and supporting family caregivers, linking them to available information, prevention education and equipment. Ensure that home-based care is providing \ufffd\ufffd the support necessary so that educational opportunities for children \u2013 especially girl children \u2013 are not lost. Foster the participation of men and boys \ufffd\ufffd in home-based care, within the family and the community. \ufffd Promote and protect the property and \ufffd inheritance rights of women affected by HIV and AIDs. Property and asset ownership and control have an empowering effect on women living with and affected by HIV, enhancing their resiliency and ability to manage their lives effectively despite their desperate circumstances. Securing women\u2019s property rights can help positive people live with dignity and contain the spread of HIV. In countries where national social \ufffd \ufffd security schemes including employment guarantee schemes exist, ensure it reaches marginalized populations, including those infected and affected by HIV. \ufffd\ufffd Address gender norms .

The programme provides psychosocial support, health care, voluntary counselling and testing, economic and food support, and skills training. Home-based care programmes in Asia operated by community-based organization (CBOs) or faith-based organizations (FBOs) are relatively small in scale. Some of the more effective programmes are those that run through HIV support groups. An example is the Ashar Alo society in Dhaka, bangladesh. Among it activities to support those living with HIV and their families are efforts to scale-up care and support programmes. Cheyutha, based in Andhra Pradesh, is a similar CBO in India. Among other services, this health and development organization offers clinical and psycho-social home-based care. The salvation Army in India also has good coverage of home-based care for AIDS.

A recent review of several large cohort studies among Thai army conscripts showed a significant, consistently negative association between HIV prevalence and higher levels of education between 1990 and 1995 (Hargreaves and Glynn, 2002). Girls\u2019 schooling has been found to be associated with several factors linked to HIV reduction. In India, women receiving secondary education were less likely to experience violence and had greater ability to leave violent situations as compared to women who received only primary education (Jejeebhoy, 1998). Education has also been shown to be a significant factor in delaying marriage (Mathur, Greene and Malhotra, 2003). Girls are also thought to gain autonomy and important life skills useful in negotiation of decisions related to the timing of marriage through education (Lloyd and Mensch, 1999). School attendance can provide opportunities for boys and girls to access information about sexual and reproductive health including critical information on HIV transmission and prevention. Across the Asia-Pacific region, education of girls lags behind that of boys. South Asia, despite a nearly 20 percent increase in girls\u2019 gross enrolment rates between 1990 and 2000 \u2013 from 79.5 percent to 96.6 percent (UNESCO, 2004) \u2013 is still experiencing a gender gap in enrolment in primary education. While this trend is positive, the picture is less hopeful for primary school completion, which is a better indicator of educational status. In 1990, primary school completion rates among South Asian boys was 94.9 percent as compared with 81.0 percent for girls (UNESCO, 2004). The gender gap is much wider in secondary education. In South Asia the secondary school gross enrolment rate for girls is only 50 percent. Globally, only 17 percent of girls are enrolled in secondary school and the gender parity ratios for gross enrolment rates are lower than 0.90 in all developing country regions except Latin America and the Caribbean. Completion rates, where available, are even lower. For the 19 middle-income countries for which this data is available, completion rates for girls at the secondary level are below 50 percent (UNESCO, 2004). Secondary education appears to be especially protective. It is more consistently associated with increased decision-making and mobility for women than schooling at the primary level, and studies have found that only at secondary or higher levels of schooling does education have a significant beneficial effect on women\u2019s own health outcomes and risk of disease. Studies of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America find that while primary education increases girls\u2019 and women\u2019s ability to discuss HIV with a partner, ask for condom use or negotiate sex with a spouse, secondary education has an even greater impact. Girls who attend secondary school are far more likely to understand the costs of risky behaviour and are better able to safely navigate difficult sexual situations (Hargreaves & Boler, 2006). There are several factors determining girls\u2019 educational opportunities. Early marriage excludes girls from education. In South Asia, 30 percent or more of girls aged 15\u201319 are already married. In Bangladesh, the rate is very high (65 percent), in India moderately high (48 percent), and relatively low in Sri Lanka (14 percent) (Mathur et al., 2003). Other reasons girls are excluded from education in the region include the following: Many families do not understand the i. benefits of educating girls, whose role is often narrowly viewed as being prepared for marriage, motherhood and domestic responsibility; Girls in many countries are already ii. disadvantaged in terms of social status, lack of time and resources, a high burden of domestic tasks and sometimes even lack of food; and 79 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics Girls, rather than their brothers, tend to iii. bear the burden of care for ill parents and younger siblings, jeopardizing their ability to attend school. (Global Coalition on Women and AIDS, http://womenandaids. unaids.org/issues_education.html) Quality of education is also relevant. Limited access to comprehensive information on sex and HIV prevention further compounds women\u2019s risk.

Fears that providing comprehensive sex education to adolescents may lead to early sexual debut and increased sexual activity have often led to restrictions being imposed on the type and level of information on sex and HIV prevention that adolescents receive. Contrary to those fears, a review of 83 studies conducted in developed and developing countries showed that comprehensive sex education programmes that include information on abstinence, contraception, pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV, do not increase sexual activity. In fact, of the 52 studies that specifically looked at the timing of initiation of sex, all but one found that the programmes either delayed sexual initiation or had no impact (Kirby et al., 2005). Hence, there is little evidence to support the belief that sexuality and/or HIV education promote promiscuity (Grunseit et al., 1997). In order to be an agent for sustained transformative change, educators also need to find ways to actively engage students in dialogue about unequal gender norms. While well-implemented, school-based HIV prevention programmes are a vital part of reducing HIV risk, these programmes can be greatly enhanced when they go beyond just providing information, and help young people develop the knowledge, attitudes and life skills needed to protect themselves against HIV. HIV education should include discussions of gender roles, rights and responsibilities to help boys and girls understand and address stereotypes, gender bias, power relations and discrimination. Skills-based HIV education uses participatory approaches to involve both children and young people in active learning experiences that can go well beyond HIV to include other health and personal development issues (http://www.unicef.org/lifeskills/ index_8657.html). In addition, students (especially girls) may benefit from livelihood skills education and training to help ensure access to wage-earning opportunities for young girls and women, thus reducing their economic dependence on others once they are out of school. These recommendations require significant changes in school curricula and, by extension, in teacher training and capacity-building. Teachers must understand and be willing to discuss HIV and AIDS before they can properly teach about it. In traditional societies, teaching about the sexual dimension of HIV and AIDS presents special problems, and teachers may need to acquire specific skills to address this role effectively. (World Bank, 2006). Investments in education often need to be accompanied by investments in conditions that will facilitate the role of education in maxmizing the benefits for girls and women. This requires improvement in provision of services and opportunities, and more fundamentally, shifts Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 80 in social and economic structures and gender norms. Many of these factors can be readily addressed by policy shifts and programmatic action, given the necessary political will. To improve health outcomes, for example, policies and programmes to educate girls must be accompanied by efforts that improve services and create an enabling environment for women to use these services. In order to have an impact on HIV prevalence, it is clear that although improving education levels can help, other key risk factors in the population must also be addressed concurrently. Similarly, in the economic sphere, policy efforts at educating girls should go hand-in-hand with efforts that increase economic opportunities. moVInG FoRWARD WITH GIRls\u2019 EDuCATIon There are four key lines of action in the education response to the challenge of HIV and its effects on girls (adapted from http://www.unicef.org/ lifeskills/index_8657.html): Get girls into school \ufffd\ufffd - and ensure a safe and effective environment that can keep them at school and learning.

Launched in 2003, DISHA is being implemented over a four- to five-year period in partnership with six organizations in Bihar and Jharkhand. Each of the partners has an extensive presence in the local community, is committed to youth well-being and development, and brings a wide range of expertise and experience to the project, ranging from community mobilization to corporate linkages. Partners in Bihar are CENCORED, the Daudnagar Organization for Rural Development and the Integrated Development Foundation. In Jharkhand, partners are Alternative for India Development, the Badlao Foundation and the Tribal Culture Society (TCS). This work is supported by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. Assessments by ICRW and local and national stakeholders indicate that existing programmes for delivering reproductive health information and services are too narrow and inadequate to address youth reproductive health concerns in Bihar and Jharkhand. DISHA takes a more comprehensive, multi-sectoral and integrated approach that addresses not only the health, but also the socio-cultural and economic factors that have an impact on youth reproductive health. It seeks to build the capacity of youth-serving organizations to implement and evaluate high- quality programmes, while building leadership and widespread commitment to address the needs of youth. DISHA is designing and implementing six new, innovative programmes that incorporate best practices and lessons learned on integrated youth programmes. Taken together, these programmes will reach over 200 communities and 7,000 to 9,000 youth. The programmes in each area also target community leaders, parents and service providers. Through both direct and indirect outreach, the DISHA project is likely to reach approximately 30,000 to 40,000 young people.

With dropping school enrolment and rising HIV rates, Cambodia adopted the sectoral mainstreaming approach to integrate HIV concerns into both policy and technical levels of development activities. This approach allowed HIV programming to shift from a strictly public health focus to a cross-cutting approach across all government sectors. Rather than doing this in a top-down manner, the approach sought to determine how HIV programming could improve each sector as a whole and contribute to the overall national goal of poverty reduction. This was useful in targeting specific groups for tailored HIV programming and for linking HIV to specific development activities and goals of the sector. This in turn allowed HIV programming to have a more fundamental effect on the education sector and resulted in HIV education to in-school and out-of-school youth, and in the workplace. HIV mainstreaming in the education sector is part of the national budget and all pre-service teachers are systematically trained in HIV. About 80,000 teachers who are in service are also trained on HIV. HIV is also part of the minimum standards for students\u2019 performance and national examination plans.

It remains the most fundamental and extreme form of gender inequality and a poignant manifestation of the low status and specific disadvantage that women face. A WHO-sponsored study, including data from more than 24,000 women interviewed in 15 sites in 10 countries, found that from 15 to 71 percent of women reported having experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Women living in more rural settings in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Peru and Tanzania reported the highest levels of violence (WHO, 2005). In India, 40 percent of women report experiencing physical violence at the hands of their husbands, and half of those who had suffered severe physical abuse reported being beaten during pregnancy (ICRW, 2001). At a global level, the health burden from gender- based victimization among women age 15 to 44 is comparable to that posed by other risk factors and diseases already high on the world agenda, including HIV, tuberculosis, sepsis during childbirth, cancer and cardiovascular disease (World Bank, 1993). oVERVIEW oF THE IssuE Violence needs to be recognized as not only as a human rights violation or health issue, but as also an issue that impacts the development process as a whole. Researchers argue that violence obstructs participation in development processes and contradicts the very goals of development (Burton, Duvvury & Varia, 2000). In addition, violence against women and HIV need to be viewed as twin pandemics that feed into and off of each other, with violence being both a cause and a consequence of HIV. Data from a study in Tanzania (Maman et al., 2000) suggests that for some women, the experience of violence or being the victim of a violent act is a strong predictor of future HIV infection. The fear of violence also acts as a barrier to women\u2019s ability to access HIV prevention tools and services, including testing and counselling (Maman et al., 2001), and health providers are often at a loss concerning how to help victims of violence. Violence against women directly contributes to HIV-related vulnerability in a number of ways. Firstly, actual or threatened violence limits women\u2019s ability to negotiate safe sexual behaviour in their intimate relationships. Research shows that violence and fear of abandonment act as significant barriers for women who have to negotiate use of condoms, discuss fidelity with their partners or leave relationships that they consider risky (Mane, Rao Gupta, & Weiss, 1994; Weiss & Rao Gupta, 1998; Dunkle et al., 2003 ). Condom use in intimate relationships is often viewed as an indicator that norms of sexuality and fidelity have been breached by one or both partners. So it is not surprising that even spouses of individuals at high risk for HIV (such as truckers) often report no condom use with their husbands (ICRW, 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c275c86-dffe-4137-80de-2602fd8cf13c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c275c86-dffe-4137-80de-2602fd8cf13c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf55c8ada80e638d177560d38981262b9f1edb95fddb346dc38724521ef59eb1"}, "2": {"node_id": "b6e9309f-b5ef-42cc-8f8d-fdb2f4c18df5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "446c077eb2932ce35fffdd4ae216b8103df60def02253b769e15a2a44fff8fe8"}}, "hash": "3b8f29b18e087bc260d01be219f8ea9d56167afe7862f122c54fcd68c22ff214", "text": "Even women sex workers who report increased ability to negotiate condom use with their clients, report high levels of sexual violence with their regular intimate partners, including being beaten for requesting condom use and being forced to have sex without condoms (ICRW, 2005; Jenkins, 2000; quoted in \u2018Policy Document on Positive Sex Workers\u2019 Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee). Studies also suggest that intimate partner violence is associated with an increased risk that the abusive male partner is HIV-positive (Dunkle et al., 2003) or is himself at increased risk for infection (Martin & Curtis, 2004). Secondly, sexual violence is related to HIV vulnerability both at the time of abuse and in predicting future high-risk behaviour.

A study in Cambodia concluded that more emphasis must be placed on the relationship between gender- based violence and HIV and AIDS within the context of marriage (Duvvury & Knoess, 2005). A small Bangladeshi study that examined vulnerability to HIV infection found that among 89 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics the 48 non-sex worker IDUs interviewed for the study, about 20 percent reported having been raped. In half of those cases the perpetrator was their husband (Azim et al., 2006). With increasing recognition of the spread of HIV among married women in the Asia-Pacific region, there is need to gather more data to better understand this association. In addition to evidence on forced sex and sexual violence among married adult women, there is also growing evidence of the magnitude of this trend among young adults, male and female, married and unmarried. A survey conducted by UNFPA in the Caribbean reported that 21 percent of boys and 18 percent of girls were sexually abused before the age of sixteen (World Bank, 2000). A review of thirteen studies (mostly small sample sizes) found that between two and 20 percent of girls and fewer than 15 percent of boys, generally aged from 15-19, reported having experienced sexual coercion. When asked about forced first sexual experience, about 15 to 30 percent of sexually active girls and fewer than 10 percent of boys reported coercion (Jejeebhoy et al., 2003). Studies conducted in schools highlight that sexual coercion and abuse are part of the educational experience for many young people (UNICEF, 2006). Conflict or violence experienced outside of the home compounds women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV. A Cambodian study found that among 1,000 female and transgendered sex workers, over 50 percent had experienced violence at the hands of law enforcement personnel (Jenkins et al., 2005). In addition to being a violation of basic human rights, many of these rapes occurred without the use of a condom, therefore involving some level of HIV transmission risk. In Cambodia, few rapes are reported by victims, often because victims fear that the perpetrator might retaliate (LICADHO, 2006). Violence is thought to be an important contributor to the HIV epidemic in Papua New Guinea, where violence and fear are part of everyday life for many of the poor, particularly in Port Moresby. According to a recent report (Tobias, 2007), sexual violence and rape \u2013 particularly of young women \u2013 is common, in part due to the extremely low social status of women, leading to an HIV incidence rate among young women aged 15-19 that is four times higher than the rate among boys in the same age group. The National AIDS Council in Papua New Guinea reports that \u201cpatterns of male sexual behaviour including a high incidence of rape, line-ups (gang rape), sexual assault and weak law enforcement\u201d are important contributors to the epidemic (Human Rights Watch, 2005 Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 90 cited in Tobias, 2007). Another study documents the extent of violence perpetrated by armed forces and other politically motivated agents in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand (Priyakamon et al., 2004). A form of gang rape referred to as \u201cbauk\u201d has also been observed in Cambodia among young students raping sex workers for male bonding because they consider the sex workers \u201cless than human\u201d (Duvvury and Knoess, 2005) Gender-based violence is also a consequence of HIV. Disclosure of status is often accompanied by violence perpetrated at the hands of the husband, family and community. The most common barrier to disclosure reported by women was related to fear of partner\u2019s reaction (WHO, 2004). A recent study on the links between women\u2019s property rights and HIV in South Asia (Swaminathan, Bhatla & Chakraborty, 2007) documented that violence in the marital home following disclosure of status often results in the positive women being evicted. Narratives collected as part of this study highlight yet another, but relatively unexplored, form of violence: violence by HIV-positive husbands towards their wives who are not HIV- positive. Affected women speak of the extreme violence perpetrated on them as a result of the anger and frustration their husbands feel when the husband learns of his own HIV status, as if wanting to ensure that he passes on the infection to his wife.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5e52a1c-d171-4821-8b2c-e19b94b40dcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5e52a1c-d171-4821-8b2c-e19b94b40dcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9bddc765237fc1299d595392c1b1a90efc5bfd25352ac8785731fda16acc6831"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf1b1a80-5bcb-496f-b880-ec2c512d7365", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9313a28253b4b4460d3db0788d636d3731f930daf42022a5dd7290fb25e5f90"}}, "hash": "a5ac0db58af9490142a0664c65dc2649b849195d337d245272b04ef613ea831e", "text": "Both stigma and violence are rooted in and enacted through gender inequalities.

Traditional norms of masculinity dictate that men should be sexually knowledgeable, experienced and \u201cin control\u201d \u2013 norms that coerce them into experimenting with sex at a young age in unsafe ways (UNAIDS, 1999) and challenge the effectiveness of prevention messages built around fidelity and partner reduction (Heise & Elias, 1995). Therefore, interventions that do not incorporate methodologies to create dialogue with the larger community on challenging these gender norms and breaking the silence around perceived \u2018private\u2019 matters only partially address the issue. Efforts to address violence require not only direct interventions but also strategic associated interventions such as work with men on notions of gender, sexuality and violence; sensitization of communities and specific groups such as health care providers and counsellors; and sensitization of other key stakeholders (e.g. teachers, parents, faith and community leaders) in the lives of adolescents who have the power to shape their notions of gender and sexuality. CREATIon oF GEnDER-EquITAblE noRms Violence against women and HIV share certain characteristics that have programmatic implications: both are associated with shame and blame; both are regarded as private matters; both are fuelled by unequal power relations; and both can only be effectively addressed through ensuring the creation of gender- equitable norms within communities and families.

Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 92 PRomIsInG PRACTICEs GoVERnmEnT mInIsTRIEs AnD bnWlA: bREAkInG THE sIlEnCE Bangladesh National Women\u2019s Lawyers\u2019 Association (BNWLA) works with different ministries to address Violence against Women and Children. BNWLA is a member of the National Task Force on CICR (Children Previously Involved in Camel Racing), the National Coordination Body for Acid Victims, and Special Cell to Monitor Violence against Women Cases. BNWLA has been involved with the National Task Force engaged in preparing the National Plan of Action for Women and Children. Additionally, BNWLA has been engaged with the Government run shelter homes to ensure that a minimum standard of care is maintained in the homes. BNWLA has also been coordinating a national coalition \u201cCitizens Initiative against Domestic Violence\u201d that has brought together more than 40 national organizations working to establish the rights of women. One of the larger goals of the coalition is to finalize the proposed Bill on domestic violence by generating awareness and policy advocacy around the Bill. WomEn-InITIATED CommunITy lEVEl REsPonsEs To DomEsTIC VIolEnCE Based on the finding that the most effective responses to inter-spousal violence are those in which the immediate family and community support the women and take responsibility to end violence, ICRW documented and evaluated five such programmes in India. Though operating in different socio-cultural contexts, all the programmes rely on a public dialogue or mediation to resolve the conflict through a face-to-face discussion among the people involved. A series of sessions takes place in the presence of the families, community and influential gate-keepers, which facilitate the emergence of a mutually agreeable solution. This strategy works because a \u2018private\u2019 issue becomes a public concern. The arbitrators feel that this technique is effective because \u201cit makes it very difficult to continuously justify a wrong behaviour in public\u201d. Additionally the fact that the decision is reached through public dialogue ensures that the community owns and is responsible for the decision. Not only is there a change in the levels of violence, but women also feel supported. They report increased confidence and ability to \u201cexercise agency\u201d \u2013 i.e., control outcomes affecting their lives. A democratic process, fear of public ostracism, and a backup threat of action by the local administrative authorities work together to make this an effective programmatic response to violence.

This law applies to all women in domestic relationships (relationships between a man and woman in a shared household) and includes physical, sexual, emotional, and economic abuse. One of the key features of the law is that provides women a right to residence in the household, i.e., she cannot be thrown out. In situations where she does not want to return to the house, the perpetrator has to provide for alternative accommodation.

Sexual and reproductive rights are among the basic human rights that are enshrined in key international conventions and upheld by governments that commit to those conventions (CRR, 2005). Nations that signed and ratified international conventions establishing or recognizing pre-existing reproductive rights (i.e., the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women [CEDAW]) must ensure that each woman in their country is free from gender inequalities that may constrain her ability to exercise those rights. When these rights are not upheld, they create ample opportunity for a woman to be abused, violated and exploited (CRR, 2005), and increase her vulnerability to poverty and disease, including HIV. According to these conventions, a woman\u2019s reproductive and sexual rights must be upheld, regardless of her HIV status. Positive women specifically need to be afforded with the guarantee that they can freely access quality reproductive health care without HIV- related stigma and discrimination and not be coerced into abortion or sterilization. HIV- negative women need to be assured that they can freely access reproductive health services and social supports that can reduce their HIV vulnerability as well as make decisions that do not compromise their reproductive health. Both groups of women need to be ensured that they can fully exert these rights on their own and at their own will.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14201f10-8305-4a3f-a5cb-73e1e4a9166d": {"__data__": {"id_": "14201f10-8305-4a3f-a5cb-73e1e4a9166d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcbc44775f89a3938e0c17b236b05e90a6af3c3bc0434dbe5439a47a1fe9edb4"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2e68a53-97d8-44c6-be24-193b319b907d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15fdc6c021d0d55f032aba20980d1eac50338f14fb15ac2c54ec934b049fa929"}}, "hash": "b07ed5659e96ac10e6d27c47070c859d953aa1778729388761b85f41fd6e1e5f", "text": "Signing international conventions does not always guarantee the protection of sexual and reproductive rights (CRR, 2005). For example, gendered norms that shape how childbearing decisions are made can affect how sexual and reproductive rights are defined and defended in the country context, as exemplified in India and Viet Nam. In both countries, women face enormous pressures to conceive once they are married and women may be coerced into childbearing by her husband/partner or a family member. In a Vietnamese qualitative study examining the socio-political attributes that facilitate the transmission of HIV, women reported that a woman\u2019s primary obligation is to provide her husband with a male heir (Phinney, n.d). In India, women in HIV-serodiscordant couples reported weighing the benefits of childbearing against becoming HIV-positive; a grave dilemma given that bearing children is an important aspect of feminine identity in India (Solomon, 2003). Punitive measures in place in some Asia- Pacific countries create further obstacles to the realization of reproductive and sexual rights. These measures effectively punish women for exercising their sexual and reproductive rights, such as possession or distribution of condoms, an offence which in some countries (such as India and the Philippines) warrants either arrest on the suspicion of being involved in sex work or harassment from law enforcement (Paxton et al., 2004; Human Rights Watch, 2002 and 2004).

Societies that lack punitive measures against the violation or infringement of sexual and reproductive rights create the opportunity for HIV vulnerability to increase. Women repeatedly exposed to violence or sexual abuse from a perpetrator who may be HIV-positive are highly vulnerable. Structural norms, particularly those that fail to provide legal protections against sexual violence within marriage, reinforce this effect. This vulnerability is compounded by women\u2019s inability to access medical care and the lack of legal options to seek justice against such incidents. 99 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics The shortcomings in upholding a woman\u2019s sexual and reproductive health rights appear to be further compounded when she is HIV-positive. Women report being denied information on safer sex because of their sero-status, the assumption being that because she is positive she is no longer entitled to her reproductive rights (Esplen, 2007). In a study on HIV-related discrimination in the Asia-Pacific region, pregnant women reported being coerced by health professionals to take an HIV test (APN+, 2004). Upon learning of their positive HIV status, they were advised to have abortions, be sterilized (even in countries where abortion is illegal), or give their child up for adoption. Furthermore, when an HIV- positive woman is pregnant, the focus will be on preventing infection of her child, while her own rights to treatment and care may be ignored or neglected (Paxton et al., 2004; DeBruyn, 2006; PATH Convergence Project, 2007; Esplen, 2007). In many parts of the Asia-Pacific region, sexual and reproductive rights often are in conflict with gendered norms prescribed by religious institutions and value systems that have been in existence for generations. In a study examining policies and actions on women\u2019s reproductive rights across five Asia-Pacific countries, the rights afforded to women were highly dependent on the religious context even though four of these five countries had ratified CEDAW (CRR, 2005). In addition, adolescents in this region report being consistently denied access to reproductive health services or unable to find youth resources that provide information about sexual and reproductive health, violence, HIV prevention, contraception and sexuality issues (CRR, 2005; APCRSH, 2003). Narrow definitions of rape, limited measures to protect women from sexual harassment, and criminalization of abortion are some of the measures that can stand in the way of women freely exercising their sexual and reproductive rights. One positive example of progress in finding ways to encourage nations to ratify and comply with CEDAW comes from the UNDP Pacific Centre. UNIFEM, UNDP, regional governments and civil society have developed specific legislative indicators to assess the degree of ratification and compliance with CEDAW conventions among the nine countries of the Pacific region (UNDP 2007). CEDAW, the international bill of rights for women, is now the second most ratified treaty in the Pacific region. These indicators have been useful measures to Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 100 assess the degree of compliance and gaps in legislative compliance (de jure) versus how laws are applied routinely. For example, one nation in the region has legislation making solicitation of sex an offence for men and women, a step toward gender equality in legislation; however, full compliance with CEDAW requires that sex workers are not criminalised. Abortion is not an offence in four of the nine nations, but access to safe reproductive health care, including family planning, is an important issue in this region. Discrimination against women is technically still lawful in two countries in this region. All countries in the region have legislated against assault on women, but none of these countries have identified by law domestic violence as a form of discrimination. Laws designed to protect women against all forms of violence, including certain protections for girls aged 16 and over in cases of rape, are generally inadequate in countries in this region. These represent several examples of the type of detailed review these indicators can provide (UNDP, 2007). The Inter-agency Task Team on the Prevention of HIV Infection in Pregnant Women, Mothers and Children has developed a global strategy for universal access to prevention of parent to child transmission which provides guidance on the standard of care for providing these services. This strategy calls for the adoption of a comprehensive package of care based on the United Nation\u2019s four elements strategy which links and integrates maternal, newborn and child healthcare services.

Male involvment is also recognized as an important issue, as is couples counseling which encourages HIV testing and counseling, facilitates disclosure of HIV status, and improves use of family planning methods and adherence to treatment. This is a critical element in the continuum of family-centered care which integrates care for the benefit of the family including services such as nutritional support, child health, and family planning services (The Inter-agency Task Team on Prevention of HIV Infection in Pregnant Women, Mothers and Children, June 2007). In sum, sexual and reproductive rights are basic human rights and awareness must be raised affirming this. When a woman faces coercion or discrimination exercising such rights, her vulnerability to HIV can increase. It is important that all women, regardless of the status, are allowed to exercise these rights without being subjected to mistreatment from their partner, medical personnel or other people in positions of authority.

The ability of women to access, own, and control assets has been considered pivotal to ensuring women\u2019s empowerment, social and economic security and well-being. Ownership of land, housing and other property provides direct and indirect benefits including a secure place to live, the means to a livelihood and a measure of wealth or capital by which additional economic resources can be leveraged (land can serve as collateral for credit, for instance). Land has long been recognized as a primary source of wealth, social status and power, providing the basis for shelter, food and economic activities (FAO 2002). The HIV epidemic amplifies the importance of property and asset ownership for women, as it can profoundly compromise a woman\u2019s financial, social and physical well-being. Property ownership may sustain livelihoods in the short- term or the long-term and also serve as collateral for credit, enabling HIV- and AIDS-affected households to cope better with the personal and financial impacts of the disease (Strickland, 2004). Unfortunately, women face many structural and community level barriers to their ability to access and own assets, claim inheritance, and access finance and credit, including male preference in inheritance practices, male privilege in marriage, gender inequality in the land market and male bias in state land redistribution programmes (Deere & Leon, 2001). Women in many countries may have access to property and other assets only through informal arrangements or traditional methods of household and communal decision-making. In India, of all rural women in the workforce, 85 percent are in agriculture (Agarwal, 2002). However, because land is primarily inherited through the male family line, some researchers estimate that women own less than 10 percent of land; others put the number at two percent (FAO, 2002). In the context of the HIV epidemic, property rights encompass a broad spectrum of assets that can provide economic security.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0df206e-2633-4164-8f04-1687f6efa721": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0df206e-2633-4164-8f04-1687f6efa721", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61d32fea4cacc3ab2ddfae199f1e0a6da02ad0c1c644bcfa1d6f4ad4001b6bcf"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b2efb2d-3813-4728-a2a3-37930e8e4185", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a95b7aa63476a8acdf2fb86f65608a5142e135b0dd4b83a2a3930a5702a1a5a"}}, "hash": "48b7557329269340ed98b8a567cc4b6742c9547423103909f26c7214abc0e9a7", "text": "\u201cWomen define \u201cproperty\u201d as everything they receive from their birth family when they marry, and all they are entitled to as wives, including jewellery, dowry, furniture, insurance, pensions, bank accounts, fixed deposits, land, houses or any other asset their husbands acquired.\u201d (Swaminathan, Bhatla & Chakraborty, 2007) Ownership of land has been linked to both economic and physical security. Research indicates that individuals who own land generate much higher rural, non-farm earnings from self-employment than people without land (Chadha, 1992). Asset control can also give women greater bargaining power within households and help protect against domestic violence, a key risk factor for HIV (see Section 4.5 for a fuller discussion of this relationship). Research in Kerala, India, for example, found that 49 percent of women with no property reported physical violence compared to only 7 percent of women who did own property (Panda, 2002). Research conducted by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW, 2006) has also documented that ownership of immovable assets not only protects women from experiencing intimate partner violence, but also gives them a means of exiting violent situations. Property-owning women who are not experiencing violence rank higher on measures of empowerment such as greater self worth, confidence and an increased ability to make decisions, including financial decisions.

This empowering aspect of property-both economically and socially-is especially vital for women living with and affected by HIV or AIDS. Issues of property ownership have been forced into the open in Africa, where there is evidence that women\u2019s need for land for economic security and survival is deepening as the number 107 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics of female-headed and child-headed households grows due to the AIDS epidemic. Evidence from that region indicates that economic vulnerability and the lack of assets such as land significantly increase the likelihood that women will engage in a variety of risky sexual behaviours, including transactional sex and multiple, concurrent sexual contacts (Hallman, 2004; Weiser et al., 2006). A study in South Africa found that factors associated with increased likelihood of reporting transactional sex were partly related to insecure asset ownership and included living in substandard housing and ever reporting hunger in the household (Dunkle et al., 2004). Financial inequality in a relationship also has been found to be an independent predictor of sexual coercion. Women who are economically dependent on men are less able to negotiate safe sex behaviour such as condom use, and are less likely to leave relationships that they consider risky (Jewkes et al., 2003; Luke 2003; van der Straten, 1997). HIV also exacerbates an additional economic vulnerability for women: dispossession and denial of property rights, mostly following death of a husband. Narratives given by a small sample of women, collected as part of a study exploring the links between HIV and property rights in three countries of South Asia (Swaminathan, Bhatla & Chakraborty, 2007), reveal that these women face the triple stigma of being female, widowed and, quite often, HIV-positive. The women report that while their husbands\u2019 HIV- positive status was deliberately withheld from them, they were nevertheless blamed for bringing HIV into the home. They were denied money for their own treatment, or denied a share of the matrimonial property on several pretexts such as: the marital family equating the money they spend on the husband\u2019s treatment to his share of the family inheritance; promises to transfer inheritance to their children, particularly if they are boys; or forcing or deceiving the women into signing legal documents to prevent them from claiming their share. The study also found that eviction is another form of property dispossession. A wife is often asked to leave her marital home after her husband\u2019s death and/or face disclosure of her HIV-positive status. Even if she is not immediately evicted, she frequently suffers abuse until she leaves of her own accord. After she is expelled from the marital home, the husband\u2019s family usually establishes control over any assets and sells them off for cash, which can make it more difficult for widows to recover their share. Such practices, fuelled by the stigma and discrimination commonly experienced by spouses of those who have died of AIDS, leave affected women (and sometimes their children) destitute and more vulnerable to further consequences of the epidemic (Drimie, 2002a; FAO, 2003; Human Rights Watch, 2003a). The study on the Gender Impact of HIV and AIDS in India (NACO, NCAER, UNDP 2006, page xxi) also supports this argument. The study shows that hardly 10 percent of widows are living with their husband\u2019s family and out of those who are not living with their husband\u2019s family; more than 90 percent had stopped living in their marital homes after the death of their husbands. In addition, 79 percent of the widows have complained that they were denied a share in their husband\u2019s property. It is important to note that the potential benefits of asset ownership go beyond income. Evidence and preliminary findings from a study in South Africa and Uganda indicate that secure property rights and property ownership can help women mitigate harmful effects of HIV and AIDS. For example, the study results suggest that mitigation benefits from owning property were strongest for women in Uganda, where land and property are used both for housing and generating income. Women with property had a greater degree of economic independence because they used their property (land, livestock, etc.) for various agricultural activities, and could further supplement their income with a range of informal work, such as petty trading, sale of old clothes, sale of livestock-related products, and brewing and selling millet liquor. Moreover, the land itself could generate income via land rentals, and women could use labour-sharing arrangements to bridge labour shortages (ICRW, HSRC, AFD, 2008).

THE EmERGInG REsPonsE Responses to help HIV-positive women secure their economic conditions and property rights have only recently begun to emerge in the Asia-Pacific region. , and they are uninformed and fragmented. This is due both to a limited understanding of how property rights could mitigate the impact of HIV, and lack of capacity, both technical and financial, to deal with the problem (Swaminathan, Bhatla & Chakraborty, 2007). A growing number of organizations have begun to experiment with employing HIV-positive women as staff, or are building vocational skills, offering loans or lobbying industry to employ HIV-positive people. However, these responses lack reach, may not be sustainable and often do not benefit the most vulnerable and unskilled. The challenge is to create strategies for sustained economic, social and health support that provide a safety net to prevent HIV-positive and/or affected women from continually slipping back into risky sexual behaviour, economic crisis and consequently worsened health status. The legislative arena holds important promise. Laws favourable to women are a critical first step and are indicative of a policy environment that recognizes gender bias and seeks to amend it. In recent years, India and Nepal have amended their legislation, giving women equal inheritance rights, though what impact this is having on the lives of women has yet to be determined. In the context of HIV, the likelihood of realizing these rights becomes even more difficult due to the added layer of blame, shame and stigma alluded to above. While personal stories of the despair faced by women abound, systematic and visible evidence is necessary to push this issue onto national policy agendas. To this end, the first ever Asia-Pacific Court of Women on HIV, Inheritance and Property Rights: From Dispossession to Livelihoods, Security and Safe Spaces was organized by UNDP Regional Office at the 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, held in Colombo in 2007. Testimonies from HIV-positive women and sex workers illustrated the violations of property rights that they faced ( http://www2.undprcc.lk/ resource_centre/rcc_publications.php?c_id=1002 ) Participants from Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Malaysia and even Ethiopia and South Africa presented testimonies at the Asia-Pacific Court of Women on HIV, Inheritance and Property Rights. The testimonials were presented before the eminent jury, which issued a public statement with policy recommendations on this issue at the end of the special court. In terms of organizational responses, formal legal, family level mediation and community- based arbitration are all potential strategies that can be used to help women access their rights (Swaminathan, Bhatla & Chakraborty, 2007). However, these may need to be used in conjunction with each other to create an environment where women can realize their rights. Women face obstacles such as legal systems insensitive to these issues, long and cumbersome arbitration processes, and practical constraints such as lack of awareness of rights and access to documents. In many instances, women hesitate to use the legal options as they want to maintain their family ties and relations, and also not lose face in the community for having dragged family matters into the open. Family and community level dialogue, mediation or even the formation of pressure groups may be needed to intervene and engage gatekeepers and shift norms around gender. 109 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics Recognizing the importance of community- driven responses to HIV and AIDS, ICRW, in partnership with the Global Coalition on Women and AIDS and the FAO, implemented a grants programme to document and test community interventions to secure women\u2019s property and inheritance rights in the context of HIV.

A major partnership initiative between UNAIDS, AWHRC, ICRW, UNIFEM, lawyers Collective and FWLD, the Court hosted over 500 people, most important of whom were 22 women testifiers from 11 countries in the AP region; a five member eminent Jury comprising two Supreme Court judges from Sri Lanka and Nepal and five expert witnesses who set the context for the subject of the court. The outcomes from court created the demand for country specific action on increasing women\u2019s access to land and property using a human rights framework. The first country level action started in Nepal, where women\u2019s land ownership has historically remained low, at only 1% according to the Nepal\u2019s National Women\u2019s Commission. Chief reasons for this have been the gender discriminatory provisions contained in the Civil Code. In 2002, after intense pressure from Women\u2019s groups and collectives of lawyers, the 11th amendment to the civil code was introduced, granting equal rights to ancestral property for daughters, full inheritance rights to widows and a wife\u2019s rights to her husband\u2019s property. However, even by 2007, the gap between progressive legislation and actual practice was still wide. With the endorsement of Justice Kalayan Shrestha of the Supreme Court of Nepal and a Jury member of the regional court; and in partnership with the Forum for Women, Law and Development (FWLD) in Nepal1, an innovative initiative involving rights holders and duty bearers, was rolled out in Nepal. This programme first brought together UNIFEM NGO partners working on gender issues, and UNDP NGO partners working on HIV, to the same platform. Using a mix of leadership development and community conversations methodology2, the group was motivated to take community level innovative actions to change attitudes, norms and beliefs surrounding women\u2019s rights to land and property, one of the key barriers to increasing women\u2019s access to land. This resulted in, among other things, three HIV positive women claiming their rights to their deceased husband\u2019s properties from their in-laws. These successes were then showcased at a national consultation for duty bearers including representatives from the Ministries of Law, Justice and Parliamentary affairs; Women, children and social affairs; Health; Land Reform, Finance; and the Human Rights Commission in Nepal. The programme resulted in a renewed commitment from policy makers to give priority to women\u2019s land rights in Nepal. During this same period, the government increased the percentage of rebate granted to people who registered property in the name of a woman from 10 % to 20%. Initial reports from the Department of Land Reform and Management have shown a remarkable increase in women\u2019s land ownership. Now 25% of the total land registered in 13 different land revenue offices in Nepal are in the names of women3. 1 Under the dedicated leadership of Advocate Sapana Pradhan Malla, a practicing lawyer before the Supreme Court of Nepal, and member of Nepal\u2019s Constituent Assembly. 2 Leadership development and community conversations are part of UNDP\u2019s Leadership for Results program, designed to enhance the leadership, commitment and capacity of stakeholders involved in the response to the HIV epidemic 3 Women and land ownership: Maina Dhital, Kantipur daily, 26th January 2008 Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 112 nAGoRIk uDDyoG CommunITy-lEVEl DIsPuTE REsoluTIon: EnsuRInG WomEn\u2019s REAlIZATIon oVER RIGHT To PRoPERTy (bAnGlADEsH) Community-level dispute resolution can be more accessible and effective for poor women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50428151-e416-42e3-9b41-c737d2b593fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "50428151-e416-42e3-9b41-c737d2b593fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06733f573bf05f099a3dc71ed92178e4cfa33148537202c161a042a7cf7b6cb6"}, "2": {"node_id": "4017afaf-0f7b-4e00-938e-5b199b2753f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15031392de634e9ca05d3baccc18ae9d0948c8ffc24685a78a211c2d09cc210a"}}, "hash": "c271db726a4f4bdf426ecf895b22dfae4a2f4a3bed7cfca3808dfc748c752094", "text": "In addition, long-term engagement with communities and working with community gatekeepers can shift gender norms to ensure sustainability of interventions. nagorik uddyog, a citizens\u2019 initiative in Bangladesh, uses the shalish, a traditional informal mechanism for dispute resolution.

Nagorik Uddyog, with the help of the local legal aid council, organized a shalish for her case. She and her husband agreed to formally separate and she was awarded Tk. 25,000 ($ 390). With Nagorik Uddyog\u2019s help, she bought 0.36 acres of land and now earns about Tk. 6,500 ($103) per month.

Persistent gender inequality, particularly in access to economic resources, greatly affects how women and girls can and cannot protect themselves from HIV, how they cope with HIV once infected and care for people living with the virus. Discriminatory practices have long kept women and girls from education, training and productive work, as well as from access to critical assets such as inheritance, land and housing. When they do find work in the formal sector, women often experience gender discrimination in hiring and payment practices. Research clearly links between women\u2019s economic vulnerability and their vulnerability to HIV: economically vulnerable women are less likely to terminate a potentially dangerous relationship, less likely to have access to information regarding HIV and AIDS, less likely to use condoms, and more likely to resort to high-risk behaviours for a source of income (Weiss and Gupta 1998, Blanc 2001). A study in South Africa found that factors associated with an increased likelihood of reporting transactional sex were partly related to insecure asset ownership. These factors included living in substandard housing and even reporting hunger in the household (Dunkle et al. 2004). Financial inequality in a relationship has also been found to be an independent predictor of sexual coercion. Women who are economically dependent on men are less able to negotiate safe sex behaviour such as condom use, and are less likely to leave relationships that they consider risky (Jewkes et al. 2003; Luke 2003; van der Straten 1997). These women are also less able to cope with HIV and AIDS and its impact if they or their family members become infected (Drimie 2002, FAO 2003). HIV infection and AIDS-related mortality generate and heighten both household level and women\u2019s personal economic vulnerability. Households slip deeper into poverty as people lose savings, land, housing tenure and employment as they struggle to meet the medical costs and other needs associated with care for the prolonged illness. Households may deal with the economic challenge by selling off assets, including livestock, furniture, and other consumer goods, in order to cover such costs as clinic visits, medical treatments, supplies and funerals. Profits from the sale of assets also help offset losses that result when household caregivers \u2013 often women and girls \u2013 are diverted from other income-generating activities to provide care for family members with HIV and AIDS. Some studies suggest a sequence of \u201casset liquidation\u201d among AIDS caregivers to cope with the economic impact: first liquidating savings, then business income, then household assets, then productive assets, and finally land (Drimie 2002b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28653e13-2ac2-4463-bc01-50f23ea54cf1": {"__data__": {"id_": "28653e13-2ac2-4463-bc01-50f23ea54cf1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "745650022041829069f055afaaa5338f9471afb9ff6eb95b99848903ee3a3bc5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f72bf020-e218-4eb7-8156-a0568d7789c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e74947fda29184a3914bf6b31d7e9a4fb0997a91ab72b91b3db4c63af68ac16"}}, "hash": "ba7abf865f2545c33d1402df3338cba5590ea35191fd18fcd047724568aa4f07", "text": "A recently concluded study on the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS at the household level in India found that HIV-affected households report both lower income and increased expenditure, especially on medical care, and decreased savings, as compared to non-HIV-affected households. The total loss of income (calculated as percentage of current household income) was found to be very high (around 66 percent) in households where people living with HIV are unable to work. The study found that almost 43 percent of the sample households had either borrowed or liquidated assets to cope with the financial burden after a member became HIV-positive (UNDP, NACO, NCAER, 2006).

In some parts of South Asia, a wife is often sent out of the house after her husband\u2019s death and/or disclosure of her HIV- positive status. Even if she is not immediately evicted, she frequently suffers abuse until she leaves of her own accord. After she is expelled from the marital home, the husband\u2019s family usually establishes control over any assets and sells them off for cash, which make it more 117 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics difficult for widows to recover their share. Some families fear that if they transfer property to their daughter-in-law, it will be passed on to her natal family (Swaminathan, Bhatla, and Chakraborty 2007). Married women, especially adolescent girls, who depend on their husbands for economic support, have less leverage to negotiate protection. In some parts of Asia, and in South Asia in particular, high rates of child marriage \u2013 triggered by poverty, lack of education and lack of viable alternatives \u2013 leave young wives with little power over their older husbands to influence sexual or other household decisions. Married girls who have complied with social expectations to marry and bear children are increasingly being infected with HIV. EConomIC EmPoWERmEnT As An AIDs- PREVEnTIon sTRATEGy Increasing women\u2019s economic stability is a goal of many development projects. Women\u2019s economic vulnerability may often be due to lack of education and training, and less access to high profit margin products and markets than men. Promoting economic empowerment through enforcing property and inheritance rights, providing secondary education, technical training and microfinance services can contribute to reducing their vulnerability to domestic violence, unsafe sex and other HIV risk factors. Economic security, through ownership of immovable assets such as ownership of land and house in some parts of South Asia, has been found to help protect women from the experience of domestic violence, and also cope better with violence should it arise (ICRW 2006). In addition, women who own property are much more likely to be involved in financial decision-making at the household level, as well as in matters related to their property. Education (Section 4.4) and property rights (Section 4.7) are discussed elsewhere in detail in this document. Many organizations employ HIV-positive women as staff, or invest in building vocational skills, offer loans or lobby with certain industries and institutions to employ positive people. However, these efforts are often not sustainable and do not benefit the most vulnerable and unskilled women. There are certain barriers to regular sustained employment in the context of HIV: lack of available, well-paying jobs; limited skills among the women; and the effect of HIV-related illness or fear of disclosure on employment (Swaminathan, Bhatla, and Chakraborty 2007). The challenge is to create strategies for sustained economic, social and health support that provide a safety net to prevent HIV- positive people from continually slipping back into risky sexual behavior, economic crisis and consequently worsened health status. livelihoods and Employment In many countries efforts around care giving have focused on economic and social support strategies to facilitate livelihood development. For example, skill building and vocational trainings that help to secure employment or generate income are often coupled with formation of social support or peer groups. In Rwanda, NGOs and international agencies are providing vocational training and skill-building classes to youth (mainly girls) who are heads of households and helping to create support groups for them. In Uganda, where one family in four is looking after children not their own, the Uganda Women\u2019s Efforts to Save Orphans is working with girls who have become the main support of their families, providing training, paying school fees and helping them develop income-generating activities (UNAIDS/UNFPA/ UNIFEM, 2004, for details see www.uweso.org/) Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 118 skIll DEVEloPmEnT PRoGRAmmEs FoR GRAnDmoTHERs In an innovative example from India, grandmothers are being financially and emotionally equipped to take care of their grandchildren.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a549b404-2ccb-41d4-90b6-108aa8b6481a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a549b404-2ccb-41d4-90b6-108aa8b6481a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36aef7548f672901fef03e86a69922aca0e822d9e38c0c6b241647716422cfc8"}, "2": {"node_id": "84e58868-b135-4e99-9829-de5d9b21e10d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60f4b8271db09e3619c42632690ada39c7c5bae8a712e0d5db19f0b73c18db61"}}, "hash": "28c4bc08fcd73ccd6150044c59c81c5f8b52fde6470b5bec8b248a928ed7bc68", "text": "Located in Andhra Pradesh, this programme was initiated by Vasavya Mahila Mandali in low income areas, where an estimated 10-15 persons die of AIDS related illnesses each year, resulting in a large number of orphans.

They also strengthened bonds between the generations, encouraged a sense of community and extended relationships to build a conducive environment (described in UNDP, NACO, NCAER, 2006). Certain institutions have initiated programmes for securing economic rights as human rights, such as freedom from discrimination in housing and employment; and addressing the welfare needs of HIV-positive people. In Fiji, for example, access to housing grants and support allowances are being made available to people with HIV who are unemployed. Churches in Tonga, the Solomon Islands and Fiji and the Samoa AIDS Foundation have provided assistance in the form of housing and employment for people with HIV (Mid-Term Review Of the Pacific Regional Strategy on HIV and AIDS 2004-2008 Draft Report) microfinance Microfinance, which provides savings, credit and other financial services for those excluded from the formal banking system, may play a role in reducing women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV and AIDS. Women have used microfinance services to generate income, develop skills and improve their families\u2019 standard of living. Several studies have documented positive outcomes of microfinance programme participation including: increases in social capital (Anderson, 2002; Quiniones 2000; and Rankin 2002); women\u2019s participation in decision-making within the household (Mahmud 2003; Amin 1998); and women\u2019s empowerment (Hashemi, 1996). Several studies in Bangladesh have also provided evidence of reduced economic vulnerability among microfinance programme participants, particularly women (Develtere, 2005; Kandkher, 2005). A recent analysis on the role of microfinance in poverty alleviation indicates that while it is not a panacea, it has been a useful mechanism for changing the circumstances of women on an individual and small community basis. Limitations include the tendency of microfinance programmes to leave out younger women and adolescents. The report states that: \u201cthe ability of a woman to transform her life through access to financial services depends on many factors \u2013 some of them linked to her individual situation and abilities, and others dependent upon her environment and the status of women as a group\u201d (Urdang 2007:8). There are other limitations as well, although these can be mitigated through careful programme planning. Some studies have shown increases in empowerment to be limited to within household arrangements only (Mahmud 2003) and to actually increase the experience of violence (Schuler 1998; Cheston, 2002). Some have viewed microfinance programmes as having failed to decrease poverty or affect real structural change to alleviate the causes of poverty (Buckley, 1997; Ahmad 2003; Elahi, 2004). Many microfinance programmes are kept at the level of small loans that do not allow growth and keep women \u201cghettoized\u201d in micro- credit. To make more permanent and sustainable 119 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics inroads into women\u2019s economic disadvantage, programmes that are committed to social change as a major goal could measure their success by the size of women\u2019s loans over time and whether a substantial proportion of women borrowers graduate from micro-credit to formal credit channels and from micro-enterprise to small- and medium-sized businesses. Access to a full complement of business development services and training, not just loans, would contribute to women\u2019s ability to building equity. Some consider microfinance an important mechanism for providing economic safety nets for women and their households affected by HIV. (Mathison 2004, Parker 2005). However, little research has been conducted on whether microfinance is an effective intervention for preventing HIV. There is some evidence that microfinance programs mitigate the consequences of HIV. The most successful project to date that has used micro-finance in a group-based lending format to prevent HIV in a community is the Microfinance for AIDS and Gender Equity (IMAGE) study in South Africa (Pronyk, 2005). This project used a combination of HIV and gender training and microfinance targeting women\u2019s groups. Study results showed a 55 percent decrease in intimate partner violence among program participants. There was also evidence of improved economic status within the household and empowerment among participants. The results did not show an effect on HIV incidence or condom use with non-spousal partners (Pronyk, 2005). In addition, access to microfinance programs can provide an opportunity and an audience for the delivery of information and education (for example, on HIV and other reproductive and sexual health issues) to otherwise hard-to-reach populations of poor women and girls.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "307a2c90-07be-459c-9b96-0e732f9d34ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "307a2c90-07be-459c-9b96-0e732f9d34ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fccc2e60d5a36544cf98462de597f8626ec1e1c1523d2306721673445e33f3c"}, "2": {"node_id": "17901004-2ebf-49e5-855a-430d84ab25ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0916c23e0657112a8b4e45aa156719bc03b187301d460f69811e2b118606b313"}}, "hash": "44aa141acd01e0993473aa0809ba0db224043a877ba7eb69b4a26b0382c2d840", "text": "HIV in the Workplace A recent report by the International Labor Organization (ILO) calls for a concerted effort towards a comprehensive national response by Governments and individual organizations to secure social protection and work place policies for people who are HIV-positive.

However, a more proactive role can be played by introducing gender-equitable HIV workplace policies and implementing HIV awareness programmes throughout a company. The involvement of HIV-positive women in workplace policy development and implementation to ensure the retention and employment of HIV- positive staff, including women, is essential (ICW 2006b). Benefits to staff should provide a range of appropriate care and support options that include but go beyond the provision of treatment \u2013 such as counselling, and having in place complaints procedures for those who experience discrimination. PWn + Positive Women\u2019s network (PWn+), Chennai has worked with the Tamil nadu state AIDs Control society (TnsACs) to place thirty three positive women as counsellors (PPTCT, ICTC, and ARV programs). TnsACs requires nGos that are funded by them to employ at least one positive person in that project. A large number of studies have repeatedly shown that investing in women is both the right thing to do (in moral terms) and the smart thing to do (in terms of economic and social pay-off (see, for example, Economist 2006; Quisumbing et al. 1995; Klasen 1999). That is why programmes that intend to promote and engender women\u2019s economic empowerment need to incorporate but also extend beyond the practical, short-term survival needs of women and their households. By addressing the longer-term, strategic (empowerment) interests of participants, such programmes can have a more meaningful and more sustainable impact \u2013 assisting not only individual women and girls, but by extension their households and communities. 121 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics The Women and Wealth Project \u2013 empowering HIV positive women economically and socially Economic security is one of the most pressing priority needs for women living with and affected by HIV in Asia. Particularly they include women economically challenged with an ailing husband, widowed by AIDS, disowned by family, or denied the right to inheritance and property of their late husbands. In many cases, these women put up a final defence line against impoverishment of the entire household including children. However, strong stigma and discrimination, compounded by lack of skills and work experience, often stand in their way to getting a job or accessing credit. In response to such emerging issues with a direct impact on human development and poverty, UNDP Regional HIV and Development Programme for Asia and the Pacific initiated the Women and Wealth Project (WWP) in late 2006, in partnership with a Thai NGO Population and Community Development Association (PDA) and UNDP country offices in Cambodia and India.

SEWA has an all India membership. It uses the dual strategy of struggle and development, thus enabling them to enter the mainstream of the economy. In this process, women have become more confident and autonomous. SEWA has helped workers organize around various issues, resulting in their being able to raise these with government and in the society in general. Self employed women workers and producers are economically very active and contribute to economic growth. They are mainly involved in production, trading and the service sector. However, in spite of their hard work and their contribution to the country\u2019s gross domestic product, they lack access to financial services that would help them to upgrade their work and productivity. Self-employed women lack working capital and ownership of assets. As a result, a large portion of their income goes towards interest on working capital and on goods for their trade. Local money lenders exploit their circumstances and the formal banking sector tends to be unresponsive to their needs. SEWA was established to fill this gap: since its inception it has been providing banking services to poor, illiterate self-employed women and has become a viable financial venture. SEWA provides a range of banking and other social services to its members in both urban and rural areas.

More importantly, the IMAGE Project mobilized microfinance participants, who tended to be older women in the community (mean age of 41 years), to be agents of change in their households and communities. An assessment of te project found the intervention to be effective in a number of ways. Participants experienced improvements in assets, expenditures, membership in informal savings groups and in nine indicators of empowerment, including autonomy in decision-making, relationship with partner, challenging gender norms, and participation in collective action. Among participants, the risk of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence in the past year dropped by 55 percent. The researchers who assessed the project concluded that \u201cgiven the linkages between violence and HIV, we suggest that existing development initiatives, such as microfinance, may provide an important entry point for addressing HIV in areas where poverty and gender inequalities continue to confound prevention efforts.\u201d (Pronyk et al., 2006) 125 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics IMAGE Project.

It also considers the relations between HIV, migration and trafficking as well as the situation in conflict areas. This sub-section provides an overview of the key linkages between migration, gender and HIV, and then focuses the lens on the issue of trafficking.

According to UNAIDS, the percentages can be high: in some countries 15 percent among men in the general population and 44 percent of men in mobile populations reported buying sex in 2004 (UNAIDS, 2006). It is not surprising then, that quite a high proportion of new HIV infections are contracted during paid sex, and a relatively high prevalence of HIV has been found among sex workers across the region. Male sex workers and transgender sex workers also have relatively high prevalence rates although data is more limited. In Viet Nam, HIV prevalence among female sex workers increased from 0.06 percent in 1994 to six percent in 2002. In Indonesia, the rate of HIV infection among female sex workers is 3.1 percent nationally but varies significantly from region to region (UNAIDS, 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1718d0a7-4ba9-4033-b930-de04203be889": {"__data__": {"id_": "1718d0a7-4ba9-4033-b930-de04203be889", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a5666abc39b984dba0a0288d2591c998c1cde790a8421a39b9a71f887fdcbfc"}}, "hash": "7a5666abc39b984dba0a0288d2591c998c1cde790a8421a39b9a71f887fdcbfc", "text": "In Jakarta, for example, prevalence reached 6.3 percent in 2003. In South and Southeast Asian countries other than India, the United Nations estimates that sex workers and their clients accounted for almost half of all people living with HIV in 2005 (UNAIDS/WHO, 2006). There are fears that commercial sex is having an increasing influence on the AIDS epidemic in China (http//www. avert.org/aidschina.htm). China\u2019s AIDS epidemic is expanding, and demand for commercial sex is apparently growing (Tucker et al., 2005). The Chinese government estimates that in 2005, sex workers and their clients accounted for just under 20 percent of people living with HIV nationally (Ministry of Health People\u2019s Republic of China/UNAIDS, 2005). High HIV infection rates also continue to be detected among sex workers in India. The government estimates that 8 percent of sex workers nationally are infected with HIV, which is almost nine times higher than the overall HIV prevalence rate for Indian adults (NACO, 2006). And the rates are even higher in some specific cities. Studies have detected 44 percent HIV prevalence among sex workers in Mumbai, and 26 percent in Mysore (NACO, 2005). Of growing concern in the region is rate of transmission from sex worker clients to their non-sex worker partners (e.g. wives and girlfriends). According to the Commission on AIDS in Asia (2008), it is the most important factor affecting the potential size of the HIV epidemic in most Asian countries. A recent study exploring this issue in Cambodia (Hor et al., 2005) found that 40 percent of the clients interviewed were having unprotected sex with non-sex worker partners, and that the rate of HIV among this group was over 9 percent - three times higher than the prevalence among police who were tested for the sentinel surveillance survey. Although the rate of reported condom use among sex workers was high (74.5 percent), it still fell below the 90 percent target set by the National AIDS Prevention programme. This study concluded that clients of sex workers are likely to be an important bridge for HIV transmission, and that condom promotion and HIV prevention programmes must urgently focus on non-sex 129 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics worker sexual relationships. Because condoms are not normally considered appropriate for use in marriage, such programmes will need to address a range of issues related to gender norms and tackle issues around the reproductive expectations and needs of married couples. Sex workers become vulnerable to HIV for a wide range of reasons. In some parts of the region, sex workers use drugs and share needles, an issue of particular salience in China, Indonesia and Viet Nam (UNAIDS, 2006; MAP, 2005). Studies often find higher rates of HIV infection amongst sex workers who inject drugs than amongst those who do not. For example, in Ho Chi Minh City, a 2003 study found that 49 percent of sex workers who injected drugs were HIV-positive, compared to eight percent of those who did not use drugs (MAP, 2005). Indeed, the overlap between drug use and sex work, particularly in Southeast Asia, parts of northern India and Indonesia, is of increasing concern. In all these countries there is an overlap between injecting drug use and sex work, such that male drug users frequently buy sex, female drug users are increasingly selling sex and female sex workers are injecting drugs. The infrequent use of condoms among sex workers and their clients is also cause for concern. Campaigns to encourage condom use among sex workers have met with a reasonable measure of success. For example, in Chennai, HIV prevalence among female sex workers fell from 8.2% in 2000 to 2.2% in 2006, a period during which 90 % of the clients claiming condom use during paid sex (Commission on AIDS in Asia 2008). The extreme stigmatization of sex workers in many, if not most, countries in the region adds a further dimension to their vulnerability. As Meena Seshu of SANGRAM has remarked: \u201cApart from the stigma already attached to [sex workers], society has further marginalized them as core transmitters of the HIV infection. It fails to understand and recognize that they are but links in the broad networks of heterosexual transmission of HIV. And that they constitute a community that bears and will continue to bear the greatest impact of the HIV epidemic.\u201d (http://www.avert. org/prostitution-aids.htm) It is important to note that sex work is not a monolithic category. There are a great variety of forms in which sex work takes place, ranged along a continuum from relatively formalized (as with sex workers who are based in brothels) to extremely non-formalized (as with women who occasionally", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1a8ef24-871f-4336-ab84-490c99a350eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1a8ef24-871f-4336-ab84-490c99a350eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56b481aca764897e411000b0273c4b1ef616e6a31850cd043b31834b5daa525b"}, "3": {"node_id": "db6e396a-91a9-418f-a6e4-f77b0b5f75d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dea26f1571e1c957705cacfad36b244ddc07569a5f99772a363926ca3edf3c76"}}, "hash": "663286c7d930f188b07a254682976bbf29144674c671e2c257a81d7ae431c27d", "text": "sell sex, or exchange sex for specific commodities such as food in times of great need).

Vulnerability to HIV is affected somewhat by where a woman is located (at any point in time) along this continuum, with the least formalized among them generally being more at risk of HIV infection. Vulnerability, however, is also mediated and shaped by a range of other factors such as age (with younger and older sex workers being particularly vulnerable), immigration status (women who are trafficked into sex work from another country being among the most vulnerable)1, whether or not she injects drugs, her history of sexually transmitted infections, and whether her entry into sex work was on her own accord or coerced. This range of factors affects the extent to which a given woman will have access to health care services (including reproductive health care, treatment of sexual infections, and HIV prevention, care and treatment), prevention commodities (such as condoms and contraception), and HIV prevention information, which may be targeted to more formalized sex workers. It may also 1 Silverman JG, Decker MR, Gupta J, Maheshwari A, Willis BM, Raj A. HIV prevalence and predictors of infection among sex trafficked Nepalese girls and women.

Women at the less formalized end of this spectrum tend to be at a particular disadvantage, as they are likely to be isolated, unprotected and quite vulnerable to exploitation, violence and discrimination \u2013 all risk factors for HIV. This is also a hidden population, about whom little is known and who therefore are difficult to reach with prevention information and commodities. Women who identify themselves as sex workers and work in a formalized sex work setting, may, in some instances, have their vulnerability mediated by the relative ease with which they are able to organize, network and provide safety nets for each other. They are also more visible, and therefore more easily reached by HIV and STI prevention programmes, treatment and care. Indeed, throughout the epidemic, women who formally identify themselves as working in the sex industry have been among the most likely to respond well to HIV prevention campaigns. Prevention campaigns aimed at, and directly involving the participation of, sex workers not only reduce the number of HIV infections that result from paid sex; they can also play a vital role in restricting the overall spread of HIV in a country. Proof of this can be seen in countries such as India, Bangladesh, Benin, Cambodia, the Dominican Republic and Thailand, where general reductions in the national HIV prevalence have been largely attributed to HIV prevention initiatives aimed at sex workers and their clients (UNAIDS, 2003). India\u2019s Sonagachi project, implemented by Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC), which mobilizes sex workers in Kolkata\u2019s red light areas into supportive Self- Regulatory Boards, monitors and protects women and girls working in those areas, and lobbies for their rights. This type of project is a prime example of directly involving sex workers as agents of change (see UNAIDS, 2000; UNDP, 2003). Within the Asia-Pacific region there is debate about whether HIV prevention will be more effective if sex work is criminalized or decriminalized. The HIV and AIDS community, however, has generally agreed that further criminalizing sex work will not only be ineffective, it may in fact exacerbate the epidemic (UNAIDS, 131 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics 2007). By driving sex work further underground, criminalization makes it more difficult to ensure that these women have access to the necessary services, commodities and social protections they need to moderate their vulnerability to infection.

Many past efforts to encourage condom use by sex workers have targeted information and commodities at the sex workers themselves. There are good examples where empowerment of sex workers organizations has led to increase in condom use as shown in Sonagachi, India. However, given that the ultimate decision about whether or not to use a condom resides with the male client, condom promotion efforts need to also be targeted directly to the clients themselves. This is especially relevant in countries such as Indonesia and Myanmar where women can be arrested for possession of a condom and in red light areas that experience high turn over of sex workers. Great success has been achieved in some countries in the region (famously Thailand, but also West Bengal) through incentives to brothel owners who require patrons to use condoms.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates are extremely high among sex worker populations, and effective screening and prompt treatment of these infections can have a significant impact on HIV transmission risk. It is likely that in the Philippines, for example, widespread, routine STI screening and associated HIV services for sex workers has contributed to slowing the growth of the epidemic there (MAP 2005).

Typically programmes to reduce needle-related HIV transmission and sex-related HIV transmission have been developed and implemented separately, or in parallel.

For additional examples, see UNAIDS (2000). Section 4.9.3 includes case studies of interventions aimed at women who have been trafficked into sex work (and see UNDP, 2003 for greater detail on these). THAIlAnD\u2019s 100% ConDom PRoGRAm By the late 1980s, the government of Thailand was becoming alarmed at the high rates of HIV in sex workers and their clients, and sought ways to increase condom use in their interactions. In the early 1990s, it began a pilot programme responding to the finding that sex work establishments requiring condom use or sex workers insisting on condom use often lost clients and money to those that did not. Owners who promoted safer behaviour faced the risk of losing business because men could simply go to another establishment or to a sex worker who did not require condoms. Regional Communicable Disease Control officials realized that one solution was to require that all sex workers in the province use condoms in every sex act. This would assure owners and managers that they would not lose business by enforcing the policies requiring condom use, since clients could not go anywhere else to obtain unprotected sex. The officials initiated a collaborative effort among local authorities, public health officers, sex establishment owners and sex workers to ensure that clients could not purchase sexual services without condom use in the province. When this programme was implemented, the rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) dropped quickly and significantly. Soon afterwards, the efforts were expanded with equally postive results in the surrounding provinces and several others in other parts of the country. In August 1991 the National AIDS Committee, chaired by the prime minister, issued a resolution to implement the 100% Condom Program on a national scale. The resolution stated: The governor, the provincial chief of police and the provincial health officer of each province will work together to enforce a condom-use-only policy that requires all sex workers to use condoms with every customer. All concerned ministries will issue directives that comply with this policy. By the middle of 1992, the 100% Condom Policy was in place nationally, and studies indicate a 90 percent compliance rate. There are clear indications that these efforts have had an impact on HIV transmission at the national level. Nationwide monitoring of condom use in brothel-based sex work and of levels of reported STI among men has shown a strong relationship between the increase in condom use and the rapid decline in STI. Studies found a tenfold reduction in STI incidence and a fivefold reduction in HIV incidence among young Thai men between 1991 and 1993 (Celentano et al. 1998). In short, the 100% Condom Program has been an important contributor to large-scale reduction of HIV transmission throughout the country.

The active involvement and empowerment of sex workers in generating sustainable responses through the formation Of: Self-Regulatory Boards\u201d has proven to be an invaluable best practice that is now being replicated globally, from Brazil to Thailand. The core elements of the project include strengthening networks and partnerships among sex workers\u2019 organizations and between state and non-governmental organizations; as well as targeting the community by involving sex workers themselves. One of the highlights, in terms of achievements of STD/HIV prevention was the rise in condom use in Sonagachi, from 2.7% in 1992, to a dramatic 60% in 1994, and 86% in 2005 (data from DMSC). 135 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics soCIAl mARkETInG oF ConDoms In A FEmAlE sTREET bAsED sEx WoRkERs InTERVEnTIon In DHAkA, bAnGlADEsH. SHAKTI, an HIV prevention project of CARE Bangladesh started working among street-based sex workers in early 1997 in Dhaka. Initially the peer educators were responsible for providing knowledge on STD/HIV/AIDS, condom use and the free distribution of condoms. The organization of sex workers, Durjoy Nari Shongo (Undefeatable Women\u2019s Committee) came into existence in February 1998. As the organization developed its capacity it was decided to hand over project activities to their organization in phased manner. Keeping in mind the sustainability of the project, it was decided to sell condoms through social marketing model and stop free distribution. The model was developed in 1999 together by the Durjoy Nari Shongo and peer educators. Durjoy Nari Shongo now purchases condoms in wholesale from a social marketing company and sells through women sellers at retailer price to sex workers. Initially, SHAKTI donated some condoms to seed the project. Subsequently, the profit from sale of condoms held create a revolving fund. The volume of condom sales is affected by external factors like police arrest, violence, political unrest, religious issues, and so on. The monitoring survey showed a sharp increase in condom usage; at the end of December 1998, only 39% of all vaginal and anal sexual intercourse were reported to be covered by condoms, which increased to 52.4% at the end of December 1999 and 65.6% at the end of December 2000. Involvement of sex workers\u2019 organization in social marketing of condoms appears to be a promising model for sustaining the safe sex intervention program.

This nexus is thought to be a key driver of the epidemics in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Viet Nam, as well as parts of India. The nexus is critical not least because the combined burden of HIV in these five countries is so tremendous. In all these countries there is an overlap between injecting drug use and sex work, such that male drug users frequently buy sex, female drug users increasingly are selling sex and female sex workers are injecting drugs. Adding fuel to this potentially explosive situation is the infrequent use of condoms in these relationships and the sometimes extreme stigmatization of sex workers and injecting drug users in many, if not most, countries in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d00fa0b1-a836-41b0-afb9-b1fb7f88e065": {"__data__": {"id_": "d00fa0b1-a836-41b0-afb9-b1fb7f88e065", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f55feb8e08fa06c685b1fc92d7fcd4b5106628c6e1c3fb35050888a652d00fb0"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1a6a995-ea21-4812-aa17-c1ec00d4ea15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "140e569b5275b02877659a58c8aa9c02e3d037a798fedb79fb505c58b51abc47"}}, "hash": "5befdfb6e99e46771f88343ed41291a70a3b97ed565d956ca24738536aa80586", "text": "Some data from the 2006 UNAIDS Epidemic Update helps to illustrate the situation: \ufffd\ufffd In China, drug users account for 44 percent of the approx 650,000 people living with HIV there. Almost half of injecting drug users (IDUs) in China is thought to share needles, and one in 10 engages in high- risk sex. Research has found that a large proportion of IDUs buy sex and at least half of female IDUs have at some stage sold sex (Liu et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2005). Sex workers who inject have a very high risk of HIV since they tend to have more partners, use condoms less, and are more likely to share injecting equipment than non-sex working injectors. \ufffd\ufffd In parts of India, the overlap between sex work and drug use is such that HIV prevalence among sex workers in Tamil Nadu is 50 percent. \ufffd\ufffd In Viet nam, HIV prevalence among injecting drug users increased from nine percent in 1996 to 29 percent in 2002 and 32 percent in 2003. It is higher among IDUs in certain cities. In Hai Phong, for example, 66 percent of IDUs are HIV- positive (VAAC/FHI 2007 \u2013 reported on JVNET 2/28/07). Condom use is sporadic at best among this population, although the purchase of sex by injectors is common. According to various studies cited by UNAIDS, large proportions of sex workers also inject drugs (20 percent of street-based workers in Ho Chi Minh City and 43 percent in Hanoi), and they are least likely to use condoms when having sex. In Hanoi, a study found that HIV infection levels were 1.6 percent among non-injecting sex workers, compared with 33 percent among those who injected drugs (Tran et al. 2005). \ufffd\ufffd Drug use is also on the rise in Pakistan, where there is also a significant overlap between injecting drug", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "452a5dc6-32e1-4add-939c-92a2583c6ae4": {"__data__": {"id_": "452a5dc6-32e1-4add-939c-92a2583c6ae4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cfba838924aed150dff365a1fb108475f2b818605daf3f181aba5a693809cdf4"}}, "hash": "cfba838924aed150dff365a1fb108475f2b818605daf3f181aba5a693809cdf4", "text": "use and sex work. Combined with very low levels of knowledge and awareness about HIV by those at greatest risk, this trend is especially troubling (one in four IDUs in Karachi had never heard of AIDS, while one in five female sex workers could not recognize a condom, and one in three had never heard of AIDS). The drug use/sex work nexus is also \ufffd\ufffd prevalent in parts of Indonesia, such as Papua, Jakarta, and Borneo. Injecting drug use is at the heart of the \ufffd\ufffd epidemic in malaysia, and threatens to increase the currently low rates in bangladesh, where HIV infection rates have increased from 1.7 percent in 2000- 2001 to 4.9 percent in 2004-2005. The fact that both sex work and injecting drugs are illegal activities presents enormous challenges for meeting the treatment and support needs of HIV-positive IDUs and their partners. Yet these data highlight the urgency of the problem, and the need to address it as a major focus of HIV prevention activities. Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 138 For women who inject drugs, the stigma of injecting drug use is added to other types of related stigma and discrimination. These factors combined can push women into behaviours that increase their risk of HIV. There is a higher likelihood that women drug users will: provide sex in exchange for housing, sustenance, and protection; suffer violence from sexual partners; and have difficulty insisting that their sexual partners use condoms. Women drug users may also rely on men to acquire drugs and injecting equipment and even to inject them \u2013 behaviours shown to increase the likelihood of injecting with contaminated equipment. Pregnant drug users are particularly vulnerable. They are less likely than other women to receive accurate information about the dangers of drug use during pregnancy or prevention of parent- to-child transmission of HIV. In some countries pregnant drug users are rejected by healthcare providers, threatened with criminal penalties or loss of parental rights, or coerced into having an abortion or abandoning their newborns to the state. Poor access to medication-assisted treatment jeopardizes the pregnancies of opiate-dependent drug users (International harm Reduction Development Program, 2007). Both injecting drug users and sex workers are potentially at great risk of contracting and transmitting HIV and other serious infections. Female sex workers who also inject drugs could therefore be at especially high risk. The close links between drugs and sex work have been known for many years. Many female sex workers in developed countries inject drugs and are HIV-positive (Gillies & Carballo, 1990). A study of injecting drug use and HIV infection among streetwalking sex workers in Ho Chi Minh City showed that those who also injected drugs had fewer years in sex work, more clients and more husbands/lovers who injected drugs (Nguyen et al., 2004). This study also showed that many of these women inject regularly, share injecting equipment, have a history of sexually transmitted diseases, and infrequently use condoms with both clients and partners (Nguyen et al., 2004). Another study in Viet Nam on drug use and sexual behaviours revealed that it is common for male drug users to partner with a specific sex worker \u2013 many of whom eventually begin to inject (Tran et al., 2004). Women who are spouses of male injecting drug users are highly vulnerable to HIV given the risk of contracting HIV through sexual intercourse compounded by the low probability of condom use. A study with male injecting drug users in Nepal showed that injecting drug users tend not to use condoms with those they feel close to and think are healthy. They apply this principle to sex with their wives, girlfriends and even sex workers. Many of these men report having multiple sex partners and did not tend to reflect on the possibility that they themselves could transmit infections to their partners (Family Health International-Nepal, 2002). In Pakistan, approximately 50 percent of men who inject drugs are married and regularly engage in unprotected sex with their spouses \u2013 a percentage that translates into an estimated 50,000 women being at high risk of acquiring HIV (Global AIDS Alliance, 2007). It is important to note that these gender-related vulnerabilities are layered on top of vulnerabilities that relate directly and solely to drug use in the region. An Asian Harm Reduction Network report (2001) found that across the region drug users are made especially vulnerable to HIV (as well as to discrimination, criminalization and excessive punishment, including violence) by policies that are affected by strongly held beliefs about drugs and their adverse effects on society.

Stringent laws exist prescribing severe punishment for all drug-related offences, including not only drug use but also possession of drugs and drug-use paraphernalia (e.g. needles and syringes). Such a policy position can make 139 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics it difficult to provide HIV-related services and support. Indeed, these penalties may actually forbid providing drug users with information or with the means to protect themselves against HIV infection. While widespread, this approach has not been successful in reducing either drug use or HIV prevalence associated with it. A harm reduction position recognizes the dangers of drug use, and seeks to create policies and programmes that eliminate the risks associated with the behaviour. Such an approach may involve some level of acceptance of drug use in order to provide or allow for the provision of, for example, constructive engagement with drug using communities and those serving them, provision of clean needles and/or replacement drug therapy to drug users. Harm reduction programming has had successes in reducing HIV transmissions among drug users, and from drug users to their non-using partners in many parts of the world, and is gaining ground in Asia as well (see, e.g. Viet Nam\u2019s new AIDS Law, at http://www.ahrn.net/Vietnam%20AIDS%20Law_ submitted%20to%20NA_21Jun2006.pdf).

The programme has also increased access to clean needles and syringes through vouchers redeemable at specially recruited pharmacies, especially those with extended business hours located in neighbourhoods where IDUs congregate. Communication materials convey messages that address needle/syringe sharing and barriers to condom use. The project also reaches IDUs at their homes and in tea stalls.

Migration data is largely not gender-specific, however, and female migrants are largely invisible in international migration statistics. This absence of gender-specific data hinders the understanding and appropriate assessment of women\u2019s role and needs in the migration process. Although much remains to be learned, it appears that while many women may migrate to be unified with family members living and working elsewhere, an increasing number of girls and women are forced to migrate. It also appears that women are increasingly migrating independently to meet their own economic needs and desires. This type of female migration may be a product of improvements in gender equality and an outcome of modifications in gender roles and women\u2019s status (UNFPA/IOM, 2006). People may move from one place to another seasonally, periodically or permanently for a range of reasons, which can be categorized roughly as follows: Voluntary and job-related mobility (e.g. 1. truckers, traders, free-lance sex workers); Legally required mobility (members of 2. the military, deported immigrants); Coerced mobility (political refugees, 3. persons trafficked for sexual or other forms of exploitation, persons displaced due to war-related population shifts); and Distress mobility (due to extreme poverty 4. and natural calamities).

Migrants are also at enhanced risk because they tend to be poor and lack access to social support networks, health and other social services. Indeed, the link between internal and cross-border migration and HIV is strong: It is estimated that 5 million people are living with HIV/AIDS in the Asia-Pacific region (UNAIDS, 2007). More than half of the PLHIV are in South Asian countries, all of which are labor sending countries. For a large number of people in the region, migration has become a key strategy to escape poverty. Migration is also an important development strategy for some countries, including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the Philippines, in which remittances from overseas migrant workers constitute a large percentage of national foreign exchange earnings. Economic need, including seasonal crop failures, is a primary driver of labor trafficking and internal migration for both women and men (Azad, Nandini). The vulnerability of women in these situations is compounded by the lack of social, medical and legal services, the absence of support structures, and low levels of awareness and knowledge about HIV. While for many people \u201cmobility is an important survival mechanism and a freedom,\u201d it also creates specific conditions of vulnerability that result from \u201clong periods of separation from family, removal from familiar behavioural norms and expectations, social and cultural, isolation and lack of access to information and services\u201d (UNDP, 2007). Therefore, the problem is not population mobility per se, but rather the unsafe conditions under which people move which increase their vulnerability to HIV. This could include increases in the number of sexual partners, the likelihood of unsafe sex and the connectivity of otherwise geographically delimited/closed sexual networks \u2013 all of which are related to the spread of HIV2 In addition, 2 Guest, P. 2002. \u201cMigration and the spread of HIV/AIDS,\u201d Unpublished paper.

Many women who are engaged in sex work are not necessarily trafficked but are extremely vulnerable to HIV given the illegal status of sex work in many countries in the region. A migration study in India among female sex workers found only five to 15 percent of women reported that they had been forced into sex work by trickery or coercion (personal communication, Ravi Verma, 2008) In many parts of South Asia, families often prefer to send off girls and young women who may be considered a burden at home while waiting for marriage, or who may be widowed or separated, as they are seen to be more likely than young men to send their earnings back to the family. Lacking education, these girls and women have limited livelihood possibilities in their own immediate communities where the majority of the others are also poor and unable to provide employment. While mobility increases the vulnerability of those who move, it can also increase the vulnerability of those who remain behind. For example, early in the HIV epidemics in Asia, long-distance truck drivers were identified as an important population to reach with prevention messages. It is estimated that there are over five million truck drivers in India, and they are three- times more likely than other men to have sex with someone who is not a regular partner. The truck drivers also have a rate of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases 10 to 20 percent higher than the average client of a sex worker (AVAHAN India AIDS Initiative, \u201cMeeting the Challenge\u201d). The wives of these truckers are at particular risk of HIV both because they are left alone in their villages for long periods of time and may themselves seek outside partners, and also because they have a much higher risk of exposure to HIV through unprotected sex with their husbands (condoms are not generally used with regular partners or spouses when their husbands return home). Violence against women is a further issue exacerbating HIV vulnerability for truckers\u2019 wives. One report (ICRW, 2005) found that 43 percent of truckers\u2019 wives in one district of Andhra Pradesh reported experiencing at least one form of physical violence in the previous 12 months, with sexual violence being particularly prevalent (see Section 4.5 on the links between violence and HIV).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e776ec2-8faa-4bdf-814f-efa20a9a7024": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e776ec2-8faa-4bdf-814f-efa20a9a7024", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb8b80ebab347a0fe54b5a18608f822a407435328c24c549c7ce89a9c5858566"}}, "hash": "bb8b80ebab347a0fe54b5a18608f822a407435328c24c549c7ce89a9c5858566", "text": "Women who travel abroad for work (whether for sex work or not, and whether the migration is voluntary or forced) also risk carrying HIV back with them to their husbands and partners at home. The situation is further exacerbated by HIV- and sex related stigma, which may lead women to conceal, their sero- status (see Hong et al., 2004). In this way, mobility can act as a bridge for HIV to move from mobile individuals into the general population. HIV and Trafficking Trafficking is a form of mobility and a phenomenon that substantially compounds HIV risk for those trafficked and their sexual contacts. The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons (2000) defines trafficking as: Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 144 \u201cThe recruitment, transporting, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of a threat of use of force, or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or of giving or receiving payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation.\u201d Trafficking has been found to be integrally linked to the lack of secure livelihoods which forces large numbers of people to leave their homes seeking income to improve the living conditions of their families, often uninformed of potential risks including trafficking and HIV infection. Although the majority of children trafficked are girls, there is evidence of trafficking of boys in Asia for the purposes of labor, begging, camel jockeys, and to work in the sex industry (Archavanitkul, 1998). Both HIV transmission and trafficking thrive in contexts of grave gender power disparity \u2013 that is, where a woman\u2019s worth is perceived as being low, where women have little autonomy relative to men, and where human rights are not accorded equally to women and men nor protected by the government. This situation results in the economic dependency of women on men, gender-based violence, unequal access to resources and many forms of exploitation \u2013 all key factors that have been strongly linked to HIV vulnerability and are associated with trafficking. Though lack of adequate data remains one of the fundamental weaknesses in exploring the linkages between trafficking and mounting appropriate responses, a recent study in Kathmandu by the Harvard School of Public Health shows a very strong association between trafficking, HIV and multiple layers of gender inequality (Silverman, 2007). The study found that about 38 percent of women trafficked into sex work were HIV-positive. Furthermore, the same study found that more than 60 percent of the girls trafficked into sex work before the age of 15 were HIV-positive, demonstrating the high vulnerability of young girls to HIV in trafficking. The research also showed that girls trafficked as minors spent longer amounts of time in brothels compared to other sex workers, extending their exposure to the virus and therefore putting them at a higher risk of HIV infection. It was found that each additional month of captivity in brothels increased their risk of HIV infection by 3 to 4 percent (Silverman et al., 2007). A great deal of trafficking occurs between countries in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, the Coalition against Trafficking in Women (CATW) Fact Book estimates that thousands of Burmese women are trafficked into Thailand for the purposes of sexual exploitation through abduction, with the promise of good jobs, or through the sale of girls from hill tribes (http://www.catwinternational.org/factbook). It is estimated that 50-70 percent of these women become infected with HIV. CATW reports that Vietnamese women and girls are trafficked to both China and Cambodia through abduction, promise of jobs or tourist trips, and match- making with foreigners who often sell and resell the women abroad. Japan, CATW reports, is the largest sex industry market for Asian women, with over 150,000 non-Japanese women in prostitution, more than half of whom are Filipinas and 40 percent of whom are Thai. These women and girls, far removed from their families and friends, with no power and fewer resources of their own, are exposed to HIV through repeated unprotected sexual contacts, which may include violence and other forms of exploitation as well. Indeed, studies show that brothel-based sex workers are most likely to become infected during their first six months of work (e.g. Kilmarx et al., 1998) \u2013 precisely the time when their bargaining power is at its lowest, when they may be forced to \u2018service\u2019 more customers, are less likely to be able to insist on condom use, and may be subjected to additional violence", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed862b4f-29e4-4868-81be-71fc0e5e99df": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed862b4f-29e4-4868-81be-71fc0e5e99df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e367b1c2cfe99f086fba63056691fa964725802d36a70bfb76465d1e49c51037"}, "3": {"node_id": "62e0ad20-824d-45bc-9246-5a0c4ab519c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c7c06f912f7c45c7a3fd492194c41798418d30cf549bc4331b697cbd0ba2c14"}}, "hash": "499fe174f4a33776ae14fd5b27749b0ec8e0bc0d2dd36330c0ed80524c8b6223", "text": "to be \u201cbroken in\u201d (UNDP, 2003). As UNDP (2003) explains, trafficking often includes sexual exploitation, and may also involve domestic servitude, unsafe agricultural labor, sweatshop labor, construction or restaurant work. Trafficked women and girls are made vulnerable to HIV infection both by being cast adrift from the networks of social support and reciprocity that may have been available to 145 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics protect them in their home areas, and through potential exposure during multiple, concurrent, unprotected and often violent sexual contacts. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) recently reported that India has become a leading destination for human trafficking, with over 35,000 young girls and women from Bangladesh and Nepal being brought into the country every year, primarily for prostitution and slavery (http://www.giftasia.org). Meanwhile, the age of those being trafficked is dropping. According to the UNODC, in the 1980s, trafficked girls were mostly 14-16 years old. By 1994, the average age was between the ages of 10-14, and by 2006, girls 10 and younger were being forced into the trade. It is possible that the fear of HIV infection is driving traffickers to seek out younger and younger women under the assumption that they would be less likely to be HIV-positive or it could be due to the prevailing \u201cvirginity myth\u201d among clients of sex workers (UNDP, 2003). As UNDP explains, \u201cAsia is facing a double emergency \u2013 a trafficked child or woman has greater chances of contracting HIV/AIDS because s/he is placed in the most vulnerable of situations with absolutely no control over his/ her choices\u201d (UNDP, 2003, 6). HIV, migration, and Trafficking The lack of safe, secure and legal channels for migration, drive unsuspecting and uninformed women and girls into the hands of unscrupulous agents and traffickers who promise them \u201cgood jobs\u201d and \u201csafe travel\u201d to work sites. Taking advantage of the increasing number of people in such vulnerable and often desperate situations, human trafficking has become the third most profitable organized crime business following arms and illicit drug trafficking, with an estimated market value of U.S.$32 billion (UNODC, 2007). An estimated 250,000 women and girls are trafficked from South Asia and 200,000 from South East Asia annually (UNDP Regional Programme for Asia and the Pacific 2008-2011). Women and girls trafficked into sex work have extremely unequal power relations with their \u2018buyer\u2019 or brothel owner. This makes them highly vulnerable to HIV infection. They are exposed to HIV through repeated unprotected sexual contacts, which may include violence and other forms of exploitation as well. A large majority of female sex-workers face extreme forms of violence at the hands of police and Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 146 clients. Women trafficked for sexual exploitation may become totally powerless and subject to greater violence and dangers, including forced sex without condoms.\u201d It is estimated that more than two-thirds of female sex-work is non- brothel based in some settings, particularly in South Asia. And about one-third of all female sex-workers are mobile for the reasons of safety and business. Over the last 15 years, there have been a number of approaches to addressing the gender-related risks of mobility and trafficking. Approaches include finding trafficked women and girls and providing safe havens and alternative income- generating options for them (also known as the 3 R\u2019s or Recovery, Rehabilitation/Repatriation (if applicable) and Reintegration); reducing the demand for trafficked women and girls by cracking down on traffickers and their contacts, such as \u201cmadams\u201d and pimps; reducing the need for mobility by increasing the resiliency and capacities of sending communities; and making migration safer for those involved. Some efforts utilize more than one of these approaches at a time. There remains considerable debate about whether and to what extent such efforts can and should involve law enforcement agencies. This debate often centres on the fact that victims of trafficking are themselves sometimes criminalized, whether as being illegally present in the receiving country, or due to the activities in which they are involved such as sex work. In Pakistan, for example, trafficked women in sex work are criminalized and imprisoned as having committed zina, or unlawful sexual intercourse outside of marriage (UNDP, 2003).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62e0ad20-824d-45bc-9246-5a0c4ab519c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "62e0ad20-824d-45bc-9246-5a0c4ab519c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e367b1c2cfe99f086fba63056691fa964725802d36a70bfb76465d1e49c51037"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed862b4f-29e4-4868-81be-71fc0e5e99df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "499fe174f4a33776ae14fd5b27749b0ec8e0bc0d2dd36330c0ed80524c8b6223"}}, "hash": "2c7c06f912f7c45c7a3fd492194c41798418d30cf549bc4331b697cbd0ba2c14", "text": "In addition, law enforcement may prioritize the repatriation of trafficked women over ensuring their well-being and respecting whether they want to return home.

Some organizations, such as Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal AID (LHRLA) in Pakistan, work closely with the media to raise awareness of policy makers and the community, and to advocate for policy change. Even when girls and women trafficked for sexual exploitation are rescued from captivity, they often face another layer of gross human rights violations and vulnerability. They are in some cases harassed and treated as criminals by the police due to the fact that they were engaged in sex work, forced into HIV testing without proper counselling, and detained or deported when they do not have legal documents. Furthermore, girls and women trafficked for sexual exploitation are often labelled as tainted and not accepted by their own family and community. Social sanctions against them are further compounded if they are infected with HIV. With few livelihood options and little social support, many are forced to re-enter into sex work, exchange sex for food and survival or become an easy prey for re-trafficking. Research conducted by the National Human Rights Commission in India (NHRC, 2004) reveals that about 25 percent of 561 respondents who were trafficking survivors for sex work were victims of re-trafficking. Eighty percent of these re-trafficking survivors cited the lack of alternative jobs back home as the major reason for becoming re-trafficked. A regional rapid assessment study by UNDP in South Asia calls for greater dialogue and collaboration between the anti-trafficking community and AIDS community, as HIV and human trafficking share many common contextual as well as consequential factors (UNDP, 2007). The report also emphasizes the need for laws, policies and programmes that address both human trafficking and HIV-related issues in a comprehensive manner. The need for attention to this issue has clear international backing. For example, the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) Declaration calls for governments \u201cto strengthen legal, policy, administrative and other measures for the promotion and 147 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics protection of women\u2019s full enjoyment of all human rights and reduction of their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS through the elimination of all forms of discrimination, as well as all types of sexual exploitation of women, girls and boys, including for commercial reasons, and all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful traditional and customary practices, abuse, rape and other forms of sexual violence, battering and trafficking in women and girls\u201d (emphasis added).

Great caution must be exercised in interpreting and implementing relevant laws. In March 2008, anti-trafficking legislation was enacted in Cambodia. However, it was used by the law enforcement authority to equate sex workers with traffickers, resulting in massive brothel raids and arrests of sex workers.

Set up in 1993 by a group of socially committed professionals to combat trafficking in women and children, it has done exemplary work in providing sustained and transformative care and support services to both the survivors of trafficking, including those who are HIV-positive, and to the communities where rescued girls are reintegrated. In the sprawling shelter home that Maiti runs, every woman and child in distress finds a place she can call her own. The organization has reached out to those marginalised and has shaped public consciousness on trafficking and HIV/AIDS issues. Maiti\u2019s uniqueness lies in its approach to care, support and reintegration of survivors of trafficking and HIV positive women and children. At the core of the care and support structures is a safe shelter where women who have been severely traumatised by the experience of being trafficked can seek refuge. But as they recover and move towards normalcy, they are offered access to many other mechanisms, which contribute towards reintegration. Medical care, psychological counselling, health and hygiene education along with awareness about HIV/AIDS, vocational training, non-formal education, assistance in finding job are among the services provided by the care and support programme. Among the international agencies and NGO\u2019s that support Maiti\u2019s programmes and projects are the UNDP, UNICEF, UNIFEM, Save the Children UK, Terre des Hommes, Save the Children Norway, The Asia Foundation and ILO. Maiti has entered into partnerships with South Asian NGOs such as STOP (Delhi, India), SANLAAP(Kolkata, India), Childline, Varanasi, and Maiti Mumbai, for better coordination of its efforts to rescue and repatriate trafficked women and children.

A key part of SANLAAP\u2019s work involves providing shelter for young women and girls who have been victims of trafficking or who are the children of sex workers in the community. There are currently 250 girls being sheltered by SANLAAP in 4 homes across the city. These girls receive education, skills building, psychosocial and mental health support, and access to legal aid. Since 2003 SANLAAP has been one of the major organizations in India giving training to the police on gender, trafficking laws and legislation and dealing with victims of trafficking. In 1996 SANLAAP created a process to repatriate Bangladeshi girls. In 2006 it became the standard operating procedure, and, with the help of UNICEF and the Government of India, will soon become the subject of a bilateral agreement between the two countries.

The active involvement and empowerment of sex workers in generating sustainable responses through the formation of \u2018Self-Regulatory Boards\u2019 has proven to be an invaluable best practice that is now being replicated globally, from Brazil to Thailand. DMSC see sex work as a \u2018contractual service negotiated between consenting adults and is committed to decriminalization of sex workers and their children. DMSC\u2019s work with trafficked women grew out of the innovative approach they developed for providing sex workers in Kolkata\u2019s red light district of Sonagachi, with treatment for sexually transmitted infections. In around 1996 DMSC helped with the creation of Self-Regulatory Boards, which were a way for sex workers to organize amongst themselves to control the exploitative practices within the trade, prevent the entry of minors, regulate the rules and practices, and institute social justice measures for sex workers and their children. Their objectives included mitigation of violence, establishing channels of information within red-light areas to identify minors being trafficked therein, providing trauma counselling and health care to trafficked women and children, repatriation of those rescued, and keeping in touch with those who are repatriated to ensure they remain safe and not re-trafficked. In the context of trafficking, DMSC use the self-regulatory boards to identify minors who have been trafficked into the sex trade, and to help them out of their situation. A key innovation of this work is the involvement of \u2018babus\u2019 (or regular clients) who keep an eye out for \u2018new faces\u2019, which they can then report to the SRBs for further investigation.

The conflict situation in the Asia-Pacific region is best described along a continuum from the relatively peaceful societies such as Malaysia and Viet Nam on one end, to countries characterized by long-term political control with forceful silencing of government opposition (such as the violence which occurred recently in Myanmar), to the ethnic and political tensions that have long smouldered and recently erupted in East Timor and Nepal. Natural disasters are also included here as they face similar issues related to displacement and disruption of services and legal and economic structures. While there is little peer-reviewed literature on gender issues related to HIV in conflict zones, recent research has challenged previous assumptions that armed conflict automatically increases HIV prevalence (Spiegel, 2004). HIV rates among displaced populations are often lower than rates in the more stable host countries. Increases in HIV rates in conflict areas are influenced by various factors including HIV prevalence in the host country and among the displaced population, the level of isolation of the displaced population, the length of the conflict, and the presence of international military or peacekeeping soldiers. Where HIV prevalence rates are higher in the host country, HIV is more likely to increase among the displaced population.

The use of rape and sexual abuse as a weapon of war has been well documented in conflict areas worldwide. Yet even in Sierra Leone, where there was a very high incidence of rape and sexual abuse, the post-conflict HIV prevalence rate was reportedly less than one percent \u2013 lower than in surrounding countries for which there is HIV prevalence data (Kaiser et al., 2002). However, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where there was a high level of sexual violence and a UN peacekeeping presence, HIV prevalence rates in eastern districts were between 15-24 percent, higher than surrounding areas (Save the 153 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics Children, 2001). Thus, the relationship between HIV and conflict is highly context specific. Regardless of whether conflict causes an increase in HIV infections, conflict undeniably creates a situation of HIV vulnerability for women and young girls. The UNHCR estimates that 80 percent of refugee and internally displaced populations worldwide are women and children. Rape and sexual violence against women are well documented weapons of war. Women are raped in refugee camps as they go out for firewood, or are raped by paramilitary groups to intimidate or maintain control of a geographic area. Women who are raped and become pregnant or HIV-positive rarely have access to health care services. Experience from Rwanda and Sierra Leone indicates that these women are often treated as social outcasts in refugee or internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, are socially isolated and even raped again inside the camps (Benjamin, 2001). In societies with existing gender inequalities, the economic and social disruption of conflict enhances unequal access to resources for women. This puts them at greater risk for transactional sex for basic needs such as food, shelter, protection and money. Conflict may cause separation of families, leaving women without the social protections of the extended family and friends. Women are also more vulnerable to weak or unenforced legal protections and if they have to leave their home country may by at increased risk for violence or other abuses. Land and property rights are also critical issues in post-conflict and reconstruction areas, and disproportionately affect women (UNCHS, 1999). In Banda Aceh Indonesia, the Indian Ocean tsunami destroyed land records and women who lost their husbands also faced enormous challenges in claiming rights to marital land and property (IDLO, 2007). Several other specific factors associated with conflict also exacerbate the HIV- related vulnerability of women. First, during conflict, public health infrastructures become inaccessible, particularly for complex services such as PPTCT or ART. Women must rely on breastfeeding where there is no access to infant formula, thus increasing the risk of mother to child transmission through breast milk. Second, the presence of international military, paramilitaries or other armed groups has also been associated with HIV infection among young girls and women in conflict zones. HIV rates among military conscripts have been found to be higher than in the civilian population (McGinn et al., 2001, as cited in Spiegel, 2004; Smith, 2002, as cited in Spiegel, 2004) and peacekeeping troops often come from countries with high HIV prevalence rates. In a recently concluded rapid assessment on the HIV risks and vulnerabilities of conflict-affected populations in Sri Lanka, it was found that vulnerabilities relating to HIV infection include poverty and lack of livelihoods, migration, displacement, disruption of families, food insecurity, gender based violence, and alcohol and substance misuse; all of which particularly increased the HIV vulnerability of women affected by conflict. (Joint HIV Assessment Mission of Conflict-affected Populations in Sri Lanka, 2008 UNHCR, UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNDP Regional Centre, UN Resident Coordinator\u2019s Office, IOM, FPA-Colombo, OfERR, World Vision, HelpAge,) In South Asia, the history of opiate drug use adds another dimension to women\u2019s HIV vulnerability. Conflict can create fluctuations in drug supply and pricing. One example is in the community associated with injecting drug use in the region of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan known as the Golden Crescent. While men account for most of the injecting drug use, their behaviour also puts women sex partners at risk of HIV infection through unprotected sex. During the Afghan war, the Taliban restrictions and military presence created increased prices and limited heroin supply in Pakistan. Among drug users who breathe the fumes of heroin (known as \u201cchasing the dragon\u201d), more switched to injecting synthetic opiates such as buprenorphine, which were less expensive and widely available in local pharmacies (Strathdee et al., 2002). Hankins et al. (2002) also point out that fluctuations in drug supply can create increased drug", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f50800c8-1dde-49b5-a88d-c95f7607995e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f50800c8-1dde-49b5-a88d-c95f7607995e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eabff747e0c49d39dde60ebca7a9fbca36a37552a7099f0bf45c05a5670528a5"}, "3": {"node_id": "10606d77-480b-4039-9dc8-49c6f5b5e82a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4921db07778220764ae5dbfe35eff8fecb34c95b28cd59aff5ce22bb14629a82"}}, "hash": "1b7d390a0dd44ad25df12062b847c8c2b1c368e3bdca5ec457d82328629bb73e", "text": "use where drugs may be used as in-kind payment for food or other necessities in conflict zones and bring in other drugs which are injected with higher frequency.

Ensure that programs are gender and \ufffd\ufffd culturally sensitive in order to deal effectively with the disadvantages women face due to conflict (e.g., the creation of women-only clinics like the Polyclinic of Hope in Rwanda). Address stigma and shame associated \ufffd\ufffd with rape and sexual violence by providing organization and social support to women living with HIV and to women who have experienced rape or other forms of violence (e.g., the Kenya Network of Women with AIDS). Incorporate conflict resolution and \ufffd\ufffd peace-building themes into HIV and AIDS programmes that are specifically tailored to women and into more general programmes in post-conflict societies (e.g., the Community Responses to Refugee Crisis: A Better Way to Cope project of the Society for Women and AIDS in Zambia). 155 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics PRomIsInG PRACTICEs TRAInInG AnD sTRuCTuRAl CHAnGE FoR mIlITARy PERsonnEl There are few examples of HIV interventions that address gender issues related to HIV in conflict zones in South Asia. An intervention conducted among conscripts in the Royal Thai Army did not directly involve a conflict zone, however, it is an example of an HIV intervention that effectively reduced HIV incidence among military personnel. The Social Mobility and Sexual Behaviour (SOMSEX) programme in Northern Thailand may provide a model for developing effective HIV interventions for other military conscripts. The model was multisectoral and established clear policies for the military regarding HIV. Several epidemiological studies were conducted to establish a databank on military conscripts for surveillance activities. Training was provided using a peer education approach with educational sessions, condom distribution, and improved recreational facilities on military bases to prevent boredom. (UNAIDS, 2004). TRAInInG FoR un PEACEkEEPERs Refugees International provided an in-depth study with the aim of developing a set of policy recommendations for increasing gender sensitivity among UN peacekeeping forces. These recommendations include mainstreaming gender, using personnel performance appraisals as a mechanism for instituting attitude changes within the organization, focusing on civilian personnel, training peacekeeping troops, improving access to the UN complaint system, and empowering women post conflict (Martin, 2005).

PRADET, a nongovernmental organization in East Timor, operates the Safe Room project which provides specialized medical and counseling care for people who have experienced domestic violence, sexual assault or child abuse. Safe Room is housed in a small building on the grounds of the National Guido Valadares Hospital in Bidau, Dili, which is open seven days a week during all daylight hours. PRADET has developed a forensic protocol for medical examinations in which injuries are recorded systematically so that this medical evidence can be used later if a legal case is prosecuted. A mental assessment and counseling is also provided. Staff follow up with patients to monitor their mental and physical health.

Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 156 The International Development Law Organization has produced a guidebook and a video to raise awareness and provide information on key legal concerns around land, inheritance and guardianship and on the processes through which issues related to these concerns can be resolved. The guidebook is based on previous literature and original data collected among 12 tsunami-affected villages in Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar (IDLO, 2007). In Sri Lanka, the Suriya Women\u2019s Development Centre is a group of displaced Tamil women who have successfully integrated gender into their development programming. Suriya uses song and street drama to educate the community about violence against women (see Bell, E. et al., 2003). The Canadian NGO, World University Service (WUSC), supports projects in Sri Lanka including courses on welding, bicycle repair, carpentry and mechanics in both mixed classes for men and women and in classes for women only. Gender training is included in all classes (Bell et al., 2003). Experiences in Africa have made clear that regional coordination is essential for providing continuity of care in HIV prevention, care and treatment services, particularly for complex medical care such as anti-retroviral therapy and prevention of parent to child transmission. Three examples of such regional coordination are the Great Lakes Initiative on AIDS (GLIA), the Oubangui-Chari HIV/AIDS Initiative, and the Mano River Union Initiative on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS and UNHCR, 2005). A recent UNHCR review indicated that regional programmes may help to provide continuity of services across countries, ensure similar HIV testing algorithms and treatment, improve programmes efficiency and lower costs for prevention and treatment services (UNAIDS and UNHCR, 2005). Dr. kamran lankarani, minister of Health and medical Education, Islamic Republic of Iran It is estimated that today about 2 million refugees are living in Iran. They are mostly from Afghanistan-the large majority of them are women and children. The Government of Iran has always made, and will continue to make available, all health interventions including HIV prevention, treatment and care for our refugee populations \u2018Without discrimination against them. So far, all HIV prevention and care programmes including methadone maintenance therapy and other harm reduction measures, have been provided free of charge to all refugees living in Iran. The Government is also providing them with antiretroviral medicines, based on national care and treatment protocols. The country\u2019s HIV policy, developed recently with the participation of all stakeholders, devotes a chapter to HIV prevention among refugees and migrant populations. In order to respect the dignity of the individual and uphold human rights, which in our constitution includes the right to health, and considering also that refugees are integrated within our host populations, Iran is committed to maintaining and promoting the health of its refugees. 157 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics REsouRCEs Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC).

There are clear connections between men\u2019s behaviours and attitudes related to sexuality and gender relations and the spread of HIV in Asia. The 2008 Report of the Commission of Aids in Asia reports that: HIV transmission in Asia is driven primarily \ufffd\ufffd by three high-risk behaviours: unprotected commercial sex, injecting drug use and unprotected sex between men. Most women living with HIV in Asia have \ufffd\ufffd been infected by their husbands and boyfriends who currently or in the past have engaged in paid sex work or drug injecting The numbers of men who buy sex and the \ufffd\ufffd turnover of clients visiting sex workers are the main determinants of the speed and level of most Asian epidemics Relatively few women in Asia have sex with \ufffd\ufffd more than one partner, and HIV-infected women are unlikely to transmit the virus to someone else (except during childbirth) Given these factors, prevention responses to the epidemic will include engaging with boys and men around", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "740f1df5-4137-4c12-8726-55549278b890": {"__data__": {"id_": "740f1df5-4137-4c12-8726-55549278b890", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7992eec2d7e4a341f293cbb3b902eae3474dcfbf5d43dbe6d7ed18ef525fd24c"}, "3": {"node_id": "a5edbf0e-7f1d-4a69-87db-644ae87905d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f69d20744c1ff843e7f9af9b4c7bac1b988d14f186043007b78fb26467a6c95"}}, "hash": "bd0b6088ecd7ecaff11dabb76d6903ac8b7aedb8131f1f5833e8374e30f0b4d2", "text": "complex issues such as condom use, MSM and other sexual practices, gendered attitudes and behaviours. Yet, working with boys and men is not a discrete or \u201cstand alone\u201d approach to HIV prevention, treatment or care. Understanding the varying positions of boys and men, and the effects of prevalent gender norms on men in Asian societies, is part and parcel of any analysis of factors behind the spread of the epidemic and for any proposed strategies for prevention. Following from such a gender analysis, project approaches of \u201cinvolving boys and men\u201d take different forms. These can be categorised in different ways, however these are fluid and overlapping categories, not distinct domains. These categories include: targeted projects and service provision that \ufffd\ufffd address issues and needs specific to boys and men, or are shaped to be more responsive to boys and men and the complexity of their lives. These are sometimes referred to as \u201cmen\u2019s health\u201d projects. Projects that involve men as partners with a \ufffd\ufffd goal of strengthening women\u2019s health and safety (women\u2019s empowerment projects) projects that involve both women and men \ufffd\ufffd (boys and girls) and consider the effects and consequences of gendered behaviours, roles and relations on society (gender equality) longer term prevention initiatives that aim \ufffd\ufffd to transform harmful gender norms for boys and men for the health and safety of all (gender transformative) Like women and girls, boys and men are not a homogenous group. The experiences, positions and attitudes of boys and men do vary widely, even among men in the same community. Men are fathers and sons, friends and co-workers, young and old, leaders and followers, husbands and boyfriends, and these roles have different shades of meaning across the region. Despite the diversity of individual boys and men, there are prevalent gender norms for men, or masculinities, that dictate a very limited, and often harmful, set of roles and behaviours for men. GEnDER noRms AnD mAsCulInITIEs Gender norms are the generally accepted definitions for being a woman and a man - what is considered \u2018normal\u2019 for the different sexes - by a given society or group. Gender norms are taught, modelled and enforced in complex ways - through friends and families, institutions and schools, through laws (civil, customary and 163 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics religious), through art and literature, the media and cultural activities. All of us, girls and boys, women and men, learn, try out, teach, and even enforce gender norms. The term masculinities describes gender norms for men. They are how societies define what men should be, do and not do because they are men. They are commonly held ideologies about men and how they ideally should behave in a given setting. The plural form conveys that there are many definitions for- and ways of being - a man, and that these do change over time, lifecycles and from place to place. The plural form also hints towards the hierarchies that stratify different types of men, characterised by different types of masculinity along a spectrum of powerful and dominant to disempowered and marginalised. At its core, understanding work with men for gender equality and HIV prevention hinges on understanding the dominant gender norms for men and women, how they are entrenched in societies, and how these norms help divide power and resources between women and men and among different groups. It is striking how the same dominant notions of manhood are so often repeated. No matter where dominant norms are identified or by whom, the answers are surprisingly the same. The common denominators are gender norms that describe men who are: strong and brave, breadwinners, attractive, protector, leaders, decision makers, heterosexual and sexually active and experienced. Dominant masculine norms dictate that men are entitled to privileges over women and their bodies - higher pay, more access to jobs, resources and political participation, as well as unpaid services and pleasure from women. As a study on masculinity in India puts it more simply, \u201cMen\u2019s roles and responsibilities were largely understood through three main roles: those of provider, protector and procreator\u201d1. There is nothing inherently wrong with many masculine norms, and all societies have positive examples of safe and healthy ways to be men. However dominant masculine norms become problematic when they are narrowly and strictly interpreted. Simply put, dominant 1 Kumar, Ch.

ConsEquEnCEs oF DomInAnT GEnDER noRms on HIV TRAnsmIssIon AnD CARE The manner in which boys and men grapple with and subscribe to dominant models of masculinity contribute to HIV vulnerability in a number of ways. Compared with women, men have more sexual partners. Clients who buy sex are primarily men. Men\u2019s attitudes concerning condom use and negotiating sex are greatly shaped by gender norms that grant men perceived entitlements to pleasure from women and control over women\u2019s bodies. Men are overwhelmingly the perpetrators of violence against women and other men. Gender-based violence is, in one brief definition, violence used to keep in place restrictive gender norms. Dominant models of masculinity are often equated to heterosexuality, sexual experience, skill and multiple sexual partners. Some young men may feel pressured to acquire sexual experience early and to have many sexual partners. These masculine norms lead some into experimenting with sex at a young age and in unsafe ways, or to buy sex (UNAIDS, 1999). Men who hold attitudes and beliefs that prioritize men\u2019s pleasure over women\u2019s or assume men have rights to women\u2019s bodies increase women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV and AIDS. There are specific sexual practices, sometimes preferred by men, which also increase women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV (UNDAW, 2003). The stigmatization of men who have sex with men often forces individuals to keep their sexual behaviour secret and deny their sexual risk, thereby increasing their own risk as well as the risk of their partners, female or male (UNAIDS, 1999). A study with nearly 970 men from three states in India exploring the notion of masculinity and its links with violence found that men endorse initiating and controlling sex as an important marker that constitutes sexual satisfaction. This was especially true for young educated men and men from higher economic groups. Most disturbingly, nearly 60 percent of the men who agreed that the ability to sexually satisfy was an important marker of masculinity felt that force during sex was a characteristic of sexually satisfying a wife/partner. Young men and men of middle social status were most likely to endorse the use of force during sex (ICRW, 2002). Condom use has a direct relation to perceived notions of masculine sexuality and pleasure. Noar and Morokoff (2001) documented the effects of \u201cmasculinity ideology\u201d on condom usage and sexual and reproductive health in general. Their findings indicate that traditional male gender norms lead to \u201cmore negative condom attitudes and less consistent condom use\u201d and promote \u201cbeliefs that sexual relationships are adversarial.\u201d Community assessments undertaken by the International HIV/AIDS Alliance found that the most frequently cited reasons given by men for not using condoms and for having multiple partners were about sexual pleasure. In the Cambodian assessments, men were frank in stating their unwillingness or inability to deny themselves their sexual desire. Notions of gender and sexuality underlying men\u2019s behaviour not only influence the transmission of HIV, they also influence disclosure, treatment, care and support. Dominant gender norms can taint men\u2019s attitudes about what it means \u201cto be strong\u201d and \u201cin control\u201d, and consequently their sexual behaviours, risk taking and use of healthcare. Men are less likely to seek preventative care and an HIV testing, to disclose a positive test result, or seek care and support outside the home. It is well established that fear of violence at the hands of their partners acts as a significant barrier for women to disclose their status. A UNAIDS study conducted with men in Tanzania shed light on men\u2019s lack of involvement in care and support and revealed that on occasion \u201cmale heads of households would wish to do more when their partners fall ill but were curtailed by cultural definitions of maleness and the roles defined which determine masculinity\u201d (Aggleton & Warwick, 1998).

This approach is based on the premise that gender norms do change and that change can be influenced in differing ways. Despite dominant masculine norms there are boys and men who want to challenge and change these norms but feel unsupported. Qualitative observations from around the region suggest that some young men want to change and challenge the unequal power relations between women and men and accompanying harmful masculine norms. Yet, many men do not know how to go about this change, or if others feel the same way within their families and peer groups. There is therefore need to view men and boys as potential partners, not as merely obstacles, and provide spaces for sharing those voices of change and create supportive system within the communities and families of young men and boys. At the project level, there is evidence that efforts to transform individual behaviours and beliefs can and do work. However, more work is needed with communities, institutions and at the policy level to create a broader conducive environment for change. A recent WHO/Promundo meta- evaluation reviewed 58 programmes involving boys and men - including in the areas of HIV/AIDS prevention, gender-based violence, fatherhood, and maternal and child health. Of these projects 29%, or about a third showed solid evidence of having led to behaviour changes among men, 38% showed reasonable evidence of having led to attitude change, and the rest were unclear or showed only knowledge change. Those programmes that specifically sought to question or change norms about manhood as part of their intervention \u2013 what are often called \u201cgender transformative\u201d programmes \u2013 showed even more evidence of attitude and behaviour change on the part of men and boys who participated. The WHO-Promundo evaluation review also confirmed that a combination of individual interaction (general in group discussion sessions) together with community or mass media messages were general the most effective in achieving attitude and behaviour change with men. Additional research conducted by Promundo (forthcoming) in Brazil suggests that studying adolescent boys who do not conform to traditional expectations of masculinity can help us identify a number of factors associated with gender equitable attitudes among young adolescent males. These factors include: acknowledgement of the costs of traditional masculinities, access to adults who do not conform to traditional gender roles, family intervention or rejection of domestic violence, and a gender equitable male peer group. The creation of long-lasting change will involve identifying these positive norms, engaging communities in discussion about them, and building upon them to create the outcomes sought (UNDAW, 2003). Because unequal gender norms and the HIV vulnerabilities they create are entrenched in communities and institutions, it is also necessary to look to communities and institutions for the resources and opportunities to support individual change and reflect positive gender transformation. Efforts to end gender-based violence have found that violence prevention efforts that come from and engage members of the community have a greater effect (see Pronyk et al., 2006). This is true for HIV prevention with men and boys as well. As many of the current initiatives involving boys and men take place at the local project level, and their impact and potential have yet to be scaled-up to the public policy domain. One way to support this scaling up process is to identify what kinds of policies and laws can build a Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 166 more conducive environment for men\u2019s active engagement in HIV prevention and achieving more gender equality, how men can play greater roles in the implementing existing laws, and advocating for the rights of women and girls. suGGEsTED DIRECTIons FoR PRoGRAmmEs The following are some of the lessons learned from the project level move towards multi-sectoral and \ufffd \ufffd integrated programmes for men and boys; encourage programmes working on violence, health, asset creation and HIV to incorporate specific strategies to reach out and involve boys and men. \ufffd Integrate HIV services within the larger \ufffd family planning and health services, and specifically involve men in prevention efforts of transmission of HIV to their children and/ or in the care of HIV-positive children. \ufffd Engage men and women and boys and \ufffd girls.

The curricula for these programmes use a wide range of activities- games, role plays, and group discussions-to facilitate an examination of gender and sexuality and its impact on male and female sexual health and relationships, as well as to reduce violence against women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cd6beb4-8e6f-4c72-b619-abd2eed0cbd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cd6beb4-8e6f-4c72-b619-abd2eed0cbd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b7c22dafef4e5578b0c946922bdf8cb55f3cce2cc353ade6827af39ac32898c"}, "2": {"node_id": "30946943-cba7-436d-a2c9-b7033a70f48c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9bba152e6ab84324b91dd9094be6cbb7d89a3fd668bdda7582f7c4f8a796672e"}}, "hash": "560ec70892add4e14dc61f22b77a066f483d6a553d050cc295a09a0bdf1a72b8", "text": "MAP has been successfully Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 168 yAARI DosTI (mumbAI AnD GoRAkHPuR) The Horizons Program/Population Council, Instituto Promundo, CORO for Literacy, Mumbai, Daud Memorial, Gorakhpur and MAMTA, New Delhi conducted operations research in urban slums in Mumbai (in the western state of Maharashtra), and in rural villages in Gorakhpur (in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh) to examine the effectiveness of various interventions, group education activities and life style social marketing campaign, designed to improve young men\u2019s attitudes", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00ee4f68-e086-4763-a3bf-7af5d1731e2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "00ee4f68-e086-4763-a3bf-7af5d1731e2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9931f010177a0a965ec9e87cdbcfb63f8b2f9782867caaa8f219991f8306ed8"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c933afd-9a79-4d34-aeb8-775ed37c8fa4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3b4ff6029a00376418769794c9a6c523c267f5499fb67598dd8a74f73359e21"}}, "hash": "e645ebaf2cef4d6507f4a22385b24e3c0b798bfc4a497cd4dff590c23cba78c7", "text": "toward gender roles and sexual relationships and to reduce HIV risk behaviors and partner violence. The sample included married and unmarried young men aged 16-29 years old in urban settings and, aged 15-24 years in rural settings. The results suggest that young men became less supportive of inequitable gender norms after participating in the interventions, whereas in the comparison groups, there tended to be little or no positive change, or the changes were in the wrong direction. Similarly, there were significant improvements among intervention participants in key outcome indicators, including condom use, partner communication, partner violence, and attitudes toward PLHIV. The domain of domestic life and child care seemed to fare best whereas the violence domain seemed to fare particularly poorly in the urban site Nevertheless, the study documented a significant reduction in reported partner violence among the intervention groups, whereas there was a significant increase among respondents in the comparison. It was evident that attitudes toward violence are very deeply rooted and thus may be more difficult to change. Study findings indicate that men perceive violence as a tool to control women and justify it through various reasons For detail see : R. Verma, J Pulerwitz, S. Khandekar, V.

Another widely respected programme is Program H, which engages men and boys in the discussion of masculinities. Its operating strategy is based on the natural variation in young men\u2019s views about gender inequalities and gender violence. This intervention, adapted in India and Tanzania, and now being adapted in Viet Nam, builds directly on insights gained from listening to the voices of those young men who openly question gender injustice. Another example of an organization engaging boys and men in critical reflections about masculinity, both in group educational sessions and via community and mass media campaigns, is the work conducted by an Indian NGO Sahayog that has started a multi-state effort to engage men at the community level to start local efforts to reach men with messages to end violence against women and girls. A literature review identified 57 interventions with men and boys in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), gender-based violence, fatherhood and HIV prevention that had some impact evaluation and in some way applied a gender analysis \u2013 a recognition of salient versions of manhood as being part of the problem \u2013 in the intervention. Of the 57 studies, 24.5 percent were assessed as effective in leading to attitude or behaviour change; 38.5 percent were assessed as promising in leading to attitude or behaviour change; 36.8 percent were assessed as unclear (see Barker, Ricardo & Nascimento, 2007). 169 CHAPTER 04 | Key Topics mEn As REsPonsIblE PARTnERs (GuJARAT AnD uTTAR PRADEsH, InDIA) Partnering with local organizations, and adapting the global Men As Partners (MAP) program, EngenderHealth developed community-based, peer-driven interventions with young men and boys. The results were dramatic: men thoughtfully engaged in discussions, role-playing and games about gender issues. The MAP workshops created real change in participants\u2019 attitudes toward women. Furthermore, it is the first gender-related HIV awareness and support program of its kind in Asia. EngenderHealth India has produced several videos that document the goals, approaches and successes of its MAP work. In these digital stories, Indian men share how their HIV-positive status has affected their attitudes and the lives of their families and friends. Each one highlights a variety of interrelated topics such as sexuality, disclosure, masculinity, positive living and prevention. The videos were produced as part of EngenderHealth\u2019s Men As Partners\u00ae in Positive Prevention program, which works in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh to engage HIV-positive men as responsible partners in prevention. The men have all become MAP advocates, working to help other HIV-positive people in their communities.

Their involvement in the response to the HIV epidemic has challenged stigma and discrimination and made communities more knowledgeable about access to treatment resources and the need for policy change. Despite this, the involvement of HIV positive people in the struggle against the epidemic and its consequences remains largely tokenistic. Governments, bilateral and multilateral agencies and NGOs have struggled to implement the Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV Principles and to work in genuine partnership with HIV positive people. Yet the engagement, support and active participation of affected people are vital to any effective, humane response to the epidemic. Since 1994, the Asia-Pacific Network of People Living with HIV (APN+) has been working to address issues of importance to HIV positive people in the region. It now has members in 28 countries and continues actively to promote the rights of positive people, including their right to be meaningfully involved in all aspects of the response to HIV and AIDS. In partnership with the UNDP Regional HIV and Development A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 4 FOREWORD \u201cThis Guidance Note provides important practical tips for working with groups of people living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region.\u201d Programme and networks of positive people in the region, APN+ has developed and supported a number of events and activities for HIV positive groups and individuals in the region over the past few years. In doing this, the organisation has always sought and encouraged the active participation of HIV positive people. One example is the Empowerment of PLHIV Initiative, conducted over the past three years in 14 countries, which strove to involve positive people in network-building, organisational and leadership development, and advocacy-skills training.

Shiba Phurailatpam Regional Coordinator The Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV and AIDS (APN+) A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 5 M W hile the features, extent and pace of the HIV epidemic vary from country to country across the Asia-Pacific region, the challenges faced by 5 million people living with HIV in these countries share many common characteristics. Prominent among these challenges are the frequent gross violations of human rights they and their families must endure as a result of stigma, discrimination and systematic marginalisation that deprives them of jobs, social capital and hope. People living with HIV represent the quintessence of the epidemic: the nexus at which human rights, gender, governance and human development issues intersect. It is they who bear the greatest burden and pay the highest price. The frequent opportunistic infections facilitated by HIV often carry away breadwinners, or require treatment that rapidly exhausts whatever scant savings and assets the afflicted household may possess. Such are the burdens of living with HIV. Yet the people who bear them - the people most affected by the epidemic - are often excluded from participation in the response to it. Over the past few years, the Asia-Pacific region has seen increasing efforts to rectify this situation through the formation of self-help networks intended to strengthen PLHIV empowerment and involvement in the response. These networks serve many useful purposes: they allow PLHIV to speak out and discuss their needs and concerns in a safe environment, offer a range of useful services and provide a sturdy collective platform from which PLHIV can claim their rights. A MESSAGE FROM UNDP REGIONAL HIV AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME FOR ASIA AND THE PACIFIC \u201cUNDP has spearheaded efforts to support PLHIV movements under the Asia-Pacific Initiative for the Empowerment of People Living with HIV.\u201d 6 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 7 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS Women, too, are coming together in the face of the growing feminisation of the epidemic, which places disproportionate burdens on them and contributes to their impoverishment in the region. Women living with and affected by HIV in many countries are joining hands to address and act collectively upon issues and challenges specific to them and their children. UNDP has spearheaded efforts to support PLHIV movements under the Asia-Pacific Initiative for the Empowerment of People Living with HIV. Important achievements of the initiative include the emergence and growth of PLHIV networks and leaders; the development of regional-level platforms for mutual support; the extension of previously unavailable services to PLHIV and their families; the growth of collective regional advocacy on rights, needs, and issues; and growing public recognition that the contribution of PLHIV is critical to the success of the collective response to the epidemic. This last achievement is of particular importance because it has promoted the formation of organisations extending support to PLHIV networks; there are more such organisations active today than was the case even a few years ago, before the Initiative commenced. Notwithstanding these signs of progress, large gaps still exist in the capacity of PLHIV networks in the region. Substantial strengthening and scaling-up will be needed before the potential contribution of PLHIV can be fully realized regionally, nationally and locally. Meanwhile, existing networks need support from and partnerships with various stakeholders on a continuing and equitable basis. This Guidance Note, based on the wealth of knowledge and experience accumulated during the three-year span of the Empowerment Initiative, is designed to help forge such relationships, thus facilitating an optimal response to the HIV epidemic in the region. Its production would not have been possible without the collaboration and support of APN+ and the positive networks that participated in the Empowerment Initiative and SWASTI. I would like to express my gratitude to all these individuals and groups for their unstinting partnership and their dedication to the development of a strong, effective and people- centred response to the HIV epidemic in Asia and the Pacific.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5fff3c3-95f4-488f-bb47-26fb05c3453b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5fff3c3-95f4-488f-bb47-26fb05c3453b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-partnership-networks-people-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific-guidance-note-development-practitioners", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Working in Partnership with Networks of People Living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific -

Habiba Akthar, Executive Director, Ashar Alo Society, Bangladesh I t is now widely recognized in development circles that local ownership and the participation of beneficiaries are indispensable if one wishes to secure sustainable results from any initiative. It is similarly accepted that meaningful participation in programme and policy initiatives by people living with HIV is indispensable to any effective HIV/AIDS response. Unfortunately, the inclusion and participation of positive people in the Asia- Pacific region has so far tended to be marginal. Although the GIPA (Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV/AIDS) Principle 1 was articulated more than a decade ago, putting it into practice has proved to be a challenge. In fact, the principle cannot be implemented without social and institutional changes at several levels. Yet it is clear that this must be done before an effective response to the epidemic can be mounted. The importance of working in equal partnership with people living with HIV cannot be overstated. Such partnerships are necessary in order to ensure several important results: Positive people locate the HIV response within the framework of human rights, dignity and gender equality enshrined in international treaties and covenants and bring it within the scope of the Millennium Development Goals; They bring to bear valuable real-life lessons, derived from the experiences of people living with HIV, on the discourse regarding HIV policy, planning and programming; and They help combat stigma and discrimination, which drive the epidemic underground and lead to the spread of HIV. The purpose of this Guidance Note is to facilitate equal, effective and synergistic partnerships between development organisations/practitioners and PLHIV networks. Ethically, it is grounded in the same human-rights principles as those of GIPA: empowerment, non-discrimination, ownership and active, meaningful participation. Functionally, its aim is to improve future interventions by groups working with PLHIV networks in other contexts. It is a practical guide, based on a wealth of experience and learning drawn from PLHIV networks and their supporting partners in several countries across the Asia-Pacific region. The data on which it draws were obtained during the course of the Asia-Pacific Initiative for the Empowerment of PLHIV (abbreviated hereinafter as EI or the Empowerment Initiative), a three-year project supported by the UNDP Regional HIV and Development Programme and implemented in partnerships with APN+ and INP+. Based on the GIPA Principle, EI focused on building the capacity of PLHIV for empowerment, in part through increasing their capacity to promote implementation of the principle itself. 1.1 The context: from involvement to empowerment EI facilitated the setting up and strengthening of 17 positive networks in 12 countries of the Asia-Pacific region 2 over the period 2002-2005.

In addition, the initiative assembled a useful overview of country situations with respect to prevalence rates, state and civil society responses, political and legal frameworks, network origins and structures, and the socio-cultural contexts that fuel stigma and discrimination. These data, together with the experiences gained, challenges faced and lessons learned by participating networks, constitute a valuable pool of resources: from it, useful guidelines could be developed for organisations working in partnership with networks and groups of positive people on capacity building and empowerment and on addressing stigma and discrimination in order to achieve a more effective HIV/AIDS response. To this end, a workshop was held in Bangkok, Thailand in May 2006 to deliberate the experiences and processes of the Empowerment Initiative. Participants included representatives of positive networks from seven countries and from the Asia-Pacific Network of Positive People (APN+), as well as from partner NGOs working with the networks, HIV focal points from three UNDP country offices and the UNDP Regional HIV and Development Programme. The workshop had two objectives: first, to take stock and plan forward for the next phase of EI; second, to create a participative environment for the development of guidelines on how to engage PLHIV groups and networks as equal and meaningful partners in programme and policy work. 1.2 Multilateral support for the HIV/AIDS response: the role of development practitioners The UN system has a significant role to play in any member country\u2019s national response to the HIV epidemic. Within the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for each country, the UN is mandated to provide technical assistance to the government. Since development goals are now inextricably linked to the causes and consequences of the HIV epidemic, this mandate implies UN involvement in the response to the epidemic. In its areas of comparative advantage, UNAIDS co-sponsors work on the HIV/AIDS response. In many countries, it supports the work of national AIDS authorities through the The Empowerment Initiative The Empowerment Initiative focuses on the empowerment of PLHIV and their groups through national and regional networking for mutual support, experience-sharing, advocacy and capacity development in order to: - establish and strengthen PLHIV organisations - facilitate care and support for group members; & - enhance advocacy and leadership skills The Initiative is implemented in partnership with the Asia- Pacific Network of PLHIV (APN+) and the Indian Network for PLHIV (INP+). Direct support for capacity development is provided to 17 networks in 14 countries across the Asia- Pacific region. A virtual Asia-Pacific PLHIV Resource Centre has been established to take forward regional advocacy, facilitate capacity transfer among PLHIV groups, disseminate information, provide space for all Asia-Pacific PLHIV groups to set up their own Web sites and facilitate networking among these 17 groups as well as among a coalition of PLHIV individuals and groups from 23 countries of the region. - From Involvement to Empowerment: People living with HIV/AIDS in Asia-Pacific. \u201cI promise that AIDS will remain a system-wide priority for the United Nations.\u201d - Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, addressing the General Assembly, New York, 21 May 2007 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 12 Box 1.1 Expanded Theme Group on HIV/AIDS. This forum includes bilateral donors and technical agencies. More importantly, in terms of the concerns of this document, it is supposed to include representatives from networks and groups of people living with HIV. Because of the breadth and depth of its involvement with member countries, the UN system is very well placed to advocate a multi- sectoral HIV response, support national leaderships and encourage the political commitment needed for effective action at the national level. Moreover, the United Nations is mandated to uphold, promote and respect human rights in its work. Human rights-based approaches to development emphasize non-discrimination, attention to vulnerability and empowerment. This fits well into the work on HIV/AIDS, particularly with respect to work in partnership with networks of positive people.

The following central principles were used in its development: The GIPA Principle (see box 1.2), which must be at the core of the HIV response; Empowerment of networks and groups of people living with HIV; Equal and meaningful partnerships between PLHIV networks, groups and various support organisations; and Experiential learning from PLHIV networks, groups and the organisations supporting them. These principles can provide guidance for many different types of organisations involved in working with positive networks and groups on the response to the epidemic. For example, the term \u2018support organisations\u2019includes the following: Multilateral donors and agencies (UN agencies, Asian Development Bank, EU, ASEAN and SAARC secretariats at country, regional and global levels); Bilateral donors working at country and regional level (AusAID, DFID, CIDA, JICA); National AIDS authorities, sub-national government agencies and their counterparts involved in prevention, capacity building, care and support, advocacy and related work; other government agencies involved in 3 Position Paper on GIPA. 2004.: APN+ 4 For more information on UNAIDS co-sponsors' division of labour, see Technical Support Division of Labour: Summary & Rationale. 2005, UNAIDS.

The GIPA Principle GIPA stands for Greater Involvement of People with HIV/AIDS, and derives from a principle embedded in the Paris AIDS Summit Declaration of 1994. At this summit, the leaders of 42 nations met together to determine how they could respond effectively to the AIDS crisis. The Declaration, signed by all nations attending the meeting, acknowledged the central role of people living with HIV (positive people) in AIDS education and care, and in the design and implementation of national and international policies and programmes, to tackle HIV and AIDS more effectively. It also acknowledged that for positive people to take on a greater role in the response, they need increased support. Article 1 of the Declaration resolved to facilitate this greater involvement of positive people. It states that: The success of our national, regional and global programmes to confront HIV/AIDS effectively requires the greater involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS... through an initiative to strengthen the capacity and coordination of networks of people living with HIV/AIDS.... By ensuring their full involvement in our common response to HIV/AIDS at all \u2013 national, regional and global \u2013 levels, this initiative will, in particular, stimulate the creation of supportive political, legal and social environments. The Declaration committed governments to develop and support structures, policies and programmes that would facilitate the greater involvement of positive people. This has since been adopted by UNAIDS as the GIPA Principle, which was reaffirmed in 2001 at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS. Why Do We Need GIPA? The GIPA Principle is important for several reasons. Publicly acknowledged involvement of empowered positive people helps reduce stigma and discrimination and has great power to break down fear and prejudice. Positive people bring the unique perspective of their experience to the range of organisations and agencies working in AIDS. They have a great deal to contribute towards the challenges posed by the epidemic provided they are given the opportunity to spell out their needs on an equal platform with government and non- governmental organisations. We have learnt by now that prevention must go hand in hand with care and support; they form a continuum. Meeting positive people significantly improves others\u2019 attitudes to AIDS (Takai et al., 1998).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e999bacb-25fb-43cd-bcc8-b92fc752e14a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e999bacb-25fb-43cd-bcc8-b92fc752e14a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-partnership-networks-people-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific-guidance-note-development-practitioners", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Working in Partnership with Networks of People Living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific - A Guidance Note for Development Practitioners", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-partnership-networks-people-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific-guidance-note-development-practitioners", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "988b2fcc975bb362a7059ad6c820b2cb56466c0201fa7383683f8a528e2754df"}, "2": {"node_id": "37c9fc55-aa0c-4271-99e8-990f6b450e1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-partnership-networks-people-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific-guidance-note-development-practitioners", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a4248e6956ed194334c7f773149963bddcd4a381ad44149309ea04944481e13"}}, "hash": "942cd12e5c7e8a23c5bafa137e6bd3342f0660025cb203642f39a822cf221df8", "text": "When people living with HIV put a face on AIDS, when they are heard to speak out and seen to be involved in policies and programmes, the impact is enormous and profound.

ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO NETWORKS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV Section 2 W hen positive people become partners in the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, they are required to play new and important roles, both as individuals and as members of groups and networks. 5 These roles are critical to the overall containment and reversal of the epidemic. As individuals, positive people must cope with changes in lifestyle, livelihood and income, as well as in their social and family relationships. When they join HIV positive groups and networks, they must learn to work effectively alongside other people from different backgrounds. As network members, they must set to work on issues such as stigma and discrimination, care and medical treatment, and national and international policy and programme implementation. This work calls for courage and determination. It also demands a variety of resources, both internal and external. The help and ongoing support of able and sensitive collaborators and partners is essential if they are to play their vital part in the response to the epidemic. Organisations and individuals who support positive people and their networks need to keep this context in mind. Several key issues of importance to positive people are discussed in this section based on the discussions and recommendations of representatives of positive networks in the Asia-Pacific region. Financial support of networks and individual members Before they can become active as members of networks, the financial needs of positive people need to be addressed. These include increased healthcare expenses on the one hand and, very often, reduced incomes on the other. Some will require special nutrition, others housing (their current environment may be unhealthy and conducive to infection, or they may simply be thrown out of their homes because of HIV- associated stigma). Unless these concerns are addressed, it is difficult for positive people to devote time and effort to network activities. Positive groups and networks need financial resources to set up, develop, sustain and grow. Their need for financial support is gradually being put on the agendas of governments, the donor community and other funding entities. Often, however, the response does not match the need. Funding to positive networks continues to be sporadic rather than planned. Furthermore, any funding received is usually project-based and does not cover organisational costs such as salaries, travel and office rent. In many cases, positive people providing expert information and ideas to groups working in HIV/AIDS are expected to volunteer their efforts. In unfair contrast, the other participants in these working processes are usually the paid employees of various organisations. Capacity and skills development More often than not, the only factor network members have in common is their HIV positive status. Coming from diverse educational, social, economic and linguistic backgrounds, their skill sets are often at variance with those demanded by their function as network members. Moreover, they are often coping with the personal and social consequences of their positive status while attempting simultaneously to play their part on the network. 5 In EI, the generally accepted distinction between a group and a network is that the group is more informal and not registered. A network is usually registered. There may, however, be local variations. In Lao PDR, for example, registration is not possible under current legal provisions; yet for all practical purposes, the country\u2019s HIV positive group functions like a network similar to those in other countries of the region.

A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 17 Management of a network and its members is not easy. It demands special skills and capacities. If positive people are to participate in and contribute to policy design, programme implementation, networking, advocacy and capacity-building, they must have specialized training and experience. In the past few years, positive persons all over the world have demonstrated that, with appropriate capacity building, they can take up these new roles and achieve significant results in them. Thus, adequate support for capacity- building among positive people and networks is of great importance. Membership diversity As stated earlier, positive networks often include members from different sections of society whose only common attribute is their HIV positive status, who may have different needs for emotional, physical and financial support. Their social position, language, religion, education, wealth, caste, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and culture are all highly variable. Hence they will also vary widely in their need for support and capacity-building. For example, better-educated and relatively well-off positive people, who are able to take care of their own needs, often do not seek support or contribute to the network. Very poor and poorly-educated people, on the other hand, may need a great deal of support without being able to contribute much. The network therefore has to evolve common issues, plans and actions that take into account the diversity of its membership and the fact that only a relative few have the capacity to take up its most challenging tasks. Care and support Strong networks can emerge only if the fundamental care and support needs of members and potential members are met. A network member must be healthy and active, both physically and mentally, in order to play her/his role in designing, enhancing and implementing the HIV/AIDS response. 6 Consequently, one important area of involvement for networks lies in helping HIV positive people obtain treatment, care and support. Besides preserving these individuals\u2019 health, care and support activities have other benefits: they build network membership, enhance the influence and status of the network (as it is seen as providing an important community service) and help reduce HIV- related stigma and discrimination. Network operations Different networks operate in different ways, depending on their socio-cultural context as well as on the factors listed above. Network meetings, for example, can take different forms. Small group meetings may be more appropriate in the early days of a network or when the comfort level of new members has to be given special consideration. Advocacy and networking, on the other hand, often demand large group meetings, which may be difficult to arrange in certain socio- economic contexts or where stigma and discrimination are severe. In some tribal or rural cultures, outdoor meetings may be preferred. Often, members who live far from the network centre may be unable to participate as actively as they wish. \u201cLack of access to antiretroviral treatment is a global health emergency\u2026To deliver antiretroviral treatment to the millions who need it, we must change the way we think and change the way we act.\u201d - LEE Jong-wook, late former Director General, WHO 6 \u2018Accessing Resources\u2019, Positive Development: Setting up self-help groups and advocating for change. A manual for positive people. 1998: GNP+ A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 18 Network constitution, structure and processes The way a network forms will influence its composition and subsequent functioning. For example, one that has come into existence based on the common concerns of a group is likely to function in a democratic, non- hierarchical fashion. But whatever its origins and however informal its functioning, a network needs proper systems and documentation for its organisational health, strength and sustainability. Sometimes a network may have only a few active members \u2013 those with language and other relevant skills that are required at the outset. Such members tend to be overworked with so much responsibility at local, national and regional levels. But over-dependence on a few key individuals slows the process of capacity-building and the taking-up of network tasks by a larger number of members. This retards the healthy growth of the network and the broad-basing of responsibility among members, potentially compromising the sustainability of the network. On the positive side, the development of a strong corpus of second-line leadership has been observed within the HIV positive movement. The number of positive networks is increasing and the movement as a whole is daily growing in strength.

SUPPORT OFFERED AND REQUIRED BY NETWORKS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV Section 3 3 P eople living with HIV offer a diversity of skills and experiences that can greatly enrich the response to the epidemic. While they may not possess detailed medical knowledge, for example, they are in an unusually advantageous position to encourage other HIV positive people to obtain proper treatment and to adhere to their treatment regimens. They are also in an excellent position to collect information about the treatment, care and support needs of positive people. Such potential can be put to best use in partnerships between positive groups and support organisations such as multi- and bilateral donors, NGOs, CBOs and academic institutions. This section deals with the kinds of support offered and required by networks and groups of positive people in key areas of the response to the epidemic. Assessments and monitoring of HIV responses What PLHIV networks can offer Positive groups and networks are able to provide the most accurate information on the impact, both positive and negative, of policies and programmes that are part of the response. They are in a good position to identify gaps in the response and point to where new or different policy intervention and programmes are needed. The experiences of PLHIV help them provide detailed information on the vulnerability of different sections of the population, as well as on stigma, discrimination and human- rights violations. PLHIV networks can provide human resources for conducting research and for monitoring and evaluating programmes. Such initiatives also provide capacity-building opportunities with respect to network members. Programme feedback and contributions to learning in the form of members\u2019first-hand experience. Role models for good practice. What PLHIV networks need Positive people will need updated information in their own language on national and international policies and programmes, their rights and entitlements, and potential sources of funding. Positive people need the opportunities and The meaning of GIPA GIPA does not mean that there is an imperative for all positive people to reveal their status in public, although it is clear that those who do so make a major impact on public perception and the more people who are open, the greater the potential for a reduction in AIDS-related discrimination. UNAIDS has described a pyramid of possible levels of involvement of people diagnosed with HIV. At the first level, positive people are recipients of services and can provide feedback to those planning and implementing these services. Many positive people move to the next level of the pyramid, as contributors to prevention programmes and as public speakers. Fewer of them progress higher to become implementers of programmes, for example as outreach workers or peer educators. A few are recognised as experts on a level with other public health professionals. At the peak of the involvement pyramid, positive people are decision-makers in policy and project design. \u201cWe heard that there are funds for setting up a National Network of PLHIV. But we don\u2019t know where to get the official information, where should we follow up.\u201d \u2013An HIV positive activist from Pakistan A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 21 3 Box 3.1 skills necessary to research and evaluate programmes meant for them. Support organisations can advocate the provision of such opportunities in various decision- making forums and provide funds for such training. Treatment, care and support What PLHIV networks can offer PLHIV networks can provide links between positive people seeking treatment and appropriate service providers, resulting in improved target group access, follow-up and feedback in care and support initiatives. For example, in Pakistan, the New Light AIDS Control & Awareness Society, a positive people\u2019s network, acts as a bridge between positive people seeking treatment and service providers. Evidence shows that where people living with HIV are involved in the HIV response, the results include better adherence to ARV medicine, reduced stigma and discrimination, and more people taking HIV testing (see Box 3.2).

With so many HIV interventions and programmes available, there is an ever- present and increasing demand for counselling services. Network members can be of great value in providing and strengthening the quality of peer counselling, pre- and post-test counselling and home-based care. Positive people can give a human face to the epidemic that is often reduced to just statistics and reports. What PLHIV networks need Information about the availability and means of accessing treatment, care, support and funding for medical expenses are among the critical needs of positive people. Many also require nutritional support, alternative means of livelihood and ways to augment their income so that their additional expenses can be met.

If \"3 by 5\" is to make the intended impact, it must call on the community for help, and jettison the lip- service to which so many are addicted. And the key element of the community is the People Living With HIV/AIDS, who are the real experts, and must be acknowledged as such. They should be consulted on every aspect of the treatment process, and they should be seen as helping to mobilize the community to work, in an equal partnership, with the medical facility dispensing the treatment.

They can provide important inputs on human rights, stigma and discrimination that can be factored into programme design, implementation and M&E. Positive people come from diverse backgrounds. Many have experience in development sectors such as education, health, microfinance, employment generation and public services, which have a direct bearing on initiatives to mainstream the response to HIV/AIDS. Networks can provide links between positive people from diverse backgrounds and the planners and implementers of programme interventions. Routing an intervention through a network benefits the network as well as the support organisation and the target group for the intervention. What PLHIV networks need All responses to the epidemic, whether to do with prevention, care, treatment or education, must recognise and respect human rights based on the dignity and autonomy of the individual. PLHIV need to be empowered technically, socially and financially, so that they can participate actively in the response and live with dignity. PLHIV networks require funding and technical support so as to participate in HIV- related programmes and interventions. The support organisation needs to demonstrate its commitment to the GIPA Principle and build the knowledge, capacity and commitment of its employees on implementing GIPA. Advocacy What PLHIV networks can offer: PLHIV are at the centre of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and are therefore of critical importance to the success of any response to the epidemic. Many positive people have the skills and experience to undertake public advocacy on issues of importance to them. They can help clarify understanding of their needs as a group and bring focus to advocacy. Their involvement strengthens the call for positive change. Their presence builds campaign solidarity and strength by adding numbers and diversity.

Box 3.3 sensational media coverage. What PLHIV networks need: In terms of advocacy, it is essential for support organisations to recognize and emphasize that the decision to go public with one\u2019s status rests entirely with the HIV positive person. Once this is recognized, positive people need support for their advocacy in the form of funds, materials, skills and capacity-building. Support is also needed to plan and sustain advocacy. Access is needed to decision-making forums where PLHIV can advocate and win support for their issues. This means access to public events such as conferences as well as to decision-making bodies such as governments and donor or technical-assistance consortiums. This access needs to go beyond tokenism. Networks need strong, sustained support to help build capacity in several areas. These include leadership skills, organisational development, administration and finance, communication and advocacy, networking and media relations. National networks can draw considerable strength and support from their counterparts in other countries, provided they are able to communicate effectively; this makes it vital that at least some network members acquire capability in English communication. An important demand made by positive people is that they be given opportunities to use their skills and be supported with continuous capacity-building rather than stand-alone workshops or sessions. \"Many women would rather not get the treatment they need to save their lives or stop their children from contracting HIV/AIDS because they do not want, or do not know how, to cope with the fear and stigma of HIV/AIDS.\u201d - Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, U.N.

The only way of making progress against the epidemic is to replace shame with solidarity, and fear with hope.\u201d - Dr. Peter Piot, Executive Director, UNAIDS T his section provides guidelines for organisations working, or wishing to work, with networks and groups of people living with HIV (PLHIV). Such organisations, called support organisations in this Note, include non- governmental organisations (NGOs), community-based organisations (CBOs), academic institutions, and bilateral and multilateral donor organisations engaged in the HIV response in a particular country or region. General guidelines and principles for effective partnerships are listed at the beginning of the section. Those relating to specific areas (country scenarios, the selection of partners, resource and funding, technical support, governance, coordination and systems, and monitoring and evaluation) are discussed in separate sub- sections. These guidelines may be applied to any multilateral or bilateral organisation with a national presence and the capacity to work with national partners, including governments and civil society. Such organisations may, in addition, have regional and global links. 4.1 General guiding principles Some principles that will help build effective partnerships between groups or networks and support organisations are given below. Develop and implement a work place policy on HIV. It is critical that organisations supporting positive groups and networks have in place a strong work place policy on HIV to ensure there are no discriminatory policies and practices against people living with HIV and that their management and staffs are sufficiently sensitised on issues related to HIV and positive people. Organisations can refer to the ILO Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work in establishing such policy. Plan and implement your response within the framework of the GIPA Principle, human rights, equity and gender equality. Ensure that there is clear understanding of GIPA within the organisation, and of what it implies for programme implementation. There are several challenges and social barriers that an organisation planning to support positive networks will have to take into account. For example, the GIPA Principle clearly articulates the importance of working in equal partnership with positive networks. In most countries, however, stigma and discrimination play an important part in reducing the effectiveness of interventions taken up by support organisations. HIV/AIDS is a relatively new and rapidly- changing field of work. Detailed planning will be needed to ensure greater and more meaningful involvement of positive people in any proposed programme intervention. Accordingly, the relevant staff capacities will The importance of involving positive people in the HIV response Positive people have a great deal to contribute towards the challenges posed by AIDS, if they are given the opportunity to spell out their needs on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "197e0067-dc5a-4c08-8a7b-f74690c2fb9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "197e0067-dc5a-4c08-8a7b-f74690c2fb9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-partnership-networks-people-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific-guidance-note-development-practitioners", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Working in Partnership with Networks of People Living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific - A Guidance Note for Development Practitioners", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-partnership-networks-people-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific-guidance-note-development-practitioners", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9854b8302222103e404ee35c6a174240ebc68775b79c9a5cd2494ecd49478a40"}}, "hash": "9854b8302222103e404ee35c6a174240ebc68775b79c9a5cd2494ecd49478a40", "text": "an equal platform with government and non-government. We have learnt by now that both prevention and care and support need to go hand in hand. It is a continuum. Meeting positive people significantly improves people's attitudes to AIDS (Takai et al. 1998). When people living with HIV put a face to AIDS, speak out and become involved in policies and programmes, the impact is enormous and profound. Positive people challenge the myths and misconceptions about HIV/AIDS. They make people realise that anybody can contract HIV. Positive people can perform valuable functions. They can be very powerful AIDS educators, counsellors, and policymakers. Their involvement in the response also builds up the morale of other positive people. The essential link between protecting human rights and promoting public health suggests that a greater pool of positive activists must be encouraged. Box 4.1 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 27 have to be reinforced before programme formulation and implementation can commence. Positive groups and networks are equal partners in all processes and outcomes, in planning and implementation and in monitoring and evaluation. Positive people will be the prime movers in all decisions and actions regarding their activities; support organisations will inform, support and facilitate but not \u2018do,\u2019 \u2018implement,\u2019 or \u2018control\u2019. The experience of the Empowerment Initiative shows that, once a group or network is formed, it will prioritize and take up issues of importance to its members. For example, in Korea, the positive network KANOS is one of the key groups protesting human-rights violations in a move to provide blood banks with lists of positive people. The empowerment of positive people means they must have the time and space to learn, act, make mistakes and innovate. Accept mistakes as part of learning and strengthening. HIV positive people have shown repeatedly that, even with minimal support, they are equal to such tasks as group-building or advocacy. A key demand they make of support organisations is to help them develop the capacity to take on such responsibilities. To build, expand and sustain a positive group or network, it is necessary to develop leadership capacity among a second and third line of potential successors to its current leadership. It is also important to build the group\u2019s capacity to handle a variety of responsibilities \u2013 from finance and office management to the treatment, care and support of members, from advocacy to partnerships with government. Set up early, and sustain, a system for regular and meaningful interaction with stakeholders. An important lesson to be drawn from EI concerns the need for regular interactions with partners in the HIV response. In China, where Marie Stopes International played the role of support NGO to AIDS Care China (a network of positive people), substantial interaction with the network began quite late in the project. A donor agency can avoid this by helping to set up a system for learning and sharing at the outset of any partnership. Be mindful of contradictory messages and positions among different partners. Forums that allow for regular interaction 28 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS \u201c(Numbers) don\u2019t convey the full and true reality of AIDS.They do not tell us of the human implications for the individuals directly affected, for their families and their communities. That is why I will be meeting today with a group of United Nations staff living with HIV. I am proud that these staff members, in coming together as the UN+ group, have the courage and strength to speak up, to challenge stigma and discrimination, and to work to make the UN a model of how the workplace should respond to AIDS.\u201d - Ban Ki-moon, UN Secretary General between positive people and other stakeholders in the response will help their participants evolve a common and consistent stand on relevant issues. Still, there will be areas where stakeholders disagree. Regular dialogue can help to secure agreement on roles and responsibilities and on what action is best suited to address a particular issue. Ensure the broadest possible participation and sharing. One of the realities of EI was that network activities tended to be confined to big cities. A number of difficulties faced by positive people from small communities and rural locations who wished to participate. Many had to travel long distances. Language differences, too, were often a barrier to participation. To overcome these difficulties, more resources have to be invested in local- language materials and transactions. Also, since positive people have different skills and come from diverse backgrounds, it is important to match available skills as closely as possible with suitable tasks and functions and to invest in appropriate, sustained capacity-building programmes.

An important role support organisations can play is that of timely information provider, enabling networks to make informed choices about such aspects of the response as providing resources for positive people, learning opportunities, treatment options, policy changes and livelihood choices. Accountability to the positive community demands that support organisations take the initiative in this area. Another important aspect of accountability is the maintenance of confidentiality. In this context, it is important that decisions with regard to interactions with the public and media are led by the network. Have risk-management strategies and backup plans in place. The unique social dimensions of the HIV epidemic include stigma and discrimination that can result in hostile reactions to group or network initiatives and programme interventions from the public or some \u201cThere needs to be a fully concerted effort on behalf of all partners to play a more participatory role in the response to HIV/AIDS.

This can be achieved by further strengthening the meaningful involvement with PLWHA to create an enabling environment, one that involves promoting human rights, empowering PLWHA and encouraging the widespread participation in policy and program development as equal partners and without relying on tokenistic representation.\u201d - Greg Gray, former Regional Coordinator, APN+ 29 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS sections of it. To deal with these, it is necessary to have more than one plan of action in place. It is also vital to undertake step-by-step planning, taking all factors into account, before any action commences. The agreed plan should contain ideas for coping with anticipated problems and alternative strategies for reaching the original objectives. Ensure that actions do not increase stigma, discrimination and marginalization. Support organisations and partners should build support in key constituencies for issues related to positive people. This can help offset the effect on public perceptions of group or network interventions that might otherwise increase the stigmatization of positive people and discrimination against them. Such stigmatization and discrimination are faced by networks and their members in many countries. Apart from compromising the effectiveness of interventions, they also cause deep personal distress. An active member of the South Korean network KANOS points out newspaper photographs of a human-rights campaign taken up by the network, saying, \u2018look at this photograph of our human-rights campaign. The person with the face covered is me. I cannot appear in the photo without this because there is a lot of stigma and discrimination.\u2019 Support organisations should be open to innovation. Networks can usually obtain funds for such activities as capacity building and meetings. Funds to set up, staff, sustain and expand the network are, on the other hand, less readily available. One of the demands of positive people and their supporters is that donor agencies innovate and redesign their funding policies so that core funding support can be given to networks. This would take care of organisational costs \u2013 office rent, salaries, travel and management expenses \u2013 as well as the recurring costs of an operating network. Further, if a human rights- and GIPA-based view is applied, positive people have the right to form their own associations in order to take up issues of concern to them. Organisations that support them should respond with appropriate flexibility and creativity rather than offering standardized solutions. Commit to holistic approaches, with flexibility to changing needs over time, group or region. Giving the rapidly-changing character of both the regional HIV epidemic and the societies it affects, the needs and priorities of a network are likely to change over time. Partners should have the flexibility to adapt to such changes, for example by revising work plans through a consultative process in order to reflect changing needs, priorities and capacities. Help sensitise the media. The media plays a critical role as the way they report on HIV and positive people strongly influence how the public in general respond to HIV and view positive people. Insensitive reporting by the media, which includes breaching confidentiality and the use of derogatory and disempowering expressions to describe positive people and the epidemic, has led to strong fear, aversion, and discrimination against positive people.

A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 30 4.2 Country scenarios: one size does not fit all Before commencing work on GIPA or undertaking partnerships with PLHIV networks in any country, a good understanding of the local situation and conditions is essential. Such understanding bears directly on the identification and prioritisation of issues and on the corresponding response. The EI experience underlined the differences that exist in country situations: beyond common factors, challenges, and consequences of the epidemic, country has a complex set of unique interwoven factors, ranging from the socio- cultural context to the nature of the national response. A deeper understanding of these realities is essential to the planning and implementation of HIV initiatives. HIV prevalence The level of HIV prevalence influences the general environment in which networks are built up and sustained. The network in Cambodia, a relatively high-prevalence country, has over 8,000 members and includes an effective women\u2019s wing. It receives strong support from the National AIDS Authority. Generally speaking, it is relatively easy for positive people in Cambodia to go public with their status. In contrast, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have low prevalence rates, though many factors of HIV vulnerability are present. In such countries, positive people are hesitant to come forward, to join networks or involve themselves in HIV-response activities because of strong stigmatization and discrimination. It is significant that in Sri Lanka, currently only one positive person is publicly open about their status for this reason. Such societies pose a particular challenge to positive groups and networks. When prevalence levels are high, there will usually be more funding available and more organisations working in the field. Governments in such countries are also, on the whole, more likely to give due attention to the need for including positive people in the national HIV response. Socio-cultural environment The socio-cultural context of a country influences attitudes to sex and sexuality. It often determines the space available for legal and human rights interventions. Social as well as economic and political factors influence the extent of stigma and discrimination and the space available for positive people to take action that will address their concerns. By and large, the epidemic in the Asia Pacific region is characterized by silence, denial, fear and stigma. Gender inequality and gender relations, based on power, are also central to the Asian epidemic and need to be addressed specifically. HIV/AIDS is spreading rapidly among women and girls in the region because of gender inequality. For example, in many countries in the region, marriage is seen as a very important institution and even in situations where young women could be vulnerable to the virus they enter into arranged marriages with little knowledge of the HIV risk behaviours of the men they marry, often putting themselves at risk. In this case, gender equality is not a matter of justice or respect for human rights, gender inequality is fatal. Therefore, it is important that HIV/AIDS interventions and activities are \u201cThere were thousands like me who carried on with verve. I didn\u2019t want to look back. I just wanted to move forward.\u201d - Helen, an HIV positive activist, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 31 not gender-blind and an analysis of how gender inequality shapes the economic, political and social factors driving the HIV epidemic are crucial. Geographical factors are also important. In Fiji, for example, access is constrained by geography, with some areas only accessible by the \u201cbilibili\u201dor local rafts. While there is sometimes considerable support from the government and the influential Church Council, there are problems because of low commitment levels and high expectations from the positive people themselves. Country responses, situations and national policies The Empowerment Initiative highlighted variations in the national policies and programmes across the region. Variations were found in fund allocation, programme design, the proportion of funds assigned to prevention efforts, the type and frequency of focused interventions among vulnerable populations and \u2013 most important in the present context \u2013 the priority given to PLHIV support programmes concerning access to care and treatment, socio-economic and livelihood support or addressing stigma and discrimination. Where it is present, government support makes a positive difference. In Cambodia, for example, where linkage to the National AIDS Authority is strong. This has helped the women\u2019s wing of the Cambodian People Living with HIV/AIDS Network (CPN+) make remarkable advances in the short span of a year. National policies in countries like China and Lao PDR have resulted in a situation where there is hardly any civil society.

In countries like Korea that are perceived as \u2018developed\u2019, the availability of donor funding is relatively low. The donor agenda has to be supportive of and conducive to the operation of networks. The extent to which the donor community, including multilaterals and bilaterals, are involved in the national response is a contributory factor to the functioning and sustainability of PLHIV networks. Presence, strength and capacities of groups and networks In some countries, groups and networks are very small and must work under conditions of severe stigma and discrimination. In Mongolia, for example, the \u2018network\u2019 consisted, until recently, of just two people. It is also important to ascertain whether positive groups share a common agenda or whether they are fragmented. In some 7 For useful information on human rights and HIV/AIDS, see Human Rights and HIV/AIDS: Now More than Ever: Law & Health Initiative and Open Society Institute Public Health Programme. A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 32 countries, the capacities and initiatives of civil-society partners, such as NGOs and CBOs, have been helpful. In other cases, experience from a neighbouring country has helped; a good case in point is the network in Papua New Guinea, which was set up with the help of positive people from other countries in the region. 4.3 Selecting partners and support organisations In the early stages of partnership between a positive network and a support organisation, the emphasis should be on developing efficient, transparent systems. Common needs and priorities have to be worked out, and space needs to be made to accommodate diversity and cater to group-specific needs. The core principles could be as follows: The inclusion of positive people from different backgrounds will make it possible for the network and its partner to take up different issues of concern to positive people. Make sure to include PLHIV from different interest groups (e.g. injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and ex- or current migrant workers). Women and youth in particular have special vulnerabilities and are often among the first victims of discrimination. In many societies they form the most vulnerable, least empowered groups, and particular efforts are needed to include them in the network. Larger network memberships, representing diverse groups of positive people, will also make it possible to distribute work more widely, reducing fatigue and the tendency to overburden a few key members. The process of building a second line of leadership is now under way in many of the networks participated in EI, but first-line leaders continue to carry a heavy load. Other issues of importance regarding the selection of partners A commonly-agreed priority focus in terms of needs; Space for accommodating diversity in a spirit of sensitivity to individual and group needs; Respect for diversity in the planning and implementation processes; and The broadest possible participation and sharing in the selection process (which will require the creation of appropriate systems to promote and facilitate it). The positive networks set up under EI are now between three and five years old. In most, the members are conscious of the need to mobilize positive people from different backgrounds as part of the network. This will strengthen the networks\u2019influence on core issues including human rights, stigma and discrimination, treatment access, care and support. The EI experience shows that, while it is desirable to diversify, there also remain challenges that need to be addressed, as illustrated by the following comment from a Fijian participant: \u2018FJN+ also works with positive people from poor socio-economic backgrounds. The network helps them access 33 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS \u201cI met several PLWHA from outside China through the networking opportunities that the UNDP Regional Programme provided.

However, it would help if they showed more commitment to network activities.\u2019 4.4 Resource mobilization This section discusses two important areas of focus: resource mobilization for networks and fund management by networks. The roles that can be played by a support organisation in resource mobilization are as follows: Leverage more funds for programmes planned in partnership with positive people by using its position and access to potential funding sources Facilitate network linkages with other sources of financial support, including government schemes Promote micro-credit, micro-finance and other schemes and initiatives for the economic empowerment of members and networks, leading in the long term to the sustainable financing of network activities Mobilise resources from the business sector as part of their corporate social responsibility for the provision of treatment and care to positive people requiring such services Commitment to the empowerment of positive people needs to be manifested by giving priority to capacity-building in the area of fund \u201cDespite government support, positive people are still stigmatised in Korea. They are thrown out of jobs, refused treatment and school admission and badly discriminated. Things have to change.\u201d - Hyun Lee, an HIV positive activist, Republic of Korea 34 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS Photo: APN+ management. In specific terms, this means: Help and support to enable the network to manage funds on its own Helping to build individual skills and network capacities Setting up systems to ensure transparency, accountability and efficiency 4.5 Technical support Technical support should be planned and implemented in equal partnership and through collaboration with the positive network or group concerned. It should cover two broad areas. First comes identification and a clarification of issues; this is followed by creation of the appropriate capacity-building packages, including training programmes, mentoring support and the development of resource materials. Issues need to be identified and understood in relation to the local cultural, language, socio- economic, geographical and political environment. This deeper understanding is vital to the communication processes too. The experience of EI has highlighted several challenges in the area of capacity-building and shown that more resources must be invested in this area over the long term in order to ensure the growth and sustainability of networks. Technical support can be provided to help positive networks to: Identify issues where technical support is needed and can be provided Develop situation-specific perspectives and clarity Design appropriate communications strategies Identify areas of technical support in response to diverse needs Develop capacity-building plans and programme designs for providing training, follow-up support, the production of resource materials and handouts, and mentoring. 4.6 Planning, monitoring & evaluation Planning and review entail the assessment of needs, both internal and external, and the mapping of resources. Internal needs are those related to capacity- building for organisational growth and development. The starting premise is that networks should be sufficiently empowered to run themselves. Internal needs are therefore organisational, administrative and financial. They relate to human resources, accounting and teamwork \u2013 including necessary interpersonal skills and the management of group dynamics. Some of these \u2018internal\u2019needs have an external component. These are related to communications with other groups and networks and with the general public through the media, as well as to advocacy and lobbying, network facilitation and linkage development. External needs assessment is somewhat different. Essentially, what is assessed is the socio-cultural context in which the group or network must operate, since this determines its operational scope within the overall programme scenario. In specific terms, it means mapping the available external resources \u2013 human, financial, organisational, and social \u2013 and the possibilities for training and documentation. Following GIPA, all these assessments should be participatory \u2013 planned and implemented with the active involvement of positive people. In the case of monitoring and evaluation, simple, easy-to-use systems to track institutional growth and programme impacts should be developed in partnership with positive networks. Their involvement will help ensure user-friendliness and ownership. 35 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS The objective of EI was to facilitate the formation and development of networks of positive people in the Asia-Pacific region. At the inception of the project, setting up systems and partnerships with positive groups for planning, monitoring, review and evaluation proved to be a challenge. Despite this, a qualitative baseline study was carried out, which served as a useful tool for assessing the environments in which the networks would have to operate and the challenges they would face. Now, with networks in place in most of these countries, it will be easier to undertake planning, monitoring and evaluation on future projects in partnership with positive people. 4.7 Governance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "136e1f17-018f-444b-a720-ce1fa4dc0feb": {"__data__": {"id_": "136e1f17-018f-444b-a720-ce1fa4dc0feb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-partnership-networks-people-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific-guidance-note-development-practitioners", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Working in Partnership with Networks of People Living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific - A Guidance Note for Development Practitioners", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-partnership-networks-people-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific-guidance-note-development-practitioners", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc00fa7bfeb7c4f500bab12da588e308e716b6cfe083398a83e7f78b8683fc19"}, "3": {"node_id": "91f6862d-8d0c-41da-9e5c-1372e904fbcb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/working-partnership-networks-people-living-hiv-asia-and-pacific-guidance-note-development-practitioners", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "319df86f7b7891eda77c19de42388b306b6db9c9fe55326f5a648279e28bffd9"}}, "hash": "42889ba329b50859a3854193ed0753076919290dcabeb5c03f7761e7d5c08632", "text": "and coordination Effective and transparent governance mechanisms are critical to the success of any partnership. The first step in setting them up is to identify all stakeholders and consider the potential support role each could play in the proposed project. Having identified all stakeholders and their potentials, a common understanding of the roles, strengths, capacities and responsibilities of the positive networks, the support organisation and the supporting partners will have to be established. There should be regular information transfer and feedback among key stakeholders during this process. It will be necessary from the outset to ensure that all stakeholders have a common understanding of GIPA in principle and practice. The next step is to draw up and agree upon a clear plan of work (including systems for monitoring and evaluation) before project or programme implementation commences. The planning process should, of course, be participatory. The partners should also set up systems for regular joint reviews, problem- solving and periodic assessments of the policy environment. In doing all of this, care should be taken to ensure that: The chosen approach is one that builds on existing systems; Systems that might polarize groups are avoided; and Resources are prioritised and their optimum use pursued.

Broad areas of relevance to all supporting partners are described first. In order to ensure that the GIPA Principle is central to a national response, all partner organisations need to do the following: Develop a clear understanding of the country scenario with respect to HIV/AIDS and share it with key stakeholders and partners working with positive people. Both globally and nationally, HIV scenarios are dynamic. The environment shifts and issues change. It is necessary to follow and understand these changes and the challenges they present, and to make the most of whatever opportunities arise for the greater involvement of positive people. Advocate a clearly articulated national GIPA policy and prioritisation of the GIPA Principle in the national response. Identify commitments made by government and lobby for translating words into action. National and international forums and events can provide opportunities for inter- governmental information exchange. However, commitments made by governments at these events (e.g. UNGASS 2001 and +5 in 2006) are rarely converted into action unless they are promoted by strong lobbies. Support organisations have a critical role to play here. Identify allies and partners in government, in the positive community and in multilateral and civil society organisations who will work on implementing GIPA. Facilitate action that will establish a clear understanding of the GIPA Principle among these allies and partners and help ensure that it is implemented in their organisations. Advocate the meaningful inclusion of positive people in all important bodies and forums. Ensure the participation of different positive groups, such as drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, women and youth. Ensure that the special needs of women living with and affected by HIV and other gender concerns are included in discussion and action. Facilitate and ensure information transfer to positive networks. Facilitate and ensure capacity building of positive networks. Facilitate the strengthening and broad- basing of positive networks. 5 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 39 66 \u201cWe have moved from \u2018talk and cry\u2019 to \u2018talk and smile\u2019.\u201d \u2013 HIV positive activist at Taking Stock and Ways Forward Strategic Planning Workshop, 10-12 May 2006, Bangkok CONCLUSION Section 6 T he spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to outpace the response to it.

However, the Empowerment Initiative yielded important lessons regarding these challenges. In particular, EI: Gave clear and conclusive evidence of how much positive people are able to make positive impacts if they are given timely support; Demonstrated the many ways in which positive people can contribute to the response to the epidemic; Helped reiterate the importance of the GIPA Principle; Demonstrated that, in order to achieve meaningful GIPA and the empowerment of positive people, a sustained investment of sufficient resources \u2013 time, funds and technical support in PLHIV groups and networks \u2013 is essential; and Demonstrated clearly the value of regional initiatives. This can be seen in the mutually beneficial relationships established between the national networks and the Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (APN+). APN+ has expanded its membership from eight countries in 1994 to 28 at time of writing. It has also provided a regional platform and system for sharing and planning regional action based on national experiences, and vice versa. Widespread ignorance about HIV and AIDS is undermining efforts to fight the spread of the virus worldwide. The social stigmatization and discrimination associated with HIV is still pervasive and is still the major factor preventing many men and women from seeking support and obtaining services, thereby significantly impeding prevention efforts. To be better able to respond to the important differences between women and men in the underlying mechanisms of HIV infection and in the social and economic consequences of HIV/AIDS, positive people and their networks are powerful allies: they understand and have lived the reality at first hand. Experience from around the world makes it clear that no community or country can tackle the consequences of the epidemic without building on the strengths and first-hand experience of those living with HIV and AIDS. They are a source of knowledge and inspiration for policy and effective programming. Their empowered voices and positive lives provide millions of positive people with hope and dignity. Countries where networks and support groups of PLHIV are established, functioning and acknowledged by donors and governments as equal partners in the response, display constructive responses, resulting in declines in infection rates as we have witnessed in Cambodia and Thailand and a more sensitive approach to prevention, care, treatment and support.

We, the people living with HIV/AIDS in the region, painfully realise that the disempowering presence of stigma and discrimination; lack of access to treatment and support services; lack of capacity; and poor knowledge on GIPA among governments, other stakeholders and PLHIV networks prevent hundreds of thousands of experienced PLHIV from actively participating in the responses to the epidemic. Our categorical learning in dealing with HIV/AIDS over the last two decades has been that without the well-being and empowerment of PLHIV, GIPA can only be a pipe dream. T rue practice of GIPA requires total empowerment of people living with HIV/AIDS - power that is both generated from within and imparted from outside. This empowerment relates to a healthy and dignified life; a rights- and gender- sensitive environment that is free of stigma and discrimination; availability of livelihood options, political and decision- making capacity; and access to affordable treatment including ARV. W e, representatives of PLHIV networks in Asia-Pacific region, therefore, urge all Governments, political parties, civil society organisations, UN, bi- and multilateral agencies, corporates, public and private sectors and the media in the region to create an empowering environment for PLHIV and people affected by HIV through the following measures: Policy and decision making 1. PLHIV representatives should be given direct access to relevant ministries dealing with HIV/AIDS issues. 2. PLHIV representatives should be part of decision-making bodies related to HIV/AIDS in every country, both in the government and non-government sectors. 3. GIPA should be incorporated into national policies as a prevention strategy. 4. Legal reforms should be undertaken expeditiously in every country to protect the rights of PLHIV. 5. A budget-line dedicated to supporting PLHIV groups should be included in the budget of every country. Access to treatment and support services 1. Universal and free ARV, laboratory tests and OI treatment should be made available in all the countries. 2. Every company should have a comprehensive workplace policy, conforming to global guidelines, that protects the rights of infected employees. 3. Quality, confidential counselling services should be made available up to the primary health care delivery points. Social and Economic Empowerment 1. National AIDS Committees should be made multi-sectoral. 2. Governments, corporates, public and private sectors should help PLHIV groups, particularly women's groups, with income generation activities, micro-credits, grants and revolving funds. 3. HIV should be mainstreamed into existing poverty alleviation programmes. 4. Social-security measures must be initiated for poor PLHIV. 5. Large-scale leadership and capacity-building efforts should be initiated for PLHIV. 6. Governments should earmark special programmes and budgets for people affected by HIV, widows and children Released at the Second Asia-Pacific PLHIV Congress, July 10-11, 2004, Bangkok BANGKOK DECLARATION by People Living with HIV/AIDS in Asia-Pacific July 11, 2004 2 The Bangkok Declaration The UNDP Regional HIV and Development Programme supported the Asia-Pacific Initiative for the Empowerment of PLHIV, or EI, which was implemented in partnership with the Asia- Pacific Network of People Living with HIV and AIDS (APN+) and the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (INP+).

The Denver Principles (see Annex 6) marked a fundamental shift in the approach, with PLHIV asserting the right to responsible roles in shaping the response to the epidemic.

Empowerment brings benefits in terms of individual well-being, better access to health information and services including quality counselling and peer support, the reduction of fear, shame, stigma and discrimination, a rights- sensitive legal and ethical environment, leadership, access to economic opportunities and the capacity of PLHIV to contribute to the response. This third-generation response recognizes empowerment as a right of people living with HIV and lies at the heart of EI. The UNDP Regional HIV and Development Programme began working with PLHIV in the Asia-Pacific region in the late nineties. The visibility of PLHIV in the region was extremely poor; groups were either absent or nascent and of low capacity. Therefore, a pilot project focusing on five South Asian countries \u2013 Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka \u2013 was initiated in 2001. The first step under this initiative was a stocktaking and mapping exercise. This was followed by a participatory problem analysis. The pilot phase made it clear that PLHIV did not consider GIPA as an end in itself, but rather as a tool to achieve objectives they had set for themselves and their networks. This led to the project known as Asia-Pacific Initiative for the Empowerment of PLHIV, which was implemented from 2002 to 2005. 8 This project was also known as the Empowerment Initiative (EI). Coverage and activities The second phase of EI was initiated in 2003. A planning meeting held in Marawila, Sri Lanka in October 2002 brought PLHIV from China, Mongolia, Korea and Iran in contact with the South Asia Group that had taken part in the pilot study. Shortly after this workshop, in 3 The Asia-Pacific Initiative for the Empowerment of PLHIV: history and achievements 8 From Involvement to Empowerment: People living with HIV/AIDS in Asia-Pacific. 2004: UNDP A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 48 A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 49 March 2003, a strategic planning meeting provided an opportunity for positive people from Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and PNG to meet the Marawila participants. Thus EI became representative of PLHIV concerns across the Asia-Pacific region. Financial and technical support was provided to selected PLHIV groups in Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, Fiji, India, Iran, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Republic Of Korea and Sri Lanka. In addition, the Initiative sought to include all Asia-Pacific PLHIV groups in regional advocacy, mutual support and the process of sharing experiences and lessons learned. The following table gives the activity components of the Empowerment Initiative.

Support us in our struggle against those who would fire us from our jobs, evict us from our homes, refuse to touch us, or separate us from our loved ones, our community or our peers, since available evidence does not support the view that AIDS can be spread by casual, social contact. (1*) 2. Not scapegoat people with AIDS, blame us for the epidemic or generalize about our lifestyles. We recommend that people with AIDS: 1. Form caucuses to choose their own representatives to deal with the media, to choose their own agenda and plan their own strategies. 2. Be involved at every level of decision-making and specifically serve on the boards of directors of provider organizations. 3. Be involved in all AIDS forums with equal credibility as other participants, to share their own experiences and knowledge. 4. Substitute low-risk sexual behaviours for those that could endanger themselves or their partners. We feel that people with AIDS have an ethical responsibility to inform their potential sexual partners of their health status. (2*) People with AIDS have the right: 1. To as full and satisfying sexual and emotional lives as anyone else\u2019s. 2. To quality medical treatment and quality social service provision without discrimination of any form based on sexual orientation, gender, diagnosis, economic status, or race. 3. To full explanations of all medical procedures and risks, to choose or refuse their treatment modalities, to refuse to participate in research without jeopardizing their treatment, and to make informed decisions about their lives. 4. To privacy, confidentiality of medical records, to human respect, and to choose who their significant others are. 5. To die and to LIVE in dignity. 1* HIV and the first proof that AIDS was an infectious disease was only discovered in 1985 2* In 1983 it had not yet been scientifically proven that condoms effectively protect against HIV transmission 5 The Denver Principles A GUIDANCE NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS 53 Below is a selection of useful and relevant documents for further reading that relate to the involvement and empowerment of people living with HIV/AIDS: APN+ Position Paper. 2004.

NOTE: Unless otherwise indicated all value figures are expressed in US dollars. 11 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 1 FoRewoRD The statistics tell a striking story. Globally, 2.7 billion people do not have access to modern cooking facilities and rely on wood, charcoal and other traditional fuels for cooking and heating. The Global Burden of Disease Study (2010) estimated that as many as 3.5 million people die each year from indoor air pollution (IAP). Many more end up suffering from respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis, lung cancer and asthma. In India, a woman living in a rural area typically spends 40 hours per month collecting cooking fuel \u2013 an average work week for many of us. More than 1.3 billion people across the world still do not have access to electricity at all. Rural areas, often highly inaccessible, have the greatest needs; globally, 85 percent of people lacking access to electricity live outside of urban centers. As individuals, communities, planners, and investors, we can do something about it. Improved cookstoves, biogas digesters and other renewable energy solutions can reduce indoor air pollution and liberate women from the drudgery of collecting fuelwood. In Cambodia, for example, the potential installation of more than 200,000 biogas digesters could produce enough biogas to replace 6 kilograms of firewood per digester per day. Such digesters offer a solution for reduced indoor air pollution that can bring more freedom for women, while at the same time preserving forests and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, new ways are being found to make off-grid renewable energy technologies more affordable for the poor and to bring electricity to households, communities and enterprises. In addition to household use, energy access would enable productive activities such as mechanized agriculture, educational tools, health services and small- scale industries. These in turn will lead to poverty reduction and improved prospects for human development. UNDP\u2019s Energy Plus approach aims to ensure that productive uses of energy are at the center of energy access efforts. Such an approach will be crucial if we are to meet our universal energy access targets in the years ahead. In 2011, the Secretary-General of the United Nations launched the \u201cSustainable Energy for All\u201d (SE4ALL) initiative. This initiative aims to achieve three main goals by 2030: to achieve universal access to energy, to double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency, and to double the share of renewables in the global energy mix. Indeed, many Asian countries are already on their way towards achieving sustainable energy for all. Indonesia increased their electrification rate from around 2 percent in the late 1970s to 65 percent by the mid-1990s. Many countries are giving priority to renewable energy options in their energy policies. Thailand, for example, has set a target of 25 percent renewable energy use within the next 10 years. Lao PDR has also seen a tremendous improvement, jumping from an electricity access rate of 15 percent in 1995 to 75 percent in 2011. And so SE4ALL is a true possibility. In collaboration with other development partners, the private sector, civil society and national governments, UNDP will use the UN Decade of SE4ALL (2014-2024) to help increase energy access for the people at the bottom of the development pyramid, with a focus on using renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Energy access for poor households is essential to eradicate poverty, and it must be part of the post-2015 development agenda. As part of the international community, we all must therefore intensify our efforts and our collaboration to achieve these lofty goals. Our hope is that this publication can be both a theoretical and practical basis for this work. So let us all work together to achieve universal access to energy by 2030.

This report is based on a thorough analysis of the data and results from eight nationally produced rapid as- sessments and gap analyses and ten regionally produced country energy reviews, an evaluation based on a rigorous methodology described in Appendix I. 2.1 the benefits of energy access The analysis reveals numerous cases throughout Asia-Pacific where access to electricity and modern forms of energy have facilitated the provision of adequate food, shelter, clothing, water, sanitation, medical care, education, and access to information. Electricity supports lighting, communication, transport, commerce, manufacturing, and industry. It can enable provision of refrigerated vaccines, emergency and intensive health care, and pumping of clean groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes for increasing agricultural productivity. The lack of electricity is particularly damaging to women, who are usually responsible for food preparation and cooking, and young children, who are usually with them. Investing in energy access therefore improves public health, community and household productivity, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Providing universal access to gaseous fuels for cooking and electricity provides benefits like improved living standards, livelihood opportunities and climate change mitigation that often far outweigh the costs of the programmes themselves. Furthermore, high-speed transportation, telecommunications, information technology, and a variety of things that enhance the quality of life depend on electricity; none of them can function on traditional fuels. In short, universal access to clean energy is an essential enabler of inclusive development, poverty reduction, and business development, reducing the gap between the rich and the poor as well as dealing with the impacts of climate change. Countless examples have shown that once modern energy is available, communities, the businesses and entrepreneurs benefit enormously from services such as light, power, heat, irrigation, new livelihood opportunities and the cleaner air and water that it provides. 2.2 Household cooking needs Without access to modern energy services, the use of traditional fuels for cooking, heating and lighting hinders economic development and has severe health impacts. There are, however, opportunities to overcome these barriers: improved cookstoves produce less smoke than traditional stoves; have relatively low cost and are simple to install. Biogas digesters produce gas for cooking and other household needs, and have the potential to meet the cooking needs of millions of households. 2.3 Rural electrification Many countries in the region have demonstrated substantial progress in expanding grid-based electrification as well as distributed energy systems in the past two decades. Where improvements have been made, electricity has brought multiple development benefits, and case studies show that household incomes can rise substantially once they are given energy access. Universal energy access will be achieved through a combination of grid extension and off-grid systems, depending on the country execUtive SUmmary 14 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre context. Five countries, including Bangladesh, Malaysia, Philippines, Viet Nam, and Thailand, have been most successful in improving energy access through grid extensions, with some reaching near universal access. This analysis indicates that Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia and Mongolia and Nepal can benefit most from improvements in grid-based electrification. Apart from large-scale grid extension efforts, off-grid microhydro is particularly apt to meet the needs of remote communities in mountainous regions and can provide year-round electricity. Solar lanterns meet lighting needs in households and small enterprises, and are low cost. Solar home systems (SHSs) are more expensive option then solar lanterns, but have dropped in cost in recent years and can usually provide more power than lanterns. Micro- and mini-grids can play an instrumental role in global electrification efforts over the next decade, especially in Asia. 2.4 energy efficiency Energy efficiency opportunities generally involve practices that are already commer- cially available and bring quick savings. Because of the fast rate of industrialization in the Asia-Pacific, many such programmes have already demonstrated success. Some of the opportunities include standards and labeling for electric appliances, reduc- ing electric transmission and distribution losses, industrial and commercial energy audits, efficient lighting, demand-side management for reduced energy demand, building codes and regulations to control the energy profile of new buildings, ener- gy efficiency funds and combined heat and power (CHP) solutions. 2.5 Renewable energy Asian countries have a diverse and significant amount of renewable energy potential that can be converted into usable modern energy services. The 18 countries evaluated in this report could more than meet all of their electricity needs exclusively with available renewable energy resources, and the resources with the most technical potential are: \u2022\ufffd Solar energy featuring prominently in Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Thailand; \u2022\ufffd Wind energy in Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16d93e37-125f-4496-a2ed-1333efda1efd": {"__data__": {"id_": "16d93e37-125f-4496-a2ed-1333efda1efd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "356f72ca6e0edcec18d651fa47ea659c48abca08245fd5de7cc4146db5fc5adf"}, "3": {"node_id": "98d69e7a-38d3-4ba8-b40e-7ceecd9a52d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c0f2f311cd668c8b4ae5ee291c0327db2a718ab8cd20f2b6bbf82dc1e29673c"}}, "hash": "78575136033b837c05bd10bb026cb344d2f8b5e4ff3ebcaaa2b9b498236b240c", "text": "Viet Nam; \u2022\ufffd Geothermal energy in Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), the Philippines, and the Solomon Islands; \u2022\ufffd Small hydro in India (given its low cost), Samoa, and the Solomon Islands; \u2022\ufffd Large hydro in Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, and PNG; and \u2022\ufffd Biomass in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. 2.6 Barriers and impediments Despite the wide range of benefits that expanding energy access, promoting renewable energy, and encouraging energy efficiency bring, realizing them is not without substantial challenges. This report identifies technical barriers such as lack of equipment, expertise or maintenance, and economic and financial barriers such as distorted energy prices, poverty, and lack of financing. Political and institutional barriers include constrained capacity to plan and implement projects as well as corruption and instability. Social and cultural barriers encompass things such as community opposition and lack of awareness. 2.7 overcoming barriers and impediments Though these challenges are real, they can be, and have been, overcome. However, ordinary energy markets and the private sector will not by themselves quickly address energy poverty and expand energy access. As a result, the very poor \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d and are too politically distant and economically costly to provide with energy services. This means that energy poverty will not be eliminated without targeted intervention that goes beyond the current interest of private sector entities to invest. Current projections suggest that the investment required to eliminate energy poverty by 2030 is $49 billion per year, only 3 percent of total global energy infrastructure investments yet well above the $14 billion that is presently being invested each year. 15 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Thus, to ensure equal development and access for all, there is a need for specific programming to reach the poorest at the bottom of the ladder that are not served by commercial energy providers or large-scale energy projects. It is the poor households unlikely to be served by the private sector, government, or financial institutions\u2014the energy poor that even the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects will not gain access to modern energy by 2030\u2014that development partners will need to consider serving. Thankfully, a series of successful business and financial models already exist backed by the empirical success of numerous case studies. Failure to utilize, replicate, and scale-up these successful models, and to learn from these case studies, prevents already disadvantaged families from participating in the Asian economic miracle; it also maintains the unequal distribution of wealth in societies. 2.8 the road ahead The report concludes with three recommendations. First, it argues that energy access should be treated as the most urgent SE4ALL goal and that development partners should emphasize energy access for productive purposes to the bottom of the pyramid. Second, it notes that any post-2015 development agenda for SE4ALL should promote \u201cbottom-up energy solutions\u201d, and it must recognize the specificity of country needs, there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d solution. Bottom-up solutions, including renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, are a crucial part of the overall SE4ALL strategy addressing the energy service needs of rural and urban communities and entrepreneurs who are not served by the central grid in case of electricity or centralized distribution systems in case of cooking and heating fuels. Such energy solutions fit into country plans that aim at reducing poverty, enhancing gender equality and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Third, the report recommends that an energy knowledge hub be established in the Asia-Pacific for improved coordination and better support for implementing \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions and meeting these specific country needs. 17 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 3 INtRoDUCtIoN Thomas Edison started generating electricity more than 130 years ago and electric utilities have been generating, transmitting, and distributing power commercially for more than a century.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98d69e7a-38d3-4ba8-b40e-7ceecd9a52d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "98d69e7a-38d3-4ba8-b40e-7ceecd9a52d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "356f72ca6e0edcec18d651fa47ea659c48abca08245fd5de7cc4146db5fc5adf"}, "2": {"node_id": "16d93e37-125f-4496-a2ed-1333efda1efd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78575136033b837c05bd10bb026cb344d2f8b5e4ff3ebcaaa2b9b498236b240c"}}, "hash": "7c0f2f311cd668c8b4ae5ee291c0327db2a718ab8cd20f2b6bbf82dc1e29673c", "text": "Yet as of 2009, 1.3 billion people, roughly one in every five, lack access to electricity, 85 percent of them in rural areas.1 Furthermore, almost 3.5 billion people, or one in two, remain partially or wholly reliant on fuels such as wood, charcoal, dung, coal, and kerosene for cooking, and 2.7 billion depend on those fuels entirely.2 An additional 1 billion people have access only to unreliable or intermittent electricity networks.3 Put another way, the poorest three-quarters of the global population still only use ten percent of global energy.4 As table 1 and figure 1 show, this is predominately a problem for countries in the Asia-Pacific.

Paris: OECD/IEA (2011). Poverty and energy deprivation go hand-in-hand, with energy expenses accounting for a significant proportion of household incomes in many developing countries. Generally, 20 to 30 percent of annual income in poor households is directly expended on energy fuels, and an additional 20 to 40 percent is expended on indirect costs associated with collecting and using that energy, such as health care expenses, injury, or loss of time, compared to a global average of only 4 to 8 percent.5 In other words, the poor pay on average eight times more for the same unit of energy than other income groups. In extreme cases, some of the poorest households directly spend 80 percent of their income obtaining cooking fuels.6 Complicating matters, about 1 billion people live below $1.25 per day in the Asia- Pacific, leading one recent study to proclaim that \u201cthe state of human deprivation compels us to consider a paradigm shift to universal energy access and a minimal standard for quality of life.

When necessary, data from these reports were supplemented with secondary sources. For more details about the research methods, readers are invited to read Appendix I. This report proceeds to discuss four key constituents of the SE4ALL goals: household cooking needs (sometimes called \u201cthermal\u201d needs), rural electrification (including small-scale renewable energy as well as micro- and mini-grids), energy efficiency, and larger commercial-scale grid-connected renewable energy. In pursuing this fourfold structure, the section on household cooking needs includes improved cookstoves and biogas digesters. The idea is to identify opportunities for those countries with more than 90 percent of their population dependent on solid fuels for household needs shown in figure 2, such as Timor-Leste, DPR Korea, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Solomon Islands, and PNG, to commercialize cleaner cookstoves and other devices. As figure 3 shows, household energy use is complex, with many homes \u201cfuel stacking\u201d and reliant on multiple sources of fuel at once.

Its aim is to inform those countries depicted in figure 4 that are striving to increase their electrification rates in the Asia-Pacific, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, the Solomon Islands, and PNG, on how they can scale up their electrification efforts.

Energy efficiency efforts can include substituting resource inputs or fuels, changing preferences, or altering the mix of goods and services to demand less energy. It is a resource historically proven, through decades of experience and thousands of programmes, to be the most cost effective way of responding to increases in demand. The IEA World Energy Outlook estimated that each additional $1 spent on energy efficiency in electrical equipment, appliances, and buildings avoids more than $2, on average, in energy supply investments.11 As figure 5 shows, some countries, such as DPR Korea, India and Myanmar, lose 15 to 29 percent of their electricity to inefficiencies affiliated with transmission and distribution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44575b91-09b2-457b-b53c-4307600692a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "44575b91-09b2-457b-b53c-4307600692a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3da8576c55666db60129630245d6949a87a6ad0949da58db4a665826b3f69663"}, "2": {"node_id": "1373d464-583b-4937-a0db-6c6394ab4eb3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fa2a8e50d8d6e0cdac781ea642bddfe3ba6237e35ae48afe3b8f19181329f0b"}}, "hash": "aa3d7edb4d64d433670ea126642f52236fa71ef85038baa08e539859493a4996", "text": "In some Pacific Island Countries (PICs), such as Tuvalu and Micronesia, the percentage is close to half.12 Figure 5 Transmission and distribution inefficiency: Selected countries (percent, 2010) Grid inefficiency (%) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 EU Japan Australia USA China Thailand New Zealand Singapore Malaysia Indonesia Brunei Vietnam Philippines DPRK Myanmar India Laos Cambodia Solomon Islands Nauru Tuvalu Micronesia Source: Data for the four PICs comes from Pacific Power Association.

The final SE4ALL area covered by the report is renewable energy, a term that describes a variety of sources, approaches, systems and technologies ranging from wind turbines and solar panels to hydroelectric dams and geothermal power stations. The attractiveness of these options is that they are from renewable energy resources that are often indigenous and free; for the most part, any amount generated from sunlight or wind does not compete with the sunlight or wind available elsewhere. Moreover, the fuel cost for some renewables such as wind and solar can be known for decades into the future, something that cannot be said about conventional technologies whose fuel prices vary widely. Furthermore, although renewable energy technologies have their own associated set of environmental and social impacts, they do not meltdown, rely on hazardous fuels, or depend on a fuel cycle of mining or milling that must extract fuels out of the earth (with the exception of some landfill gas capture facilities). When roughly quantified and put into monetary terms, the negative externalities for coal power plants are 74 times greater than those for wind farms, and the ones from nuclear power plants are 12 times greater than solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.13 Put succinctly, oil, gas, coal, and uranium are susceptible to rapid escalations in price and price volatility, whereas renewable fuels are often free for the taking, widely available, and inexhaustible. In choosing to assess SE4ALL in the Asia-Pacific, the report narrows its focus mostly to 18 countries. These countries are: \u2022\ufffd Bangladesh \u2022\ufffd Bhutan \u2022\ufffd Cambodia \u2022\ufffd Fiji \u2022\ufffd India \u2022\ufffd Indonesia \u2022\ufffd Lao PDR \u2022\ufffd Malaysia \u2022\ufffd Mongolia \u2022\ufffd Nepal \u2022\ufffd Papua New Guinea \u2022\ufffd Philippines \u2022\ufffd Samoa \u2022\ufffd Solomon Islands \u2022\ufffd Sri Lanka \u2022\ufffd Thailand \u2022\ufffd Vanuatu \u2022\ufffd Viet Nam Viet Nam 23 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre These countries were selected for two key reasons. First, they are diverse, and include a broad sample of different types of energy markets, geographic sizes, population densities, energy resources, and policy challenges. Second, at the time research for this report began, 11 of them had opted-in to the SE4ALL Initiative and the remaining six\u2014 India, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Thailand and Vanuatu\u2014were added to give greater representation of the sub-regions of Asia-Pacific. Other major energy poor countries would have been included, but the research was constrained by resources. After documenting the benefits of energy access and previewing the SE4ALL energy dynamics of these 18 countries, the report analyses a common set of technical, economic, political, and socio-cultural barriers that affect all of them before presenting solutions on how to overcome these barriers and the report\u2019s three conclusions. 25 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 4 tHe BeNeFItS oF eNeRgy ACCeSS As this section shows, the expansion of energy access contributes to four major and interrelated sets of positive consequences: declining rates of poverty, enhanced human health, gender equality and improved education, and reduced levels of environmental degradation. The second part of this section then presents case studies of where countries in the Asia-Pacific have successfully expanded household energy access, invested in rural electrification and energy efficiency, and promoted renewable energy. 4.1 Poverty and economic security Electricity and modern forms of energy are crucial to meeting the primary development challenge of providing adequate food, shelter, clothing, water, sanitation, medical care, education, and access to information. Electricity supports lighting, communication, transport, commerce, manufacturing, and industry. It can enable provision of refrigerated vaccines and emergency and intensive health care, the pumping of clean groundwater for drinking and irrigation for increasing agricultural productivity. The lack of electricity is particularly damaging to women, who are responsible for food preparation and young children who are often under the care of mothers while they are cooking at home.

For instance, countries with underperforming electricity networks tend to lose 1 to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) growth potential due to blackouts, over- investment in backup electricity generators, energy subsidies, and inefficient use of resources.16 Dependency on fossil fuels, particularly oil, results in severe macroeconomic shocks. One study looked at the world average price of crude oil for 161 countries from 1996 to 2006, when prices increased by a factor of seven, and concluded that lower-middle income countries were the most vulnerable followed by low-income countries, even though these countries consumed less oil per capita than industrialized or high income countries.17 The reason is that the ratio of value of net oil imports to GDP tends to be higher in lower income countries, meaning they spend a greater share of their GDP on energy imports. Indeed, poor Asian households have suffered dramatic increases in the price of fossil-fueled energy, paying on average 74 percent more from 2002 to 2005 for their energy needs. This included paying: \u2022\ufffd 171 percent more for cooking fuels; \u2022\ufffd 120 percent more for transportation; \u2022\ufffd 67 percent more for electricity; \u2022\ufffd 55 percent more for lighting fuels; and \u2022\ufffd 33 percent more for petroleum-based fertilizers and other agricultural inputs.18 Another study noted that the rise in oil prices during 2010 and 2011 placed an additional 42 million people in the Asia-Pacific region into poverty.19 A third study assessed the close connection between rising oil prices and food prices, and documented an almost perfect relationship between the two. Higher oil prices resulted in rising input costs for agriculture such as oil based fertilizers and fuel for motorized and mechanized equipment, as well as a greater demand for biofuels which then divert agricultural feedstocks to produce fuel rather than food. Both factors created higher food prices, and the number of malnourished increased from 848 million in 2004 to 923 million in 2007.20 Renewable energy, by displacing the use of oil, kerosene, and diesel, can ameliorate these negative trends. the BeNeFitS oF eNergy acceSS 26 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 4.2 Household health Affecting numerous interrelated domestic health and development issues, investments in energy access can enhance maternal health, reduce infant mortality, and help curtail disease epidemics. Based on the number of lives lost and disabilities incurred annually, the largest immediate benefit of sustainable energy access is the displacement and reduction of IAP. Indeed, one just-released study examined the relationship between household cooking fuels and low birth weights, and found conclusively that \u201cprimary use of coal, kerosene, and biomass fuels is associated with significant decreases in mean birth weight\u201d and that \u201cincreased risk of neonatal death is strongly associated with household use of coal\u201d.21 More on these harms from IAP are presented in Chapter Five on \u201cHousehold Thermal Needs\u201d. However, countries without access to modern energy systems also tend to have more dilapidated health systems; consider that compared to industrialized countries, infant mortality rates are more than five times higher in developing countries, as is the proportion of children below the age of five who are malnourished (eight times higher), the maternal mortality rate (14 times higher), and proportion of births not attended by trained health personnel (37 times higher).22 Indirect health effects also occur when traditional fuel becomes scarce or prices rise. Meals rich in protein, such as beans or meat, are avoided or undercooked to conserve energy, forcing families to depend on low protein soft foods such as grains and greens, which can be prepared quickly. In other cases, families stop boiling drinking water when faced with an energy shortage.23 The provision of modern energy services can improve general health by enabling access to potable water, cleaner cooking facilities, lighting, and refrigeration.24 Renewable based electricity can also enable modern preventative, diagnostic, and medical treatment, including the electrification of health-care facilities and energy for medical equipment, sterilization, security, and information and communication technology.

As the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has reported: The energy-poverty nexus has a distinct gender bias: of the world\u2019s poor, 70 percent are women. Access to and the forms of energy used by a poor community have significantly different impacts on the men and women in it. Existing social and work patterns, particularly in rural communities, place a disproportionate burden of fuel and water collection and their use in the household for cooking on women and girl children, who consequently have to devote long, exhausting hours to this purpose rather than more productive activities, family welfare, or education. However, women\u2019s role in decision-making within the household and community is usually very restricted, reducing their say in issues of spending levels and choices, including with respect to energy. This includes the types of fuels used, amounts of energy purchased, the devices and technology chosen, as well as domestic infrastructure characteristics (e.g., stove design, ventilation, etc.). Such decisions are made by the male head of the household, although their burden is borne by the women.26 The labor and time intensity of fuelwood collection, one of these burdens, depends on not only the availability of fuel, but also traveling distance, household size, and season. In the summer months, when wood must be stockpiled for the winter in countries with harsh climates, some women gather firewood twice a day, each trip taking two hours.27 In some developing countries, girls spend more than seven times as many hours collecting wood and water than adult males, and 3.5 times as many hours compared to boys the same age.28 In India, for instance, the typical woman spends 40 hours collecting fuel per month during 15 separate trips, many walking more than six kilometers round trip.29 This amounts to 30 billion hours spent annually 27 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (82 million hours per day) collecting fuelwood, with an economic burden (including time invested and illnesses) of $6.7 billion (300 billion rupees) per year.30 In addition, current energy production entails occupational hazards that almost uniquely befall women and children. People carrying cooking fuels suffer frequent falls, back aches, bone fractures, eye problems, headaches, rheumatism, anemia, and miscarriages from carrying weights often 40 to 50 kilograms, nearly as much as their body weight. The energy needs of rural women can be further marginalized if men control community forests, plantations, or woodlots, and if there are other \u201chigh value\u201d wood demands by the community that displaces their foraging grounds for fuel.31 The educational impacts of energy poverty include absenteeism from school as well as increased incidence of illness. Numerous medical studies have documented a strong connection between the effects of IAP mentioned above and acute respiratory infections in children, which is the principal cause of school absences in many countries. Conversely, energy access can help improve both education and gender equality. Table 2 depicts a variety of ways they can enhance the status of women by saving time and improving health. One study of the Philippines noted that the odds of being illiterate are far greater for individuals that lack electrical lighting.32 Energy services can also enable schools to recruit and retain better qualified teachers.33 Lighting from solar and microhydro technologies can extend the time children have to study at night, and can also lead to better equipped schools with computers and the Internet.

Since billions of individuals rely on biomass for cooking and heating, about 2 million tons of it is combusted every day.34 Where wood is scarce, or populations are dense, the growth of new trees is not enough to match demand for fuel, resulting in deforestation, desertification, and land degradation. Even when entire trees are not felled, the collection of dung, branches, shrubs, roots, twigs, leaves, and bark can deplete forest ecosystems and soils of much needed nutrients.35 It can also damage agricultural production: when wood supplies are scarce, people often switch to burning crops\u2014 which threatens food security. Moreover, the deforestation and erosion caused by harvesting reduce the fertility of surrounding fields. One recent assessment attributed 6 percent of global deforestation to fuelwood collection.36 For example, in Bangladesh trees and bamboo meet about 48 percent of all domestic energy requirements followed by agricultural residues that offer 36 percent and dung that offers 13 percent.37 Widespread destruction of forests has occurred to satisfy energy needs, with homestead forest cover reduced to eight percent of its original area38 and half of Bangladesh\u2019s natural forests being destroyed in a single generation by people collecting fuelwood.39 Similarly, about four percent of China\u2019s standing forests serve as a source of fuel and roughly 13 percent of cultivated land in China is used to grow fuelwood.40 Apart from its environmental damage, fuelwood-driven deforestation results in two significant social and economic impacts: an increased burden on fuelwood collectors and farmers, and increased fuel prices. First, as stockpiles are depleted, women and children need to travel longer distances to collect fuel, requiring more time and energy. Moreover, such collection typically interferes with the viability of farms and other rural livelihoods that rely on trees for their own income.41 Second, deforestation results in Figure 6 Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (grams of CO2e/kWh) Source: Sovacool, B.K.

Energy Policy 36(8), pp. 2940\u20132953. 29 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre severe price increases of fuelwood. As deforestation in Bangladesh has accelerated, demand for wood has outpaced supply, causing the price of wood to increase from $0.35 in 1980 to $1.27 in 1991 and $1.69 in 2007 per bunch. When put into the context of the typical household budget, about 50 percent of the annual income of rural households in Bangladesh is now spent on fuel.42 A second environmental impact of energy poverty involves climate change and black carbon. Burning solid fuels in open fires and traditional stoves has significant global warming effects, due to the release of methane and carbon dioxide.43 Reliance on biomass fuels and coal for cooking and heating is responsible for about 10 to 15 percent of global energy use, making it a substantial source of greenhouse gas emissions.44 One study, for example, projected that by 2050 the smoke from wood fires will release about 7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.45 By contrast, when direct and indirect carbon emissions are included, renewable sources of power are the least

Most homes without access to modern forms of energy cook and combust fuels directly inside their home. Ten countries in the Asia-Pacific\u2014China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Afghanistan\u2014account for 96.7 percent of people in Asia-Pacific dependent on traditional fuels to meet their cooking/heating energy needs, as figure 8 shows.

For instance, almost 90 percent of people in Bangladesh cook with traditional fuels such as firewood, jute sticks, and agricultural waste. In Bhutan, more than 80 percent of rural households, where 70 percent of the population resides, are largely dependent on traditional fuels such as firewood and kerosene.48 Cambodia is extremely dependent on wood and solid fuels for household energy needs. In 2011, firewood and charcoal represented 95 percent of all energy used for cooking in the country.49 In India, a typical rural woman spends 40 hours collecting fuel every month during 15 separate trips, many walking more than 6 kilometers round trip.50 This amounts to 30 billion hours spent annually (82 million hours per day) collecting fuelwood, with an economic burden (including time invested and illnesses) of $6.7 billion (300 billion rupees) per year.51 In Lao PDR, almost 90 percent of rural households and over half of urban households use firewood for cooking, and the use of charcoal as the main cooking fuel has almost quadrupled from 1995 to 2005. In Nepal, 81 percent of the Nepali population use solid fuels for cooking (mostly wood), destroying about 12.5 million tons of biomass and forestland each year.52 A 2007 World Bank survey reported that 98.7 percent of households in Timor-Leste, a country of roughly 1 million people, used fuelwood as their primary source of energy for cooking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05ae1962-f932-43b2-9e82-e190ffe6f5e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "05ae1962-f932-43b2-9e82-e190ffe6f5e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49a069fe338d187f5a62d2d42d99719028f16259f4d3ee1a3e2835dfd7c68c74"}, "2": {"node_id": "29e28518-940d-42c5-8d28-82f880ac81ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eedbc191df8ebad52e28b7ec979dd0d1e2792ab6b9bdd8fe5892a29d68ccf1a1"}}, "hash": "36330954360f212ca3a4e528b1e6a4e1639b5bbecff7122ce571863a60733a16", "text": "Sixty percent of the rural populations in Timor-Leste spend 1-3 hours a day searching for fuelwood.53 The World Bank estimates the annual economic cost of IAP resulting from traditional cookstoves in Timor-Leste to be $12.5 million or 1.4 percent of Gross National Income.

Strikingly, IAP ranks fourth on the global burden of disease risk factors at almost five percent, coming after only high blood pressure (almost 8 percent), tobacco smoking and second hand smoke (about 7 percent), and alcohol use (about 6 percent).59 This places it well ahead of physical inactivity and obesity, drug use, and unsafe sex, as figure 9 depicts. In India and all of South Asia, cookstove smoke is the highest health risk factor, ranking above smoking and high blood pressure. It is second for Sub-Saharan Africa, third for Southeast Asia, and fifth in East Asia. Air pollution from conventional cookstoves is therefore responsible for 3.5 million direct premature annual deaths. The cost of this burden to national health care systems, not reflected in the price of fuelwood or energy, is $212 billion to $1.1 trillion.61 35 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Figure 9 Burden of disease Attributable to 20 leading risk factors in 2010 for both sexes (percent of disability-adjusted life years globally). Source: Lim et al. 2012. Two key alternatives\u2014improved cookstoves, and biogas digesters\u2014can minimize many of these health-related risks. Indeed, WHO estimates that if half of the global households that still use traditional fuels and stoves switched to cleaner cooking sources, over a ten-year period, families would save $34 billion per year and generate an economic return of $105 billion per year.62 5.1 Improved cookstoves The three basic components of any cookstove are a combustion chamber where wood or charcoal are burnt with air; a heat transfer area, where hot gases actually heat pots and cook; and a chimney which removes hazardous gases outside the cooking area. Improved cookstoves sometimes require a switch away from charcoal or coal to \u201chealthier\u201d fuels such as grass, crop residues, and firewood; they have a grate and an improved combustion chamber; and they almost always have a chimney. They utilize higher temperature ceramics, fire resistant material, longer lasting metals, and possess more insulation and a better frame that guides hot gases closer to cooking pots. They can cook more food at once and many have coils around the combustion chamber to heat water while cooking is in process. Some improved stoves are connected to radiators or space heaters so that heat could be recycled and/or vented to other rooms and some stoves send heat through pipes directly into a brick platform that occupants sleep on at night. Other improved stoves are \u201cfuel flexible\u201d and can combust coal and biomass, although doing so requires homeowners to insert a different combustion chamber for each fuel.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1056a27c-1c7a-4cf8-9634-c218c86431e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1056a27c-1c7a-4cf8-9634-c218c86431e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ccf3b62de836b015535a97bd8b1a0eeeba11fc674df3a1a2dece2ada2778898"}, "2": {"node_id": "eee16f6d-874e-4a2d-b3ca-f131a3215e6c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1babdb4c6d05322d9a1874a31c9cc905d08b35d8339a5cc95a4eeb275aed297"}}, "hash": "de08d88c8a846077a85c2571898fbc4691ee7f59d298f3d88631067fca9d6dc2", "text": "Improved stoves are also often aesthetically pleasing with beautifully designed tile and artwork, making them something to be proud of and handed down to children, regarded as a family asset.63 The most popular models are one-, two-, and three-mouthed clay cookstoves which cut fuel use by half and have chimneys that create a smoke-free cooking environment, improving", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25365b22-170e-4dcd-9cf3-4e05979da11f": {"__data__": {"id_": "25365b22-170e-4dcd-9cf3-4e05979da11f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "888aec86bc4cae6ff17741909f6a695d68d727962a5938012e7d9bf682811c45"}, "3": {"node_id": "fec8cc28-6ed1-48da-8475-8cef6df532cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cfe35a08e74a5ec77acee7fa89dfb1465327da66945eea90b7fcd16d233f729f"}}, "hash": "d66815c0cb79c21be310a19a1f918d04f16b994c19f2c2b36a2c7114a5d112b5", "text": "air quality within the home. These efficient cookstoves not only result in less fuel consumption (typically reducing fuel needs by 40 to 50 percent), they also facilitate shorter cooking times, generate more heat, and reduce IAP by 20 percent. The technical benefits of these improved stoves, moreover, are manifold. They can be installed quickly, often taking only one to two days. Under China\u2019s National Improved Stoves Programme, improved stoves lasted longer, with lifetimes of ten 36 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre years compared to five for traditional stoves. They were constructed in China with prefabricated models taking only seven to 15 days to mold, and they cost only $12 for a complete three-mouthed model with a chimney.64 Throughout Asia, national cookstove programmes have also been shown to provide local employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for local artisans.65 Newer designs of cookstoves, especially those made in the past decade, only multiply such benefits. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are becoming cost-competitive and enable stoves to generate both heat and a small amount of electricity that they use to power a fan, which increases the efficiency of combustion, or to charge small devices such as mobile phones.66 These TEG stoves have been shown to reduce harmful pollutants ten to twenty times the rate of ordinary improved stoves. Natural draft, rocket stoves reduce emissions of key health pollutants by two to three times compared to an ordinary cookstove, and natural draft gasifier stoves can reduce those pollutants by five or six times.67 Microgasifiers, those small enough to fit under a cooking pot at a \u201cconvenient height\u201d, can cleanly burn biogas with almost smoke free combustion, provide a steady flame with no waiting, and can be operated over extended periods of time (no tending of a fire). Moreover, microgasifier stoves reduce soot, black carbon, and particulate matter. They need less total biomass fuel, due to their efficiency.68 Figure 10 shows some of the environmental and health advantages from improved cookstoves, rocket stoves, and gasifier stoves.

Almost all countries among the sample of 18 would benefit from or are benefitting from improved cookstove programmes, some potential exceptions being: \u2022\ufffd Indonesia, where a largely successful liquid petroleum gas (LPG) substitution programme and large subsidies for kerosene have reduced dependence on fuelwood; \u2022\ufffd Malaysia, where a large proportion of homes use LPG, or electricity for cooking; \u2022\ufffd Philippines, where roughly half the population already has access to an improved stove; \u2022\ufffd Sri Lanka, where household needs are met mostly with electricity, kerosene, and gas for cooking, and many homes also have improved stoves; \u2022\ufffd Thailand, where almost two-thirds of people have access to an improved stove. Every other country, however, has significant improved cookstove potential. In Bangladesh, the German International Cooperation, GIZ, has disseminated over 450,000 improved cookstoves and Grameen Shakti has distributed another 300,000. In Cambodia, the Group for the Environment, Renewable Energy and Solidarity reports that they have sold more than 2 million \u201cNew Lao\u201d stoves as of March 2011.69 India has almost 1 billion people in need of an improved stove, and large potential also exists for in many other Asian and Pacific countries. 5.2 Biogas digesters Biogas is a clean fuel produced through anaerobic digestion of animal, agricultural, and domestic wastes. These three forms of organic waste and water typically enter a chamber where they are left to ferment and decompose, producing both biogas as well as digested slurry that can be turned into an organic fertilizer.70 Smaller-scale, two- to three- cubic metre biogas plants tend to be used in homes and communities, suitable for providing gas and heat for cooking three meals a day for an average-sized family. Commercial scale systems exist as well, with these larger units offering enough gas to 37 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre meet the energy needs of neighborhoods, restaurants, tea stalls, and bakeries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fec8cc28-6ed1-48da-8475-8cef6df532cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "fec8cc28-6ed1-48da-8475-8cef6df532cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "888aec86bc4cae6ff17741909f6a695d68d727962a5938012e7d9bf682811c45"}, "2": {"node_id": "25365b22-170e-4dcd-9cf3-4e05979da11f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d66815c0cb79c21be310a19a1f918d04f16b994c19f2c2b36a2c7114a5d112b5"}}, "hash": "cfe35a08e74a5ec77acee7fa89dfb1465327da66945eea90b7fcd16d233f729f", "text": "These larger systems, installed near large farms, poultry suppliers, and livestock ranches, can supply enough gas for up to a thousand families.

India is the fifth largest consumer of biogas in the world, with most biogas derived from animal waste (poultry and livestock associated waste) and cow dung. One assessment has estimated the potential for an additional 25 to 30 million households.72 The Nepali farming system is heavily dependent on livestock, with at least 1.2 million households owning cattle and buffalo, there is technical biogas potential for at least 1 million household-size plants, 57 percent located in the Terai plains, 37 percent in the hills and 6 percent in remote hills.73 According to the Alternative Energy Promotion Center, as of July 2011, 241,920 biogas plants were installed in more than 2,800 Village Development Committees and in all 75 Districts under their Biogas Support Programme. In addition, 2,907 biogas plants were installed under the Gold Standard Biogas Project.74 Still, other estimates of Nepali biogas utilization have calculated that potential for family-sized biogas plants, operating on agricultural residues, could fuel at least another 200,000 units.75 Many other Asian countries are also estimated to have substantial potential for biogas digesters. 39 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 6 RURAL eLeCtRIFICAtIoN The Asia-Pacific is also home to ten countries that have populations of nearly 10 million or more without access to electricity. As figure 11 reveals, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Myanmar, Afghanistan, DPR Korea, Nepal, Cambodia, and the Philippines account for 96.1 percent of people without access to electricity across the Asia-Pacific in 2009.

In these countries, the provision of electricity through grid extension, mini-grids, or off-grid systems can help to expand income-generating activities that contribute to human development, as well as to diversify the economies of developing countries against fossil fuel shocks and price spikes. 6.1 grid extension Lack of electricity from the national grid limits the productive hours of the day for business owners and heads of households, and also inhibits the types of business op- portunities available. Grid electrification, combined with appropriate government, financial and technical training, can make a variety of income generating activities possible, including mechanical power for milling grain, illumination for factories and shops, heat for processing crops, and refrigeration for preserving products.76 In the Philippines, for instance, investments in the electrification fund are largely justified on the grounds that Philippine households typically see income gains of $81 to $150 per month when they become connected to the grid, as table 6 reveals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ead5ed5-680c-4c08-8562-8ab08472342e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ead5ed5-680c-4c08-8562-8ab08472342e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f88ba34df17667bc98d80e4783ab38d704aaa058b6e1a72b9c5c9457fd466acd"}, "2": {"node_id": "27275a94-2245-4ef7-989e-ef840c9eb633", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b4453078bacd0a79907bcb68ac5b8703f8d644feb40faba0c0740051bcc4944"}}, "hash": "b861df9d6be1cfa48fa040c9f71082f522962965de696fb50ad32abe57dc6684", "text": "Table 6 Summary of rural household benefits from electricity in the Philippines Benefit category Benefit value (US$) Unit (per month) Less expensive and expanded use of lighting 36.75 Household Less expensive and expanded use of radio and television 19.60 Household Improved returns on education and wage income 37.07 Household wage earner Time savings for household chores 24.50 Household Improved productivity of home business 34.00 (current business), 75.00 (new business) Business Source: World Bank.

As we elaborate in the section of the report presenting case studies, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Philippines, Viet Nam, and Thailand represent arguable \u201ctrend setters\u201d that have made considerable progress in their electrification efforts. Other countries, such as Fiji, PNG, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, have grid networks that are unlikely to expand further in the near-term, often due to geographic limitations (they consist of thousands of islands and archipelagos or have inaccessible mountainous terrain), and still others, such as Bhutan, Lao PDR, and Sri Lanka, have ambitious and mostly successful electrification programmes in place that are both adding large numbers of customers and obviating incentives to invest in off-grid alternatives. With Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Nepal all recognized as having large grid electrification potential, a summary of their needs and challenge is worth review. 6.1.1 Bangladesh About four-fifths of Bangladesh\u2019s rapidly growing population of 144 million lives in rural areas, and almost four decades after the country\u2019s independence, shortages in natural gas, which provides 70 percent of commercial energy (electricity and liquid fuels), are now common. The most recent numbers offered by the Rural Electrification Board show an estimated 71 percent of households without access to the electricity grid, and due to natural disasters some years such as 2008 to 2009 actually saw a negative electrification rate. Previous estimates calculate that kerosene, natural gas, and electricity combined meet less than 1 percent of rural household energy needs.79 For comparison, energy consumption in Bangladesh is less than one-tenth the global average, and 96 million people lack access to the grid.80 National planners expect the need for $10 billion worth of investment by 2020 only to maintain the grid and stop load shedding. 6.1.2 Cambodia In 2012, 35 percent of Cambodian households had access to electricity, and in provincial towns and rural areas 25 percent of households had access. Only 6 percent access the grid and 3 percent have some type of off-grid or mini-grid source. Of the remaining 75 percent without access, most are estimated to use automotive batteries for occasional supply and approximately one-third forgo access entirely.81 The geographic gaps in coverage have begun to be filled by 600 Rural Electricity Enterprises (REEs), privately owned vendors that have entered the retail electricity sector to provide electricity to households. In 2011, these REEs supplied about 5 percent of the country\u2019s electricity to about 115,000 isolated customers in rural towns. The REEs offer a variety of services including battery recharging, connecting households to micro-grids, and supply electricity through diesel generators, though they have also been accused as charging exorbitant rates.82 6.1.3 India Though most rural villages, about 93, have electricity access, the formal electrification rate (excluding informal connections and theft) among actual households is much lower, about 75 percent, with some 140,000 villages out of 586,000 lacking any connection to the grid whatsoever in 2009.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c87d56fd-f5a4-4dd2-9460-c81cff142d05": {"__data__": {"id_": "c87d56fd-f5a4-4dd2-9460-c81cff142d05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "435325218969697ecc6097cae7f76978a11a91d866c34bed70376445d92f6a54"}, "2": {"node_id": "498e0150-a258-4b82-b673-dc06849843ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af7c3248831ba4215891ac0a9cb16347615669a77df9b4343bae01ce6c0d3943"}}, "hash": "653e1d2ffe0c3447395e3e99b81bd7a7b81dde1baa87d635e0cf4e19d0c43107", "text": "India thus suffers from a \u201csevere shortage\u201d 41 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre of electricity capacity, with blackouts a \u201ccommon occurrence\u201d throughout main cities and total demand for electricity rising at more than 7 percent per year.83 As one assessment put it, \u201cadditional capacity has failed to materialize in India in light of market regulations, insufficient investment in the sector, and difficulty in obtaining environmental approval and funding for hydropower projects\u201d and \u201ccoal shortages are further straining power generation capabilities\u201d.84 Even where electricity access is available, the quality of supply remains poor because power is often unavailable during the evening hours when people use it the most.85 Only 7 out of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c3ca948-651a-46df-91e2-e0b0a820b488": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c3ca948-651a-46df-91e2-e0b0a820b488", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a238fb90cbf88ef9f088f9086d96a2a1b3b92a95a57a695035fecca4e0377e6"}, "3": {"node_id": "abc0b25e-d0bd-433d-b05e-ee147c5f4d1d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f37d6cbb9c64a5c1d0bde4f4680ff9cbf988291c4f68ead7f97f1e8c3d3914a"}}, "hash": "1a5f8f583329928c6e6e1a42cd1b02b0a40042716847173c07773988e2127ece", "text": "28 states have achieved 100 percent village electrification, and many large states such as Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh have lagged behind electrification efforts.

The national electricity access rate went from a low of 2 percent in the late 1970s to 65 percent in 2009. Much of this electricity access progress occurred in the decade starting in late 1980s and was significantly slowed down in the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis that started in 1997, and a huge number of Indonesians still lack access to electricity. The World Bank estimates that about 81 million people were without electricity in 2009, making Indonesia, one of the top ten countries with largest number of people lacking access to electricity. Compared to other East Asian and Pacific countries with relatively similar economic strength, Indonesia\u2019s electricity access rate is among the lowest. 6.1.5 Mongolia Mongolia confronts high rates of poverty, low population density, and low per capita electricity use. With a per capita income of $1,870 per year, Mongolia has grown in recent years to become classified as a lower middle income country. Despite this, UNDP reports that \u201ca substantial portion of the population in Mongolia still lacks access to electricity despite an expansion in the country\u2019s energy infrastructure.\u201d87 The country\u2019s large geographic size, low population density and nomadic herding lifestyle practiced by approximately one fourth of the country\u2019s population make transmitting and distributing electricity difficult, a feat compounded by old and inefficient Russian generators that frequently break down and are completely dependent on fossil fuels. 6.1.6 Nepal Nepal\u2019s national electrification rate in 2009 was about 44 percent, meaning around 17 million people did not have access to electricity. Moreover, the Nepal Electricity Authority, the state-owned monopoly supplier of power for the country, serves only 15 percent of the total population of Nepal.88 For this small number of customers, average electricity supply is less than eight hours per day, with load shedding accounting for up to 16 hours during winter. In December 2008 the Nepal Government declared a \u201cnational energy crisis\u201d and approved an Energy Crisis Management Action Plan.89 In January 2009, things got even worse as drought in one part of the country reduced water available for hydroelectricity generation, and floods in another part breached the embankments of the Kosi River, toppling a crucial transmission line importing power from India. Such events provoked the World Bank to declare that \u201cNepal is experiencing an energy crisis of unprecedented severity, caused by years of under- investment and sharp growth in electricity demand.\u201d90 Other recent studies have concluded that \u201cNepal has strikingly low levels of access and electricity consumption compared to many other developing countries.\u201d91 6.2 micro-grids and mini-grids A mini-grid refers to a localized or isolated grouping of electricity generation, distribution, storage, and consumption within a confined geographic space.92 While in some instances mini-grids can be interconnected to national electricity networks, in most cases they operate autonomously and at lower loads and voltages. Though definitions vary, mini-grids are often locally managed, they involve less than 10 MW of installed capacity, they serve small household loads, and they possess a radius of 50 kilometers or less. Micro-grids are even smaller and typically operate with less than 100 kW of capacity and at even lower voltage levels and possess a three to eight kilometer radius.93 Mini- and micro-grids can be powered by fossil fuels, such as diesel generators or fuel cells, or by renewable energy sources such as microhydro dams, solar 42 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre PV plants, biomass combustion and wind turbines. When configured properly, such mini- and micro-grids can operate more cost effectively than centralized generation from a power grid.94 At least five countries in the Asia-Pacific\u2014Nepal, Sri Lanka, Lao PDR, Mongolia, and Viet Nam\u2014have been experimenting with mini- and micro-grids for rural electrification over the past decade.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abc0b25e-d0bd-433d-b05e-ee147c5f4d1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "abc0b25e-d0bd-433d-b05e-ee147c5f4d1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a238fb90cbf88ef9f088f9086d96a2a1b3b92a95a57a695035fecca4e0377e6"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c3ca948-651a-46df-91e2-e0b0a820b488", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a5f8f583329928c6e6e1a42cd1b02b0a40042716847173c07773988e2127ece"}}, "hash": "6f37d6cbb9c64a5c1d0bde4f4680ff9cbf988291c4f68ead7f97f1e8c3d3914a", "text": "Nepal\u2019s Rural Energy Development Programme (REDP), Sri Lanka\u2019s Energy Services Delivery Project, and the Rural Electrification Project in Lao PDR all entailed components tailoring grid, micro-grid, and off-grid solutions to local circumstances.

The Rural Energy Access Project in Mongolia, similarly, pursued a two-pronged strategy of isolated diesel and solar hybrids for some herders but micro-grids for others living near soum centers (in Mongolia, a soum is equivalent to a district or county).95 Viet Nam\u2019s Renewable Energy for Remote Island and Mountain Communes Project financed the construction of ten mini-hydropower facilities, with a capacity of less than 7.5 MW each, in several northern provinces of Viet Nam. It built more than 100 kilometers of low-voltage micro-grid networks and electrified 50 villages and 5,000 households.96 Due to the isolated nature of their remote communities and the particular distribution of renewable resources such as microhydro or biomass, Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, PNG, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu also have potential to further expand energy access through mini- and micro-grids. Indeed, the IEA expects micro- and mini-grids to play an instrumental role in global electrification efforts over the next decade, especially in the Asia-Pacific. The IEA\u2019s most recent numbers suggest that national grid extension is the most suitable option for all urban areas and for around 30 percent of rural areas, but not a cost effective option in more remote rural areas.97 Therefore, in the Asia-Pacific 70 percent of rural areas are assumed to be connected either with mini-grids (65 percent of this share) or with small, stand-alone off-grid solutions (the remaining 35 percent)\u2014as table 7 shows. Out of a total generation requirement of 838 TWh, 56 percent (or 470 TWh) will be provisioned via mini-grid and isolated off-grid technology.

They can also receive electricity through microhydro dams, solar lanterns, and PV SHSs. Other, larger options, such as commercial-scale biogas and biomass, wind, solar, and geothermal units, are discussed in Chapter Eight on renewable energy. 6.3.1 Microhydro dams Unlike their larger counterparts which require reservoirs, microhydro plants utilize low- voltage distribution systems and simpler designs that often have a natural river intake, de-sanding basin, masonry lined canal, forebay, penstock, powerhouse, short tailrace, and electronic load controller. By \u201cmicro\u201d we refer to what is commonly discussed as either \u201cmicro\u201d (less than 100 kW) or \u201csmall\u201d (less than 10 MW).98 Microhydro units have a distinct set of advantages since they can provide not only electricity, but also mechanical energy for milling, husking, grinding, carpentry, spinning, and pump irrigation. Local people can also be trained to manage them without any technical background in engineering or maintenance. They can also provide electricity in remote 43 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre mountain areas unsuited for biogas (because fermentation takes more time at higher altitudes) and SHSs in areas prone to fog and cloud cover.

Customers in off-grid and rural areas can often choose from a variety of systems and technologies. Larger systems often have the capacity to connect televisions, radios, and other electric appliances. These systems have seen their competitiveness decline in the past few years due to advances in solar lanterns (see below) and rapid expansion of grid electrification.

Current demographic, economic, social, and technological trends pose major challenges to the global energy system and increase the need for intelligent energy efficiency solutions. If more ambitious energy policies beyond those already planned are not implemented between now and 2030, it is projected that the world\u2019s energy consumption will increase by 30 to 50 percent. In developing countries, energy consumed by the industrial sector is frequently in excess of 50 percent of the national energy supply. Energy efficiency measures contribute to development and reduce costs both for public and private sector. Adopting energy efficient technologies could, by 2030, reduce global projected electricity consumption of buildings and industry by 14 percent. In more industrialized countries, investments in energy productivity can contribute to job creation. Energy efficiency practices are already commercially available and ready to be utilized, and in many countries they are being adopted without dependence on subsidies or further research. Energy efficiency is an opportunity that is not capital intensive, reduces consumption of water and other resources, contributes to reducing greenhouse gases emissions, and is not prone to catastrophic failure. Energy efficiency can specifically reduce the financial burdens for energy consumers, decrease net import dependency for importers or enhance exports for exporters, and improve local economic competiveness and employment.101 Experiences from numerous Asian countries already confirm many of these points. In Bhutan, for example, major industrial electricity customers such as steel manufacturers, aluminum smelters, chemical companies, and cement makers could cut their energy use cost-effectively by 9 to 35 percent without decreases in output and profit, as energy efficiency costs more than balance energy savings.102 Cambodia\u2019s energy efficiency potential amounts to as much as 467 GWh per year, or almost one-third of national energy demand, mostly through potential improvements to the residential sector, which uses most of the country\u2019s electricity.103 India has cost effective energy savings potential of 10 to 70 percent for households and 8 to 40 percent for industries available.104 In Indonesia, about 181.18 GWh of electricity consumption can be saved by 2025 through implementation of energy efficiency and conservation measures, displacing 20 to 26 percent of expected national electricity consumption.105 In Sri Lanka, energy efficiency efforts are so cost effective that spending Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR) 1.22 billion is projected to reap LKR 135 billion in financial savings.106 \u201cThough this energy efficiency potential exists in every country in the sample, it takes many different forms in practice, with existing efforts falling into the eight broad categories previewed by table 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c5b65cc-4a1c-4eed-bd9a-7c4264984490": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c5b65cc-4a1c-4eed-bd9a-7c4264984490", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56f8bf58d12e0ca5e92314e92df8d2dfc416b32db2b50351f471cdfeb457722f"}, "2": {"node_id": "72df4c4d-3078-48fc-a86c-07ec6cebc5ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e36431d3dfbefddbf1983a1eb063cf6c1438cf314a302e60eb61541289da8bca"}}, "hash": "a9db263ec32382bf7c169496ac4e645c820d1f553123f42a2a9da959ba162fbc", "text": "They are, in order of most popular, labels and standards for electric appliances (present in 12 countries) followed by programmes reducing electric transmission and distribution losses (ten countries) and industrial and commercial programmes (ten countries) proceeded by lighting (eight countries), demand-side management (five countries), building codes (six countries), energy efficiency funds (four countries), and government programmes for combined heat and power and cogeneration (three countries).\u201d Although countries in the Asia-Pacific are undertaking various energy efficiency activities, there are others that have not yet taken advantage of this option.

Another tool utilized only rarely is ascending block rate pricing and decoupling revenues from sales for the electricity sector. The promotion of ascending block rate pricing, where customers are charged higher rates for electricity the more they consume, has encouraged more efficient use in India, Malaysia, Vanuatu, and Viet Nam. Another important policy innovation is decoupling the profits of electricity and natural gas utilities from their sales volumes. Some states in North America are adopting this policy, which allows electric utilities to keep a small share of the savings they achieve for their customers. In other words, the utilities are \u201crewarded for cutting your bill, not for selling you more energy\u201d.109 The Natural Resources Defense Council has noted that the relatively simple act of decoupling ensures that utilities cannot make windfalls by encouraging higher (and at times, unnecessary) sales and are not penalized when energy-efficiency programmes and other efforts reduce consumption.110 7.1 electric appliance standards/labels Nonetheless, numerous Asian countries have labelling programmes or are in the process of implementing them. Bangladesh has a standards and labeling scheme, which lays down minimum energy performance standards for energy intensive equipment and appliances. In Bhutan, a study conducted under USAID\u2019s South Asia Regional Initiative programme examined the potential for a standards and labeling programme and estimated that the use of efficient fluorescent lamps, rice cookers and refrigerators, complemented by a public awareness campaign to promote efficient appliances could potentially save 5-8 MW electricity peak demand over a five-year period.111 In Malaysia, a voluntary labeling programme covers refrigerators, fans, ballasts, lamps, air conditioners, televisions, insulation materials, and electric motors, which can receive a label like the one depicted in figure 13. These labels are being implemented in tandem with the country\u2019s Sustainability Achieved via Energy Efficiency programme, which is aiming to save 7,300 GWh of electricity by 2020. These savings are to be accomplished by the phasing out of inefficient models from local markets, with 100,000 rebate vouchers for five-star rated (the most efficient) refrigerators and 65,000 vouchers for five-star air conditioners being allocated so far, and 4,000 retail outlets participating with 12 brands to select products from.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e965e71-3aa0-4a01-835c-a16199ec2127": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e965e71-3aa0-4a01-835c-a16199ec2127", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3268b18c34f6ebd975c64929e2d2729a7bebb365290ba1026c46c63e05f98b1a"}, "2": {"node_id": "00ed0db4-1433-412e-bd3a-2d3121fa73ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55249e5abc2525303d6012d3563b01f907b1e2214525d0025d6e3096e8139d87"}}, "hash": "f2ae921b2cc95f4a9d9d8a92cff70b24a3710fd1aca7bc87b3d9fe2b175e1004", "text": "As of 2012, 66.3 GWh have been saved and the five-star refrigerators have accomplished a 12.4 percent market share and the five-star air conditioners a 7.1 percent market share.
