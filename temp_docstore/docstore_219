The meeting aimed to achieve a consensus from national stakeholders on the components, as well as intervention priori- ties to prevent hiV transmission among MSM be- havioural populations, including Tg populations. a key challenge when reviewing past experiences in responding to hiV among MSM is that most of the current interventions among MSM in asia and the Pacific have not benefited from rigorous outcome evaluations using behavioural and/or biological outcomes to analyse their effectiveness in asia.ix despite this, many countries in the region do have a set of interventions that can justifiably serve as the basis for discussion and for the development of consensus. 5 regional consensus meeting To increase the effectiveness of all of these initiatives, the proposed Comprehensive Package of Services for MSM and TG Consensus Meeting with government and civil society representatives aimed to build on collective efforts and experiences of national aidS responses, ingo and community experiences to achieve the following objective: national government deci- \ufffd sion-makers, multi and bilater- al donors, international ngos and community advocates review, identify priorities and endorse the components of a comprehensive package of programmes and services to support national responses. an endorsed comprehensive package of services and pro- grammes to support hiV preven- tion, treatment and care which is intended to serve as essential tool for national aidS authorities and community-based organisations to design and scale up effective responses to hiV among MSM and Tg at the local and national level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "307cacfc-744e-4686-a0d1-e26a9b30f5f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "307cacfc-744e-4686-a0d1-e26a9b30f5f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) Populations in Asia and the Pacific - Regional Consensus Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a3a97d9d6e504fcbe08ddcbbd13cd2e829be50327d57599e9a3029b86ce3168"}, "2": {"node_id": "d92ec7a1-2e12-40c7-88d5-2f017ac378fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a7a74c70e6bfc155c48dd320d712cda330c7277bf669c7bb113ce3d3ce8d357"}}, "hash": "f6f0670232b2f0450db6baf6fb2e6e770e98f57cc96bf4b879718f65561cc077", "text": "objective of the Consensus Meeting expected outcomes of the Consensus Meeting Structure of the Consensus Meeting in brief, the consensus meeting consisted of: Presentations on different as- 1. pects of the comprehensive response; Small group work to define 2. the services and interven- tions that make up a compre- hensive response; and a final plenary to consider the 3. draft consensus statement on the comprehensive package.

These participants included government health ministry representatives, health service providers, national aidS pro- gramme officers, national MSM focal points, and community members from the following countries: Cambodia, indonesia, laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam (aSean member states). Representatives from China, india, Japan and from the Pacific Region also attended the meeting. additionally, representatives from aPn+, Seven Sisters, inter- national ngos, un agencies and technical experts participated in the meeting.

This is done not just through hiV-specific initiatives, but by assisting MSM and transgender to maximise their overall health and wellbeing. The package covers the continuum of prevention, treatment and care programmes and services, sup- ported by the maintenance of an enabling environ- ment and informed by local and relevant strategic information. The comprehensive package contains a mix of MSM and Tg-specific and mainstream services that are MSM and Tg-friendly. The way that services and programmes are delivered under the package is as important as the elements of the package. Some services and programmes are best delivered through MSM or Tg CBos and ngos, others by gov- ernment and private sector services. The services and programmes ideally recognize that MSM and Tg are not a homogenous population, that pro- grammes and service need to be tailored to meet the specific needs of sub-populations and that the nature and needs of these subpopulations varies from setting to setting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0c2018f-1596-4a7a-ad72-46665b7d4ba9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0c2018f-1596-4a7a-ad72-46665b7d4ba9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) Populations in Asia and the Pacific - Regional Consensus Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa8a72c3612664f49556995625732582808eb7fbfedbcc21674273c79e234bcc"}, "2": {"node_id": "50dee027-062d-4aa1-b531-10672ec24f4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "754083a5cdb41b933cae71a513c330f3d6a1676a200416d2f80120870ae1de93"}}, "hash": "2f598de482a18f53545a8b898de10211d15435bb182828273a91e6e21a36ed03", "text": "The comprehensive pack- age takes account of the fact that some MSM and Tg can be reached through community organisa- tions, whilst others cannot; that some respond well to written BCC materials whist others do not; that some can easily use mainstream health services without stigma and discrimination, whilst others cannot.

For people with hiV it can be life-saving as it can provide them with access to hiV treatment and care. it can also assist them to put strategies in place to protect others. For people who do not have hiV, the process of testing and counselling needs to act to reinforce their need to stay healthy and hiV-free. The vast majority of MSM and Tg in asia and the Pacific do not know their hiV status. Some have ac- cessed hiV testing and counselling, but have been lost to follow-up.

The rollout of VCT services in some countries, without this link firmly in place, has led to high rates of loss to follow-up and the late presentation of MSM and Tg with hiV to treat- ment, care and support service. This contributes to unnecessarily high levels of death, costly medical treatments for avoidable opportunistic infections as well as onward hiV transmission. The split in programming between hiV prevention and care in many national and local hiV programmes has also seen the development of some service models that focus on prescribing oi and aRT medications without a holistic focus that includes hiV preven- tion, family/partner care and support, adherence counselling and education, and promotion of gen- eral wellbeing.

Mr. Rossel- lini stated that the UNAIDS Action Framework: Universal Access for MSM and TG People, recently endorsed at the unaidS PCB meeting in geneva (June 2009), will assist the un system to accelerate and better coordinate its efforts in this area, guided by the following principles: action must be grounded in an understanding \ufffd of, and commitment to, human rights, the cor- nerstone to an effective response to hiV action must be based on and informed by an \ufffd evidence-base on hiV among MSM and Tg action is required by a broad range of partners, \ufffd simultaneously addressing both short- and long-term needs and opportunities to ensure broader and better responses to hiV among MSM and Tg he closed by stating that while human rights pro- tection is a pre-condition for strong responses, it is not enough in and of itself. in the asia-Pacific region, there are a number of countries that mix tolerance and repression; that often criminalise same-sex relationships, but only rarely enforce these laws; that have effective community-based MSM responses to hiV in some urban centers, yet none at all in other parts of the country. he urged all participants to simultaneously push for legislative reform, wider scale community mobilisation and enhanced human rights protection.

Philavong concluded by expressing his sincere hope that this Regional Consultation would provide a good opportunity to share analysis of gaps in ad- dressing this emerging issue, and to learn from each 13 regional consensus meeting other to address the issue more effectively through collaboration, shared policy development, sharing lessons-learned about what works to address spe- cific issue and recommend regional programming where appropriate. Caitlin Wiesen, Regional HIV/AIDS Practice Lead- er and Programme Coordinator Asia-Pacific, UNDP Regional Centre Colombo, highlighted the impacts of the epidemics on MSM and Tg, and explained that there is a lack of policy guidance for hiV interventions among MSM and Tg which comprehensively focus on prevention, treatment, care and support. She explained attention should be given to the coverage of quality and compre- hensive interventions. While effective programmes should reach around 50% to 60% coverage levels, in most asian countries, the coverage levels for most- at-risk populations average around 30%. Coverage rates among MSM are estimated at less than 8%. She emphasised that this is the reason why current strategies have had little impact on halting the pro- gression of these concentrated hiV epidemics. She stated that any effective hiV programme must address the legal barriers and discriminatory prac- tices that impede effective service delivery to high risk and vulnerable communities. Whilst attention to MSM and human rights concerns is found in most national aidS strategies, these strategies are often not costed and budgeted and therefore there is a lack of translation into action. existing costing and resource estimation tools used by the governments are not currently designed to address these issues. She expressed the need for a comprehensive and complementary national costing and community-friendly resource estima- tion tool to assure strong alignment with universal access targets and the recommendations of the Commission on aidS in asia report. The tool should include new areas such as supporting the enabling environment and addressing human rights and gen- der dimensions of MSM and Tg hiV responses. Ms. Wiesen recommended the use of tools like the asian hiV and aidS Resource estimation and Cost- ing Model (undP-unaidS-adB) to ensure focused and rights-based interventions to hiV among MSM and Tg are included and budgeted. She expressed a hope that the key outcomes of this meeting and following uSaid/hPi advocacy and Resource esti- mation Workshop would help strengthen the key MSM components in costed national plans. \u201cThere will be no equitable progress so long as some parts of the population are marginalised and denied basic health and human rights \u2013 PlWhiV, MSM, SW, idus\u201d Quote by the un Secretary general in 2008 Finally, Ms. Wiesen pointed to the unique oppor- tunities ahead: The un Secretary general puts full weight and \ufffd support behind efforts in addressing the en- trenched stigma, discrimination, and laws that criminalise same sex behaviour and impede ac- cess to hiV services; unaidS: Framework for action on MSM and hiV \ufffd recently endorsed; and Commission of aidS in asia Report unequivo- \ufffd cally puts the issue of epidemics among MSM as top priority for action She closed by saying that any effective hiV pro- gramme must address the legal barriers and dis- criminatory practices that stand in the way of getting services to high risk and vulnerable com- munities.

Who\u2019s recent focus on MSM and hiV in the Region began with the implementation of the regional consultation on the health sector response to hiV among MSM held in hong kong (China) in February 2009. That meeting followed on a global consultation that was held in geneva in September 2008. Strong international consultation partner- ships were established to steer an appropriate re- sponse to the crisis. Mr. Clif Cortez, Regional Team Leader, HIV/AIDS, Office of Public Health, Regional Development Mission Asia (RDMA), U.S. Agency for Interna- tional Development (USAID) shared with the audi- ence that the first discussions that he was a part of between uSaid/Washington and unaidS/geneva regarding MSM and Tg took place in 1997 but with no official leadership taken on this issue by unaidS at that time. in recent years, un leadership in asia regarding MSM and Tg issues had improved; first under the leadership of unaidS Regional Support Team, asia and the Pacific; as then as a result of the energy provided by uneSCo. Most recently, the greater un global commitment, as evidenced by undP officially taking coordinating responsibility for the un for MSM/Tg-hiV issues may represent a \u201cgame-changing\u201d shift towards a cohesive and strengthened un coordinated approach to these critical issues in asia and the Pacific. uSaid has supported hiV prevention among MSM and Tg in various latin america and asia-Pacific countries since the mid-1990\u2019s but, like all other donors supporting such hiV prevention, for many years the ngos and specific services supported were not linked effectively from a beneficiary\u2019s perspective, and there was no strategy behind the support. however, since 2003, uSaid has supported a strategy of MSM and Tg-focused interventions, linked as a network of interventions and services through both community-based organisations and local government services, in specific geographic sites. This includes supportive interventions such as policy, stigma and discrimination reduction, government and ngo capacity building. This ap- proach has been labelled the \u2018minimum package of services\u2019 (MPS). in 2008, the unaidS-supported independent Com- mission on aidS in asia spoke of essential services for MaRPs, and the elements of \u201cessential servic- es\u201d noted were the same as uSaid\u2019s MPS. uSaid supports the move towards a comprehensive pack- age of services for MSM and Tg. Mr Cortes expressed a hope that this meeting, with the support of the key regional donor (uSaid), in partnership with undP, Who, and other multilaterals, together with government and civil society, will also be a \u2018game changer\u2019 in the response to hiV and aidS among MSM and Tg. he stated that there was another significant \u2018game changer\u2019 in this region - mobilising the resources provided by the global Fund to Fight aidS, Tuber- culosis and Malaria (gFaTM). until very recently, uSaid remained the only significant funder of hiV interventions for MSM and Tg both globally and in asia and the Pacific. This has changed dramatically with gFaTM Round 8 (and hopefully future Rounds). But even though most countries included MSM in their Round 8 proposals, not all countries included support for the concept of a comprehensive hiV prevention package for MSM and Tg. he hoped that a critical outcome of this meeting would be the use of the comprehensive package concept to engage with gFaTM in each country to ensure that global Fund projects meet minimum standards of quality, and engagement of affected civil society in relation to MSM and Tg.

Currently, there is powerful support with the presence of certain individuals at the global and regional levels, he emphasised, but there is a need to institutionalise the MSM and Tg issues within the un system. he elaborated that increased holistic thinking is needed and that critical issues need to be tackled. he referred to Who, who continues to 15 regional consensus meeting classify Tg as a disease. Mr. khan concluded that he wanted to bear witness to the millions of people denied the right to live with dignity and social jus- tice in the Region. \u201cWe must not forget who we are discussing. The need is not only to target hiV support but also to support making society more inclusive for MSM and Tg, because unless we address the underlying psychological factors the af- fect this group, targeted interventions will not work.\u201d he emphasised that critical issues around low self- esteem/self worth, lack of social justice and citizen- ship rights also affect MSM and Tg, but that inter- ventions are not strategically designed to address this. Finally, Mr. khan stressed that poverty issues are key factors that are not fully exposed and that are undervalued in development approaches. he gave an example that MSM often lack education due early school dropout rates due to harassment and sexual abuse, sexuality and gender preferences. This lack of education leads to poor access to jobs and can lead to sex work and a higher vulnerability to hiV and STi\u2019s. agenda Setting: hiV among MSM and Tg in asia Pacific Dr. Frits van Griensven, Thailand MOPH-U.S. CDC Collaboration reported on the epidemiol- ogy of hiV infection among populations of MSM in asia and the Pacific. he explained that current hiV prevention efforts have been unable to contain or reduce hiV transmission in this population and that additional behavioural and biomedical interven- tions were urgently needed. he noted that while knowledge is growing, little systematic knowledge is available regarding risk behaviours and the preva- lence of hiV and STi in populations of MSM in the greater Mekong sub-region and China. he noted that the levels of hiV and STi prevalence in the region were high and that continued moni- toring, surveillance and targeted preventive inter- ventions were necessary to stop the spread of hiV in this vulnerable population. he discussed new developments in asia including new data from Myanmar and presented some highlights from the hiV Sentinel Sero-Surveillance survey. The survey presents similar data to that from Thailand show- ing people acquiring hiV at a very young age. he referred to the currently ongoing hiV prevalence surveys in kuala lumpur, Malaysia, and in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket in Thailand. Results from these studies will be available by the end of 2009. dr. van griensven also presented data from the Bangkok MSM Cohort Study, where about 6% of 1002 hiV negative men enrolled in the study be- came hiV-infected every year. after three years of the study, the cumulative hiV incidence in the cohort was 24.7%. The annual incidence of hiV in- fection was higher in those 22 years of age and younger, with about 10% of men becomming in- fected in this group every year. dr. van griensven drew attention to some of the ongoing chemoprophylaxis trials that may undergo interim analysis later this year. he explained that the use of PreP looks promising in animal models. if proven effective the placebo arms in the study will be closed and participants will be given the active study drug. he informed that ongoing trials of daily Truvada\u00a9 amongst MSM, injection drug users and heterosexuals.

Strengthening surveil- lance and implementing interventions for the prevention and treatment of hiV and other STis for MSM and Tg should be considered as priority activities for all countries and regions as part of a range of interventions to ensure universal access to hiV prevention, care and treatment. global Consultation on MSM and hiV in geneva, Septem- ber 2008, Who/undP/unaidS Strategic information on MSM and Tg including \ufffd epidemiological and biological/behavioural surveillance data should be collected through existing systems; together with social/anthro- pological, and operations research.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96d75b81-8e36-4e30-b875-675a84d8bcef": {"__data__": {"id_": "96d75b81-8e36-4e30-b875-675a84d8bcef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) Populations in Asia and the Pacific - Regional Consensus Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2d3af4eb1fa98f4ecf2670d025b7c777416f25572efd6ef0c2d0a0b70fc52c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d54ec39-5e3c-4cfe-b4fb-1083a68c011b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "225281005ce8ab85d7a54d82750177f4fd01842a79a6d83aa8a6d7536186915e"}}, "hash": "28ba82801ee6f6be13d5aead705e6dbfd8e9971bde03fdf915f9ad87a0ecbaa7", "text": "There are several promising interventions cur- \ufffd rently underway in low and middle-income countries in the region, but most are limited in scale and coverage; constrained by accessibil- ity, quality of services, capacity of implement- ing partners and service providers, availability of resources, and legal and social barriers There are, at present, different understandings \ufffd of labels with regards to a package of services, such as \u2018minimum\u2019, \u2018comprehensive\u2019, \u2018essential\u2019, however, the meeting recognised the need for an endorsed, single comprehensive regional reference package to better inform national re- sponses in high hiV incidence settings, additional urgent \ufffd prevention measures are needed and a \u201chighly active intervention package (hai)\u201d should be developed in order to break the chain of trans- mission Partnership with aPCoM on strengthening \ufffd health sector responses is essential SOURCE asian epidemic Model estimates for the asian region.

Conversely, in countries with legal protection and the protection of human rights for these people, many more have access to services. as a result, there are fewer infections, less de- mand for antiretroviral treatment and fewer deaths. not only is it unethical not to protect these groups; it makes no sense from a health perspective. it hurts all of us.\u201d Ban ki-moon, Secretary-general of the united nations, august 2008 Mr. Settle underscored the urgent need not just for more programming, but also for new and better ap- proaches. Based on local epidemiological and social realities, enhanced responses must combine efforts focused specifically on MSM and Tg and attention to their needs in broader hiV responses, and bridge- building with broader efforts to achieve gender equality, promote human rights and protect public health. he further emphasised that countries must be rigorous in monitoring the evolution of their hiV epidemics and recalibrating their responses as needed. he emphasised that: MSM and Tg have an essential role to play in \ufffd launching, sustaining and reinventing commu- nity and self-help responses, as well as related cultural and political advocacy efforts other civil society actors are key allies, includ- \ufffd ing aidS organisations lesbian/gay/bisexual/ transgender rights movements, family plan- ning associations, human rights advocates and religious institutions with ethics of caring and inclusion governments are key partners and have an ob- \ufffd ligation to respond in both public health and human rights. They are at the cutting edge of health service provision, and often overseeing police and education services Public and private donors must be convinced \ufffd to invest in effective and targeted action, based on the evidence of the significant role of these populations in the hiV pandemic Mr. Settle concluded by stating that the ten un- aidS cosponsors and the unaidS Secretariat have a unique mandate and the ability to work with part- ners to achieve a stronger enabling environment for hiV prevention, treatment, care and support in the long-term, while taking advantage of multiple entry points and opportunities for impact in the short-term. he argued that far more needed to be done within a broader context, by developing and strengthening partnerships as an essential aspect of regional and national aidS responses in the asia- Pacific region. Following the presentations, the plenary discus- sion also reinforced the need for an expanded re- sponse to hiV among MSM and Tg in more devel- oped countries (e.g. Japan, Taiwan, Singapore) as strategies should not only focus on lower-income countries. The unaidS action Framework was cited as a good step forward and countries in the sub re- gion were advised to examine the report and adapt its recommendations. Participants expressed that knowledge of what works and an understanding of best practice is still weak and that there was a lock of critical information available on the impact of programmes. Community groups have supported organisations to point out where to invest, what kind of inter- ventions to choose because high level organisa- tions might be unaware of local realities. advice was given to link budgets with size estimation and realistic denominators to be better able to convince governments to allocate resources and identify ap- propriate interventions. Participants stressed that PlhiV should be involved in all interventions including prevention, treatment care and support. interventions are needed to try to break silence and to change dynamics. Research and data about the population is required to iden- tify overlaps in need and approach between sub- populations, as well as the specific needs of par- ticular subpopulations.

Mi gave an overview of the Chinese government response from 2004 to 2006. in 2004, central govern- ment funds supported the first MSM ngo. in 2005, central government funds supported 17 projects for MSM, Moh issued a policy paper, set up high-risk intervention team targeting sexual transmission (including MSM), high-level central government officials met with MSM community representatives and a national consultation with MSM communities was held. in 2006, a national technical guideline for the control hiV/aidS among and from MSM was developed and a national response plan to control hiV and aidS among and from MSM was developed jointly with MSM communities. Recent responses involve a second national Con- sultation with MSM communities that was held in 2007, a joint national survey of hiV infection, pre- vention and care projects that was conducted in 2008 and the establishment in 2009 of a perspective cohort to evaluate the impact of a comprehensive intervention package implemented in 8 cities with hiV prevalence rates greater than 5%.

MSM Surveillance shows that STi and hiV rates were very high among MSM in Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya, especially among those who engage in commercial sex. MSM tend to have multiple sex partners, both male and female, and significant numbers also buy and sell sex. Consistent condom use remains low, knowledge of preventive mea- sures against sexual transmission of hiV and other STi was moderate to high in six cities but overall 21 regional consensus meeting knowledge was lower. MSM receive information about hiV from a variety of sources, moderate pro- portions of MSM has recently used STi treatment services and received hiV counselling and testing. although drug use affects only a small proportion of MSM, the recent use of amphetamines and simi- lar drugs was reported by sizeable proportions of MSM in some cities. however, few MSM inject drugs. Coverage of programmes compared with national estimation population shows that: PHILIPPINES: Dr. Ferchito L. Avelino, Director III, Secretariat of the Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC) stated that in the Philippines in 2007, the department of health (doh) and Who estimated the number of people living with hiV in the Philippines at 7,490. This shows an increase of 1,490 on the 2002 estimate. MSM registers the high- est estimate, with a 0.07 to 0.98 hiV prevalence. he explained that among the 85 new hiV infections reported for May 2009, the mode of transmission for 88% was reported as sex between men. Some 3,911 cumulative hiV cases were reported to the aidS Registry, of which is 2,777 (71%) were male and 3,500 (90%), reported as infected through sexual contact. Sexual transmission proved to be the predominant mode of transmission, increasing from one new hiV case detected every three days in 2001, to one case per day in 2007 and two cases detected per day in 2009. The mode of transmission shifted from once predominantly heterosexual to that of homosexual transmission and a sharp in- crease in the number of MSM with hiV was noted from 2006 onward. Results of the 2nd generation Surveillance on hiV and MSM revealed the below findings. Though the surveillance was conducted in 2004, risk factors for hiV identified are still relevant today.

Current outreach activi- ties must be reviewed to explore other avenues of reaching out to MSM. Building partnership must go beyond the usual national government, non- government and donor players. Research findings need to draw out information that will provide bet- ter understanding of the issue of hiV among MSM. For years the hallmark of hiV response for MSM in the country was based on building knowledge through capacity or awareness building. Referral mechanisms in relation to STi case management have been established. With the increasing trend of infection amongst this subpopulation, Mr. avelino said, initiatives need to be reviewed. Challenges in the MSM response are: Weak organisational capacity amongst differ- \ufffd ent MSM communities to respond to the needs and challenges that confront them lack of relevant and reliable demographic \ufffd knowledge on population sise and subpopula- tion characteristics Persistence of homophobia and discrimination \ufffd health care system not accessible, sensitive and \ufffd responsive to the needs of MSM an Tg insufficient funding and other resources allo- \ufffd cated to hiV among MSM and Tg The strategic direction includes a focused on most at risk populations, adoption of a package of services approach in reaching MaRPs and the achievement of at least 60% coverage for MaRPs (ungaSS report shows only 14% reached). Finally, Mr. avelino showed examples and budget alloca- tions of the intervention Package for MSM for spe- cific components:, behaviour change, commodities and services, enabling environment, programme management, investments and monitoring and evaluation. The plenary discussion revolved around social and sexual behaviour (that requires more multi-faced responses), issues around condom use, the need to develop programmes and services for positive MSM and Tg. Participants discussed experience on what works, citing examples from both resource- rich and resource-poor countries, where the im- plementation of a package of interventions has proven to be helpful. This contextual approach has been shown to reduce hiV infection rates. evidence also shows that if governments reduce their invest- ment hiV transmission rates rise again. Continued investment and increased partnership between the community and government will contribute significantly. Such approaches need to be built into the response. Research experiences of increased internet access and use in indonesia were shared. Finally, participants expressed that the information from China and Cambodia was inspirational. hav- ing a sub-plan on MSM and hiV, and a very specific framework and costing plan increased coordination and provided useful insights on how the country was responding. They have each provided leader- ship and a mechanism that created opportunities to mobilise funds. 23 regional consensus meeting Rob Gray, Regional Advisor, Population Servic- es International (PSI) Asia gave a presentation entitled defining Comprehensive Prevention among MSM and Tg. Mr. gray noted the importance of developing a com- prehensive package of services that also included the mechanisms by which the effectiveness of the services and interventions are measured. he said that too often attention is given to what is needed but not enough is given to operational issues, such as which organisation will deliver what product or service, how, and with what measure of quality. he gave an example of social marketing of con- doms in laos. Ten years ago condoms, although available, were expensive and difficult to find. So- cial marketing made condoms widely available and also promoted demand among MSM and other vul- nerable groups. as the social marketing campaign continued, the private sector recognised there was a market for condoms, and has begun to fill that demand on their own. increasingly now, condoms that are both high quality and low cost are available. eventually, the social marketing project will reduce the burden on donors to fund condom distribution in laos, as the commercial sector will take much of the burden. he also emphasised to the need to pay more at- tention on grass roots project implementation of quality projects to serve the immediate needs of MSM.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb32f2ae-e006-4e57-a197-a4899832b303": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb32f2ae-e006-4e57-a197-a4899832b303", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) Populations in Asia and the Pacific - Regional Consensus Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e4cf2f583391c45ce401e1824616a77f6b1905f9e94bc06cc43455e4ea783c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "59371bba-174a-4cb2-98b0-cad8dae34e41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1afa76f0199ca9659cf0649767db52a63a0b70654e8c5afa776340d05dcdcbea"}}, "hash": "65463335f29b45d296574a2beb6c5b19c7c9a92cc49f6c24079f7497e8c9a4ff", "text": "he said that in Se asia we have an impressive level of high-level activities from civil society as well as governments and international organisa- tions, talking about the hiV/STi prevention, care, and support needs of MSM/Tgs.

The Minimum Package of Services (MPS) was discussed by Philippe Girault, Technical Advisor, Male Sexual Health, Family Health International (FHI) APRO. Mr. girault noted that the term MPS is now shifting to the term Comprehensive Pack- age. When discussing MPS it is also important to detail the different components, particularly the behaviour change component. in the work that Mr. girault presented, the minimum package of ser- vices included outreach activities i.e., peer outreach, educational sessions, community-based events, targeted media campaigns, access to condoms and lube, voluntary counselling and testing, and diagnosis and treatment for sexually transmitted infections. he noted that some of the implemented interventions of the MPS may contribute to changes sexual and health seeking behaviours but despite a significant increase from 2005 to 2007, access to MPS is still low. Mr girault suggested that more effort should focus on developing internet interventions and structural interventions in entertainment establishments, because this could provide a huge opportunity to reach more MSM, particularly \u201chard-to-reach\u201d MSM. Specific attention should be paid to the ac- cess to VCT and STi services for MSM. There is a need to identify relevant strategies to strengthen and scale-up MSM-friendly services to reach different MSM population networks/segments. in addition, community-driven targeted social marketing cam- paigns should be developed in a more systematic way. all these interventions should be preserved or included in the behaviour change component of the MPS. Evaluating Community-based Response to HIV prevention for MSM: the amfAR/MSM initiative experience, presented by Dr Annette Sohn, Di- rector, TREAT Asia/amfAR. Dr. Sohn spoke about the goal of improved health and well-being for gay men, other MSM and Tg. She noted that universal access to hiV services like prevention, treatment and care are key to help bring about a decline in the number of MSM acquiring hiV. She also pointed out that an important benefit of a comprehensive package of services would be to reduce the burden of STis on individuals, leading to better health and quality of life for MSM with hiV. She shared results of reports from MSM initiative grantees and an audit conducted by aidS Projects Management group (aPMg) for amfaR\u2019s MSM initiative to identify op- erational research priorities for MSM hiV services in the asia and the Pacific.

Day Two: Tuesday, June 30 Session Two: Strengthening health Sector Responses - Treatment, Care and Support Dr. Massimo Ghidinelli, Regional Adviser, HIV/ AIDS and STI, World Health Organization \u2013 West- ern Pacific Region (WHO/WPRO) defined health sector responses. a health system includes all the activities whose primary purpose is to promote, restore or maintain health. health Services are servic- es for the diagnosis and treatment of disease and the maintenance of health. They are a key component of the health sector but only one aspect of it. World health Report, 2000 definitions: The health sector is wide-rang- ing and encompasses organised public and private health services, including those for health promotion, disease prevention, diag- nosis, treatment and care; health ministry\u2019s; nongovernmental organisations; community groups; professional organisations; as well as institutions which directly input into the health-care system (e. g. the pharmaceutical industry,, teaching institutions). global health Sector Strategy for hiV/aidS, World health assembly, 2003 the health sector\u2019s contribution to achieving universal Access is visualised in the below framework: expanding testing and counselling Strategic information Strengthening health systems Maximising prevention accelerating treatment scale up 26 04 SuMMaRy oF Regional ConSenSuS MeeTing Strategic information includes components like sur- veillance data and trends, monitoring the health sector\u2019s response and developing estimates and projections. assessing service delivery in different countries has exposed a wide gap between a high demand and a limited availability of qualified ser- vices. This calls for institutional and capacity de- velopment approaches and interventions. Who has guidance documents available that elaborate along the five strategic directions including tools, guidance and case studies. Who is intending to produce a document setting out the health sector\u2019s priority interventions for MSM and Tg in asia and the Pacific, in line with global tools and publications, but highly contex- tualised to the specific features of the region. dr ghidinelli emphasised Who\u2019s focus on a compre- hensive approach and highlighted the need to combine prevention technologies to maximise ef- fectiveness and impact. guiding principles for the health sector were listed as: Rights-based norms and standards for the in- \ufffd tegration of MSM and Tg issues into national aidS responses evidence-informed and non-discriminatory in- \ufffd terventions Comprehensive approach linking prevention to \ufffd treatment, care and support Combination of prevention interventions to \ufffd maximise effectiveness inclusiveness: broad partnerships and involve- \ufffd ment of communities linking to interventions in other sectors \ufffd Who\u2019s priority includes measures to support main- streaming of MSM and Tg interventions in the health sector to assure community involvement and the establishment of networks and outreach activities. Centres of excellence should be devel- oped and identified and lessons learned should be better captured, documented and disseminated. Sensitive clinical guidelines and operational frame- works and capacity building among health person- nel need to be expanded and should include skills in history taking, physical examination, the ability to identify specific STis, PiTC (Provider-initiated Testing Counselling) and counselling. MSM and Tg issues should be included in training curricula of medical and nursing schools and the attitudes of health workers need to be addressed to reduce stigma and discrimination.

Zhao Pengfei highlighted the challenges of scaling- up hiV testing and counselling. he addressed the need for laboratory testing quality assurance and discussed the challenges if testing Qa in community settings. Finally, he announced that a uniCeF/Who Package of counselling, covering the full spectrum of hiV counselling and testing, is to be launched at the 9th iCaaP in Bali. 27 regional consensus meeting Definitions: VCT involves individuals actively seeking hiV testing and counselling, usually emphasises individual risk assessment and management by counsellors, addressing issues such as the desirability and implications of taking an hiV test and the development of individual risk reduction strategies. PiTC refers to hiV testing and counselling which is recommended by health care provid- ers to persons attending health care facilities as a part of a package of services. The major purpose of such testing and counselling is to enable specific clinical decisions to be made and/or specific medical services to be offered that would not be possible without knowledge of the person\u2019s hiV status. This testing is also voluntary. Source: Who Access to treatment and care among positive MSM in the region was presented by Addy Chen, Coordinator MSM Positive Working Group, Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV/ AIDS. Mr. Chen outlined aPn+\u2019s access to treatment re- search, issues relating to hiV+ MSM and Tg, key research findings and recommendations for further research. This research was designed to identify challenges faced by MSM and Tg with hiV, as well as hiV-pos- itive women and idu, while accessing hiV related treatment and care. The MSM-specific research cov- ered six asian countries (india, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, indonesia and nepal) and 897 partici- pants were involved. Methods included individual questionnaires and 17 focus group discussions in a peer-led research process. Research limitations involved the challenges around the recruitment, coverage areas and the fact that Tg issues were not clearly separated. The follow results were high- lighted in relation to hiV counselling and testing: 59.3% of the participants accessed hiV test in \ufffd government hospitals 13.1% reported having been tested for hiV \ufffd without their consent e.g. nepal (36.9%) vs. in- donesia (1.6%) 81.6% received post-test counselling among \ufffd these, 81% disclosed their sexuality to counsel- lor and among participants who disclosed their sexuality to counsellor, 41.6% reported that counsellors were neutral in terms of friendli- ness (friendly attitude) towards MSM. Related to access to aRT, Mr. Chen explained that in total, nearly half (46.4%) were in need of aRT. Barri- ers to access included lack of adequate knowledge about aRT, fear of side effects, denial of service by doctors and unfriendly hiV service providers. Bar- riers to accessing hiV-related services were sum- marised as: the high cost of services; legal issues, travel costs and inconvenience (average travel time: 2.78 hrs); lack of adequate information about ser- vices; and, stigma and discrimination. Participants reported that healthcare workers (hCWs) disclosed the participants\u2019 hiV status (12.4%) and sexuality (14.5%) to others without consent. There was a fear of discrimination by hCWs if participants were per- ceived to be effeminate or hiV positive, preventing people from accessing services. Some participants reported denial of services (21.1%) and physical assault (9.6%) by hCWs; most alarming, in nepal, participants reported denial of services (30.8%) and physical assault (37.7%) by hCWs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4138ddea-5d28-4782-84ac-cb67da9357dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "4138ddea-5d28-4782-84ac-cb67da9357dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) Populations in Asia and the Pacific - Regional Consensus Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "abd7a55ad0c679e4506652ea3b6befe5c5fd0994512ecf40bc31ef22eb38216b"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f9da227-64a6-4515-8381-c60ff2f2126a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6bdeef8e4ae78c2388859c5f80cde7c17bcabc38072442f0c31db6f1909e6df8"}}, "hash": "999945588f567c6b7dbe72d17e5d4716ba04c63a9432a010f230de7455cc8572", "text": "Being transgen- der (53.7%) and being openly homosexual (44.4%) were seen as risk factors that exposed respondents to the risk of refusal of healthcare services. other issues reported upon in the research: employment and poverty (type of jobs, jobless- \ufffd ness and recruitment) disclosure.

Questions were raised on how develop a sensitive health sys- tem in a cost-effective manner and how to deal with issues of income and poverty.. Finally, participants expressed a need for increased engagement with governments to create awareness and to protect rights. Session Three: enabling environment Don Baxter, Co-Chair, Global Forum on MSM and HIV and Executive Director, Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations (AFAO) presented on the Key Components of an Enabling Environment. Mr. Baxter proposed a simple definition of an enabling environment: a social and legal environment that protects the rights of people living with hiV and aidS and encourages people whose behaviours place them at risk of infection to participate at all levels of the response to the epidemic. Source: aFao he noted that this goal requires enactment and implementation a disparate range of measures ex- tending well beyond the health system \u2013 in fact most lie chiefly outside the health system. he then identi- fied the key components required to enable effective MSM and Tg programming. These are: de-criminalisation of sex between men \ufffd anti-discrimination legislation protecting people \ufffd with hiV and specific anti-discrimination legisla- tion protecting MSM and Tg anti-stigma campaigns to challenge homopho- \ufffd bia and build confidence among MSM and Tg to participate fully in society, including engaging actively with the health system Community mobilisation among MSM and Tg, \ufffd allowing the formation and operation of inde- pendent MSM and Tg community organisations and the strengthening of their capacity, particu- larly in advocacy accessible, user-friendly and high-quality health \ufffd services sensitive to MSM and Tg advocacy and collaboration with commercial sex \ufffd venues\u2019 owners and managers advocacy and collaboration by MSM and Tg with \ufffd the range of government agencies which police the private and public sites where sex between men often, including police, park rangers and lo- cal public health officials an enabling legislative and social environment for MSM and Tg has key characteristics which: Promote the rights of the most affected popula- \ufffd tions to encourage and facilitate participation Remove punitive or coercive measures and prac- \ufffd tices that impede participation apply to all aspects of social life - not just the \ufffd health system Mr. Baxter noted that hiV anti-discrimination legisla- tion exists in 60 countries globally, that 52 have spe- cific legislation protecting MSM and Tgs. 19 countries in the asia Pacific region still have laws criminalis- ing male-to-male sex. it is essential these criminal laws are removed in order to allow MSM and Tg to participate effectively in society, including engaging with hiV prevention programmes. This will encourage MSM to protect their own health and the health of their partners. he then noted that a range of other laws can also hinder effective hiV programmes, citing three examples. These laws and regulations range from those that treat the possession of condoms as evidence of prostitution; censorship laws or regu- lations that prevent the use of explicit imagery in targeted hiV and sexual health campaigns; and, the inappropriate use of vagrancy laws when they are used to harass and intimidate MSM, Tgs and peer educators in outreach settings. he urged the decriminalisation of male-to-male sex, along with a systematic review by governments of any laws or regulations which hinder hiV prevention and support programmes. he noted this review and reform is not expensive \u2013 saying governments do not have to wait until the next global Fund grant to undertake it. These reforms are especially important at the local and provincial levels, under whose juris- diction most high risk sex happens and where most hiV programs operate. he emphasised the need to a range of anti-stigma measures including, creating space for the general community to talk honestly about sex \u2013 and the reali- ties of MSM sex lives \u2013 including sex with their female partners. national governments and naC\u2019s should lead this process of reversing stigma in a number of ways including: leading public discussion on these 29 regional consensus meeting sensitive issues; ensuring there is realistic sex edu- cation in schools; and instituting anti-homophobia campaigns for the general public.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1a093ea-4d5b-4f68-9f55-e4b183863780": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1a093ea-4d5b-4f68-9f55-e4b183863780", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) Populations in Asia and the Pacific - Regional Consensus Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b292fe35b374811bd1636642e00586876e5b4a908e96da3d48f271be3d7aabea"}, "2": {"node_id": "84b86baa-1914-416f-a9cb-422e73f770b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76d9866ee14aa3d91d660dd0a4cd764d05a8cf914710fd9ff5088bc0a74f648f"}}, "hash": "f10b05e992c141e24c6632b550ae88fea896967abdefd57296e63b5b199300f3", "text": "Prejudicial religious leaders need to be challenged and constructive ones fostered and encouraged. he noted the leadership provided by the governments in Mexico and Bra- zil, both implementing national campaigns against homophobia \u2013 and doing so in a fairly conservative religious", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf0dc751-45b3-477b-8cf3-b5347ebcd0c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf0dc751-45b3-477b-8cf3-b5347ebcd0c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) Populations in Asia and the Pacific - Regional Consensus Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67156b1910de59b92f2e9cad3f38fcda27e765713e03462979efd4a6e0114f7a"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b4f126d-cf27-43cb-ae30-8cb5ed6f5d89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cc4d02b170cd85040c04358337ebacb7cfa7ad51ee6c15bc07bd44eac016b51"}}, "hash": "13a9c95b62630bd9cf28470c6765f41de6700110d82e2bb8d7e57c87b1258c63", "text": "environment. Finally, Mr. Baxter explained that an enabling envi- ronment is not a \u2018service\u2019; rather it is a part of a com- prehensive and multi-faceted comprehensive pro- gramme. another significant component is fostering community mobilisation as core to successful MSM and Tg programmes as it is the critical key to chang- ing norms and values \u2013 and therefore behaviour \u2013 on a substantial scale. effective CBo\u2019s are essential \u2013 and governments should be able to respect the independence and ad- vocacy of the CBo\u2019s and to ensure the organisations are able to operate legally; legislative or regulatory change may be needed to ensure this environment. Further, short-term investment should be avoided in favour of long-term support and governments should foster national networks to ensure the views and voice of MSM and Tg can be conveyed more ef- fectively to decision-makers. it is through the protection, promotion and respect of human rights that the prevention and control of hiV and aidS can take place both by recognising and seeking to address the factors that lead towards hiV transmission and by protecting the human rights of those infected and affected by hiV and aidS. Capacity Mapping for Community-Based Orga- nizations was presented by David J. Dobrowolski, Country Representative, GMR Regional Coordi- nator, Pact Thailand. he outlined capacity map- ping for CBos in the MSM Response: \u201cActivating the Community Response for Results\u201d. he defined the science and art of oCB for CBo, discussed about organizational capacity building (oCB) for commu- nity-based organizations, illustrated ways to map CBo capacities to deliver the comprehensive package and highlighted some issues and common \u201ctraps\u201d. he described the large gap in implementation ca- pacity among CBos targeting MSM and mentioned that the overall goal of interventions should focus on community-led response and community-owned response. Therefore he said we need: Strong CBo partnership with essential govern- \ufffd ment health services high performing service delivery organizations \ufffd rooted in the community SOURCE aFao enabling environment and supportive Interventions Structural interventions organisational development Policy & legal Framework Capacity Building advocacy Community Mobilisation Strategic information Stigma and discrimination Programs Relationships with gatekeepers 30 04 SuMMaRy oF Regional ConSenSuS MeeTing Focused advocacy networks to improve the en- \ufffd abling environment another gap, he mentioned, lies in MSM program- ming on the ground due to the lack of absorptive capacity in the community-based hiV program or- ganizations and local implementing agencies that are needed to scale up services at a high level of quality. an example from Thailand was illustrated. This pro- gram focused strategically focused on CBos imple- menting MSM services and is uSg funded since 2005 with gFaTM Round 8 starting up in 2009. The partner organizations can be mapped out to clarify the programming choices and variables in oCB im- provement for CBos. a format sheet was shown with examples to map out the organization\u2019 status, tech- nical/ organizational capacity balance, absorptive capacity on a 1-4 scale, identify elements of quality at the service delivery point, track number of service delivery points in each province, district or locality serving MSM, Tg, MSW, hard-to-reach MSM (such as clients), for each service in the comprehensive package and identify prioritized technical and orga- nizational capacity areas. additional information was shared on the processes of participatory assessment, systems development and skills transfer needed to move cohorts of CBos along a continuum toward increased capacity. Mr. dobrowolski recommended that more innovative responses are required and emphasized that quality services for MSM at scale require functional service delivery points, but also enhanced leadership and management from the community members.

The programme called for starting up and up scaling interventions in the MSM/ Tg sector as a priority. in the new estimates for the hiV+ population, MSM and Tg carried the heaviest burden of hiV infection. Mr. Row kavi reported that the first baseline study re- vealed high levels of sex between MSM and women, highlighting MSM as a key bridge population for hiV prevention efforts. Coming from a gay activist background, many prac- titioners in the MSM community based organisations (CBos) of such groups, did not realise that working with communities would also require looking at the sexual and reproductive dynamics within the indian society. in 2000, hST\u2019s pilot project was transformed into a targeted intervention program, focussing on in- creasing consistent condom use in anal sex between men, increasing awareness around hiV transmission, reduction of partners and prompt STi treatment. hST succeeded in all these efforts over six years. The hiV infection among MSM today has been halved from 13.8% to a plateau of 7% in Mumbai as of last year. it can be said that hiV awareness is now very high, consistent condom use has increased and partner reduction was also successful. Mr. Row kavi stressed that MSM also have multi- partner sex including with women. These men, more often than not, are not reached by traditional government and community interventions and have been overlooked in india\u2019s national aidS Control Pro- gramme. he said that it is now well understood that controlling the hiV epidemic needs more attention to the MSM and Tg sectors as large subpopulations of these groups are also having sex with women. Plenary questions and discussion were held around the importance of anti discrimination laws, the role and actions to be undertaken for legislators and the need to focus on implementation of the rule of law. it was felt that the importance of designing a good le- gal framework was not well understood. Participants felt a need to focus more on rights-based approaches. a discussion was held around how to best create awareness and knowledge in countries where CBos are not allowed, not legalised and/or do not exist. at least, a minimum enabling environment should exist. in countries where there is a social impasse and no social welfare system, like in Pakistan and Bangla- desh, it is very difficult to operate. Better approaches for these countries should be developed. also ap- proaches on how to work around religious influences like Muslim and Catholicism need to be designed. While operationalising strategies it is important to include the community in decision-making, to design good processes, and also leadership roles need to be assigned to the community. 31 regional consensus meeting Day Three: Wednesday, July 1 Session Four: Strategic information Strategic Information and improving responses to MSM and HIV was presented by Geoff Manthey, Regional Programme Advisor, UNAIDS Regional Support Team, Asia and the Pacific. in compliance with the declaration of Commitment on hiV/aidS signed by un member states in June 2001, countries submit progress reports to unaidS. The reports, submitted every two years, reflect the progress made by countries in their response to the aidS epidemic. Mr. Manthey discussed the ungaSS reports from the region and questioned whether ungaSS indicators can be adapted to MSM stra- tegic interventions. he noted that 25 reports were submitted out of 38 countries in the region (report- ing rate 66%), compared with 19 reports in total in 2005 (reporting rate 54%). in presenting the highlights of the report by output, outcomes and impacts indicators from the region he showed that increased reporting takes place on the different formulated indicators. he explained that through a multi-agency effort (uSaid, CdC, unaidS, Who, uniCeF, Fhi, MeaSuRe evaluation) in 2007 a Framework for M&e of hiV Prevention Programmes for MaRPs was developed. The rationale was that existing unaidS M&e guide- lines were mainly adapted to generalised epidemics and that there was a need to compile existing work from different sources. also, there is a need to move from project level to systematic M&e at each level and phase within the framework of national M&e systems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20a87eb3-34c2-4371-af4a-54cfc76039c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "20a87eb3-34c2-4371-af4a-54cfc76039c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) Populations in Asia and the Pacific - Regional Consensus Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5d3e666a7edc84c0e940096405043c8b753e682732d146b7b7df3e9f774f30d"}, "2": {"node_id": "16f4b2f6-ed3f-4125-aad9-13bdb137724a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "588151a54fb11d925d354f75384d33fa3f44cbdd1d7a1f6991aba877ec0bd73d"}}, "hash": "2939242b759cd9f27951cbc12b9aae67e147186e3d592343315a761a686ee3bb", "text": "he closed by saying that the hiV epidemic in asia is mainly concentrated in groups with higher risk behaviour (SW, idu, MSM).

Developing MSM HIV Indicators and Evaluation Processes, Ruth Bessinger, PhD Consultant MEA- SURE Evaluation. Ms. Bessinger explained that prior M&e guidance, particularly for prevention, was largely developed with generalised epidemics in mind; little focus was paid to settings where hiV is concentrated among high risk populations. Meth- ods and approaches are developed and used for M&e of most-at-risk populations. The MaRP guide mentioned earlier was an attempt to systematically compile this information and provide a framework for M&e of MaRP programmes. She highlighted the importance of sub national and project-level M&e as part of a national M&e system and addressed some of the key challenges with collecting infor- mation about MaRP populations (do no harm ap- proach working with highly stigmatised popula- tions, ethical considerations such as confidentiality and respect for privacy). The framework presented in the MaRP guide provides the strategic informa- tion needed and answers questions related to iden- tifying the magnitude of the (different problems) problem and the identification. information comes from surveillance, determinants research, and pop- ulation size estimates. Population size estimates are difficult to come by and approaches used may include census and enumeration (sub-national), population survey methods, multiplier methods, capture-recapture (and multiple capture) meth- ods and compartmental methods. information is then needed to understand what interventions will work; this comes from formative research, needs assessment, costing and resources analysis. as the focus of this meeting is on a package of services for MSM, the presentation focuses on issues related to monitoring and evaluating the implementation of such a package. illustrated with examples from Fhi Bangkok, she presented a draft list of harmonised project level indicators for MSM projects, 2009. She explained that indicators allow for the routine track- ing of priority information about a programme and its intended outcomes. it helps to measures change over time in any of the programme components inputs, processes, outputs, outcomes, impacts and it aims to improve programmes by identifying those aspects that are working according to plan, and those in need of mid-course correction.

She asked the participants to think about two questions \ufffd is there a minimum package of interventions or services that everyone in the target popula- tion should receive? \ufffd is there a minimum intensity of services that everyone in the target population should re- ceive? She stressed that a coordinated effort to define these basic measures will make overall measure- ment easier. Finally, she highlighted some ap- proaches to programme evaluation: look at trends in STi and hiV in the target popu- \ufffd lation Triangulate trend data from programme moni- \ufffd toring systems with data on risk behaviours and hiV STi status look at associations between service use and \ufffd hiV related behaviours in a cross-sectional survey She used illustrations from MSM programme bene- ficiaries in three countries that showed the associa- tion between intensity of service use and consistent use of condoms with a paying partner. She closed her session by noting that there are evaluation gaps, in part because of the difficulties in determining the relationship between level of programme coverage or quality of a programme, and the impact that that programme has on behaviour and health status. There is a lack of rigorous evaluations of hiV preven- tion programmes targeting MSM populations and there needs to be a more coordinated response to evaluation. Plenary questions and discussions were framed around the different uses and understandings of terminology. Participants expressed a need for clarification on terms. They also mentioned the lack and inappropriate use of terminology like the term \u2018intensity\u2019 and the conceptual difference between coverage and reach. unpacking and (re)defining terminology that distinguished between reach and intensity was mentioned in particular. Participants expressed that classification and harmonisation of different types of interventions need to be better assessed and identified, and these interventions should be more based on theories, research and best practices. 33 regional consensus meeting Participants questioned how much coverage was enough to justify interventions and to be effec- tive and efficient in programming. The amount of coverage required varies from setting to setting and country to country. More modelling work at country level needs to be done. Because of the lack of strong evidence related to areas of prevention, MaRPS and behaviour change to guide practitio- ners, resources should be allocated to building up the evidence basis and disseminating knowledge and best practices. a dialogue on how to better correlate interventions and indicators to outcomes, and how self reporting could support countries and organisations to link with the response among other MaRPSs and indica- tors was held. Measuring the level of exposure that led to a particular behaviour change and reduction in transmission rate was given as an example. it was also suggested that broader health outcomes need- ed to be measured, such as outcomes about care and treatment. Therefore a broader understand- ing about the health sector and engagement with different stakeholders is required. a suggestion to identify broader nominators to include themes like violence and broader social sector issues was made. Participants were invited to think in the group work about how to measure coverage and intensity. a discussion took place around the MSM and Tg content in global Fund Round 8 and Round 9 pro- posals in asia and the Pacific and about how to increase the presence of MSM and Tg work in gF programmes. a question was raised about what is meant by coordinated response to evaluation. it was suggested that the comprehensive pack- age should be accompanied by an allocation of resources and a consensus among partners about who supports which components. Finally, a discussion took place around size estima- tion issues. good data is important for strategic prioritisation but because many MSM are hidden, health officials think there are not many MSM to target and allocate a budget for. Planning inter- ventions and programmes is difficult, and better methodologies are needed to link communities and the health sector to improve estimation. un- aidS announced a meeting to be held in august 2009 on size estimation in asia with other partner organisations and country teams.

Closing Remarks and Next Steps Shivananda Khan, Chairperson, APCOM thanked all the organising partners and representatives of the different countries. he reminded participants that roughly three times the number of people in the workshop, around 199 people, become hiV- infected each day in asia and the Pacific. he argued for a broader definition of health for MSM and Tg, beyond \u2018not hiV infected\u2019.. he requested undP and Who to better define what is understood by health. he stressed that it is important to have a broader sense of health, and to include wellbeing elements and emotional health as well. Wellbeing should be the focus in all programming. he high- lighted that the Pacific region often feels ignored and explained that it is important to include them in discussions especially because they have very unique features. Mr. khan outlined that developed countries like Sin- gapore, South korea and Japan are not yet included in discussions and that responses and investments to address hiV and MSM, Tg challenges in these countries are often very poor. he asked partner or- ganisations to look at this. Finally, he talked about community engagement and said that the current movement is developing in new areas, new part- nerships and includes multi sector responses. he stressed that the beneficiaries must not forget their own responsibility and said that he looked forward to increased coordination and partnership to imple- ment the package. Edmund Settle, HIV Policy Specialist, UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre highlighted two impor- tant recent developments in the response to hiV among MSM and Tg: firstly, the increased joint collaboration among un agencies; and secondly, the increase fostering of equal and direct relation- ships with community partners. he emphasised the importance and commitment of undP to con- tinue this process and assured participants that the global framework would be regionalised. he thanked aPCoM highlighting the increase in its work with government sector partners and donors on a variety of issues like increasing advocacy, cov- erage and investment. Mr. Settle illustrated this with 34 04 SuMMaRy oF Regional ConSenSuS MeeTing examples from the China and Philippines where national strategies and work plans are developed and resources allocated. Finally, he expressed his gratitude to aSean and the national governments that have also approached un to respond to the epidemic. he applauded aSean\u2019s commitment and he reaffirmed undP\u2019s wish for closer and sustained partnership on this important regional issue. Dr. Massimo Ghidinelli, Regional Adviser, WHO/ WPRO explained that Who, as a newcomer to the partnership, highly appreciates the harmonised environment and the encouraging way partner organisations are moving forward. he highlighted the importance to deliver the package in partner- ship and to use the resource tool to jointly respond to hiV among MSM and Tg. dr. ghidinelli reaffirmed Who\u2019s commitment to the partnership and said that Who will actively engage and continue to work in close collaboration. he referred to the partnership with aPCoM aimed at establishing a sub-committee on health sector responses. Finally, he remarked that the process of implementation should not be forgotten, through the country of- fices and partner networks. 35 regional consensus meeting key technIcAl AssIstAnce And orgAnIsAtIonAl support needed For eFFectIve ImplementAtIon oF nAtIonAl And locAl responses 05 Below is a summary of the key technical assistance and organisational support needs identified by par- ticipants for effective implementation of national and local responses.

Research should focus more on contextual country mapping (incl. legislative, policy, cultural, religious and social barriers) and the mapping of actions that governments need to take in order to provide an enabling environment. other approaches related to the conduct of needs assessments (eg for prevention programmes) and the need to develop a quality measurement system for services. new approaches should increase MSM and Tg participation and decision making in the development, imple- mentation and monitoring of programmes.

Policies should be more culturally sensitive (e.g. push for policies and laws that reflect cultural or religious values/social order) and should address the issues of marginalised groups to protect the rights of people and encourage diversity. Policy implementation needs to be monitored. Management and leadership development at all levels (among a wide range of stakeholders) should be in place. Currently, capacity development is very service-oriented (like peer outreach, condom distribution 50 06 annexeS only) but more general organisational development and institutional strengthening is required. Specific capacity development plans and investments should to be developed. The key knowledge gap was identified as the lack of best practice and sharing of experiences of what works on community mobilisation, how to engage communities to contribute to the reduction in hiV prevalence and how to build strong institutions. also the lack of availability of resources in local languages and simplified language was felt as a barrier. a particular challenge relates to the lack of MSM/Tg skills and knowledge of human rights approaches. it was suggested that a regional review on policy implementation of human rights should take place. also, the lack of experiences and skills to design successful approaches for advocacy, especially in countries where many religious leaders are likely to oppose MSM and Tg hiV prevention strategies, is an issue. This is equally important for Muslim and Christian faith religious leaders. gRouP WoRk SeSSion 4 Strategic information to identify interventions and supportive activities, knowledge gaps and technical assistance needs understand coverage of MSM services (for planning and targeting) and to better understanding bud- geting needs and requirements were identified as priorities. The group highlighted that more (recent) international discussion focuses on universal access. Therefore a size estimation of MSM and Tg popula- tions is crucial to be able to advocate where universal access programmes can support interventions. Size estimation that is country specific and contextualised should provide better baseline information (incl. risk behaviours, mapping of cruising areas). Programmes should be culturally-sensitive and in certain countries, MSM and Tg issues should be integrated into the national aidS Plan and/or hiV/aidS opera- tional plan. MSM and Tg should also be considered in all cross-cutting sectors, including surveillance, social and behavioural research, M & e. estimates are also required for other MaRPs (idu, FSW). Stakeholders should have consensus about cat- egories, data collection, approaches for estimating population size and define universal denominators (incl. defining the difference between denominator ranges of MSM in a country and denominators for most-at-risk MSM within that range). governments cannot always provide guidance. There is a lack of tools, methods and an international standard methodology. There is a need for locally applicable methods for population size estimation that is acceptable to government). implementers need persuasive methods to influence and negotiate with policy decision-makers (an example was given related to the lack of data collection methodologies to identify the highest-risk MSM using internet). group consensus was reached around two issues that need to be separated: Firstly, the range of all MSM should be defined as any male engaging in sex with another male \ufffd Secondly, within this larger number, the range of highest risk MSM should receive the focus of hiV \ufffd targeted interventions and resources. a suggestion was given that this second denominator should focuses on local \u201chotspot\u201d for MSM behaviour (could be a city, a district or country) Finally, a demand was expressed to increase in country skills and knowledge to conduct research and collect data complementary with \u201cexternal / outside\u201d technical assistance (demographers with under- standing of MaRPs/MSM).

Key references 4 Linkages between violence against women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific \u201d Foreword Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive manifestations of gender inequality and is an indicator of the status of women in a society. Violence against women is both a cause and a consequence of HIV infection. Therefore, violence needs to be dealt with as an integral part of multisectoral HIV responses. UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki Moon There is limited research conducted in the Asia-Pacific region exploring the linkages between HIV and violence against women (VAW). While research conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and in hyper-epidemic settings have established that violence against women drives and fuels the HIV epidemic, there has been little analysis done in countries with concentrated epidemics such as those in the Asia-Pacific region, and therefore little is known about how they overlap. Perhaps as a result, policy and programmatic responses on VAW and HIV are not always coordinated and often run in parallel. This Discussion Paper was commission by UNDP and UNAIDS on behalf of the Asia-Pacific Inter-agency Task Team on Women, Girls, Gender Equality, and HIV (IATT), to review and analyse existing qualitative and quantitative research on the relationship between violence against women and girls and HIV in the region. The paper clearly demonstrates that violence is a risk factor for HIV, with women living with HIV more likely to report a history of violence. It also shows that HIV is a risk factor for violence, including from intimate partners. It also demonstrates that key HIV-affected groups of women and girls, particularly sex-workers and female drug users, face disproportionate violence. These findings will provide the basis for an IATT position on VAW and HIV, which we are confident will help to sharpen policy and programmatic actions to address the inter-linkages. Further, in order to achieve UNAIDS\u2019 vision of \u201cZero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS-related deaths.\u201d it is imperative that the recommendations of this paper on addressing the overlaps between VAW and HIV in the Asia Pacific region are implemented, starting with translating political commitments into scaled-up action to address the rights and needs of key HIV-affected women and girls.

At an exploratory meeting, the Asia-Pacific Interagency Task Team on Women, Girls, Gender Equality and HIV5 (IATT\u2013women and girls) noted that limited evidence from the region continues to undermine efforts to address the twin epidemics of HIV and violence against women through effective, evidence-based, programmatic interventions. For these reasons, a discussion paper on violence against women and HIV linkages that considers and draws upon available data and research from the region would mark a starting point for national and regional partners to engage more closely in addressing this issue. Methodology This paper primarily reviews English-language peer-reviewed articles and grey literature on the inter-linkages between HIV and violence against women in Asia and the Pacific. The search item combinations included gender-based violence, violence against women and HIV; sex workers; women who use drugs; women living with HIV; young and adolescent women; migrant women; and lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women. Although, some global literature was reviewed and referenced (especially evaluated programmes to address the linkages), following the mandate of the review, articles and literature from Asia and the Pacific were given priority. The conceptualization and development process included feedback mechanisms at various stages. Feedback was sought through: \u2022\ufffd E-discussion on www.hivapcop.org to validate the scope of the review and seek input on regional and national research studies and experts for interviews; 1 UNESCAP, 2008, UN Secretary-General\u2019s Asia Pacific Unite to End Violence against Women. 2 Ibid. 3 At www.un.org/ga/aids/coverage/FinalDeclarationHIVAIDS.html. 4 UNAIDS (2010), \u201cAgenda for Accelerated Country Action for Women, Girls, Gender Equality and HIV Operational Plan for UNAIDS Action Framework: Addressing women, girls, gender equality and HIV.\u201d 5 Key HIV-affected women and girls include: i) women and girls living with HIV; ii) female sex workers; iii) female spouses of male clients of sex workers; iv) women who use drugs; v) female spouses of men who inject drugs; vi) female spouses of men who have sex with men; and vii) women and girls from households affected by HIV/AIDS.

Across Asia, the HIV epidemic is predominately concentrated among sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs.8 In many countries, the proportion of women among persons living with HIV is increasing as the epidemic matures and HIV spreads to the intimate female partners of men who inject drugs, as well as to the clients of sex workers and their other sexual partners.9 Epidemiological data shows that in a number of countries the majority of women who cite sexual transmission of HIV as the source of infection report that they contracted the virus from their spouse or long-term partner.10 Violence against women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific: The evidence base \u2022\ufffd Violence as a risk factor for HIV: Studies from the region indicate that women living with HIV are more likely to report a history of intimate partner violence than women who are not.11 \u2022\ufffd HIV as a risk factor for violence against women living with HIV: Studies show that (1) actual or the threat of violence is a barrier to HIV disclosure, access", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5b19c08-196c-478b-8052-41a8245dfce5": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5b19c08-196c-478b-8052-41a8245dfce5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Discussion paper: Linkages between violence against women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fc74f8fed9650293be7608fbeb174428cad6e603f7a781304bcc0dedbb4de3b"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc3adb49-d292-4f8f-a980-587cf3fa501d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f6ef577abaaef3d220c31521c336ad1ca99382e5562afdc588ed775c02caa9a"}}, "hash": "d3ba3058cc2a07ee1dddb87b5334f5019f7d2e81e2585a21a6059ee3f4d8fc67", "text": "to services, and adherence to treatment; and (2) women living with HIV experience violence after disclosure of their HIV status.

According to the World Health Organization\u2019s multi-country study on women\u2019s health and violence against women, 13\u201361 percent of ever partnered women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a partner in their lifetime.21 Young women are at particular risk for violence, with as many as 30 percent of women in some locations reporting that their first sexual experience was coerced or forced,22 and the younger the women were at the time of sexual initiation, the higher the chance that it was violent.23 Also, the majority of sexually active girls aged 15\u201319 in developing countries are married, and these married adolescent girls tend to have higher rates of HIV infection than their sexually active, unmarried peers.24 Actual and the threat of violence not only cause physical and psychological harm to women and girls, it also limits their access to and participation in society. Even the threat of violence alone circumscribes women\u2019s freedom of movement and of expression as well as their rights to privacy, security, and health. Compounding factors The twin epidemics of HIV and violence against women are exacerbated by inadequate services; persistent denial of sexual and reproductive health and rights; laws that are weak or discriminatory towards women and people living with HIV;25 limited access to justice for women and girls; community standards that validate gender inequality and the subordination of women; women\u2019s unpaid care burden, including HIV care burden; and multiple discriminations faced by women and girls because of their class, caste, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors. Moreover, uptake of VCT services, disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners, and breach of confidentiality and partner notification by HIV service providers all have the potential of increasing women\u2019s risk of violence.26 18 WHO (1998), \u201cGender and Health: Technical Paper.\u201d 19 Yakin Ert\u00fcrk (2005), \u201cIntegration of the human rights of women and the gender perspective: The intersections of violence against women and HIV/AIDS,\u201d Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences. 20 WHO (2006), \u201cSexual and reproductive health of women living with HIV/AIDS: Guidelines on care, treatment and support for women living with HIV/AIDS and their children in resource-constrained settings.\u201d 21 Claudia Garcia-Moreno, Lori Heise, Henrica, A.

The UN Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health noted that \u201ccriminalization of same sex practices, drug use, sex work and HIV transmission are counterproductive to the prevention of HIV transmission.\u201d30 As examined below, for women in Asia and the Pacific, whether they are living with HIV, are in sex work, or use drugs, criminalisation not only increases their risk for HIV but also increases the likelihood that they will experience some form of violence. International human rights framework A number of international human rights standards that are agreed by governments are directly relevant to women in the context of HIV and violence against women.31 Among these: Vienna Declaration and Programme for Action (1993) recognises the importance of women\u2019s right to enjoy the highest standard of physical and mental health throughout their lifespan. Article 41 reaffirms a woman\u2019s right to accessible and adequate health care and the widest range of family planning services.32 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, 1993), articles 2, 5, 11, 12, and 16, require state parties to take action to protect women from violence of any kind occurring in the family, at the work place, or any other area of life. The CEDAW committee in General Recommendation 19 (1992) noted that gender-based violence impairs or nullifies women\u2019s enjoyment of human rights and is a form of discrimination; and in General Recommendation 24 (1999) noted that in unequal power relations based on gender, women and adolescent girls are often unable to refuse sex or insist on safe and responsible sex practices.33 27 Global Commission on HIV and the Law. Also, in July 2012 the High Court in Namibia ruled in favour of three women living with HIV who had been forcefully sterilised by the government. The campaign was spearheaded by the Namibia Women\u2019s Health Network, formed and led by women living with HIV.

Women experience violence or the threat of violence throughout their life cycles, including during pregnancy.40 Manifestation of and means to maintain women\u2019s subordination According to the UN Secretary-General\u2019s 2006 report, violence against women maintains, \u201ccontrol over women\u2019s sexuality and reproductive capacity\u2019.\u201d41It is also a means to circumscribe women \u2013 and men \u2013 to their socially defined gender roles. For instance, gender non-conforming heterosexual men, gay men, or transgender people can also become targets of violence, as they are seen to be transgressing normative masculinity. The same system of gender-based discrimination and violence that targets women also impinges on men who have sex with men and transgender people. Female sex workers are also at heightened risk for violence because they are seen to transgress normative femininity, whereby control over their sexuality and reproductive capacity or indeed their productive and reproductive labour is not assigned to a single man.

Normative masculinity and femininity The idea of \u201cnormal or compulsory heterosexuality\u201d \u2013 or heteronormativity \u2013refers to the explicit or implicit practices and institutions that legitimise and privilege heterosexuality and heterosexual relationships as fundamental and \u2018natural\u2019 within society and, moreover, posit that women should be feminine (meaning subservient) and men should be masculine (meaning dominant). See, for example, Sangeeta Budhiraja, Susan T. Fried, and Alexandra Teixeira, \u201cSpelling it out: From alphabet soup to sexual rights and gender justice,\u201d in Suzanne Bergeron and Amy Lind, eds., Queering Development; and Cathy J.

The UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, notes in her 2011 report that \u201cthe different ways in which women may experience violence, particularly intimate and interpersonal violence, depends on how they are positioned within social, economic and cultural hierarchies that prohibit or further compromise certain women\u2019s ability to enjoy universal human rights. These institutions and structures often promote access for a privileged group of women at the expense of those who are less privileged.\u201d45 Women who face multiple and intersecting discriminations on the basis of their class, caste, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors are at heightened risk for violence. In the context of HIV, this includes women who face multiple discriminations, often sanctioned by the state, on the basis of their work (sex workers), addiction (women who inject drugs), and HIV status (women living with HIV). Gender inequality fuels HIV Women have substantially different needs and face both different HIV risks and different risks of violence than do men.

This includes a concerted effort to address factors such as male control over women\u2019s agency and sexuality; religious and cultural influences that perpetuate gender inequalities; and a lack of justice, accountability, and resources to implement existing policies as well as the resulting sense of impunity. It also requires that all stakeholders in the national AIDS response monitor the human rights impacts of their HIV-related activities and remedy any adverse human rights outcomes, especially among groups that have a heightened risk for violence and HIV. In the context of the Asia-Pacific region, this includes key affected women and girls. Risk of violence and other negative outcomes can be compounded for women sex workers and women who use drugs, especially in settings where their work or addiction is criminalized.

In many countries the proportion of women among persons living with HIV is increasing as the epidemic matures and HIV spreads to the intimate female partners of men who inject drugs, as well as of clients of sex workers and their other sexual partners.60 Epidemiological data shows that in a number of countries the majority of women who cite sexual transmission of HIV as the source of infection report that they contracted the virus from their spouse or long-term partner. For example, 90 percent of women in India report that they were infected within long-term relationships.61 In India, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand, married women account for a significant proportion of new HIV infections.

The Commission of AIDS in Asia (2008) report estimates that 75 million men regularly buy sex; 16 million men have sex with other men (MSM); and 4 million inject drugs.63 It is also known that many these men (see, for example, Figure 3) are married or have regular sexual partners.64 The Commission on AIDS in Asia report estimates that between 10 and 60 percent of men who have sex with men and between 25 and 60 percent of men who inject drugs are married or have regular female sexual partners. In some contexts, men who have sex with men are married to women or maintain heterosexual relationships because they do not necessarily identify themselves as gay or to escape homophobia \u2013 especially where same sex relationships and/or behaviours are criminalized.65 Predicated on these estimates, the report found that around 50 million women are at risk for HIV from their intimate partners.66 Also, low condom usage can increase the risk of HIV for women who are sexual partners of men who buy sex, use drugs, or have sex with men. As shown in Figure 4 below, condom usage among key populations in the region is uneven: reported condom usage at last sex can range from as high as 92 percent among female sex workers in Thailand to 53 percent in PNG. Reported condom usage among men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs remains low in most countries across the region (Figure 4).

And the 2008 report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia notes that the trend of increasing HIV transmission from men with high- risk behaviours to their intimate female partners continues in many countries in the region. Violence against women has implications for sex workers, women who use drugs, and women who are married to or are in intimate partner relationships with men who buy sex, inject drugs, and/or have sex with men. These trends, historical and emerging, warrant greater investment in sex disaggregated data collection, building new evidence and knowledge that identifies and assesses the gender-specific risks and vulnerabilities faced by women and girls in the Asia Pacific region. 25 Violence against women and HIV: The evidence base Violence against women and HIV: The evidence base Mapping the research A recent global review of literature examining the inter-linkages between violence against women and HIV68 found that close to half of the studies were based in the United States and a third in Africa. Fewer than 10 percent of the studies were conducted in Asia and the Pacific. However, India is an outlier, accounting for the third highest number of studies after the United States and South Africa. Most of the studies from Asia and the Pacific have been conducted with married women or women sex workers as the primary focus. In India, the majority of studies conducted focused on married women survivors of violence and their vulnerability to HIV transmission from their husbands. Globally, there is an evidence base to establish, conceptually and empirically, linkages between violence against women and HIV and the potential casual pathways, including: \u2022\ufffd Unprotected coerced sex, increasing women\u2019s risk for HIV; \u2022\ufffd Violence or the threat of violence restricting their ability to negotiate safe sex; \u2022\ufffd Child sexual abuse increasing likelihood of sexual risk-taking, thereby increasing risk for HIV; \u2022\ufffd HIV as a risk factor for violence, i.e., women who are HIV-positive being at a greater risk for violence and the threat of or actual violence interfering with their ability to access or adhere to treatment; \u2022\ufffd Violence against women and HIV as mutual risk factors combining with other factors \u2013 such as alcohol or substance abuse, conflict, or emergencies \u2013 reinforcing the relationship between the two.69 Mapping the research in Asia and the Pacific Of the literature on the linkages between violence against women and HIV in the region, a little over 85 percent were empirical research studies published in peer-reviewed journals, 10 percent were reports written by non- governmental organizations (NGOs), and 5 percent were produced by UN agencies. Of these, 60 percent are on sex workers in which female sex workers as respondents account for 80 percent; 15 percent are on married women; and 10 percent are on women who use drugs. India accounts for 35 percent of the literature, which focus evenly on married women and female sex workers; China accounts for 15 percent of the literature, of which 70 percent are focused on female sex workers and the rest on women who use drugs; and the remaining are divided among such countries as Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and Fiji as well as some global-led reports with a special focus on developing countries. Over 90 percent of this literature is on female, male, and transgender sex workers, with 80 percent on female sex workers. Violence as a risk factor for HIV in Asia and the Pacific Studies from the region indicate that women living with HIV are more likely to report a history of intimate partner violence than women who are not.70 For instance, a 2008 study in rural and urban India found that 68 Program on International Health and Human Rights, Gender Based Violence and HIV. The review included peer-reviewed articles on the intersection of gender-based violence and HIV published between 2000 and 2010. A significant majority of the articles reviewed were empirical studies that investigate the link between gender-based violence and HIV. The review used a broader gender-based violence framework, and included violence against boys, men, MSM, and transgender people. 69 Ibid. 70 Silverman et al., \u201cIntimate partner violence.\u201d 26 Linkages between violence against women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific women living with HIV were more likely to report forced sex and domestic violence.71 Another 2009 study with husband-wife dyads in India showed that abusive husbands were more likely to acquire HIV than non-abusive husbands, and that the HIV risk for women in violent relationships increased seven-fold.72 A 2007 study in Bangladesh of married men found that more than one in three husbands reported physically and/or sexually abusing their wives", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1da917c0-1991-4756-b879-8029f66c3fdf": {"__data__": {"id_": "1da917c0-1991-4756-b879-8029f66c3fdf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Discussion paper: Linkages between violence against women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "033816156bd70c3ce7c906237a90ffca49d890c84b3c0f21587609352d72624e"}, "3": {"node_id": "cea36a0b-0a19-41b5-a33d-e859aa4550b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffe773b6a72992ac52bdf4b3b4365a123130d7b96444a051099a39d759597ae5"}}, "hash": "b23f561bcae4923320016ac735c1b8833bde9b55f477bee221966e1a1a4f9dfd", "text": "in the preceding year. Men perpetrating such violence were more likely to report both premarital and extramarital sex partners; those reporting physical violence were also more likely to report STI symptoms or diagnosis in the preceding year.73 Empirical studies from other parts of the world have established other dimensions of the linkages between violence against women and HIV. First, there is a strong link between actual or threat of violence and sexual risk- taking, including unprotected sex and multiple sex partners.74 Second, actual or the threat of violence affects women\u2019s ability to negotiate condom usage.75 And third, there is a link between intimate partner violence and unequal gender relations and HIV.76 It is telling that the type of empirical research outlined above is lacking within Asia and the Pacific and, as such, highlights the urgent need for an improved evidence base for policy makers and programme planners. HIV as a risk factor for violence against women There have been some attempts to understand HIV as a risk factor for violence in the Asia-Pacific region, though these are studies mostly based in India. These studies have tended to follow two lines of inquiry: one, actual or the threat of violence being a barrier to HIV disclosure, access to services, and adherence to treatment; and two, women living with HIV experiencing violence after disclosure of their HIV status. A cross-sectional study conducted in 2007 explored the prevalence of domestic violence among women visiting a VCT facility in India. Of the participants, 67 percent reported that they were HIV-positive.

While studies from the region indicate that women living with HIV are more likely to report violence, it is unclear whether disclosure of their HIV status marks the onset of violence or whether it triggers another episode of abuse within a history of intimate partner violence.80 In the context of the link between seropositivity and domestic violence, the 2007cross-sectional study in India concluded that \u201cthe cross-sectional nature of the research makes it impossible to determine the temporality of the variables.\u201d81 In light of these ongoing challenges, civil society organizations, including women\u2019s rights groups, HIV-positive women\u2019s networks, and other HIV/AIDS organizations, have all highlighted the need to examine the association between HIV disclosure and violence as part of the national research agenda. Data from other regions would suggest that the causality runs both ways, though this needs to be further investigated. In addition to intimate partner violence, women living with HIV as well as women sex workers and women who use drugs are also at risk of human rights violations within the public sphere. Human rights violations experienced by women and girls within the context of healthcare settings are being increasingly documented throughout the region. This includes forced sterilizations, forced abortions, forced disclosure of HIV status, and the denial of access to sexual and reproductive health (including family planning) information and services.82 The 2011 Stigma Index noted that between 2 percent (in China) and 29 percent (in Thailand) of the women respondents had been coerced into sterilization, and that between 7 percent (in Fiji) and 20 percent (in Thailand) reported health providers making access to antiretroviral treatment conditional on contraceptive usage.83 A 2012 study reported that women living with HIV in Asia face a range of sexual and reproductive rights violations in health facilities. These include discouraging women living with HIV from getting pregnant; denial or delay of medical care during childbirth; as well as coerced sterilization: \u201cOf the women surveyed, 30.1% said they were asked or encouraged to consider sterilisation, of these 37.7% said they did not have the option to decline. Women in Cambodia, India, and Indonesia recorded the highest rate of being asked to undergo sterilisation (over 35%). Indonesian women recorded the highest proportion who were given the option to decline the procedure (39 of44 women) whereas Cambodian women recorded the least choice to decline sterilisation (34 of 70 women).\u201d84 Young women\u2019s risk of violence and HIV Young women are at particular risk for violence, with as many as 30 percent of women in some locations reporting that their first sexual experience was coerced or forced,85 and the younger the women were at the time of sexual initiation, the higher the chance that it was violent.86 Also, the majority of sexually active girls aged 15\u201319 in developing countries are married, and these married adolescent girls tend to have higher rates 78 Medley, A., Garcia-Moreno, C., McGill, S., Mamanm S.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ee97f8f-404c-4fa1-8155-5a115689c017": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ee97f8f-404c-4fa1-8155-5a115689c017", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Discussion paper: Linkages between violence against women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3cb4b1bc2d9ab5d31f084c6d20651064269ca10c729e574674de2e02ad30478"}, "2": {"node_id": "6574cdd6-829e-4bd1-9c93-91ec13b28f1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e258541f7f164f0319f0849d1f469b8a58bcfe16d4c45428e408d1805fff0f72"}}, "hash": "1490cb9ba06d79faddf8239aa764fa59c18dd45e6bb6eb04b147ade2e0913a23", "text": "(2004), \u201cRates, barriers and outcomes of HIV serostatus disclosure among women in developing countries: Implications for prevention of mother-to-child transmission programmes,\u201d Bull World Health Organ; 2004;82(4):299-307. 79 GNP+ et al, \u201cPeople Living with HIV Stigma Index Asia Pacific Regional Analysis.\u201d 80 Program on International Health and Human Rights, Gender Based Violence and HIV. 81 Chandrasekaran et al., \u201cDeterminants of domestic violence.\u201d. 82 Global Commission on HIV and the Law.

For example, a 2008 study found that seroprevalence of HIV was the highest (24 percent) among sex workers aged 20 or younger.88 Sex work, violence and HIV Across Asia and the Pacific, female, male, and transgender sex workers face endemic violence from a range of perpetrators, and in various sites.89 At least three studies from the region have found that street-based sex workers are at greater risk for violence because they work in public spaces and are socially and physically isolated from colleagues than those in brothels and entertainment and massage parlours.90 Studies from the region have shown that female sex workers also experience intimate partner violence. In India, up to 35 percent of female sex workers surveyed faced intimate partner violence91; in Pakistan, a study dated 2009 reported that up to 66 percent of female sex workers faced physical violence and 34 percent faced sexual violence from their intimate partners92; in China, a 2012 study found that 55 percent of female sex workers surveyed reported emotional violence, 20 percent reported physical violence, and 16 percent reported sexual violence.93 In China, a 2008 study reported that 70 percent of surveyed sex workers had experienced some form of violence from clients94; in India, 56 percent reported that clients were the main perpetrators of violence.95 Research conducted by NGOs in Cambodia in 2005 and 2006 found that female and transgender sex workers are at particular risk of violence from gang members. The 2006 study96 reported that 38.3 percent of freelance transgender sex workers were beaten by clients in the past year and 48.5 percent were raped by at least a single client in the past year. Similarly, 43.9 percent of freelance female sex workers were beaten by clients in the past year and 57.1 percent were raped by at least a single client in the past year. A 2005 study97 reported that 54 percent of female beer promotion workers (considered \u201cindirect\u201d sex workers) reported physical abuse, and 38 percent reported coercion into sexual acts in the workplace.

A 2011 study in India reported that sex workers who have experienced a police raid are three-times more likely to report an STI and four-times more likely to report client violence.99 In Fiji, a 2009 study revealed that police surveillance and the threat of criminal sanction affects the ability of sex workers to safely negotiate prices and condom usage with clients.100 The inability of sex workers to enforce condom usage is a consequence of actual or the threat of violence, regardless of who the perpetrator is. In India, a 2010 study conducted with a cohort of 11,000 sex workers shows that those who report violence are less likely to have access to HIV-prevention information and enforce condom usage, and twice as likely to be infected with STIs than those who do not.101 A similar finding was reported in a 2010 study conducted in Thailand where sex workers who had experienced violence were found to be twice as likely to report condom failure.102 There is emerging evidence from the region regarding sex workers\u2019 risk for violence when placed under involuntary detention.103 Although few studies have investigated the combined risks for violence and HIV in detention centres, a 2010 study in China demonstrated that median syphilis prevalence in incarcerated sex workers was twelve-times higher than sex workers who were not incarcerated.104 Globally, sex workers are eight-times more likely to be HIV-positive than other adults. In developing countries, sex workers are fourteen-times more likely to be HIV-positive than women of reproductive age.105 All countries of the region criminalize some aspect of sex work, with the only exceptions being New Zealand and the Australian state of New South Wales.106 The threat of criminal sanction pushes sex workers underground, in turn reducing their power to negotiate condom usage as well as their ability to access health, including HIV-related, services. Possession of condoms itself can be used as evidence of sex work, inviting criminal prosecution in a number of countries in the region.107 Moreover, criminalization affects the access of sex workers to justice and affords impunity to police, clients, and other actors, thereby compounding the risk of violence faced by sex workers as well as their HIV-risk.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0ad2ee5-846d-49a3-80fc-8a042983e686": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0ad2ee5-846d-49a3-80fc-8a042983e686", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Discussion paper: Linkages between violence against women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "252df45e8aa3a6a19a9aa2b5e729552af4f4192229ac2483ade0df4818b043f2"}, "2": {"node_id": "096f69d2-a765-4057-bafd-c9afba4fb987", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9051db0e507aaac116a5cc2b6df6d41af52a5cf38cb8b5d8353da5203fcb5ce"}}, "hash": "9f05ed55659824993786531b16e22b040b84e7457a6aa38eb7b0f54fa99c62d0", "text": "98 Jenkins, et al., \u201cViolence and Exposure to HIV among Sex Workers in Phnom Penh.\u201d 99 Erausquin, Jennifer Toller, Elizabeth Reed, and Kim M.

For example, in certain provinces within China, women comprise between 17 to 40 percent of all people who use drugs.109 Women face gender-specific risks, vulnerabilities, and consequences of their drug use as well as gender-specific barriers to information and access to harm reduction, violence survivor services, and sexual and reproductive health and HIV services.110 Gendered analysis of drug use shows that a \u201clarge proportion of women are introduced to drug use in sexual relationships and are more likely than men to share injecting equipment, in particular with their sexual partners.\u201d111 A 2008 study from China reported that more than 90 percent of women who inject drugs share equipment, particularly with their sexual partners.112 Women are often injected by others, and when this is their sexual partner \u201cthey are likely to use the needle after their partner, compounding their HIV risk.\u201d113 Further, gender power inequalities between women and men, and specifically women\u2019s dependence on their partners for drug use, as well as the threat of or actual violence restricts their ability to insist on clean needles, negotiate condom usage, and access harm reduction and HIV-related services. Studies114 also show that women who use drugs are more likely to transact sex to finance their and/or their partner\u2019s drug habit, leaving them at greater risk for HIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78e23436-1b98-4de3-84d6-e7314ab8a1b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "78e23436-1b98-4de3-84d6-e7314ab8a1b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Discussion paper: Linkages between violence against women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5287d7957f17fee680f6d13476f484084805756262666140271c26ad9af7f9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cefa494-f666-4b64-8ecf-8d38cdad0843", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef04a9d1e4ed6233600d6159b37ab585a5ececa8976b718a57774ff0c2aefc1d"}}, "hash": "5ea114dea6c4ce3244ad954f44786e44d2691070bd8a87ccd0e9a6ad8e7b3416", "text": "The control that some men who use drugs exercise over the drug use and habits of their female sexual partners can also result in the inability of female drug users to manage their drug use, including when to abstain or access treatment.115 Women who use drugs in the Asia-Pacific region face conditions of marginalization, criminalization, and police surveillance, which places them at heightened risk for violence and HIV. In many countries, possession of drugs or injecting equipment can lead to criminal sanctions, including imprisonment and involuntary detention in treatment centres \u2013 sites where there is a woeful lack of gender-sensitive services and where women are at particular risk for violence.116 A 2002 study in Sri Lanka points to women being at particular risk for rape, sexual exploitation, and sexual harassment during drug searches by law enforcement officials. 117 Where the possession of drugs is criminalized, women are unable to report police violence and harassment for fear of retribution.

In addition, this approach is at the heart of MDG 3 (gender equality and empowerment of women) and MDG1 (reducing poverty).\u201d122 Violence against women and women\u2019s risk to HIV are rooted in gender inequality and unequal power relations. Therefore, interventions that are designed to respond to underlying causes and transform unequal power relations do work in terms of reducing HIV vulnerabilities of women and girls.123 Interventions that empower women, challenge gender norms, build collective power, and support collective action are achieving results; these strategies have been successfully adapted for different groups of women, whether they are married, living with HIV, or in sex work. Sex workers\u2019 collectives have been particularly successful in this region. Along with interventions that challenge structural determinants of women\u2019s risk to violence and HIV, services that reduce and mitigate harm are also needed. Principles of equality and non-discrimination must be integrated, so that the most marginalized and hard to reach groups, such as sex workers, women living with HIV, and women who use drugs, are prioritized and historical discrimination is not reproduced and reinforced. Examples of programmatic innovations and promising practices from the region At the global level, WHO, UNAIDS Open Society Initiative, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have led a concerted effort in recent years to collate evaluated interventions that integrate 120 UNIFEM, \u201cTransforming the National AIDS Response.\u201d 121 UNDP Roadmap (forthcoming publications). 122 Ibid. 123 Ibid. 33 Response to violence against women and HIV HIV, gender equality, and violence against women.124 These evaluations have focused on gender-sensitive HIV interventions that are transforming gender norms;125 reducing gender and economic inequalities;126 providing integrated and comprehensive post-rape care127; and addressing violence against women in the context of HIV testing.128While many of these globally-led evaluations have focused on programmatic interventions taking place in sub-Saharan Africa, there is an increasing number of innovative programmes being evaluated and documented in the Asia-Pacific region. These include programmatic interventions to address violence against sex workers, initiatives to challenge harmful masculinities and gender norms, and programmes aimed at reducing gender and economic inequalities faced by married women. Interventions such as the Avahan,129 Sonagachi,130 and SANGRAM131 projects in India and Pratirodh132 in Bangladesh all use multiple strategies to buttress the ability of sex workers to protect themselves from violence and HIV. In response to endemic violence faced by sex workers, Avahan initiated interventions to develop consciousness around gender and sex work; supported collective identity and action; and set up crisis management systems, including medical and legal counselling. Sonagachi established a sex worker-led collective that has changed the legislative and policy environment as well as set up services for sex workers. SANGRAM has several collective empowerment groups for marginalized groups, including female sex workers, MSM, and transgender people. VAMP is a registered sex workers\u2019 collective with 5,000 informal members and 127 staff. It is a rights-based organization led by women that tackles harmful gender norms and gender inequalities, including violence against sex workers and their access to resources and rights.133 Pratirodh, builds skills around finances, advocacy, networking, and solidarity through support groups. Strategies are based on learning and reflection on power inequities that are at the root of the discrimination, exclusion, and denial of rights that sex workers face.134 Avahan has reported a reduction of police violence and an increase in sex workers reporting non-police violence.135 Through the Sonagachi project, sex workers themselves have reduced HIV rates, condom use 124 A global web-based resource that showcases evaluated interventions that address gender equality and violence against women to reduce women\u2019s risk for HIV (www.whatworksforwomen.org/); and WHO, UNAIDS (2010), Addressing Violence against Women and HIV: What Works.\u201d 125 Stepping Stones seeks to improve sexual health by fostering gender equitable relationships between men and women through peer group sessions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41283df0-aeda-452c-8b0d-5f8ffff5d861": {"__data__": {"id_": "41283df0-aeda-452c-8b0d-5f8ffff5d861", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Discussion paper: Linkages between violence against women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1be67c4f1f332bbe965ac3d6df6b1c2c11435eb96c886144bb988b2bad09b2b"}, "2": {"node_id": "82349500-0bd7-4568-b3d2-c3ad39c02aa1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/discussion-paper-linkages-between-violence-against-women-and-hiv-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a07d5c844ec03dfa775bd5722e38cbb4336b4949816c3938db67c1da5a535d60"}}, "hash": "20c7b1838b472afae8fe7a98d8eabd0f943e798be713d1a709b60635975a317f", "text": "Evaluation of Stepping Stones in South Africa shows that there was a significant decrease in reported intimate partner violence (27 percent after 12 months and 38 percent after 24 months) as well as in the male participants\u2019 engagement in transactional sex and alcohol abuse.

Yaari Dosti The Yaari Dosti programme in India replicated aspects of Programme H in Brazil. Nearly 1,150 young men in Mumbai and rural Uttar Pradesh were exposed under the Yaari Dosti programme to either peer-led group education activities alone or combined with a community-based behaviour change communication, or to a delayed intervention that promoted gender equity. The study found that in all intervention sites there was a significant increase in the report of condom use at last sex, decreased partner violence, and increased support for gender equitable norms. The sample of young men included married and unmarried young men aged 16\u201329 in the urban areas and aged 15\u201324 in the rural settings. Logistic regression showed that men in the intervention sites in Mumbai were 1.9 times more likely and in rural Uttar Pradesh 2.8 times more likely to have used condoms with all types of partners than were young men in the comparison sites in each place. Furthermore, self-reported violence against partners declined in the intervention sites.

Evaluation shows participants reported less aggressive interactions; increased ability to openly discuss sexuality; increased recognition of women as having sexual rights and sexual agency; increased worry about their own health needs; increased seeking of HIV testing; delayed initiation of sexual activity with their current partner; and increased use of (male) condoms at last sexual intercourse.139 Resourcing gender equality in national AIDS plans: gaps and opportunities The UNAIDS Global Epidemic Report (2010) notes that, although women are included in HIV strategies of many countries, budgetary allocations are insufficient: \u201cGovernments in 80% of countries (137 of 171) reported that they include women as a specific component of a multi-sectoral HIV strategy, but the rate of inclusion of women differs by geographical regions. The number of countries with a specific budget for HIV activities related to women is considerably lower: 46% (79 of the 171) reporting countries. Outside sub-Saharan Africa, UNGASS reports are silent on violence against women and girls. UNGASS reports for several countries in sub-Saharan Africa outline the increased HIV vulnerability of women due to violence and sexual coercion and highlight the link with armed conflict, including sexual violence against women in refugee camps. Other countries underline that violence against sex workers affects their capacity to insist on the use of condoms. Reporting on gender-based violence is not even\u201d (emphasis added). While it is encouraging that countries are reporting on \u2018women\u2019 as a specific category, it is unclear what kinds of strategies countries are adopting and which groups of women are prioritized, or whether these strategies are gender-transformative and rights-based. Moreover, the fact that a majority of countries do not allocate a budget weakens the efficacy of their plans to address gender inequality and violence against women as part of their national AIDS action plan. Furthermore, along with including women-specific activities, national plans need to integrate gender equality outcomes across HIV interventions in order to be effective. Responding to violence against women and girls and HIV in Asia and the Pacific: Key gaps and challenges \u2022\ufffd Evaluated interventions that address gender equality, violence against women, and HIV are overwhelmingly focused on responding to HIV and VAW risks of female sex workers. \u2022\ufffd Interventions for sex workers that integrate gender equality, human rights, and violence against women are showing positive HIV outcomes, and also gender equality outcomes. However, these are limited to a few countries in the region, which presents opportunities for shared learning, adaptation, and scale-up in other parts of the region. 136 UNDP and UNAIDS (2012), \u201cUnderstanding and Acting on Critical Enablers and Development Synergies for Strategic Investments.\u201d 137 USAID, AIDSTAR Case Study Series. 138 WHO and UNAIDS, \u201cAddressing Violence against Women and HIV.\u201d 139 Ibid. 36 Linkages between violence against women and HIV in Asia and the Pacific \u2022\ufffd Voluntary counselling and testing services and the provision of comprehensive post-rape care services and other integrated services where they exist have not been evaluated or showcased. \u2022\ufffd Most of the evaluated interventions are designed and implemented by civil society organizations or sex worker networks, pointing to the lack of integrated services delivered by the state.

Notes on terminology and spelling: 1. The terminology associated with HIV has undergone many changes since HIV was first detected over two decades ago, and in all likelihood will continue to do so. For some time, the term HIV/AIDS was used to indicate generally the human immunodeficiency virus, and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome which it produces. Now that the onset of AIDS can be suppressed or significantly delayed with appropriate medication, and people are living long and productive lives with fewer manifestations of disease, the simple term HIV has gained favour. In this document, HIV is used unless it is not appropriate, or a quotation is used which employs other terminology. 2. Standard Anglo-Australian spelling has been used except where direct quotes are taken from documents using other variants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58e55609-4d81-4908-8757-87aee102cfae": {"__data__": {"id_": "58e55609-4d81-4908-8757-87aee102cfae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enabling-effective-responses-hiv-pacific-island-countries-drafting-instructions-human-rights-based-legislative-reform", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enabling Effective Responses to HIV in Pacific Island Countries: Drafting Instructions for Human rights-based Legislative Reform", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enabling-effective-responses-hiv-pacific-island-countries-drafting-instructions-human-rights-based-legislative-reform", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a08bd185e4bf708a60bc71c27b400fd1f48f20fb31cd9805c0464d94f2dc4ba7"}, "2": {"node_id": "9820a66d-14f6-47f9-a8b0-41e04c5e5713", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enabling-effective-responses-hiv-pacific-island-countries-drafting-instructions-human-rights-based-legislative-reform", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbabe3a74fdee24a763131dafe46d16617452deff9d668bb5e9f73a0f2b5638f"}, "3": {"node_id": "d746d599-ffe9-4cfd-955a-d98e84d01851", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enabling-effective-responses-hiv-pacific-island-countries-drafting-instructions-human-rights-based-legislative-reform", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84a4ac00f3f3da84dac06ea10e18f8afb526d2cfc2b84ea52b0464ca523d1520"}}, "hash": "dfd4987295c2dee2c8cde845fd6fc86793cb06fdde77ef694a18214430c7bb02", "text": "ExECuTivE Summary E N A B L I N G E F F E C T I V E R E S P O N S E S T O H I V I N P A C I F I C I S L A N D C O U N T R I E S vi This.project.was.a.joint.partnership.between.UNDP.Pacific.Centre,.UNAIDS.and.the.Pacific.Regional.Rights.

Occupational health and safety in the sex industry Example A culture of safer sex can be promoted in the industry and responsible behaviour by clients, workers, and management can be encouraged. In New Zealand, the Prostitution Reform Act 2003 aims to safeguard the human rights of sex workers, to protect them from exploitation, to promote the welfare and occupational health and safety of sex workers, to be conducive to public health, and to prohibit the use in prostitution of persons under 18 years of age. Shortly after the law changed, occupational safety and health guidelines were developed by the Department of Labour in consultation with sex workers. The guidelines contain specific references to supporting sex workers in maintaining conditions that are conducive to their well being. The guidelines not only promote best practice in the provision of commercial sexual services, but also include information about HIV education. The ability to negotiate with clients to promote sexual services that are safe is enhanced in this decriminalized environment.

Example \u2022 In New South Wales, Australia, condoms have been made available in prisons since 1996, after a prisoner sued the Government after being infected with HIV in prison. \u2022 Establishing needle and syringe programmes in prisons. The first such programme started in 1992 in Switzerland. As of March 2004, over 50 such programmes were operating in Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, and Belarus. All evaluations of programmes have been favourable. Reported drug use decreased or remained stable over time, and reported sharing of injecting equipment reduced dramatically. The evaluations found no reports of serious unintended negative events, such as the initiation of injection, or the use of needles as weapons. Overall, evaluations indicated that prison syringe exchange programmes are feasible, and do provide benefit in the reduction of risk behaviour and the transmission of blood borne infection without any negative effects. b \u2022 Fiji\u2019s Prisons and Corrections Act 2006 requires those implementing the legislation to apply \u201cthe accepted practices and standards identified in the context of HIV/ AIDS, and in particular the International Minimum Standards on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights\u201d and to ensure that \u201cprisoners who are infected with HIV/AIDS ...are treated in a manner which takes into account their basic rights and special needs\u201d.
