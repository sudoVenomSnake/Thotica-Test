It is because of her that our wells had sweet water at just 10 feet. Every monsoon, she would ride up to our houses. Every third year she claimed a sacrifice \u2013 mostly small animals. One time though she took away my 16-year-old cousin. I was angry and hollered in her direction for days,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now, she has been angry for far too long... maybe the bridge did it,\u201d his voice trails off. Awasthi stands on a 67 metre-long bridge, on a barely-there river called the Sai. The angry \u2018She.\u2019 Below the bridge is farmland \u2013 with freshly cut-off stubs of wheat in the riverbed and water guzzling eucalyptus trees swaying on the sides. Awasthi\u2019s friend and associate Jagdish Prasad Tyagi, a retired schoolteacher remembers the Sai as \u201ca beautiful river.\u201d He speaks of the deep water eddies on the crests of which big fish would ride and create a spectacle. The fish he still remembers are eddy machli , rohu , eels, puffers, etc. \u201cWhen the water began to dry out, the fishes disappeared,\u201d he says. There are other fond memories. Malti Awasthi, 74, who was the village sarpanch from 2007-12, recalls how the Sai rode right up to the courtyard of her home, some 100 metres from the riverbed.

Right: Malti Awasthi recalls how the Sai rode right up to the courtyard of her home, some 100 metres from the riverbed The Sai is a tributary of the river Gomti. It holds a lofty place in Indian mythology. In the Ramcharitramanas (the 16th century epic which literally means the Lake of the Deeds of Lord Ram) penned by Goswami Tulsidas, it is referred to as Adi Ganga \u2014 that which came before the Ganga. The river rises from a pond in the village of Bijgawan in Pihani block of Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Hardoi district. In its initial 10 kilometres it is called jhabar (pond), before it takes its more popular name. It travels about 600 kms to form a boundary between the districts of Lucknow and Unnao. The state capital Lucknow is some 110 kms north of Hardoi while Unnao district is 122 kms away. From its origin to its confluence with the Gomti, a tributary of the Ganga, in Rajepur village of Jaunpur district, the Sai measures approximately 750 kms. That great length is caused by its meandering nature. Hardoi, a district measuring roughly 126 kms in length and 75 kms in width, is shaped like an irregular quadrilateral. It is home to 41 lakh people. Most of its workers perform agricultural labour, others are cultivators and household industry workers. According to Hardoi A Gazetteer , Being Volume Xli Of The District Gazetteers Of The United Provinces Of Agra And Oudh , published in 1904, the valley of Sai \" extends over the central portion of the district.\u201d The gazette notes: \u201cThe area under cultivation in Hardoi is fertile but [...] broken up by many shallow depressions, frequent stretches of barren tisar ... scattered patches of dhak and scrub jungle \u2026 .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ea68042-cb6e-42ec-b8b3-0522df0c6330": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ea68042-cb6e-42ec-b8b3-0522df0c6330", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/and-a-river-no-longer-runs-through-it/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nRana Tiwari\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "And a river no longer runs through it", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/and-a-river-no-longer-runs-through-it/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nRana Tiwari\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "3be209b9906f98b170caf537437c9a40a54ac1774fce3dfd634dfaf9c9b43c1b"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4914bc2-342d-432e-86db-bbfee313c0af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/and-a-river-no-longer-runs-through-it/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nRana Tiwari\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "aded3301e828e9cc816f984439f0908b2d7e3451d187324e790df5a35d051654"}}, "hash": "2493796744404558f83c20f41a5f9d631a2fcc91f3d2cf5068783145b4ca3011", "text": "[it] forms the valley of the Sai.\u201d Awasthi, now 78 and a medical doctor (anaesthetist), was born in Parauli, a hamlet in the village of Kursath Buzurg in Madhoganj block.

Parauli has a population of 130 consisting mainly of Brahmins with a sprinkling of Chamars (Scheduled Castes) and Vishwakarmas (Other Backward Castes). The bridge Awasthi stands on is between the villages of Parauli and Band, the latter sited in Kachhauna block. Kachhauna was (and is) an important market area \u2013 to which farmers carry their produce for trade and purchase fertilisers. In the absence of a bridge, the distance between Kursath Buzurg and Kachhauna was 25 kms. With a bridge that was whittled down to 13. Between the railway stations of Kursath and Kachhauna (now known as the Balamau junction) there was a railway bridge, also used by people. Old timers remember camels for trade traversing the bridge, made of wooden planks. But in 1960, an unusually fierce monsoon caused that bridge to fall \u2013 thus cutting off the only quicker route (10 km) between the two places. The idea of a new bridge first came to Tyagi, then a primary school teacher in Sardar Nagar village of Madhoganj block. He lived in what is today the town of Azad Nagar, some three and a half kms from Parauli. Tyagi is not the 1945-born former teacher\u2019s family surname. That name is Singh. The name Tyagi \u2013 from tyag , the Hindi word for sacrifice \u2013 was bestowed on him as he was willing to go to any length to better things for his people. When he retired in 2008, he was the headmaster of the junior high school where he began his career. \u201cI was born into a very poor family, but that never dampened my will to do good,\u201d says Tyagi, now so weakened with age that he finds it difficult to walk. Once, both his family\u2019s buffalos fell into a deep pit on Azad Nagar\u2019s main village road. Through some heavy pushing and pulling, he got them out, Tyagi was struck by his father Mohan Singh\u2019s moan. \u201cWill there ever be a time when it will be safe to walk in these lanes?\u201d \u201cThat triggered something in me, and I started to fill up the pit.

He had carried within him the pain of the river which made higher school education impossible, especially for the girls of the village school. So he asked his brother Narendra, an electrical engineer, to look for a boatman, who during monsoons would ferry students free of cost to the other side of the river. Awasthi paid Rs 4,000 for the wooden boat. After school duties the boatman, Chotai, was free to collect more fare for the rest of the day \u2013 but the stipulation was that he could never miss a school day. Over the years the boat came apart, but Awasthi in 1980 had built a school till Class 8 in his own village, named after his grandparents \u2013 the Ganga Sugrahi Smriti Shiksha Kendra. In 1987, the school was recognised by the Uttar Pradesh State Board of High School and Intermediate Education. Yet, that bothersome challenge \u2013 how do others come to Parauli for education remained. When Awasthi and Tyagi finally met they decided nothing short of a new bridge would solve the problem. As men, they could not be more different. Awasthi had learnt swimming by being thrown into the river, while Tyagi had never dared dip his toe in the waters. Awasthi \u2013 given his government job could not be at the forefront of the agitation, while Tyagi knew only how to lead from the front. Two unlikely but committed men met and the \u2018Kshetriya Vikas Jan Andolan\u2019 (KVJA - People\u2019s Struggle for Area development) was born. The membership of the KVJA could not really be counted, but kept growing. As Tyagi could not fight an election, he cajoled his mother, Bhagwati Devi, to stand in the municipal polls anticipating more clout to get good quality development work done. Bhagwati Devi appeared to lose by five votes, but an appeal at the Sub District Magistrate (SDM) court upturned the decision in her favour. From 1997-2007, she served as Town Area Chairman. First, the KVJA had to be registered. However, despite Awasthi\u2019s influential position in Lucknow that could not happen. So the andolan turned around with a slogan \u2018 vikas nahin, toh vote nahin \u2019 [no development, no vote] and \u2018 vikas karo ya gaddi chodo\u2019 [carry out development or leave your chairs] aimed at politicians and legislators. 'We loved her [the Sai river]. It is because of her that our wells had sweet water at just 10 feet. Every monsoon, she would ride up to our houses' Watch the video: The lost Sai At the first meeting of the still unregistered organisation, some 3,000 people from 17 affected villages reached Parauli to hear Bhagwati Devi. Pamphlets were circulated. These read, \u2018 With our body and heart we commit ourselves to this movement. We will not retreat. We will sign these pledge letters with our blood. There is no way back till there is a bridge between Band and Parauli.\u2019 These were signed off with \u2018Laal hoga humara jhanda, kranti hoga kaam [Our flag shall be red, rebellion shall be our task]\u2019. Over 1,000 such pamphlets were distributed and on each, people signed or affixed their thumb prints with blood. Then came visits to all 17 villages which would be impacted by the bridge. \u201cPeople took their cycles, beddings and just moved on. There was no need for any elaborate preparations,\u201d recalls Tyagi. Word would be sent to the village where the visit was to take place and a dugduggi (small drum) sounded to inform residents of it. The next step was a sit-in on the riverbank \u2013 led by Tyagi\u2019s mother, who was a well-respected figure. Awasthi gave his farmland by the river to stage the sit-in, ringing in the protest area with bamboo sticks. A canopy of chaff was set up for people who stayed at the sit-in during the night.

Before they set out to Lucknow, one final effort was made through a cycle rally to the town of Madhoganj, eight kms away. When some 4,000 cycles appeared with posters, banners and flags, the media sat up and took note. Many local reports highlighted the issue. Also reported was the daring declaration of some agitators that if the demand for the bridge was not accepted, they would push the DM\u2019s jeep in the river. Some weeks later, 51 tractors laid siege to the DM\u2019s office.

By then the fight for the bridge had been on for almost a year and a half. The siege at Lucknow had created a massive stir. The first person to reach out to the protestors soon after was Ram Prakash Tripathi, the minister for cooperatives. He heard them; went to Kalraj Mishra, the minister of Public Works Department to apprise him not only of the demand, but the fact that the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) would lose support in the area if the agitation persisted. Before Mishra could intervene, the protestors had declared they would immolate themselves and announced that intent to the media. The police swopped down, arresting many of the agitators including Tyagi\u2019s brother, Hriday Nath. On August 13, 1997, a team led by the DM Hardoi, finally decided to pay the protestors a visit. Tyagi was hailed as a hero. In Lucknow, Awasthi who had been funding the agitation, was relieved. Some months later, the bridge was sanctioned. However the two instalments that were to be paid for the construction came through only after another year of protests. <img alt=\"Left: Venkatesh Dutta sitting in front of his computer in his laboratory.\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/08a-IMG_2242-RT-And_a_river_no_longer_runs.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/08a-IMG_2242-RT-And_a_river_no_longer_runs_th.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:500px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Rana Tiwari <img alt=\"Right: A graph showing the average annual rainfall in Hardoi from years 1901-2021\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/08b-Hardoi-Rainfall-RT-And_a_river_no_long.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/08b-Hardoi-Rainfall-RT-And_a_river_no_longer_.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:500px;\"/> Left: Venkatesh Dutta sitting in front of his computer in his laboratory.

In all the 17 villages that had come together to fight for the bridge, it was a day of celebration. \u201cFar brighter than Diwali, more colourful than Holi,\u201d as Awasthi remembers. Almost immediately after that, the Sai began to shrink. The rain-fed river that had once flowed majestically all year round and would become fearful in the monsoon, was reduced to a timid version of itself, getting weaker as the years went by. This is not a fate unique to the Sai. Venkatesh Dutta, Professor, School for Environmental Sciences at the Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, says in a report : \u201cThere is a global trend of intermittency. The flow of once-perennial rivers (like the Sai) has become monsoon-dependent and sluggish. Data from 1984 to 2016 confirms that both groundwater and baseflow are declining.\u201d Baseflow is water from the ground that flows into a water body over a long time even after the last rain; while groundwater is the water under the ground \u2013 the stock into which a river needs to dig into when it gets dry. Baseflow is thus the river of today, groundwater \u2013 the river of the future. Over a 20 year period from 1996, rainfall in Uttar Pradesh decreased by 5 per cent. The WaterAid report on The State of Groundwater in Uttar Pradesh , released in July 2021, reads, \u201c...rapid decline of water levels have severely impacted groundwater-fed rivers of the state, as natural discharges/base flows from the groundwater system to rivers, and wetlands have significantly reduced or almost vanished. Large scale encroachment of water bodies and their catchments has added miseries\u2026. Reduced base flows are impacting groundwater-dependent rivers and their ecological flows as well the surface storages. Gomti river and its tributaries as well as several other rivers in the state are groundwater-fed, but heavy extraction and subsequent groundwater level decline in the river catchment have impacted severely with significant reduction in flows of the rivers.\u201d In addition to these disasters, the district faced a third problem. A study showed that Hardoi had lost 85 per cent of its wetlands between 1997 and 2003. <img alt=\"Left: Shivram Saxena standing knee-deep in the Sai river.\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/09a-IMG_7893-RT-And_a_river_no_longer_runs.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/09a-IMG_7893-RT-And_a_river_no_longer_runs_th.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Rana Tiwari <img alt=\"Right: Boring for farm irrigation right on the banks of the river\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/09b-_X4A5691-RT-And_a_river_no_longer_runs.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/09b-_X4A5691-RT-And_a_river_no_longer_runs_th.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Pawan Kumar Left: Shivram Saxena standing knee-deep in the Sai river.

Professor Venkatesh Dutta says that river rejuvenation is no \u2018magic\u2019 that can be achieved in a few years. \u201cOnly natural recharge through large waterbodies, lakes, ponds and streams can bring water back to our rivers.

Trees became fewer. Rainfall patterns changed \u2014 with most of it concentrated in a few days, instead of being spread out. This means most of the rainwater runs off, for it doesn\u2019t have the time to percolate into the ground. Groundwater becomes scarcer and thus there is not enough to feed our rivers,\u201d says Sinha. Yet, development policies rarely consider groundwater as a factor. Sinha cites two examples \u2013 one, the increase in number of tubewells in the state from 10,000 to 30,000 under the current government. And another, the Har Ghar Jal Yojana which aims to take water to every household. Sinha lists a number of necessary steps, including the mapping of rivers, the ground water situation, morphology and ox bow lakes (through satellite mapping). Yet, instead of moving to a more complete approach the government has turned to obfuscation of figures. For instance, in the calculation of dark zones (where groundwater levels have fallen to an alarming level) in 2015, the government decided to do away with the measure of ground water extracted. It has since relied only on estimates of water absorbed by the ground.

Vijay Marottar\u2019s cotton field in Vidarbha had been devastated. \u201cI had invested nearly Rs. 1.25 lakh on the crop. I lost most of it,\u201d says the 25-year-old. It was September 2022, Vijay\u2019s first cropping season. And this time, he had nobody to share his problems with. His father, Ghanshyam Marottar had died by suicide five months ago, and he had lost his mother to a sudden heart attack a little more than two years ago. Seasons of crop loss with erratic weather and mounting debts caused his parents severe anxiety and stress, as with many other farmers in the Vidarbha region. And there has been little help for them. But Vijay knew he could not afford to break down like his father. He busied himself to draining the water from his field for the next two months. For two hours every day, with nothing but a bucket in hand, he ploughed barefoot through his sloughy farm, his track pants folded up to his knees, his t-shirt soaked in sweat. He broke his back, draining the water out manually. \u201cMy farmland is located on a slope,\u201d Vijay explains. \u201cI am, therefore, more affected by excess rains. Water from surrounding farms slides into mine and is difficult to get rid of.\u201d The experience has scared him. Even when adverse climatic conditions \u2013 excessive rainfall, prolonged dry spells, and hailstorms cause immense agrarian distress, leading to mental health issues, the state does very little to help farmers deal with this crisis. (Read In Vidarbha: agrarian distress, playing on the mind ). No information about access to or provision of services for people with mental stress and disorder, available under the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 , ever reached Vijay or his father, Ghanshyam, while he was alive and struggling. Nor have they come across any outreach camps organised under the District Mental Health Programme of 1996. In November 2014, the state of Maharashtra came up with the \u2018Prerna Prakalp Farmer Counselling Health Service Programme.\u2019 The initiative came via the district collectorate along with a Yavatmal-based NGO \u2013 Indirabai Sitaram Deshmukh Bahuddeshiya Sanstha, and aimed at plugging the treatment gap in rural areas using a public-private (civil society) partnership model. But by the time Vijay lost his father in 2022, the much-touted Prerana project of the government had also fizzled out. <img alt=\"Vijay Marottar in his home in Akpuri.

Not long after the project took off across the state, administrative and coordination issues between teams began to rear their heads. Eventually, civil society organisations pulled out, and the Prerana project became a completely government-controlled program, lacking efficient implementation.\u201d The programme had roped in ASHA workers to track potentially depressed or anxious patients by promising additional compensation and benefits for this added responsibility.

Again, Yavatmal was staring intense agrarian distress in the face: symbolised by 355 farmer suicides in that year. The state\u2019s inability to address the mental health crisis meant that more than one non-profit organisation had stepped into the region. Tata Trust ran a pilot project called Vidarbha Psychological Support and Care Programme in 64 villages of Yavatmal and Ghatanji taluka from March 2016 to June 2019. \u201cOur initiative increased the help-seeking mentality among people,\u201d says Praful Kapse, who headed the project. \u201cMore farmers started coming forward with their problems whereas, in earlier times, they used to go to a tantrik practitioner to cure mental health disorders.\u201d In the 2018 Kharif season, a psychologist working with Tata Trust reached out to Shankar Pantangwar. This 64-year-old farmer, who owned three acres of land in Hatgaon village in Ghatanji taluka, had slipped into a depression with suicidal thoughts. \u201cI had not seen my farmland for over a month,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI would spend days sleeping in my hut. I have been a farmer all my life, and I don\u2019t think I have ever gone so long without seeing my land. When we pour our heart and soul into our farm and get nothing in return, how do you not get depressed?\u201d For two or three consecutive seasons, Shankar had experienced serious losses in his farm, where he cultivates cotton and tur. And so, when the month of May arrived, in 2018 the thought of preparing for the upcoming season all over again seemed overwhelming. He did not see the point of anything then. \u201cI told myself I can\u2019t lose hope. If I break down, my family will break down,\u201d says Shankar. <img alt=\"Shankar Pantangwar on his farmland in Hatgaon, where he cultivates cotton and tur on his three acre.

Shankar decided to fight his inner demons for their sake as the Kharif season of 2018 approached. It was around that time that the psychologist approached him. \u201cThey used to come and sit with me for three-four hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI just shared all the troubles I had.

It was refreshing to talk to someone about my feelings without being guarded,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf I share with my family and friends, they will get stressed. Why should I bother them like that?\u201d Shankar gradually slid into a routine of expecting the interactions every couple of months when they suddenly stopped one day - without a warning or word of explanation. \u201cAdministrative reasons,\u201d is all Kapse, the head of the project, could say. At their last meeting, neither the psychologists nor Shankar knew they would never see each other again. Shankar misses those interactions very much.

He received help when a psychologist working with TATA trust reached out to him, but it did not last long var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); In September 2022, when Divya Marathi , a regional daily newspaper, called up 104 posing as a distressed farmer with suicidal thoughts, the response from the helpline said that the counsellor was busy with another patient. The caller was requested to note her name, district and taluka and call again in half an hour. \u201cThere are times when the help-seeker might feel calm after being heard,\u201d comments Kapse. \u201cBut if the help-seeker has called in acute distress where he is feeling suicidal, it is important for the counsellor to convince the person to call 108 ambulance service. The counsellors managing the helpline should be trained to address such cases,\u201d he says. According to the state government data, the helpline had received its highest number of calls, 13,437, from all over Maharashtra from 2015-16. The average number of calls stood at around 9,200 a year for the next four years. However, when Covid-19 broke out in 2020-21, and mental health crises peaked, the number of calls saw a dramatic decline, 3,575 calls a year \u2013 a surprising 61 per cent drop. The following year, it further dwindled to 1,963 \u2013 a staggering 78 per cent drop from the average of the previous four years. On the other hand, the distress in rural areas was at an all-time high, and so were the farmer suicide numbers across Maharashtra. According to Maharashtra government data, 1,023 farmers took their own lives between July 2022 and January 2023. A much worse figure than the 1,660 farmers who killed themselves in the two and a half years preceding July 2022. On 30 October 2022, the union government announced a new helpline \u2013 14416 \u2013 to replace 104 slowly. It is too early to judge the impact of the new helpline. The distress, however, persists. <img alt=\"Farming is full of losses and stress, especially difficult without a mental health care network to support them.

A daily wage worker, his orchard is a hard-won dream. A member of the Madiga community (listed as Scheduled Caste in Andhra Pradesh), this land was assigned to him around 25 years ago by the state government. It was done in a move by the state to redistribute land among the landless classes introduced under the Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings) Act, 1973. When the mango season ends in June he returns to doing daily-wage work in sugarcane fields in nearby villages. He can earn Rs. 350 a day when he gets work. He also does MNREGA work like deepening lakes, composting and other labour for 70-75 days in a year. He gets paid between Rs. 230 and 250 for a day\u2019s work. When Nagaraju first became a land owner he grew turmeric, but in around five years he switched to mango cultivation in the hope of better profits. \u201cWhen I started [20 years ago], I would get 50- 75 kilos of mangoes from each tree,\u201d he says, recalling happier times of bountiful harvests. \u201cI love mangoes, especially Totapuri ,\u201d he adds.

The trees cannot handle this,\u201d he adds. With conditions for mango cultivation becoming less ideal over the last few years, Sriramamurthy is beginning to regret the decision he took in 2014. That year, he sold a 0.9 acre patch of land near the town of Anakapalli and used the Rs. six lakh he got for it as pettubadi (investment) for a mango orchard in Pomula Bheemavaram. Explaining the move he says, \u201cEveryone loves them [mangoes] and they are in demand. I hoped that mango farming would [eventually] get me enough money.\" Since then, however, he says he hasn\u2019t been able to make a profit. \u201cBetween 2014 and 2022, my total income from mango farming [in these eight years] has not been more than six lakh [rupees],\u201d says Sriramamurthy. Regretting his decision to sell his land he says, \u201cThe land I sold is now worth so much more. I should have probably not started mango farming.\u201d It\u2019s not just the weather. Mango trees depend on saagu neeru (irrigation), and neither Nagaraju nor Sriramamurthy have borewells on their land.

His fingers brush the tea bushes planted uniformly in rows on the sloping hill. His wife, Sumna Devi, stands close, holding a basket in readiness.

It is harvesting time and Rajinder Singh\u2019s urgent search for leaves has not yielded anything. He comes to the field in Tanda village of Kangra district every day, and either Sumna or their 20-year-old son Aryan accompany him. April and May are the season for plucking tea, called the first flush. But there is nothing for him to pluck. \u201cYou can feel the heat and don\u2019t know where the rain is!\u201d he said worried about his drying tea bushes located here in Palampur tehsil of Himachal Pradesh. Rajinder\u2019s nervousness is understandable given the poor rainfall over the last two years. A 2016 FAO intergovernmental report noted that, \u201cErratic rainfall is responsible for damage to tea plantations.\u201d The report studies the effect of climate change on tea which specifically needs rain between the months of February to April. After which, the first harvest in April demands the highest price \u2013 going for Rs. 800 and occasionally to as high as Rs. 1,200 a kilogram. The year 2022 was supposed to be a special one for Rajinder who had taken two more hectares on lease and as he mentions, \u201cI thought my income would increase.\u201d With the total area now at three hectares, he looked forward to harvesting up to 4,000 kilos of tea at the end of the season. He spent Rs. 20,000 for the lease, and says that in tea it is the wages for labour that account for up to 70 per cent of the production costs. \u201cIt takes a lot of labour and [input] expenses to maintain a garden,\u201d he pointed out.

More than half the gardens are in Palampur tehsil , and the rest are distributed across Baijnath, Dharamshala and Dehra tehsil . \u201cOnly a few districts in Himachal have the possibility to grow tea because of its fulfilment of tea requirements of acidic soil and a PH level of 4.5 to 5.5,\u201d points out Dr. Sunil Patial. He is the Tea Technical Officer at the state\u2019s Department of Agriculture. The tea gardens and mountainous landscape of Kangra features extensively in Bollywood films, the latest being Bhoot Police, a story around supernatural elements. \u201cMany tourists get out their cameras and shoot our gardens, but know very little about it,\u201d points out Rajinder. ***** Tea plantations in Himachal Pradesh are solely dependent on orographic precipitative rainfall \u2013 when the heat rises it usually rains, bringing relief to tea bushes. \u201cA rise in temperature with no rainfall is a big problem. Tea plants need humidity, but now [2021 and 2022] it is hot,\u201d explains Patial. In March and April 2022, rainfall in Kangra district showed over a 90 per cent deficit, according to the data with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Subsequently, the leaves plucked in April and May 2022 and sent to the Palampur Cooperative Tea Factory, were down to one lakh kilos \u2013 a quarter of 2019 figures for the same month. <img alt=\"Left: The prized 'two leaves and a bud' that go to make tea.\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/04a-IMG_2947-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/04a-IMG_2947-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling_of.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:470px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Aakanksha <img alt=\"Right: Workers come from other states to pluck tea\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/04b-IMG_3030-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/04b-IMG_3030-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling_of.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:470px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Aakanksha Left: The prized 'two leaves and a bud' that go to make tea.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4db016a7-10c9-4e25-9e1c-9f6908d740ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "4db016a7-10c9-4e25-9e1c-9f6908d740ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/kangras-tea-gardens-falling-off-the-map/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nAakanksha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kangra\u2019s tea gardens: falling off the map", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/kangras-tea-gardens-falling-off-the-map/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nAakanksha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "d13456e358db9ac10c31d5bf6d1a5599c604ec4ff3ca56fb5518b8e8b2f668af"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f6fbb50-4faf-48cf-b275-048edcf68aa9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/kangras-tea-gardens-falling-off-the-map/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nAakanksha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "be08b0ec77566040f81b09bc62089cc348fa95f84ecb8dedd5c670966692a58f"}}, "hash": "6bc27b13c43a4496bc8f8635f62cee822cfcb609d8ff40e974a46f18783f04b3", "text": "Right: Workers come from other states to pluck tea var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); <img alt=\"Freshly plucked leaves drying (left) at the Palampur Cooperative Tea Factory (right) in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/05a-IMG_4208-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/05a-IMG_4208-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling_of.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Aakanksha <img alt=\"Freshly plucked leaves drying (left) a t the Palampur Cooperative Tea Factory (right) in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/05b-IMG_4243-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/05b-IMG_4243-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling_of.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Aakanksha Freshly plucked leaves drying (left) a t the Palampur Cooperative Tea Factory (right) in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); Rajinder was not spared: When PARI checked at the end of May 2022, he said he had managed to harvest only around 1,000 kilos. Of that, half was kept by the family to process at home to sell locally and half went to the factory in Palampur for processing. \u201cFour kgs of green leaves gives a kg of tea. We made around 100 packets of a kilo each to sell,\u201d said his son Aryan. A kilo of black tea is sold for Rs. 300 and green tea for Rs. 350. The bulk of tea is grown in Assam, West Bengal and the Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu. In 2021-22, India produced 1,344 million kilos and small growers contributed close to 50 per cent of that, says the Tea Board India on its website. This body comes under the union ministry of commerce and industry goes on to say, \u201csmall producers are highly unorganized and because of fragmented and scattered nature of the holdings, they remain at the very bottom of the value chain.\u201d Tea from Himachal competes with tea from other regions. Within the state, apple growers are preferred and get more attention from the [local] administration,\u201d points out Dr. Pramod Verma. He is a Tea Technologist at the Himachal Pradesh Agriculture University in Palampur and has been researching tea for over a decade. The drop in tea produced is also a fallout of the shrinking area under tea: Bushes have been planted across 2,110 ha in Kangra district, but only half the area \u2013 1096.83 ha is actively cultivated. The rest is neglected, abandoned or has been converted into dwellings. The last is in violation of the Himachal Pradesh Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1972 , which states the land under tea cannot be sold or used for any other purpose. <img alt=\"Jaat Ram Bahman and wife Anjagya Bahman (right) are in their eighties and continue to work in their tea garden.\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/06a-IMG_2760-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/06a-IMG_2760-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling_of.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Aakanksha", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dd65aae-c370-4d4f-b9f7-2fc7289300d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dd65aae-c370-4d4f-b9f7-2fc7289300d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/kangras-tea-gardens-falling-off-the-map/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nAakanksha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kangra\u2019s tea gardens: falling off the map", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/kangras-tea-gardens-falling-off-the-map/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nAakanksha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "bbf48a6ff6851737e0a53c655eb3b39c53878c741394a406bcddf684bd471b5b"}, "3": {"node_id": "218368ba-903a-4232-92b0-f95b238db610", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/kangras-tea-gardens-falling-off-the-map/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nAakanksha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "8be71269f28329e1d2b15f0b774e3924c57f58ee81954486806bc0b577225364"}}, "hash": "8acb2de82064b0cadcae78b9d25a508a911600652e33d0709fd70351fab456b3", "text": "<img alt=\"Jaat Ram (left) in his factory\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/06b-IMG_3793-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/06b-IMG_3793-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling_of.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Aakanksha Jaat Ram Bahman and wife Anjagya Bahman (right) are in their eighties and continue to work in their tea garden.

Now you see houses,\u201d says Rajinder\u2019s neighbour in Tanda village, Jaat Ram Bahman. He and his wife Anjagya Bahman own and cultivate tea on their 15-canal garden (roughly three fourths of a hectare). The 87-year-old Jaat Ram recalls a time when gardens made profits and there were plenty of them around. The first seedlings were planted in 1849 and by the 1880s, tea from Kangra was winning gold and silver medals in the London and Amsterdam markets. In 2005, Kangra received a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for its unique flavour. \u201cThose were the golden years\u201d recalls Jaswant Bahman, 56, and owner of a 10 canals (roughly half a hectare) of tea also in Tanda village. \u201cWe used to process the leaves in our homes with machines (traditional) and sell in Amritsar. It was a huge market.\u201d Bahman is referring to the 1990s when, according to the local tea board, Kangra produced up to 18 lakh tonnes of finished tea a year. The tea was sent by road to Amritsar\u2019s markets \u2013 a journey of over 200 kilometres \u2013 from where it joined international auctions. Today it produces less than half of that amount \u2013 8,50,000 tonnes. \u201cWe could earn a good amount [on our one hectare]. We made many trips in a year as soon as we prepared tea. In one trip I could earn between Rs. 13,000- 35,000,\u201d said Rajinder showing PARI old bills. <img alt=\"In Kangra district, 96 per cent of holdings of tea gardens are less than two hectares.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "218368ba-903a-4232-92b0-f95b238db610": {"__data__": {"id_": "218368ba-903a-4232-92b0-f95b238db610", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/kangras-tea-gardens-falling-off-the-map/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nAakanksha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kangra\u2019s tea gardens: falling off the map", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/kangras-tea-gardens-falling-off-the-map/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nAakanksha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "bbf48a6ff6851737e0a53c655eb3b39c53878c741394a406bcddf684bd471b5b"}, "2": {"node_id": "3dd65aae-c370-4d4f-b9f7-2fc7289300d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/kangras-tea-gardens-falling-off-the-map/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nAakanksha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "8acb2de82064b0cadcae78b9d25a508a911600652e33d0709fd70351fab456b3"}}, "hash": "8be71269f28329e1d2b15f0b774e3924c57f58ee81954486806bc0b577225364", "text": "More than half the gardens are in Palampur tehsil, and the rest are distributed across Baijnath, Dharamshala and Dehra tehsil\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/08a-IMG_4473-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/08a-IMG_4473-A-Kangras_tea_gardens-falling_of.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:350px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Aakanksha <img alt=\"In Kangra district, 96 per cent of holdings of tea gardens are less than two hectares.

Kangra\u2019s tea planters started shifting to Kolkata, the chief tea auction centre in India. Most growers had shifted from processing at home to the state-run factories in Palampur, Bir, Baijnath and Sidhbari as the factories would deal directly with the Kolkata auction. However, these factories began to shut down and local growers lost local state support. Today only one cooperative factory is still functional. The Kolkata auction centre is roughly 2,000 km from Kangra leading to higher transportation costs, high warehouse charges and increased labour cost. This made competing with other Indian teas from Assam, West Bengal and Nilgiris, difficult, and Kangra tea planters saw their profits shrink. \u201cKangra tea is exported but not as Kangra tea instead with different names by the buyers and trader company name. Kolkata takes tea for less price and sells for good price and even has export base,\u201d points out Verma. ***** \u201cI need around 1,400 kilos of manure for the garden, and this costs me around Rs 20,000,\u201d said Rajinder. Earlier the state government gave 50 per cent subsidy on the manure, but he says that has stopped in the last 5 years and no one is clear as to why, including the state department. Tea is a labour-intensive crop and the need for workers is between April till October for plucking and then from November onwards for pruning.

And during 2022 harvest from April to October, a time when the hillsides are usually populated with workers, one could hardly locate anyone.

In 2022 the family could not rely on savings, said Rajinder.

Meanwhile we have rushed to make a home for a foreign species \u2013 a majestic five-year plan to spend Rs. 224 crore on bringing African cheetahs to India. The outlay covers flying them in special aircrafts, building secure enclosures, hi-quality cameras, and observation watchtowers. Then there is the tiger whose population is increasing and its budgetary allocation stands at a generous Rs.300 cr in 2022. ***** An imposing member of the avian species, the Great Indian Bustard stands a metre tall and weighs around 5-10 kilograms. It lays only one egg a year, and in the open. The increasing population of feral dogs in the area has put bustard eggs at risk. \u201cThe situation is grim.

It was a humid summer evening, and their village in Yavatmal district was slowly fading into the twilight. He had set out two dinner plates for his father and himself in their dimly-lit hut \u2013 two neatly folded rotis, lentils and a bowl of rice. But his father, Ghanshyam, took one look at the plate and lost his cool. Where were the diced onions? His reaction was out of proportion, according to 25-year-old Vijay, but quite in character at that time. \u201cHe had been cranky for a while,\u201d he says sitting on a plastic chair in the open space outside their one-room hut in Akpuri village in Maharashtra. \u201cLittle things would set him off.\u201d Vijay did go back to the kitchen and sliced the onions for his father. But an unpleasant argument broke out between the two after dinner. Vijay went to bed that night with a sour taste in his mouth. He had hoped to make up with his father the next morning. But the morning did not come for Ghanshyam. The 59-year-old farmer consumed pesticides that night. He passed away before Vijay woke up. It was April 2022. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02-IMG_20221209_113218-PMN.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02-IMG_20221209_113218-PMN.height-1120.jpg\" style=\" height:680px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N. Vijay Marottar outside his home in Akpuri in Yavatmal district. What he regrets the most is the last conversation he had with his father, who took his own life in April 2022 Nine months after his father\u2019s death as he speaks to us, Vijay still hopes to rewind the clock and undo that unpleasant conversation between them on that fateful night. He tries to hold on to Ghanshyam\u2019s image as a loving father and not the anxiety-ridden man he had become in the few years just before his death. His mother, Ghanshyam's wife, had passed away two years ago. His fathers\u2019 anxiety had a lot to do with the family\u2019s five acres of farmland in the village, where they traditionally cultivated cotton and tur . \u201cThe last 8 to 10 years have been particularly bad,\u201d says Vijay. \u201cThe weather has been increasingly unpredictable. We have a late monsoon and a prolonged summer. Every time we plant the seeds, it is like throwing the dice.\u201d That uncertainty made Ghanshyam, a farmer for 30 years, suddenly unsure of his abilities to do the only thing he knew well. \u201cFarming is all about timing,\u201d says Vijay. \u201cBut you can no longer get it right because the weather patterns keep changing. Every time he planted the crop, a dry spell followed, and he took it personally. When it doesn\u2019t rain after sowing, you must decide whether or not to go for the second round,\u201d he adds. The second round of sowing doubles the basic production cost, but one hopes for a harvest that would still deliver returns. Most of the time, it doesn\u2019t. \u201cIn one bad season,\u201d says Vijay \u201cwe\u2019d lose anywhere between 50,000 to 75,000 rupees.\u201d Climate change has led to variations in temperature and precipitation, reducing farm income by 15-18 per cent for irrigated areas, according to the OECD\u2019s Economic Survey of 2017-18 . The losses, the survey states, could be as high as 25 per cent in non irrigated areas. Ghanshyam, like most small farmers in his region of Vidarbha, could not afford expensive irrigation methods and relied entirely on a good monsoon, often inconsistent. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t drizzle anymore,\u201d says Vijay. \u201cThere is either a dry spell or flooding.

Two years before Ghanshyam's death in May 2020 his wife Kalpana died at 45 of a sudden heart attack. She was also under duress with their worsening financial condition Alcohol abuse is a symptom of depression, according to Praful Kapse, 37, a psychiatric social worker based in Yavatmal. \u201cMost of the suicides have an underlying mental condition,\u201d he says. \u201cIt goes untraced because farmers don\u2019t know where to get help for it.\u201d Ghanshyam\u2019s family saw his worsening struggle with hypertension, anxiety and stress before he finally ended his life. They had no clue what to do. He wasn\u2019t the only one in the house struggling with anxiety and stress. Two years ago in May 2020 his wife Kalpana, all of 45 years old with no prior health condition, had died of a sudden heart attack. \u201cShe looked after the farmland and the household as well. And because of the losses, it had become difficult to feed the family. She was tense because of our worsening financial situation,\u201d says Vijay. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other reason.\u201d Kalpana\u2019s absence made it worse for Ghanshyam. \u201cMy father was lonely and went into a shell after she died,\u201d says Vijay. \u201cI tried talking to him, but he would never share his feelings. I guess he was just trying to protect me.\u201d The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), fear and depression are more prevalent in rural regions suffering from extreme weather events and unpredictable climates, argues Kapse. \u201cFarmers don\u2019t have any other source of income,\u201d he says. \u201cStress, when untreated, converts into distress, eventually leading to depression. At an initial stage, depression can be treated with counselling. But one needs medication at later stages, when suicidal thoughts creep in,\u201d he adds. But in India the lag in crisis-intervention in cases of mental disorders is at 70 to 86 per cent, according to The National Mental Health Survey of 2015-16. Even after the passing of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 , which came into force in May 2018, access to and provision of necessary services to people struggling with a mental disorder remain a challenge. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/06-IMG_20221209_104446-PMN.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/06-IMG_20221209_104446-PMN.height-1120.jpg\" style=\" height:760px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N.

Seema in her home with the cotton salvaged from her harvest The Mental Healthcare Act 2017 meant that Seema\u2019s family should have had good quality and quantity of counselling and therapy services, half-way homes, sheltered and supported accommodations available to them and within easy reach. At the community level, the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) introduced in 1996, had mandated every district to have a psychiatrist, a clinical psychologist, a psychiatric nurse and a psychiatric social worker. In addition, the community health centre at the taluk level should have had a fulltime clinical psychologist or a psychiatric social worker. But in Yavatmal the MBBS doctors at the Primary Health Centres (PHC) are the ones who identify people with mental health issues. Dr. Vinod Jadhav, DMHP coordinator for Yavatmal, accepts the lack of qualified staff at the PHC. \u201cOnly when the case can\u2019t be handled at their [MBBS doctor] level, can there be a referral to the district hospital,\u201d he says. If Seema were to know and avail of the counselling services at the district headquarters, some 60 kilometres away from her village, she would have to be prepared to take an hour-long bus ride each way, not to mention the expense. \u201cIf the help is an hour-long bus ride, it discourages people from pursuing it because you need recurring visits,\u201d says Kapse. This already adds to the primary challenge of just getting people to admit that they need help. Jadhav says his team under DMHP conducts an outreach camp annually in each of Yavatmal\u2019s 16 taluks to identify people struggling with mental health issues. It\u2019s better, he says, \u201cto reach out to people where they are, instead of asking them to come to us. We don\u2019t have enough vehicles or funding, but we do as much as we can.\u201d Funds sanctioned by both governments for the state\u2019s DMHP total almost Rs. 158 crore across three years. The Maharashtra government though, spent barely 5.5 per cent of that budget \u2013 roughly Rs. 8.5 crore. The likelihood of the many Vijays and Seemas ever coming across such a camp in unlikely, given the shrinking budget of Maharashtra\u2019s DMHP. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/07-parth-story-data-slides-1-PMN.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/07-parth-story-data-slides-1-PMN.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:510px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N.

He was at home when the first one struck in 2018. His wife, Gabhiben rushed him to a hospital. In April 2022, he was steering a fishing trawler in the Arabian Sea when he suddenly experienced severe chest pains. One of his co-workers took over the wheel and the other nervously helped him lie down. They were about five hours from the shore. Jeevanbhai held out for over two before passing away. Gabhiben\u2019s worst fear had come true. When Jeevanbhai decided to resume fishing a year after the first heart attack, she wasn\u2019t too thrilled about it. She knew it was risky. So did Jeevanbhai. \u201cI told him not to,\u201d Gabhiben says, sitting in her dimly-lit hut in the small coastal town of Jafrabad in Gujarat\u2019s Amreli district. But like most people in the town, 60-year-old Jeevanbhai knew no other work except fishing, which earned him about Rs. 2 lakh every year. \u201cHe had been in the business for 40 years,\u201d says Gabhiben, 55. \u201cWhen he rested for a year after the heart attack, I worked as a labourer [drying fish of other fisherfolk] to keep our household barely afloat. When he thought he had recovered, he decided to go back to work.\u201d Jeevanbhai worked on a trawler owned by one of the bigger fishermen in Jafrabad. For eight months of the year \u2013 barring the monsoon season \u2013 workers take these trawlers into the Arabian Sea for stretches of 10-15 days each. They carry enough water and food to last a couple of weeks. \u201cIt is never safe to be far out in the sea for days with no access to emergency services,\u201d says Gabhiben. \u201cAll they have is a first-aid kit. For a heart patient, it is riskier.\u201d <img alt=\"Gabhiben holding a portrait of her late husband, Jeevanbhai, at their home in Jafrabad, a coastal town in Gujarat\u2019s Amreli district\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02-IMG_20221015_172409-PMN-Amrelis_fisherf.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02-IMG_20221015_172409-PMN-Amrelis_fisherfol.height-1120.jpg\" style=\" height:750px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N.

It contributes to 20 per cent of the country's marine production. Over five lakh people in the state, across more than 1,000 villages, are engaged in the fisheries sector, according to the website of the Commissioner of Fisheries. Most of these people are completely cut off from medical services during the four months or so that they spend at sea each year. Every time Jeevanbhai set off to sea after his first heart attack, Gabhiben would experience stress and anxiety.

Rampant industrial pollution across the coastline has a terrible impact on the marine ecosystem, says Usman Gani, secretary of National Fishworkers Forum. \u201cIt ensures that the fish steer clear of the coast, forcing fisherfolk to go deeper,\u201d he says. \u201cThe further they go, the more critical the emergency services become.\u201d According to the State of Environment Report (SOE), 2013 , Gujarat\u2019s coastal districts are home to 58 major industries, which include chemicals, petrochemicals, steel and metals, among others. There are 822 and 3156 mining and quarry leases, respectively. Since the report came out in 2013, activists believe these numbers would have risen substantially. The report further points out that over 70 per cent of power generation projects in the state are concentrated in its 13 coastal districts, while the rest of the 20 districts host the remaining 30 per cent. \u201cThe industries often flout environmental norms. Everybody dumps their effluents in the sea either directly or through rivers,\u201d says Rohit Prajapati, a Baroda-based environmental activist. \u201cGujarat has as many as 20 polluted rivers. Many of them merge into the Arabian Sea.\u201d In the name of development along the coast, Gani says, the state has disturbed the mangrove cover as well. \u201cMangroves protect the coast and provide fish with a safe space to lay their eggs,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut wherever commercial industries have come up along the Gujarat coast, mangroves have been cut.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cae84ff-7e6b-4bf1-b6de-a0bc8df5e6f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cae84ff-7e6b-4bf1-b6de-a0bc8df5e6f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/amrelis-fisherfolk-wait-for-a-lifeline/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nParth M.N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Amreli\u2019s fisherfolk wait for a lifeline", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/amrelis-fisherfolk-wait-for-a-lifeline/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nParth M.N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "c79ed996d9aeef5f5cdf166043ee06b917465b2aec7290b624486521f96acdb5"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bfd053a-27bd-4cd3-b158-76ee48dc6acb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/amrelis-fisherfolk-wait-for-a-lifeline/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nParth M.N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "7a77577a54b47f8f8edd93350e1763ca8ecab299e132312b263b16b5614f4f8c"}}, "hash": "5e0e980303db4e44c4c91c5de02fab13fc3aa0b37f0cc423caf8da288c3230e4", "text": "The fish won\u2019t come to the coast in the absence of mangroves.\u201d <img alt=\"Jeevanbhai Shiyal on a boat parked on Jafrabad's shore where rows of fish are set to dry by the town's fishing community (right)\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/05a-IMG_20221015_162432-PMN-Amrelis_fisher.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/05a-IMG_20221015_162432-PMN-Amrelis_fisherfol.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:430px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N. <img alt=\"Jeevanbhai Shiyal on a boat parked on Jafrabad's shore where rows of fish are set to dry by the town's fishing community (right)\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/05b-IMG_20221015_180708-PMN-Amrelis_fisher.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/05b-IMG_20221015_180708-PMN-Amrelis_fisherfol.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:430px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N.

There was a time when she and her husband went there every day, to cultivate the food that they would consume during the year \u2013 bajra , moong and jowar . The farm was their main source of sustenance until the calamitous floods in Gujarat in 2017, which destroyed their patch of land. \u201cOur diet changed after that,\u201d says Bhanuben, 35. \u201cWe had to start buying the crops that we used to grow in our farm.\u201d Half an acre of bajra in her farmland would yield about four quintals (400 kilos) of the pearl millet. If she were to buy it now, the same quantity would cost her close to Rs. 10,000 at the mandi . \u201cEven taking inflation into account, our [input] costs to cultivate half an acre of bajra would be half of the market rate,\u201d she says. \u201cThe calculation for other crops is similar. The price is double for every crop [we used to grow].\u201d Bhanuben, her husband Bhojabhai, 38, and their three children live in Totana village of Banaskantha\u2019s Kankrej taluka. When they still tilled their land, Bhojabhai would also work as an agricultural labourer to earn an income. But he\u2019s had to work as a labourer full time since 2017 \u2013 in farms nearby and at construction sites in Patan, 30 kilometres away. \u201cHe is out looking for work even now. He earns about 200 rupees a day when he finds work,\u201d says Bhanuben. Suhana, Bhanuben and Bhojabhai\u2019s youngest child, was born the same year as the ruinous floods. Caressing her forehead, Bhanuben says she can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been five years already. Many districts of Gujarat, including Banaskantha, Patan, Surendranagar, Aravalli and Morbi, recorded extremely heavy rainfall in July 2017. The deluge was brought on by low-pressure systems of both Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal that had formed at the same time. It was a rare phenomenon. According to a report of National Disaster Management Authority , it was the highest rainfall that the area had received in 112 years. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02a-IMG_20220912_120446-PMN-We_must_fill_o.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02a-IMG_20220912_120446-PMN-We_must_fill_our_.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:520px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02b-IMG_20220912_121402-PMN-We_must_fill_o.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02b-IMG_20220912_121402-PMN-We_must_fill_our_.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:520px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N.

She was one of 37 children with malnutrition out of 320 \u2013 all under five years of age \u2013 who were surveyed in the village. \u201cData of the children\u2019s height, weight and age were collected and analysed,\u201d says Mohan Parmar, an activist with Navsarjan Trust, a human rights organisation in Gujarat that had conducted the study across Banaskantha district.

The note, which draws data from National Family Health Survey 2019-21 ( NFHS-5 ), shows that out of 23 lakh (2.3 million) under-five children who were underweight in Gujarat, 17 lakhs were in Banaskantha. The district has 15 lakh children who are stunted (short for their age) and close to 1 lakh kids who are wasted (low weight for their height) \u2013 6.5 per cent and 6.6 per cent of the state\u2019s total respectively. One of the fallouts of poor nutrition is anaemia, which is highest in Gujarat among all the states of India: 80 per cent. About 2.8 lakh children under five years are anaemic in Banaskantha. Without access to sufficient food, the health of children like Suhana and their families are at risk. And extreme events triggered by climate change are making a grave situation worse. The \u2018 Gujarat State Action Plan on Climate Change \u2019 identifies extremes in temperature and rainfall, and sea-level rise, as the \u201cmain climate change risks\u201d. In the last decade, increasingly erratic rainfall patterns and flash floods have created new challenges for local people, says the ANTICIPATE research project that\u2019s studying droughts and floods in India.

How can you get a proper harvest in these circumstances?\u201d The total crop area of foodgrains (cereals and pulses) in Gujarat declined from 4.9 million to 4.6 million (49 lakh to 46 lakh) hectares in the decade of 2010-11 to 2020-21. And though the area under rice cultivation increased by almost 100,000 hectares, cereals like wheat, bajra and jowar lost ground in this period. In Banaskantha, the crop area under bajra , the cereal grown most in the district, reduced by almost 30,000 hectares. Overall, production of cereals \u2013 mainly millets and wheat \u2013 in Gujarat fell 11 per cent during the decade, while pulses grew 173 per cent.

Villagers say the ritual was almost six decades old. It was the kind of healthy competition that reaped handsome rewards for everyone involved: some farmers would grow as much as 80,000-100,000 kilos per acre, almost 1.5 times the normal harvest. That ritual came to an abrupt end in August 2019 following a flood that left several parts of the village submerged for almost 10 days, damaging much of its sugarcane crop. Two years later, in July 2021, heavy rains and floods once again caused massive destruction to Khochi\u2019s sugarcane and soyabean crops. \u201cNow, farmers don\u2019t compete; rather, they pray that at least half of their sugarcane survives,\u201d says Geeta Patil, 42, a tenant farmer and resident of Khochi. Geeta, who once believed she had learnt all the techniques to increase sugarcane production, lost more than 8 lakh kilos of sugarcane in the two floods. \u201cSomething has gone wrong,\u201d she says. She hadn\u2019t accounted for climate change. \u201cThe rainfall pattern has changed completely [since the 2019 floods],\u201d she says. Until 2019 she had a set routine. After every sugarcane harvest, typically around October-November, she would cultivate a different crop \u2013 soyabean, bhuimug (groundnut), different varieties of rice, s halu (hybrid sorghum) or bajra (pearl millet) \u2013 to ensure that the soil retained its nutrients. There was a fixed, and familiar, rhythm to her life and work. Not anymore. \u201cThis year [2022], the monsoon was late by a month. But when it started raining, the fields were almost flooded within a month.\u201d Large tracts of fields remained submerged for almost two weeks as it rained heavily in August; farmers who had just cultivated sugarcane reported extensive losses as excess water caused stunting and damage to the crops. The panchayat even issued warnings asking people to vacate their homes in case the water level rose further. <img alt=\"Geeta Patil was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism after the 2021 floods.

But, October brought unprecedented rains (people in the region describe it as 'dhagfuti' or cloudburst) \u2013 which, according to a report in the Times of India , destroyed close to a thousand hectares of farmland in 78 villages of Kolhapur district alone. \u201cWe lost almost half the rice,\u201d says Geeta, adding, even the sugarcane that withstood the heavy rain will see less yield. Her woes don\u2019t end there. \u201cAs tenant farmers, we have to give 80 per cent of the produce to the landowner,\u201d she points out. Geeta and her family cultivate sugarcane on four acres of land. During normal times, the output would be at least 320 tonnes. Of this, they could keep only 64 tonnes while the rest went to the land owner; 64 tonnes roughly translate to Rs. 179,200 for 15 months of hard work by at least four members of the family.

The village, in Karvir taluka, is usually one of the first villages to drown when the water level rises. Research conducted with 374 heads of families in five flood-affected districts of Kerala four months after the 2019 floods in the state found that those who had experienced two floods demonstrated higher learned helplessness (passive acceptance of a negative situation owing to previous exposure to a similar situation) than those who had experienced a single flood. \u201cSpecial attention must be given to the victims of frequent natural calamities to prevent negative psychological consequences,\u201d the paper concluded. In the villages of Kolhapur \u2013 and indeed for the 833 million people who live in rural India (Census 2011) \u2013 accessing mental health care is easier said than done. \u201cWe have to refer patients with mental health issues to the district hospital. However, not everyone can afford to travel that far,\u201d says Dr. Panhalkar. Rural India has a mere 764 district hospitals and 1,224 sub-district hospitals (Rural Health Statistics, 2020-21), where psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are appointed. \u201cWe need mental health care professionals at least at the primary health centres, if not the sub-centres,\u201d the doctor adds.

Yet, within three months of the 2019 floods, Shivbai was diagnosed with hypertension. \u201cEveryone in the village was surprised, especially because she is someone who is known to never be stressed,\u201d says Shubhangi, who took it upon herself to find out what had led a happy-go-lucky woman to this. Thus began her extensive conversations with Shivbai, sometime in early 2020. \u201cAt first, she wouldn\u2019t share her problems; she would smile all the time,\u201d remembers Shubhangi. However, Shivbai\u2019s deteriorating health, including dizzy and feverish spells, indicated that all was not well. After months of conversations, the ASHA worker finally discovered that the recurring floods were to blame for Shivbai\u2019s condition. The floods of 2019 wrecked Shivbai\u2019s kaccha house, a semi-permanent structure built partly with bricks and mostly with dried sugarcane leaves, jowar (sorghum) stalk and straw. Her family then spent around Rs. 1 lakh to build a tin shanty which they hoped would survive another flood. To make matters worse, there has been a steady decline in the family\u2019s income due to a sharp drop in the number of working days. From mid-September to nearly the end of October 2022 Shivbai couldn\u2019t find work as the fields remained submerged and inaccessible; besides, with their crops damaged, farmers found it unviable to hire labour. \u201cFinally, I worked for three days in the fields before Diwali (the last week of October), but the rains returned and took that work away too,\u201d she says. With her income dwindling, Shivbai is unable to follow her treatment. \u201cMany times, I\u2019ve had to skip medicines because I didn\u2019t have enough money,\u201d she says. <img alt=\"ASHA worker Maya Patil spends much of her time talking to women in the community about their health\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/08-IMG_4376-SJ.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/08-IMG_4376-SJ.height-1120.jpg\" style=\" height:630px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain ASHA worker Maya Patil spends much of her time talking to women in the community about their health var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); Arjunwad\u2019s community health officer (CHO), Dr. Angelina Baker, says there is a spike in the number of people suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as hypertension and diabetes, over the last three years.

The additional mental strain caused by her precarity worsens her hyperthyroidism. The land suffers, too. Shirol\u2019s agriculture officer, Swapnita Padalkar, says that 9,402 hectares (23,232 acres) of land in the taluka were found to be saline in 2021. Uncontrolled use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, improper irrigation practices, and monocropping are some of the reasons for this, she explains. <img alt=\"Farmers in the area are increasing their use of pesticides to hurry crop growth before excessive rain descends on their fields\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/13-IMG_0802-SJ.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/13-IMG_0802-SJ.height-1120.jpg\" style=\" height:630px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain Farmers in the area are increasing their use of pesticides to hurry crop growth before excessive rain descends on their fields var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); <img alt=\"Saline fields in Shirol; an estimated 9,402 hectares of farming land were reported to be saline in 2021 owing to excessive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/14-IMG_0690-SJ.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/14-IMG_0690-SJ.height-1120.jpg\" style=\" height:630px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain Saline fields in Shirol; an estimated 9,402 hectares of farming land were reported to be saline in 2021 owing to excessive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); Since the 2019 floods, many farmers in Kolhapur\u2019s Shirol and Hatkanangle taluka have drastically increased the use of chemical fertilisers to \u201censure they can harvest the produce before the floods,\u201d says Chaitanya. According to Dr. Baker, the Arsenic content in Arjunwad\u2019s soil has increased significantly in recent years. \u201cThe primary reason for this is the increasing use of chemical fertilisers and toxic pesticides,\u201d she says. When the soil gets poisoned, can people be far behind? \u201cAs a result [of soil toxicity], there are 17 cancer patients in Arjunwad alone, excluding those in terminal stage,\u201d she says. These include breast cancer, leukemia, cervical cancer, and stomach cancer. \u201cWhile chronic illnesses are on the rise, many people don\u2019t even consult a doctor despite the symptoms,\u201d she adds. Khochi-based agricultural labourer Sunita Patil, in her late 40s, has been experiencing muscle and knee pain, fatigue and dizziness since 2019. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what is causing it,\u201d she says. But she is certain that her stress levels are linked to the rain. \u201cAfter it rains heavily, I find it difficult to sleep,\u201d she says. The fear of another flood keeps her afraid and awake. Fearing high medical costs, Sunita and several other flood-affected women agricultural labourers rely on anti-inflammatory pain-relieving medicines. \u201cWhat can we do? Going to the doctor is unaffordable, so we rely on painkillers that cost much less, around 10 rupees,\u201d she says. While the painkillers temporarily ease their pain, Geeta, Shivbai, Bharti, Sunita, and thousands of others live in perennial state of uncertainty and fear. \u201cWe haven\u2019t drowned yet, but we are drowning in the fear of floods every day,\u201d says Geeta.

She was born in July 2005, a week after the deadly floods that claimed over 1,000 lives and affected 20 million people in Maharashtra. \u201cShe is born during the floods; she will spend most of her time in floods,\u201d people are said to have told her parents. Seventeen-year-old Saniya recalled this again when it started raining heavily in the first week of July 2022. \u201cWhenever I hear paani vaadhat challay [The water level is rising], I fear there might be another flood,\u201d says the resident of Bhendavade village in Hatkanangle taluka of Maharashtra's Kolhapur district. The village and its 4,686 residents have witnessed two devastating floods since 2019. \u201cDuring the floods of August 2019, the water rose to seven feet in our house within just 24 hours,\u201d Saniya remembers. The Mullani family managed to escape just as water started entering their home, but the incident left Saniya with deep trauma. Floods struck their village again in July 2021. This time, the family moved to a flood relief camp outside the village for three weeks, returning home only after it was deemed safe by village authorities. A Taekwondo champion, Saniya\u2019s training to become a black belt has suffered a setback ever since the 2019 floods. She has been experiencing fatigue, restlessness, irritability and increased anxiety for the past three years. \u201cI cannot focus on my training,\u201d she says. \u201cMy training is now dependent on the rain.\u201d <img alt=\"Saniya Mullani (centre), 17, prepares for a Taekwondo training session in Kolhapur\u2019s Bhendavade village\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02a-IMG_4839-SJ-In_Kolhapur_sportswomen_ge.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02a-IMG_4839-SJ-In_Kolhapur_sportswomen_get_t.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain <img alt=\"The floods of 2019 and 2021, which devastated her village and her home, have left her deeply traumatised and unable to focus on her training\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02b-IMG_4753-SJ-In_Kolhapur_sportswomen_ge.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02b-IMG_4753-SJ-In_Kolhapur_sportswomen_get_t.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain Left: Saniya Mullani (centre), 17, prepares for a Taekwondo training session in Kolhapur\u2019s Bhendavade village.

Since August 2019, she has visited the doctor at least 20 times, but dizziness, fatigue, body ache, recurring fever, inability to focus, and a constant feeling of \u201ctension and stress,\u201d refuse to go away. \u201cNow, even the thought of going to the doctor causes nightmares,\u201d she says. \u201cA private doctor charges at least 100 rupees for one visit; then there are costs for medicines, multiple tests and follow-ups,\u201d she says. \u201cIn case there's a need for an intravenous drip, we have to shell out 500 rupees for every bottle.\u201d When the consultations failed to help, one of her friends gave her a solution: \u201c Gapp training karaycha [Just go about your training, quietly].\u201d That didn\u2019t help either. To her frustration, when she spoke to her doctor about her deteriorating health, he simply told her, \u201cDon't stress.\u201d Perhaps the most difficult piece of advice for Saniya to follow, given the uncertainty around how the next spell of rain will behave and how her family will be impacted. Saniya's father, Javed, who owns an acre of land, lost over 100,000 kilos of sugarcane during the 2019 and 2021 floods. Heavy rains and the Warna river in spate claimed most of his produce in 2022 too. \u201cSince the 2019 floods, there is no guarantee that you will reap the fruits of what you sow. Every farmer here has to sow at least twice,\u201d says Javed. This roughly doubles the cost of production, while the returns are sometimes naught, making farming unsustainable. <img alt=\"The floods of 2019 destroyed sugarcane fields (left) and harvested tomatoes (right) in Khochi, a village adjacent to Bhendavade in Kolhapur district\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/04a-IMG_4651-SJ-In_Kolhapur_sportswomen_ge.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/04a-IMG_4651-SJ-In_Kolhapur_sportswomen_get_t.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain <img alt=\"The floods of 2019 destroyed sugarcane fields (left) and harvested tomatoes (right) in Khochi, a village adjacent to Bhendavade in Kolhapur district\"", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83fde859-7ffc-4d74-8369-5ad9afbd821d": {"__data__": {"id_": "83fde859-7ffc-4d74-8369-5ad9afbd821d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/in-kolhapur-athletes-get-that-sinking-feeling/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nSanket Jain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "In Kolhapur, athletes get that sinking feeling", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/in-kolhapur-athletes-get-that-sinking-feeling/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nSanket Jain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "691e2bb2a2e23607726ddb12776718741b3d771d8ef27a1acdbf679955cd34ef"}, "3": {"node_id": "3fa8b2cc-cca7-4849-83d3-c24b0e9d16b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/in-kolhapur-athletes-get-that-sinking-feeling/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nSanket Jain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "a1331f66ee880d1b681012447ab32a2a47662b472739f152fb76f5d36570ddd2"}}, "hash": "4540249fc7eb2bbf104bb4a56cf3e5674f767a7c88b6ce18d4f699e70459cdd5", "text": "class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/04b-IMG_0013-SJ-In_Kolhapur_sportswomen_ge.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/04b-IMG_0013-SJ-In_Kolhapur_sportswomen_get_t.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain The floods of 2019 destroyed sugarcane fields (left) and harvested tomatoes (right) in Khochi, a village adjacent to Bhendavade in Kolhapur district The only way out is to borrow from private moneylenders at exorbitant interest rates, compounding the stress. \u201cAs the monthly repayment date approaches, you will see several people running to the hospital because of stress,\u201d Saniya adds. Mounting debt and the fear of another flood leave Saniya anxious most of the time. \u201cUsually, after any natural disaster, people are not able to put in the desired efforts to achieve their goals. It\u2019s not because they don't want to; they are unable to,\u201d says Kolhapur-based clinical psychologist Shalmali Ranmale Kakade. \u201cThis eventually leads to helplessness, frustration, and several sad emotions, which start affecting their mood and lead to anxiety.\u201d The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has for the first time highlighted that climate change severely affects the mental health of people: \u201cMental health challenges, including anxiety and stress, are expected to increase under further global warming in all assessed regions, particularly for children, adolescents, elderly, and those with underlying health conditions.\u201d ***** Aishwarya Birajdar, 18, saw her dreams swept away by the floods of 2021. After the water receded, the sprinter and Taekwondo champion from Bhendavade spent over 100 hours across 15 days cleaning her house. \u201cThe stench just wouldn't go; the walls looked as if they could collapse anytime,\u201d she says. It took around 45 days for life to regain some sense of normalcy. \u201cIf you skip a day's training, you don't feel good,\u201d she explains. Making up for 45 days of lost training meant she had to work harder. \u201c[But] My stamina has fallen drastically because we are supposed to train double while eating half the food. This is unsustainable and causes a lot of tension,\u201d she says. <img alt=\"Sprinter and Taekwondo champion Aishwarya Birajdar (seated behind in the first photo) started experiencing heightened anxiety after the floods of 2021.

In the last two decades (2000-2019), India experienced an average of 17 flood events every year, making it the world's worst flood-affected country after China. For more than a decade, rainfall across many parts of Maharashtra has been increasingly erratic, especially in Kolhapur district. Just in October this year, 7.5 lakh hectares in 22 districts of the state were affected by natural disasters. The area includes agricultural crops, fruit crops, and vegetables. According to the state's Department of Agriculture, in 2022, it rained 1,288 mm until October 28 in Maharashtra \u2013 120.5 per cent of the average rainfall .

So, we must be extremely careful and act quickly because we are the first to get affected.\u201d However, there is a major gap that needs addressing: the lack of adequate healthcare data that connects climate change with rising illnesses in the region.

It was greener and the grass was also good,\u201d says Chhering Angdui, a herder and farmer in Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh. The 43-year-old lives in Langza, a village situated 14,500 ft above sea level and home to 158 people ( Census 2011 ). A majority of them are from the Bhot community listed as scheduled tribe in the state. Residents of the village are largely engaged in farming, livestock rearing and hospitality for tourists who visit Spiti. In late July 2021, we met Chhering and a few herders in Langza tending to their livestock of cattle, sheep and goats. They spoke about having to travel greater distances just to find grass for their animals. \u201cNow it snows less here in the mountains. It doesn\u2019t rain much here either so not much grass grows now,\u201d Chhering says, \u201cThis is why we have to take the animals to further heights for grazing.\u201d Watch the video: In search of grass Spiti lies in the north-eastern part of Himachal Pradesh and is home to many high-altitude valleys of several rivers. The region has a cold desert-like environment which attracts tourists from the rest of India \u2013 especially during the hot summer months. Visitors can also catch a glimpse of the Milky Way galaxy visible in the clear night skies up here. The herder's story told in this film shows us how erratic snowing patterns have impacted the lives and livelihoods of Chhering and his fellow herdsmen. \u201cWe [villagers] have been thinking that in the coming years something will happen and the bhed bakria [sheeps and goats] here will go extinct because we don\u2019t have much grass left. Where will we get it from?\u201d he asks, worry apparent across his face. <img alt=\"Langza village is situated at an altitude of 14,500 ft above sea level in Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh.

Around these parts of Maharashtra, it is called halki jameen or shallow land.

From the canopy, Champat, an Andh tribal farmer in mid-40s, must have had a full view of his farm \u2013 and the unending spectre of loss, stunted plants sans bolls, and knee-high pigeon pea plants. He must have instinctively known that in two months, when harvest began, these fields would yield nothing. He had outstanding loans and the family\u2019s daily expenses to be taken care of.

Then, he shouted out to his cousin working on the opposite field, vigorously waving the empty can as if to bid goodbye before he fell to the ground. He died instantly. \u201cI dropped everything and rushed to him,\u201d recalls Champat\u2019s uncle Ramdas Jangle, 70, who was working on the adjoining farm, another infertile piece of rocky land, when the incident took place. He was declared \u2018brought dead\u2019 after relatives and villagers managed to arrange for a vehicle to take him to a rural hospital 30 kilometres from the village. ***** Ninganur, an obscure village in the Umarkhed tehsil of Yavatmal in Maharashtra\u2019s western Vidarbha region, is inhabited mostly by small or marginal Andh tribal farmers, with subsistence living and shallow lands. It is also where Champat lived and died. In the last two months Vidarbha has witnessed a spate of farmer suicides following a disastrous wet-drought in the wake of incessant, heavy rains through July and mid-August. \u201cFor almost three weeks, we did not see the sun,\u201d says Ramdas.

With almost a month to go before monsoon recedes, the region had already received over 1100 mm rain between June and September 10, 2022 (compared to an average 800 mm rainfall recorded in the same period in previous years). This is turning into an exceptionally wet year. But that figure does not reveal the variations and fluctuations. June was almost dry.

The result is acute distress of the kind that drove Champat to take his own life. <img alt=\"Fields damaged after extreme rains in July and mid-August in Shelgaon village in Nanded.\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/DSC04317.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/DSC04317.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:420px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Jaideep Hardikar <img alt=\"Large tracts of farms in Chandki village in Wardha remained under water for almost two months after the torrential rains of July\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/Ed-DSC04387.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/Ed-DSC04387.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:420px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Jaideep Hardikar Left: Fields damaged after extreme rains in July and mid-August in Shelgaon village in Nanded.

The fortnight between August 25 and September 10 alone saw close to 30 farmer suicides in Vidarbha, he says, blaming extreme rain events and economic distress for driving more than a thousand farmers to suicide since January 2022. Among those who ended their lives are two brothers from a village in Yavatmal, who died by suicide a month apart from each other. \u201cNo amount of help will really help; this year\u2019s devastation is really bad,\u201d Tiwari says. ***** Their fields inundated and crops destroyed, a large number of small farmers in Maharashtra are looking at an extended period of distress ahead. The office of the Agriculture Commissioner of Maharashtra estimates that around two million hectares of farmland across Vidarbha, Marathwada and north Maharashtra have been ruined by this season\u2019s wet drought. Kharif is practically lost, farmers across the region say. Soyabean, cotton, pigeon pea \u2013 every major crop has suffered. For dry-land areas that rely primarily on the kharif crop, this year\u2019s devastation could be excruciating. Villages along the rivers and rivulets \u2013 such as Shelgaon in Nanded\u2019s Ardhpur tehsil \u2013 bore the brunt of the unprecedented floods. \u201cWe were cut off for a week,\u201d says Shelgaon sarpanch Punjab Rajegore. \u201cOur houses and fields were inundated because of the fury of Uma river that flows along the village.\u201d Uma meets Aasna river a few miles down the village, and together they meet the Godavari near Nanded. All these rivers were overflowing during the heavy rain spell. <img alt=\"Punjab Rajegore, sarpanch of Shelgaon in Nanded, standing on the Uma river bridge that was submerged in the flash floods of July.\"", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80a156f5-49a6-471a-a3a7-4e7d30947f01": {"__data__": {"id_": "80a156f5-49a6-471a-a3a7-4e7d30947f01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/when-it-rains-it-pours-misery/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nJaideep Hardikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "When it rains, it pours misery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/when-it-rains-it-pours-misery/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nJaideep Hardikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "251375b8f725ea97d0649eb0760255087c108d650dce19279c704481ff1ac59f"}, "2": {"node_id": "b71a8481-49e9-4780-986b-bc57a2b374fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/when-it-rains-it-pours-misery/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nJaideep Hardikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "86f9f7c43c550bd8a10e18930fe0c4d24ecaae2a795131d39c42257d9b216b10"}}, "hash": "e19aba46a3b83bc13750612d96fd7d182a19b5c8063d4ea5cbb775ea85d1a9e7", "text": "class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/DSC04329.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/DSC04329.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:420px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Jaideep Hardikar <img alt=\"Deepak Warfade (wearing a blue kurta) lost his house and crops to the July floods.

The loss of cotton crop alone in one village, Chandki, is close to Rs 20 crore \u2014 that is how much money cotton would have brought into just this one village this year under favourable circumstances. The estimate is based on the per acre average productivity of cotton in this part. \u201cNot only have we lost the crop,\u201d says Namdev Bhoyar, 47, \u201cwe [also] won\u2019t be able to recover the money we spent on sowing and other operations thus far. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t a one-time loss,\u201d he warns. \u201cSoil erosion is a long-term (ecological) problem.\u201d <img alt=\"Govind Narayan Rajegore's soybean crop in Shelgaon suffered serious damage.\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/DSC04320.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/DSC04320.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:420px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Jaideep Hardikar <img alt=\"Villages like Shelgaon, located along rivers and streams, bore the brunt of the flooding for over a fortnight in July 2022\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/Ed-DSC04326.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/Ed-DSC04326.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:420px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Jaideep Hardikar Left: Govind Narayan Rajegore's soybean crop in Shelgaon suffered serious damage .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b45586fe-6bcb-4ae7-9f6d-9d98b21fadfd": {"__data__": {"id_": "b45586fe-6bcb-4ae7-9f6d-9d98b21fadfd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/when-it-rains-it-pours-misery/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nJaideep Hardikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "When it rains, it pours misery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/when-it-rains-it-pours-misery/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nJaideep Hardikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "a35460fe588d3c3b84c463e9e2cb9864ee955369dd56afa59ad8b8e835b68a74"}, "2": {"node_id": "42e9f512-70ae-4a1a-9ed7-ccd682adb24e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/when-it-rains-it-pours-misery/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nJaideep Hardikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "fbbe1dc71fd76e35ad6e73e190a63f845644fc212ccfcebade6b4bb1f3bb52da"}}, "hash": "26b91e80275f7db276b6433fb4bba7c8162759692a819a0ee95b0eab3756dc42", "text": "Right: Villages like Shelgaon, located along rivers and streams, bore the brunt of the flooding for over a fortnight in July 2022 var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); While hundreds of thousands of farmers across Maharashtra were reeling under the rains July through August, the state had no functional government in the wake of a revolt in the Shiv Sena that led to the toppling of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.

Inside the living room, the pista green walls are decorated with more flowers, photographs of her family and portraits of Jesus and Mary. Besides the aesthetics, the ample storage in her house gives her a chance to keep her harvest and wait for a good price. Mostly it pays off. The government procurement rate for paddy was Rs. 19.40. Whereas the local commission agent only offered 13. \u201cI sold two quintals [200 kgs] to the government. Why can\u2019t they buy chilli too?\u201d she asks. Every chilli farmer would appreciate a steady, good price, she argues. \u201cUnlike paddy, chilli can\u2019t take much rain or standing water. This year, it rained when it shouldn\u2019t have \u2013 when the plants germinated, when they were small saplings. And when some rain would have helped \u2013 before the flowering \u2013 there was none.\u201d She didn\u2019t use the word \u2018climate change\u2019 but alluded to the changing pattern of rain \u2013 too much, too quickly, in the wrong season, at the wrong time.

Perhaps as a nod, chilli \u2013 in many Indian languages \u2013 was named after pepper. In Tamil, for instance, pepper is milagu ; chilli became milagai , two vowels bridging continents and centuries. The new spice became ours. And today, India is among the world\u2019s largest producers of dried red chillies, and the leader in the Asia-Pacific region, with 1.7 million tonnes in 2020. That\u2019s nearly five times more than Thailand and China, who are placed second and third. In India , Andhra Pradesh is easily the \u2018hottest\u2019 state, producing 8,36,000 tons in 2021. Tamil Nadu produced just 25,648 tons the same year. Within the state , it is Ramanathapuram that leads the roster: one in every four hectares (15,939 out of 54,231) where chilli is grown in Tamil Nadu is from this district.

Vasuki, 35-year-old farmer from Koneri hamlet in Ramanathapuram block, shares her experiences. Like the other women present, her day begins earlier than the men. She\u2019s up long before 7 am, when she leaves for the market, as she cooks and packs lunch for her school going children. And it is a full 12 hours by the time she returns. In time for more chores. This year\u2019s harvest was a washout, she says. \u201cThere was something wrong and the chillies did not grow at all. Ambuttum kottiduchu (Everything fell).\u201d All she\u2019s brought with her is 40 kilos \u2013 half her harvest \u2013 and she expects another 40 later in the season. To earn a little something, she\u2019s pinning her hopes on the NREGA work. <img alt=\"Vasuki (left) and Poomayil in a yellow saree in the centre waiting for the auction with other farmers\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/06a-_PAL8405AK-In_red_hot_pursuit-Tamil_Na.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/06a-_PAL8405AK-In_red_hot_pursuit-Tamil_Nadu.height-1120.jpg\" style=\" height:610px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 M.

Another man \u2013 all the buyers are men \u2013 clasps his fingers beneath in a secret auction. This secret language is bewildering for an outsider. But by touching the palm, holding the finger, or stroking one underneath, the men communicate numbers. That is, the price they are quoting for the lot. If they wish to register a \u2018no-bid,\u2019 they draw a zero in the middle of the palm. The auctioneer gets a commission for his work \u2013 three rupees per bag. And the trader takes 8 per cent of the total sale, from the farmer, for facilitating the auction. When one buyer\u2019s done, another takes his place opposite the auctioneer, and clasps his fingers under the towel. And another, until everybody has placed their bid, and the highest is announced.

First, you have to pay for the tempo/ other transport from your village to the mandi,\u201d says Gandhirasu. \u201cThere, traders will come and fix the price and take eight per cent as commission charges. Third, there might be a discrepancy in weight, usually to the trader\u2019s advantage. If they reduce even half a kilo per bag, it is a loss. So many farmers complain about this. Further, one person has to spend the whole day at the market without attending to the farm. If the trader has money, they will pay immediately. If not, they will ask them to come again. And lastly, if it a man who goes to the market, he is unlikely to carry lunch. He will eat in a hotel. We calculated everything and found all this takes away 18 per cent of their income.\u201d Gandhirasu runs a farmer producer organization (FPO).

Government figures back his statement. Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Project\u2019s diagnostic report for Ramanathapuram district estimates between 3000 and 5000 farmers migrating every year. It also notes the influence of middle-men, poor water resources, droughts, and lack of cold storage as hurdles to productivity. Water is the game changer, says Gandhirasu. \u201cGo to the agricultural fields in the Cauvery Delta region or Western Tamil Nadu. What do you see?\u201d He pauses for effect. \u201cElectricity poles. Because there are borewells everywhere.\u201d In Ramanathapuram there are far fewer, he says.

Ramanathapuram\u2019s problems however are hardly new. In Everybody Loves a Good Drought (published: 1996) journalist P. Sainath interviewed the celebrated writer (late) Melanmai Ponnuswamy. \u201cContrary to common belief, this district does have good agricultural potential. But who has ever worked with that view in mind?\u201d He went on to add that \u201cmore than 80 per cent of the landholdings in Ramnad are less than two acres in size and uneconomical for many reasons. At the top of the list is a lack of irrigation.\u201d Ponnuswamy was spot on about the potential. In 2018-19, Ramanathapuram district traded in chillies worth 4,426.64 metric tonnes valued at Rs. 33.6 crores. (Paddy which cornered much of the irrigated land, yielded only Rs. 15.8 crores). The son of a farmer himself \u2013 and having practiced agriculture even while doing his master\u2019s degree, \u2013 Gandhirasu recognises chilli\u2019s promise. He quickly dives into the economics of farming it. Typically, a small farmer raises this crop in an acre of land. During the harvest, they hire some labour, and the family usually handles the rest themselves. \u201cIt costs between 25,000 rupees to 28,000 rupees to cultivate mundu chilli in an acre. Harvest costs add another 20,000 rupees. That is, for 10 to 15 people who do four rounds of plucking.\u201d Each labourer can gather a sack of chilli a day. When the plants are dense, it is harder work, he points out. Chilli is a six-month crop. It is sown in October, and there are two bogams (yields): the first fruiting is in Thai , the Tamil month starting from mid-January. The second ends in Chithirai (beginning mid-April). In 2022, unseasonal rainfall disrupted the whole cycle.

The cultivation of chilli is hard because of high production costs, expensive harvesting and intensive labour Gandhirasu calls those numbers a \u2018tsunami.\u2019 He pegs the breakeven price for a kilo of mundu chilli at 120 rupees a kilo. With a yield of 1,000 kilos in an acre, a farmer can see a profit of about 50,000 rupees. \u201cTwo years ago, chilli only fetched 90 or 100 rupees a kilo. Today\u2019s rate is very good. But we can\u2019t bank on a price of 350 per kilo. This is an aberration.\u201d Mundu chilli is a popular crop in the district, he points out. It is a \u2018peculiar\u2019 variety, he says, describing the miniature tomato look perfectly. \u201cRamnad mundu is called sambhar chilli in Chennai. Because the skin is also thick, it makes for a thick puli kozhambu (a tangy tamarind gravy) if you grind it in. And the taste will be fantastic.\u201d There is a huge market for mundu in India and abroad. And online, as a quick search revealed. By mid-May, mundu chilli was selling for a fabulous 799 rupees a kilo on Amazon. This price was after an attractive 20 per cent discount. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to lobby for this,\u201d admits Gandhirasu. \u201cMarketing is a problem.\u201d Besides, not all the members of the FPO \u2013 over 1,000 farmers \u2013 sell their produce to their organisation. \u201cWe can\u2019t generate that kind of funds to buy all their harvests, nor can we store it.\u201d Keeping the crop \u2013 especially if the FPO wishes to wait for better prices \u2013 is made harder because chillies turn black when kept for many months and the powder can be infected with pests. At the government-run cold storage facility \u2013 about 15 kilometres from Ramanathapuram town \u2013 we had walked around the refrigerated yards where sacks of chillies were stored the previous year.

The weekend after our visit in March, they planned to celebrate women\u2019s day. \u201cAfter Sunday mass at the church, we will be handing out cakes,\u201d she smiles. They also conduct prayers for rain, make a Pongal, and serve everybody. Because she\u2019s bold and speaks freely, Adaikalaselvi advises men in the village, if they have a tendency to drink or abuse their wife. She is also an inspiration for other women, driving her bike, and looking after her fields by herself for decades. \u201cYounger women are all smart, they drive bikes, they are well educated. But,\u201d she asks sharply, \u201cwhere are the jobs?\u201d Now that her husband is back, he helps with the farm. And she uses the freed-up time to do other stuff. Like that relating to cotton, which she also grows. \u201cFor the last ten years, I have been removing cotton seed and selling it separately. That goes for 100 rupees a kilogram. Many people buy it from me \u2013 because my seeds sprout very well. Last year I think I sold 150 kilos of seeds.\u201d She opens a plastic bag, and like a magician and his rabbit, pulls out three covers and shows me different grades of seeds. It\u2019s another hat that she wears with little fuss \u2013 that of a seed saver. By late May, her chilli harvest is done, and we speak on the phone about the season. \u201cThe price fell from a high of over 300 to 120 rupees a kilo. It dropped steadily,\u201d she tells me. She only got 200 kilos of chillies from an acre. And paid 8 per cent commission on the sale, plus lost out 1 kilo for every 20, because the traders discounted an extra 800 grams on the 200 gram sack. She broke even this year because the price wasn\u2019t too bad. But the rain, she says, messed with the plants, and shrunk the yield. Nothing, however, shrinks the work of a farmer. Even a poor chilli crop has to be plucked, and dried and bagged and sold. And Adaikalaselvi and her friends\u2019 labour adds taste to every spoonful of sambar\u2026 The reporter would like to thank K. Sivakumar and B. Suganya, of Ramnad Mundu Chilli Production Company, for their help with this story. This research study is funded by Azim Premji University as part of its Research Funding Programme 2020.

Early one December morning, we walk a few kilometres to meet him. His house is, he tells us, a casual \u201cjust over there\u201d. Actually, it was around the flooded lake, past the big tamarind tree, up the eucalyptus hill, down the mango grove, next to the guard dog, the squealing pup and cattle shed. In addition to all the usual problems and headaches any farmer in the country faces, Nagi Reddy has another that bothers him to the point of changing the crops he grows. He\u2019s being hounded by three tough and feared characters: Mottai Vaal, Makhana and Giri. Farmers here have learned that these guys are not to be taken lightly \u2013 figuratively or literally. Not when they weigh between 4,000 and 5,000 kilos each. Locals may be forgiven a lack of enthusiasm in checking out up close the exact weight and height of these marauding elephants. We are in Krishnagiri district that borders two states \u2013 Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. And Nagi Reddy\u2019s hamlet, Vadra Palayam, in Denkanikottai taluk , is not far from the forest, not far from the elephants, and his cement verandah, where we\u2019re seated, is a few metres from his fields. Naganna, as he is called by the villagers, is 86 years old and is a farmer who cultivates ragi (finger millet) a highly nutritious cereal. He is also a witness who recalls every churn in agriculture over the decades \u2013 the good, the bad and often, the terrible. \u201cWhen I was young, aanai (elephants) came a few days during the season, when the scent of ragi attracted them.\u201d Now? \u201cThey come often, they\u2019re used to eating the crops and fruits.\u201d There are two reasons, Naganna explains in Tamil. \u201cAfter 1990, the number of elephants in this forest went up, while the size and quality of the forest came down. So, they show up here for their meals. And just like you\u2019d tell your friends when you go to a nice hotel, they tell theirs,\u201d he sighs and smiles. The ironical comparison amuses him, surprises me. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02a-_PAL6785-AK-In_TN-the_new_ragi_univers.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02a-_PAL6785-AK-In_TN-the_new_ragi_universe_o.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:420px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 M.

Ragi is his favourite. So is jackfruit. If he can\u2019t reach the high branches, he places his front legs on the tree, uses his long trunk and plucks. If the tree is still higher, well, he simply knocks it over.

So it would be safe to assume that millets were important grains for people of the Sangam era (approximately 200 BCE - 200 CE). Among that group , thinai (foxtail millet) features predominantly, followed by varagu (either ragi or kodo millet).\u201d Ragi originated in Uganda, East Africa, writes K.T. Achaya in his book Indian Food: A Historical Companion . It made its way to southern India many thousand years ago and was found \u201cat the Hallur site (1800 BCE) in Karnataka on the river Tungabhadra\u201d and \u201cat Paiyampalli in Tamil Nadu (1390 BCE)\u201d. That\u2019s around 200 kilometres from Naganna\u2019s house. Tamil Nadu ranks second in ragi production in India \u2013 after Karnataka which leads the pack \u2013 and the annual harvests touch 2.745 lakh metric tonnes. Krishnagiri district, where Nagi Reddy\u2019s village is located, alone produces 42 per cent of the state\u2019s ragi .

Krishnagiri district produces 42 per cent of Tamil Nadu\u2019s ragi var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); And yet, finger millet has declined in production and popularity. Unsurprisingly, that decline coincided with the rising popularity of rice and wheat with the green revolution \u2013 which also saw their easy availability through the public distribution system (PDS). Ragi production in the kharif season across India has seen fluctuations in the past few years but was thought to be close to 2 million tons in 2021. However, the first estimates for 2022 suggest a decline. The figure for 2010 was 1.89 million tons. The projection \u2013 first estimates \u2013 for financial year 2022 is around 1.52 million tons. According to the Dhan Foundation, a development organisation that has worked on millets, \u201cdespite their nutritional qualities and climate resilience, the consumption of finger millets in India declined by 47 per cent , while intake of other small millets fell by 83 per cent in the last five decades. In neighbouring Karnataka, the biggest ragi producer in the country, \u201cthe average per capita monthly consumption of finger millet by rural households fell from 1.8 kg in 2004-05 to 1.2 kg in 2011-12.\u201d The crop survived because some communities and geographies continue to grow and eat ragi .

And he thought he\u2019d farm. Only then did he realise how hard cultivation was. He now sticks to lemon trees and horse gram in his two acres. Full time farmers \u2013 who depend on the income \u2013 have it much harder. A combination of adverse policy direction, climate change, poor procurement price, and man-animal conflicts has destroyed the traditional ragi crop, he says. \u201cFinger millets is an excellent example of why the proposed \u2013 and repealed farm laws \u2013 would not have worked,\u201d says Gopa. \u201cThe law said you can sell it to anybody. Take Tamil Nadu. If this were a possibility, farmers would have been growing much more ragi , yes? Why would they smuggle it across to Karnataka, where there is a minimum support price of 3,377 rupees a quintal [against the much lower amount Ananda says he gets here in Tamil Nadu]?\u201d It turns out that people are not able to realise the support price in this part of Tamil Nadu.

Today, ragi is cooked and eaten as a meal, made into snack, and fed to babies. Many regions of Tamil Nadu have their own recipes. In Krishnagiri, it is the ragi mudde (ball), also called kali , as Prabha demonstrates. We are in her kitchen, where the steel stove sits on a cement platform. She pours water into an aluminium kadai (a round pot). And she waits with a wooden stick in one hand, and a cup of ragi flour in the other. Can she speak Tamil? I ask, initiating a conversation. Dressed in salwar kameez , wearing little jewellery and a small smile, she shakes her head. But she understands the language, and answers haltingly in Kannada laced with a little Tamil. \u201cI\u2019ve made this for the last 16 years,\u201d she says. Since she was 15. Her experience shows when the water begins to boil. She adds a big cup of ragi flour into it. It turns into a greyish paste. Holding the pan with tongs, she briskly stirs the mixture with the wooden stick. It\u2019s heavy work \u2013 and calls for skill and stamina. The ragi cooks in a few minutes, the dough rolls around the stick like a ball. It is interesting to reflect, as I watch her, that women here have probably done this for a couple of thousand years. \u201cWhen I was young, this was made in a mud pot, over a wooden fire,\u201d Naganna explains.

Prabha brings us saut\u00e9ed vegetables in a cup. It is a delicious meal and keeps us full for hours. In nearby Bargur, also in Krishnagiri district, ragi is made into rotis by the Lingayat communities. During a long-ago visit, farmer Parvati Siddhaiah had cooked it for me in a rough and ready outdoor stove. Thick and tasty, the rotis kept for many days, and were a staple meal for the family\u2019s herders when they took the cattle and went into the forest to graze. Chennai-based food historian, raconteur and show host Rakesh Raghunathan, describes an heirloom family recipe: ragi vella adai . A sweet pancake, this dish calls for ragi powder, jaggery and coconut milk, and a pinch of cardamom and dry ginger powders. \u201cMy mother's grandmother taught her this adai . It was made in the Thanjavur region, and it was traditionally eaten to break a fast, on the day of the Karthigai Deepam [a traditional festival of lights].\u201d These plump pancakes made with a little ghee are both nourishing and soothing, an ideal post-fast meal. In Pudukottai district\u2019s Chinna Veeramangalam village, the famous chefs of the Village Cooking Channel rustle up a ragi meal: kali with karuvaadu (dried fish) . The USP of their YouTube channel is reviving traditional recipes. \u201c Ragi was cooked and eaten widely until I was seven or eight. Then it vanished, and rice slowly appeared,\u201d Subramanian, 33, a co-founder of the channel, says over a telephone interview.

Subramanian\u2019s grandfather, 75-year-old Periyathambi, supervises mixing ground finger millets with a handful of cooked rice, making it into balls, and dropping them into rice water. This salty version is eaten with dried fish, which are slow roasted over a wood fire, until the skin is charred and flaky. \u201cAn everyday meal would simply be accompanied by shallots and green chillies,\u201d he points out. Subramanian speaks passionately about native varieties of rice and the nutritive value of millets. He and his brothers and cousins impressed Rahul Gandhi on a visit to Tamil Nadu before the 2021 assembly elections. And with each video, their cooking channel spotlights \u2013 and often revives \u2013 dishes that are on the brink of disappearing. ***** Those farmers who keep spraying chemicals donate their profits to the hospitals. Anandramu, ragi farmer in Krishnagiri The disappearance of ragi from the farmlands around Naganna\u2019s hamlet is down to three factors: economics and elephants, and a recent, more pressing one: climate change. The first one is true for all of Tamil Nadu. The input costs for an acre of finger millet varies between 16,000 to 18,000 rupees. \u201cIf there\u2019s rain or elephant raids, everybody is on the look-out for labourers during the harvest, and it adds another 2,000 rupees to the cost,\u201d Ananda explains. \u201cThe selling price in Tamil Nadu is 2,200 rupees for an 80-kilo sack. That\u2019s 27.50 rupees a kilo. You can get up to 15 sacks in a good year \u2013 18, if you use high yield seeds. But,\u201d Ananda warns, \u201cthe cattle don\u2019t care for the stalk of hybrids. They only like the native variety.\u201d And that\u2019s an important rider, because one load of ragi stalk sells for 15,000. And you can get up to two loads from an acre. Farmers with livestock use it to feed their animals. They store it in a heap, and it keeps nicely for over a year. \u201cWe don\u2019t sell the ragi too,\u201d Ananda points out, \u201cuntil we get a good crop the next year. It\u2019s not just us, even our dogs and chickens eat only millets. We need enough to feed everybody.\u201d <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/14a-_PAL7077-AK-In_TN-the_new_ragi_univers.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/14a-_PAL7077-AK-In_TN-the_new_ragi_universe_o.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:390px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 M.

The state has begun distributing millets at the public distribution system outlets in Chennai and Coimbatore. Besides, the 2022 agri budget speech presented by Minister M.R.K. Panneerselvam, mentions millets 16 times (rice and paddy, together, find 33 mentions).

Also, FAO\u2019s declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets \u2013 an idea mooted by India \u2013 might also spotlight \u2018nutri cereals\u2019, including ragi . For Naganna\u2019s family though, this year is going to be a challenge. They have managed to harvest just three sacks from their half-acre allotted to it. The rest was savaged by the rains and wild creatures. \u201cEvery night during the ragi season, we have to go and sleep in the machan [platform erected up in a tree] and keep a watch,\u201d Ananda says.

His father was cheated by his uncle. And Ananda demonstrates the betrayal with a little skit. He takes four steps in this direction and four in the other. \u201cThat\u2019s how he gave us land, by saying so many feet are yours and mine. My father is not educated, he simply agreed. We have registration papers for just four acres.\u201d In reality, they are cultivating more, but cannot file for compensation for any damage other than what occurs on the four acres they officially own. Back in his verandah, he shows us photos and documents. An elephant raid here, a pig raid there. A fallen tree. Trampled crops. His father, tall and forlorn, standing in front of a toppled jackfruit tree. \u201cHow can you make money in agriculture? Can you buy a nice vehicle? Fine clothes? The income is so poor, and this I say as someone with land,\u201d argues Naganna. He has changed into formal clothes: a white shirt, new dhoti, cap, mask and kerchief. \u201cCome with me to the temple,\u201d he tells us. And we are happy to oblige. The festival he was going to was also in Denkanikottai taluk , half an hour away on a \u2018star\u2019 (superior quality) road. Naganna gives us crisp directions. He gives us a commentary on how much the area is changing. The rose farmers have taken out big loans, he says. They fetch between 50 and 150 rupees a kilo, going up during the festive season. The most attractive feature of the rose, from what I hear, is not the colour or fragrance \u2013 but the fact that elephants don\u2019t like to eat them. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/17a-_PAL7210-AK-In_TN-the_new_ragi_univers.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/17a-_PAL7210-AK-In_TN-the_new_ragi_universe_o.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:380px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 M.

The stepway leading to the pond in Dayapur village was broken in places. Meenu slipped and tumbled down the stairs, falling face down. \u201cI had excruciating pain in my chest and stomach,\u201d she recounts in Bengali . \u201cI started bleeding from the vagina. When I went to the bathroom, something slipped out of me and fell to the floor. I noticed a flesh-like substance coming out of me. I tried to pull it out, but I couldn\u2019t extract the whole thing.\u201d A visit to a private clinic in a nearby village confirmed the miscarriage. Meenu, tall, thin, and wearing a smile despite her worries, had irregular menstrual cycles since then, along with acute physical pain and emotional distress. Her village in the Gosaba block of West Bengal\u2019s South 24 Parganas district has a population of about 5,000. Lush with sprawling paddy fields and the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans, it is among only a handful of interior villages in Gosaba that are connected by road. Meenu was bleeding without a break for more than a month after the fall, and that was not the end of her suffering. \u201cSharirik somporke eto byatha kore [sexual intercourse is so painful],\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels as if I am being torn apart.

On suffering vaginal bleeding after the fall, Meenu, who did not study beyond Class 10, decided not to consult the ASHA worker (Accredited Social Health Activist) in Dayapur. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her to know,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause others in my village might have come to know about my miscarriage. Also, I don\u2019t think she would have known what to do.\u201d She and her husband, Bappa Sardar, had not been planning a baby, but she was not using any contraception at the time. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about family planning methods when I got married. Nobody told me. I learnt about them only after I miscarried.\u201d Meenu is aware of the sole woman gynaecologist posted at the Gosaba Rural Hospital, about 12 kilometres from Dayapur, but she was never available. There are two Rural Medical Practitioners (RMPs), unlicensed healthcare providers, in her village. Dayapur\u2019s RMPs are both men. \u201cI was not comfortable disclosing my problem to a man.

Her own village has a small government-run clinic, but she didn\u2019t know about its existence then. \u201cAfter my skin problems worsened, I stopped going to fish,\u201d she says.

Unqualified medical practitioners scare these women of having uterine tumours and subsequently into undergoing a hysterectomy at a private hospital.

For Meenu, Alapi, Basanti and millions of other women in the Sundarbans, sexual and reproductive health problems are compounded by the difficulties in accessing healthcare.

But the neighbourhood appears a bit altered from what I remember of it. There\u2019s no sign of the crumbling old house by the sea, whose coordinates I had saved on my phone the last time I visited Uppada. \u201cOh, that house? It is in the sea now \u2013 there!\u201d says T. Maramma, casually pointing to a wave gushing in from the Bay of Bengal. I vividly remember the old structure that had offered a stunning, yet sombre, backdrop as I photographed Maramma and her family members a few weeks before the nationwide lockdown of March 2020. Perched perilously on a narrow beach, it was the only portion remaining of what used to be a large home where Maramma\u2019s joint family lived until the early years of this century. \u201cIt was a building with eight rooms and three sheds [for animals]. Around a hundred people used to live here,\u201d says Maramma, a small-time local politician in her 50s, who once ran a fish business. A cyclone that hit Uppada just before the 2004 tsunami took away a big chunk of the building, forcing the joint family to move into different houses. Maramma continued to use the old structure for a few more years before shifting to a house nearby. Maramma and her family are not alone; nearly everyone in Uppada seems to have moved home at least once because of the encroaching sea. Their calculations on when to quit a house are based on lived experience and the local community\u2019s instinctive reading of the seas. \u201cWe can sense that the house will go into the sea when the waves start to bulge forward. Then we move our utensils and everything to one side [and start searching for a temporary house to rent]. The old house usually goes [into the sea] within a month,\u201d explains O. Siva. At 14, he has already had to leave one house to escape the sea. <img alt=\"T. Maramma and the remains of her large home in Uppada, in January 2020.

When Maramma\u2019s family moved into their then new home around 50 years ago, it was located far from the beach. \u201cOur legs used to ache a lot when we walked home from the shore,\u201d recalls O. Chinnabbai, Siva\u2019s grandfather and Maramma\u2019s uncle. A deep-sea fisherman in his 70s or 80s, he remembers a time when the stretch leading from their home to the beach was dotted with houses, shops and a few government buildings. \u201cThat was where the shore was,\u201d Chinnabbai points towards a distant horizon where some ships fade into the evening sky. \u201cBetween our new house and the sea, there was a lot of sand too,\u201d Maramma reminisces. \u201cWhen we were children, we would play in the sand mounds and slide through them.\u201d Much of the Uppada of these memories now lies submerged in the sea. Between 1989 and 2018, Uppada\u2019s coastline eroded, on average, 1.23 metres every year; in 2017-18, the erosion was as much as 26.3 metres, says a study by researchers at the Andhra Pradesh Space Applications Centre, Vijayawada.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a0806b0-8633-4ff5-bc31-692114ed88a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a0806b0-8633-4ff5-bc31-692114ed88a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/oh-that-house-thats-in-the-sea-now-there/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nRahul M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "'Oh, that house?

The large stones laid along the shore were meant to protect the land from the encroaching sea var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); \u201cThe coastal erosion at Uppada, a few kilometres north of Kakinada town, is caused mainly by the growth of Hope Island \u2013 scientifically known as a \u2018spit\u2019 \u2013 a 21-kilometre-long linear sand body. That spit grew naturally northward from the mouth of Nilarevu, a distributary of Godavari River,\u201d says Dr. Kakani Nageswara Rao, a retired professor of the department of geo-engineering, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam. \u201cThe waves refracted by the spit are impinging on the Uppada coast, leading to its erosion. Probably initiated more than a century ago, this sand spit more or less attained its present form in the 1950s,\u201d explains the professor, who has been closely studying the coastal forms and processes along the Andhra coast for several decades. Official records dating back to the early 1900s confirm that the Uppada phenomenon was already recognised more than a century ago. The Godavari District Gazetteer of 1907, for example, notes that the sea had eroded more than 50 yards of land at Uppada since 1900 \u2013 in other words, the village lost seven metres of land every year in those seven years. \u201cSince coastal zones in general are very dynamic regions, with the interplay of complex global, regional and local phenomena,\u201d says Dr. Rao, \u201cthe reasons for coastal erosion at Uppada are multidimensional.\u201d Global warming, melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels, besides increased frequency of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, are a few of them. A drastic reduction in sediment loads at the river mouths, caused by burgeoning dams in the Godavari basin, further exacerbates the situation. ***** As its land disappears into the sea bit by bit, Uppada gets recreated in the memory of its people. One of the villagers asks me to watch the Telugu movie Naakuu Swatantram Vachindi for a glimpse of the village that resides in their memories and their stories. I see a different Uppada in the 1975 film: the village and the sea lie at a comfortable distance from each other, a gorgeous sandy beach separating them. The sea and sand, captured in single-frame shots \u2014 the beach was wide enough to allow the crew to shoot from various angles \u2014 form the background to key sequences in the film. <img alt=\"Pastor S.

Chinnabbai, Maramma's uncle, close to where their house once stood var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); Uppena , a Telugu film released in 2021, captures a vastly changed Uppada, with boulders and stones along what used to be the beach, attempting to protect the village from the sea. Unlike in the 1975 film, scenes capturing the village and the sea in a single frame had to settle for bird\u2019s eye-view shots, or diagonal shots, as there was barely any beach to place the camera on. Perhaps the most vicious attack on Uppada\u2019s shoreline in recent times was by Cyclone Gulab in late September 2021, when the sea took in at least 30 houses. In December, Cyclone Jawad severely damaged the newly constructed Uppada-Kakinada road, rendering it unsafe for use. The turbulent sea in the aftermath of Gulab took away the remnants of Maramma\u2019s old family home in early October. It also washed away the home she and her husband were living in. ***** \u201cAfter the cyclone [Gulab] many of us were forced to sleep on the elevated platforms outside other people\u2019s homes,\u201d Maramma\u2019s voice quivers as she recalls the devastation caused in 2021. Since 2004, when the cyclone forced them out of their ancestral home, Maramma and her husband, T. Babai, have lived in two houses \u2013 a rented one first, and then a home of their own. Last year\u2019s cyclone tossed that home into the sea. Today, the couple live in the open on a platform outside a relative\u2019s house in the neighbourhood. \u201cAt one point in time, we were a \u2018 sound-party \u2019 [credit worthy and relatively well-off],\u201d says Maramma.

The rope that binds the stones is also worn out. So, the houses and huts lining the shore have become one with the sea. The fishers along the coastline are living in terror,\u201d they added, requesting that the boulders be replaced with bigger ones. However, according to Dr. Rao, there is little evidence that the boulders can provide a permanent defence against a determined sea; they are at best a makeshift remedy as the sea continues to encroach. \u201cDon\u2019t try to protect property. Protect the beach. The beach protects your property,\u201d he says. And adds that \u201coffshore barriers in the sea \u2013 like the huge stone structures which break the waves off Japan\u2019s Kaike coast \u2013 can help prevent erosion at Uppada.\u201d ***** Even as the sea chips away at it, the village is witnessing changes in its social makeup. In the 1980s, the weaving community \u2013 Uppada is famous for its exquisite handwoven silk sarees \u2013 moved from the edge of the village to its interior parts after the government allotted them some land there. Gradually, the more affluent villagers, mainly belonging to the upper castes, also started moving further away from the sea. But the fishing community, their livelihoods inextricably linked to the sea, had no choice but to stay put. With the upper castes escaping to safer areas, some of the customs and practices associated with the caste system began to weaken; for instance, the fishing community was no longer forced to hand over their catch, free of cost, for upper caste festivities. Slowly, the fishing community started turning to Christianity. \u201cMany joined the religion for their freedom,\u201d says Kruparao, the pastor. Most people here are very poor and belong to social groups originally categorised as Backward Classes. Kruparao remembers experiencing multiple instances of caste humiliation before embracing Christianity. <img alt=\"Poleru and K. Krishna outside their home, in 2019.

We didn\u2019t just survive the pandemic and its lockdowns \u2013 we produced our best work ever. On the very first day of the lockdown last year, the government of India declared the media, both print and electronic, an essential service. That was good. Never had the Indian public needed journalism and journalists more. There were stories to be told on which people\u2019s lives and livelihoods depended. How did the big media houses of this country respond? By sacking 2,000 to 2,500 journalists and over 10,000 non-journalist media workers. So how were they going to tell the big stories? By getting rid of some of their best reporters? Thousands of other mediapersons \u2013 those not retrenched \u2013 had their salaries slashed by anywhere between 40 and 60 per cent. Travel by journalists was strictly curbed, not as a precaution to preserve their health, but to cut costs. And such stories as were done, especially after the first two weeks from March 25, 2020, were largely city or big-town bound. PARI added 11 people to its staff since April 2020, did not impose a single paisa\u2019s pay cut on anyone \u2013 and in August 2020, handed out promotions and increments to almost all our staffers. Apart from our other reporting which remained prolific, PARI \u2013 from when the pandemic began \u2013 published over 270 (mostly multimedia) stories and important documents and reports, on the single theme of livelihoods under lockdown. These stories we brought in from 23 states, from almost every major region of the country, from the villages including those the migrants were returning to, with reporters travelling hundreds of kilometres on whatever transport they could manage during the lockdowns. You\u2019ll find over 65 different reporters\u2019 bylines on these stories. PARI was covering migrant workers for years before the pandemic and did not have to discover them on March 25, 2020. As our readers know, and for others who don\u2019t, PARI is both a journalism platform and a living, breathing archive. We are the largest online repository of articles, reports, folk music, songs, photographs, and films on rural India and one of the biggest repositories of the rural anywhere. PARI\u2019s journalism is based on reporting the everyday lives of everyday people. And on telling the stories of 833 million rural Indians through their voices and lived experience. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02a-ZAL-4315-PS-Give_good_journalism_a_cha.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02a-ZAL-4315-PS-Give_good_journalism_a_chance.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:420px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Zishaan A Latif <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02b-IMG_2691-PS-Give_good_journalism_a_cha.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02b-IMG_2691-PS-Give_good_journalism_a_chance.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:420px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Shraddha Agarwal We at PARI have produced some of our best work during the pandemic-lockdowns, including an ongoing award-winning series on women's reproductive health (left) and detailed coverage of the farmer's protests (right) against the now-repealed farm laws var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); In these first 84 months of our existence, PARI has won 42 awards \u2013 one every 59 days on average.

In one year of existence, PARI Education has published 135 articles (right) by students from 63 locations var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); Launched in just English in December 2014, PARI now publishes in 13 languages almost simultaneously \u2013 and will add more. We believe in parity, that is, any story coming to us in one language has to be published in all 13. We believe Indian languages are at the soul of rural India and that Every Indian language is your language . And we now run the largest translations programme for any journalism website anywhere. Our translators include doctors, physicists, linguists, poets, homemakers, teachers, artists, journalists, writers, engineers, students, and professors. The oldest is 84 and the youngest, 22. Some are based outside of India. Others live in remote locations within the country, with very poor connectivity. PARI is free to access. There is no subscription fee. No articles tucked away behind paywalls. And we carry no advertising at all. There\u2019s already too many media outlets drowning young people in ads, creating artificial needs and wants. Why add to that? Close to 60 per cent of our readers are below the age of 34 \u2013 and nearly 60 per cent of those are in the age group 18-24. As are many reporters and writers and photographers we work with. Our youngest section, PARI Education , has in a single year of existence, moved rapidly ahead on another mandate of ours: creating the textbooks of the future. As many as 95 educational institutions and 17 organisations in the education sector are using PARI as a textbook and as a means to explore and learn about rural India. Of these, over 36 are working with us to create PARI-centred curricula that will get students to engage directly with marginalised people. PARI Education has published 135 reports by students from 63 locations \u2013 on problems in farming, vanishing livelihoods, gender issues and more. Since January 2021, this section has conducted over 120 online talks and workshops in India's top universities as well as in remote rural schools. \u2018Rural\u2019 for PARI is not an idyllic or romanticised Indian countryside, nor a glorified blend of cultural practices, nor even a nostalgic idea of living that needs to be curated and exhibited. PARI's journey is an exploration of the complexities and exclusions on which rural India is built. All of it \u2013 the beautiful and the brilliant, the brutish and the barbaric. PARI itself is an ongoing education for all of us who work in it \u2013 we respect the knowledge and skills that ordinary Indians bring to us. That is one of the reasons why we centre our storytelling around their voices and lived experience of some of the most critical issues of our time. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/04a-IMG_6818-PS-Give_good_journalism_a_cha.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/04a-IMG_6818-PS-Give_good_journalism_a_chance.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:380px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Rahul M.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a48e971-5fff-4c25-85cd-c6e52048708a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a48e971-5fff-4c25-85cd-c6e52048708a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/give-good-journalism-a-chance/", "Author": "\n\n\n\n\nP.

On PARI they can listen to them, see them, hear them explain in their own words what our freedom struggle was really about. We may be a very young media platform of very limited resources \u2013 but we run the biggest fellowships programme in Indian journalism. Our aim is to have a Fellow writing out of and about every one of the 95 (natural-physical and historically evolved) regions \u2013 and from the rural areas within those. Well over half our 30 Fellows so far have been women, and several from minorities and other sections of society conventionally excluded from and by the media.

We are home to the largest collection of songs composed and sung by poor women in any language in the world. That is, the Grindmill Songs Project with 110,000 songs by women in rural Maharashtra and in a few villages in Karnataka. A dedicated team has translated over 69,000 of those songs into English so far. Our coverage of folk arts and music, artists and artisans, creative writing and poetry, means we have built large collections of stories and videos on these from multiple regions across India. We also have perhaps the only archive of 10,000 black and white photographs of the Indian countryside shot across 2-3 decades. These are largely photos of people at work and, occasionally, at leisure. We are very proud of our FACES project that tries to map the facial diversity of this country. These are the faces not of celebrities or netas but of everyday people. The aim is to have such faces from every single district and block of the country. So far the collection has 2,756 faces from 220 districts and 629 blocks across India. These FACES have been shot by 164 photographers including several undergraduate students. Overall, PARI has carried the work of 576 photographers these past seven years. Our unique Library does not loan you books \u2013 it gives them to you for free.

Men, women, children, and cattle too, hurry to get off the boat and go about the day\u2019s business. Having taken shelter elsewhere during the high tide, often with relatives, they are returning home to the island after the waters had receded. The ferry, which takes 40 minutes from mainland Kakdwip to reach the island in the Sundarbans delta, carries such passengers to and fro at least twice a month. However, this routine belies the long struggle of Ghoramara's villagers to survive on their small island located in West Bengal\u2019s South 24 Parganas district. Frequent cyclones, rising sea levels and heavy rains \u2013 markers of climate change \u2013 have made life difficult for Ghoramara\u2019s people . Floods and soil erosion over the decades have turned their isolated homeland into a floating piece of land in the Hooghly estuary. When Cyclone Yaas made landfall in May, Ghoramara, in Sagar block, was among the worst hit areas in the Sundarbans. On May 26, the cyclone along with high tide had breached the island\u2019s embankments and inundated it within 15-20 minutes. The islanders, who had borne the impact of cyclones Amphan (2020) and Bulbul (2019) earlier, faced destruction again. Their homes were ripped out, and entire storehouses of paddy, betel crops and sunflower fields were washed away. Abdul Rauf\u2019s house near Khasimara ghat was destroyed in the cyclone's aftermath. \u201cWe had no food for those three days and survived on rainwater, and were protected by just plastic sheets,\u201d said Rauf, a tailor who works in Kolkata, about 90 kilometres away. When he and his wife fell ill, \u201ceveryone suspected that we had Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cMany had fled the village,\u201d added Rauf. \u201cWe lay there, unable to escape to safety.\u201d It was when the block development officer was informed that Rauf and his wife received medical attention. \u201cThe BDO asked us to reach Kakdwip by any means possible. He made arrangements for an ambulance from there. We had to spend about 22,000 rupees [on medical care].\u201d Rauf and his family have been living in a shelter on the island ever since. Many whose homes were destroyed were moved to temporary shelters. Residents of Mandirtala village are housed at a shelter in Tank Ground near Mandirtala bajar (bazaar), the island's highest point. Some of them set up camp on a narrow road nearby. From Hatkhola, Chunpuri and Khasimara areas of the island, 30 families were temporarily sheltered on Sagar island, to the south of Ghoramara. They have since been allotted land there, to relocate. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/02-28_Abhijit-AC.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Abhijit Chakraborty Rezaul Khan's house in Khasimara was damaged by Cyclone Yaas. He and his family have been rehabilitated in Sagar island Rezaul Khan's family is one of them. His house in Khasimara is in ruins now. \u201cI have to leave the island, but why should I?\u201d he told me on a stormy day, sitting in a dark attic of a mosque that was damaged in the cyclone. \u201cHow can I leave my childhood friend Ganesh Parua?

In the original Hollywood movie, Flik the ant is trying to recruit tough warriors to save thousands of his kin on Ant Island from the bad guys \u2013 marauding grasshoppers. In the unfolding real-life sequel in India, the cast runs to trillions, of whom 1.3 billion are humans. The marauding short-horned grasshoppers \u2013 better known as locusts \u2013 arrived in May this year, each swarm running to millions. They devastated standing crops on close to a quarter of a million acres in Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and, Uttar Pradesh, says the country\u2019s Agriculture Commissioner. These airborne aggressors render national borders irrelevant. Locusts exist across 30 countries and 16 million square kilometres from West Africa to India, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture organisation (FAO). And a small locust swarm \u2013 1 square kilometres with about 40 million members \u2013can eat the same amount of food in a day as 35,000 people, 20 camels or six elephants. Not surprising then that the national Locust Warning Organisation draws its members from defence, agriculture, home affairs, science and technology, civil aviation and communication ministries. Locusts, however, are not the only villains in the emerging script as the delicate balance between millions of insects is thrown into jeopardy. In India, entomologists and Adivasi and other farmers are lining up the bad guys: multiple and sometimes alien species.

Bottom left: 'We are seeing new pests', says Lotan Rajbhopa. Bottom right: When bees are less, flowers and fruit will also be less', says Ranjit Singh It's not just the decline in flowers that\u2019s worrying. \u201cWe are seeing phenological asynchrony \u2013 where the emergence of insects and the emergence of flowers are out of sync,\u201d says Dr. Jayashree Ratnam of the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru. \u201cFor many plants,\u201d says Dr. Ratnam, who is associate director of the NCBS\u2019 wildlife biology and conservation programme, \u201cthe flowering dates have advanced with the earlier advent of spring in temperate zones, whereas pollinators have not always advanced their emergence to the same dates. This means the insects don\u2019t get the food they need at the time they need it. These alterations can be matched to climate change.\u201d And, as Dr. Ratnam puts it, though they relate more directly to our food security, \u201cInsects generally do not invoke the same affection as, say, furry mammals.\u201d ***** \u201cThere is less fruit not just on my guava tree, but on the amla and mahua trees, too. The achar (or chironji ) tree is not fruiting for many years now,\u201d Ranjit Singh Marshkole, 52, tells us in Katiyadana hamlet in MP\u2019s Hoshangabad district. Here, this Gond Adivasi farmer grows wheat and channa on his family\u2019s nine acres near Matkuli village of Pipariya tehsil . \u201cWhen bees are less,\u201d says Ranjit Singh, \u201cflowers and fruit will also be less.\u201d Our food security rests in part on the wings and feet, pincers and antennae, of native insects like ants, bees, flies, wasps, hawk moths, butterflies, beetles and others who assist in pollination. As an FAO bulletin tells us, worldwide there are more than 20,000 species of wild bees alone, plus many other species \u2013 of birds, bats and other animals \u2013 that contribute to pollination. As much as 75 per cent of all food crops and 90 per cent of all wild plants depend on that pollination. And the annual value of crops affected by it globally is pegged at between $235 and $577 billion. Our food security rests in part on the wings and feet, pincers and antennae, of native insects like ants, bees, flies, wasps, hawk moths, butterflies, beetles and others Watch video: \u2018All trees and plants depend on insects to grow\u2019 Apart from their starring role in food crop pollination, insects also help maintain the health of forests as they break down wood and carcasses, turn the soil around and sequester seeds. In India, millions of Adivasis and others live in the 170,000 villages located next to forests where they procure fuel wood and non-timber forest produce that they can use or sell. Further, grazing of much of the country\u2019s livestock population of 536 million depends on forests too. \u201cThe jungle is dying,\u201d Vijay Singh tells us, sitting under the shade of a tree while his buffaloes graze around him. This Gond farmer in his 70s has 30 acres of land here in Singanama village of Pipariya tehsil where he once grew channa and wheat. For some years, he\u2019s let the land lie fallow. \u201cThe rain is either very heavy and runs off quickly, or it barely wets the earth.\u201d And he\u2019s observed the problems insects face. \u201cThere is no water, so where will the ants make their homes?\u201d In the Pachmarhi Cantonment area in Pipariya tehsil , Nandu Lal Dhurbe, 45, shows us a baami [local name for both ant and termite homes) of raised concentric circles. \u201c Baami need soft earth and cool moisture.

So winters which used to be dry and cold are now warmer and wetter, enabling the colonisation of the west Himalaya butterflies by eastern Himalayan species (used to a warm and humid climate). India is a major centre of biodiversity with 2.4 per cent of the earth\u2019s land but 7 to 8 per cent of its species . As of December 2019, insect species in India numbered 65,466, says ZSI\u2019s Dr. Chandra. However, \u201cthis is a conservative estimate. The likely figure is at least 4 to 5 times higher. But many species will become extinct before they can be recorded.\u201d ***** \u201cDeforestation and fragmentation of habitats coupled with climate change are leading to disturbed habitats,\u201d says Dr. Himender Bharti, evolutionary biologist at the Punjabi University, Patiala, who is famous as India\u2019s \u2018Ant Man\u2019. \u201cAnts react to stress on a much finer scale compared to other vertebrates and are widely used to assess landscape disturbance and species diversity.\u201d Dr. Bharti, who heads the department of zoology and environmental sciences at the university, is credited with compiling the first checklist of 828 valid ant species and subspecies in India. \u201cInvasive species,\u201d he warns, \u201care faster at adapting and are displacing native species.

Hyder, a 60-year-old fisherman who lives on the island of Bitra . \u201cWhen I was younger, we could see the corals when the tide was low,\" adds 60-year-old Abdul Khadar, another fisherman on Bitra. \u201cIt was beautiful. Now there is not much left of them. But we need that coral to keep the big waves away.\u201d That coral \u2013 central to the stories, imaginations, lives, livelihoods and ecosystems of the islands of the Lakshadweep archipelago \u2013 is slowly bleaching away, along with many other changes that the fishermen here have been noticing over the decades. \u201cIt\u2019s simple. Nature has changed,\u201d explains Muniyamin K. K. The 61-year-old from the island of Agatti began fishing when he was 22. \u201cThose days, the monsoon arrived at the correct time [in June], but now we can\u2019t tell when it will come. There\u2019s less fish these days. We didn\u2019t have to travel so far out for our catch back then, the shoals were all close by. But now people are gone for days, sometimes weeks, searching for fish.\u201d Agatti and Bitra, around seven hours apart by boat, are home to some of the most skilled fishermen in the Lakshadweep, India\u2019s smallest union territory situated in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Kerala. \u2018Lakshadweep\u2019 in both Malayalam and Sanskrit means a hundred thousand islands. Reality, in our era, presents us with just 36, which together cover barely 32 square kilometres.

But \u201cnow the sea is rough at any time \u2013 that\u2019s not how it was,\u201d says U. P. Koya, who, at 70, has four decades of experience as a fisherman here. \u201cI was in maybe Class 5 when people from Minicoy island [some 300 kilometres away] came and taught us \u2018pole and line\u2019 fishing. From then on, in Lakshadweep, we mostly fish with that method only \u2013 we don\u2019t use nets because they get caught on the corals and break them. We are able to find fish because of the birds, and with our compasses.\u201d In pole and line fishing, the fishermen stand at the railings or on special platforms on their vessels. A short, strong line with a robust hook at the end is attached to a pole, often made of fibre glass. It\u2019s a more sustainable form of fishing, and used here mostly to catch shoals of the tuna species that inhabit the upper layers of the water.

And the baitfish communities are quite central to fishing for tuna. \u201cWe used to catch baitfish only after they had finished depositing their eggs, but now people just capture them anytime,\" says 53-year-old Abdul Rehman, a fisherman for over 30 years, in the district headquarters of Kavaratti, around 122 kilometres from Bitra. \u201cThe number of boats has increased, but catch has decreased.\u201d Indiscriminate fishing, particularly bottom trawling by large mechanised boats with nets, depletes the baitfish and also harms the reefs and related biodiversity. And that\u2019s just part of the problem. Severe climate patterns like El Nino raise sea surface temperatures and cause massive \u2018coral bleaching\u2019 \u2013 stripping the corals of colour and life, and reducing their ability to protect the islands. Lakshadweep has witnessed three mass coral bleachings \u2013 in 1998, 2010, and 2016. A 2018 study of the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF), a Mysuru-based non-profit wildlife preservation and research organisation, shows that the reefs are in danger. The study found that absolute coral cover in the Lakshadweep islands fell sharply from 51.6 per cent in 1998 to 11 per cent in 2017 \u2014 in just about 20 years. Bitra fisherman Abdul Koya, 37, says: \u201cWe recognised coral when we were 4 or 5 years old. We saw it wash up on shore, even before we went into the water. We use it to build our houses.\u201d While in Kavaratti, Dr. K. K. Idrees Babu, a scientist with the Department of Science and Technology, explains the declining coral: \u201cThere is a correlation between high sea surface temperatures and coral reefs. In 2016, sea temperatures were clocking 31 degrees Celsius and even higher!\u201d Studies show that as recently as 2005, the reef areas saw temperatures of 28.92 C. In 1985, that was 28.5 C. Warming and a rise in water levels is a worry in islands where the average elevation is mostly 1-2 metres above sea level. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/03-SD-The_Great_Coral_Grief_of_Lakshadweep_ar.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Rohan Arthur, Nature Conservation Foundation, Mysuru Top row: Severe climate patterns like El Nino raise sea surface temperatures and cause massive \u2018coral bleaching\u2019 \u2013 stripping the corals of colour and life, and reducing their ability to protect the islands.

It will rain for 2-3 hours. Sometimes light, sometimes heavy showers. But in the next few hours there will be unbearable heat once more. Absorbing all the moisture of the land. Then the soil becomes dry again. How will the saplings grow?\u201d Eighty-year-old Garel and his family cultivate paddy on their one acre in Garelpada, an Adivasi hamlet of 15 Warli families in Shahapur taluka of Thane district. In June 2019, the paddy crop they sowed dried up completely. That month, it rained just 393 mm for 11 days (less than even an average of 421.9 mm). The paddy they had planted didn\u2019t even sprout \u2013 and they lost around Rs. 10,000 spent on seeds, fertilisers, a tractor on hire and other cultivation costs. \u201cIt was only in August that the land started cooling down with regular rainfall. I was sure that by risking a second sowing, we would get a harvest, some benefit,\u201d said 38-year-old Raju, Dharma\u2019s son. After that rain-scarce June, in July, it had rained a lot in the taluka \u2013 1586.8 mm, against the normal rainfall of 947.3 mm. So the Garel family was banking on that second sowing. But by August the rain became much too intense \u2013 and it continued till October. All seven talukas of Thane district received excess rainfall of around 1,200 mm in 116 days. \u201cIt was enough rain till September for the growth of the plants. We humans too don\u2019t eat until the belly bursts, why would a small plant?\u201d asks Raju. The October rainfall flooded the Garel family\u2019s farm. \u201cWe had started cutting the paddy in the last week of September and stacking it in bundles,\u201d recalls 35-year-old Savita, farmer and Raju\u2019s wife. \u201cWe still had to harvest the rest of the crop. After October 5, it suddenly started raining heavily. We tried to take the stacked crops inside the house as much as possible. But within minutes, our farm was flooded\u2026\u201d From that second sowing of August, the Garels managed to salvage 3 quintals of rice \u2013 when in the past they would harvest, from a single sowing, around 8-9 quintals. <img alt=\"Paddy farmers Dharma Garel (left) and his son Raju: 'The rain has not increased or decreased, it is more uneven \u2013 and the heat has increased a lot' \" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02a-IMG_2023-JS.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02a-IMG_2023-JS.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:550px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Jyoti Shinoli <img alt=\"Paddy farmers Dharma Garel (left) and his son Raju: 'The rain has not increased or decreased, it is more uneven \u2013 and the heat has increased a lot' \" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02b-IMG_1992-JS.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02b-IMG_1992-JS.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:550px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Jyoti Shinoli Paddy farmers Dharma Garel (left) and his son Raju: 'The rain has not increased or decreased, it is more uneven \u2013 and the heat has increased a lot' var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); \u201cIt\u2019s been like this for a decade,\u201d says Dharma. \u201cThe rain has not increased or decreased, it is more uneven \u2013 and the heat has increased a lot.\u201d In 2018 too, the family harvested just four quintals due to a below-average monsoon.

Instead, as Dharma observes, the heat seems to have steadily intensified, and become \u201cunbearable\u201d. Data from an interactive portal on climate and global warming of the New York Times shows that in 1960, when Dharma was 20 years old, Thane saw 175 days where temperature could rise to 32 degrees Celsius. Today, that number has increased to 237 days that the temperature can reach 32 degrees. Across the Adivasi hamlets of Shahapur taluka, several other families speak of falling paddy yields. The district is home to Katkari, Malhar Koli, Ma Thakur, Warli and other Adivasi communities \u2013 the Scheduled Tribe population in Thane is roughly 1.15 million (Census 2011), nearly 14 percent of the total. \u201cRainfed paddy requires water at regular intervals, which needs proper rainfall distribution. Water stress at any stage of the crop cycle decreases the yield,\u201d says Somnath Choudhury, programme manager at the BAIF Institute for Sustainable Livelihoods and Development, Pune. Many of the Adivasi families manage to see the year through by growing kharif season paddy on small pieces of land, and then migrating for half the year to work at brick kilns, sugarcane fields and other worksites. But they can no longer count on one half of even this precarious annual rhythm, with the paddy yield repeatedly falling due to an erratic monsoon.

People here face water scarcity from December to May, until the monsoon arrives. So tankers become a major source of water during summer,\" says Baban Harane, a Shahapur-based social activist and coordinator of the Bhatsa Irrigation Project Rehabilitation Committee. \u201cThere is an increasing demand for borewells in Shahapur,\u201d he adds. \u201cApart from the digging done by the water department, private contractors illegally dig to more than 700 metres.\u201d The Groundwater Surveys and Development Agency\u2019s Probable Water Scarcity Report, 2018, shows that groundwater has depleted in 41 villages of three talukas of Thane, including Shahapur. \u201cWe don\u2019t get water even to drink, how are we going to give life to our crops? Big farmers manage because they can pay to get water from the dam, or they have wells and pumps,\u201d says Raju. The water scarcity is one reason why very many from the Adivasi hamlets of Shahapur migrate for work from November to May every year. After the kharif harvest in October, they go to labour at brick kilns in Maharashtra and Gujarat, or to sugarcane fields within the state. They return in time for the kharif sowing season, with barely enough money to meet a few expenses for some months. Raju and Savita Garel too migrate to Prakasha village in Shahade taluka of Nandurbar district, around 500 kilometres away, to work on a sugarcane field. In 2019, they set out a little late, in December, leaving Dharma and their 12-year-old son Ajay back in Garelpada.

Everyone shifted from traditional to aushadhwale [hybrid seeds]. Nobody conserves seeds now\u2026\u201d he says. When we met, he was mixing a hybrid seed variety in the soil with a pitchfork. \u201cI was against using them. Traditional seeds give less yield but they cope up with the environment. These new seeds cannot even grow without aushadh [fertiliser]. It reduces the purity [fertility] of the soil \u2013 regardless of whether the rainfall is poor or heavy.\u201d \u201cFarmers are becoming increasingly dependent on seed companies rather than preserving stock of their own traditional seeds. But these hybrid seeds, over time, need high amounts of fertilisers, insecticides and water. They can\u2019t give guaranteed yields if these [inputs] aren\u2019t made available. This means that under the changing climate conditions, the hybrids are not sustainable,\u201d explains Sanjay Patil, assistant programme coordinator at BAIF, Institute for Sustainable Livelihoods and Development, Pune. \u201cNow timely and predictable rainfall is rare due to global warming and climate change, so it becomes very necessary to have a staple crop which can adapt to the changing conditions.\u201d \u201cTraditional rice seeds, used to those locations, are enough to give some output irrespective of the changes in climatic conditions,\u201d adds BIAF\u2019s Somnath Choudhury. The hybrid seeds also typically require more water, and in rainfed-villages, if the rainfall is uneven, the crops suffer.

It developed around an idea, originating with Hippocrates and later wildly popular in Europe of the Middle Ages: that an imbalance of the four humours of the body \u2013 blood, phlegm, black bile, yellow bile \u2013 caused illness. Around 500 years after Hippocrates, Galen declared blood to be the most important humour. These and other ideas driven by surgical experimentation and, often, superstition, led to bleeding the body, ridding it of bad blood, if you like, to save the patient. Leeches were used for bloodletting, including the medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis . We will never know how many people lost their lives across 3,000 years to this treatment, how many humans turned corpses, bled to death by the medico-ideological delusions of their doctors. We do know that King Charles II of England had some 24 ounces of blood taken from him before he died. George Washington\u2019s three doctors drained him of copious amounts of blood (on his own request) to cure him of a throat infection \u2013 he died soon after. Covid-19 has given us a brilliant, thorough autopsy of neoliberalism, indeed of capitalism itself. The corpse is on the table, in glaring light, every vein, artery, organ and bone staring us in the face. You can see all the leeches \u2013 privatisation, corporate globalism, extreme concentration of wealth, levels of inequality unseen in living memory. The bloodletting approach to social and economic ills that has seen societies drain working people of the basics of decent and dignified human existence. The 3,000-year-old medical practice reached its peak in Europe in the 19th century. Its discrediting came only with the late 19th and 20th centuries \u2013 but the doctrine and practice are still dominant in the disciplines of economics, philosophy, business and society. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/02-_SR07556-PK-PS-We_didnt_bleed_him_enough-P.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 M. Palani Kumar Inequality is now central to any debate we have on the future of humanity Some of the most powerful social and economic doctors around the corpse before us, analyse it much the way doctors in say, medieval Europe, did. As the late Alexander Cockburn, founder editor of Counterpunch , once said, when the Middle Ages medicos lost their patient, they probably shook their heads sadly and said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t bleed him enough.\u201d Precisely as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have whined for decades that the horrific damage of their shock and awe treatment, of sometimes near-genocidal structural adjustment \u2013 was not because their \u2018reforms\u2019 went too far, but because their reforms, alas, did not go far enough, indeed were not allowed to, by the rowdy and great unwashed. Inequality, the ideologically insane argued, was not such a dreadful thing. It promoted competitiveness and individual initiative. And we needed more of those. Inequality is now central to any debate we have on the future of humanity. The rulers know this. For over 20 years now, they\u2019ve been savaging the suggestion that inequality has anything to do with humanity\u2019s problems. Early this millennium, the Brookings Institute warned against this debilitating discussion on inequality. Less than 90 days before Covid-19 swept the world, The Economist magazine, neoliberalism\u2019s Oracle of Delphi, read the chicken entrails before it and ran a bitter cover story: Inequality Illusions: Why wealth and income gaps are not what they appear Could turn out the most famous last words since Tarzan\u2019s \u2013 \u201cwho greased the grapevine?\u201d It then goes on to blast the numbers relating to income and wealth, attempts to discredit the sources of those numbers; says these ridiculous beliefs persist \u201ceven in the world of polarisation, fake news and social media.\u201d Covid-19 has given us an authentic autopsy, debunking the witch doctors of neoliberalism \u2013 yet their thinking dominates, the corporate media, who are busy finding ways not to link the destruction of the past three months in any way to capitalism.

One a superhighway for the super-rich, another a dirt track service lane for the migrants who will trudge there to serve them var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); The pre-Covid normal \u2013 in January 2020, we learned from OXFAM that the 22 richest men in the world had more wealth than all the women in Africa. That the world\u2019s 2,153 billionaires held more wealth than 60 per cent of the planet\u2019s population. The new normal: American billionaires, the Institute of Policy Studies, Washington D.C., tells us, added more wealth in just three weeks of the pandemic \u2013 $ 282 billion \u2013 than the total wealth they held in 1990 ($240 billion). A normal where billions lived in hunger in a world bursting with food. In India, as of July 22, we had over 91 million metric tons of foodgrain \u2018surplus\u2019 or buffer stocks lying with the government \u2013 and the highest numbers of the world\u2019s hungry. The new normal? The government distributes very little of that grain free, but sanctions the conversion of huge stocks of rice into ethanol \u2013 to make hand sanitiser . The old normal, back when we had nearly 50 million tons of \u2018surplus\u2019 grain lying in the godowns, was neatly summed up by Prof. Jean Dreze in 2001 : if all our foodgrain sacks \u201cwere lined up in a row, they would stretch for a million kilometres \u2013 more than twice the distance from the earth to the moon.\u201d The new normal \u2013 that figure reached 104 million tons in early June. Two roads to the moon? One a superhighway for the super-rich, another a dirt track service lane for the migrants who will trudge there to serve them. The \u2018normal\u2019 was an India where full-time farmers fell out of that status at the rate of 2,000 every 24 hours, for 20 years between 1991 and 2011. In other words, the population of full-time farmers in the country fell by 15 million in that period . Also: 315,000 farmers took their own lives between 1995 and 2018, as the numbers (huge underestimates) of the National Crime Records Bureau show . Millions either became agricultural labourers or migrated out of their villages \u2013 since many allied occupations had also died \u2013 in search of jobs. <img alt=\"The \u2018normal\u2019 was an India where full-time farmers fell out of that status at the rate of 2,000 every 24 hours, for 20 years between 1991 and 2011.

Close to 10 million went by trains in the month of May alone \u2013 trains organised with the greatest governmental reluctance and only well after a month into the lockdown. The returning migrants, already destitute and starving, were made to pay full fare to the government-owned railways. Normal was an overwhelmingly private healthcare sector, so expensive that for years, the largest number of individual bankruptcies in the United States came from health expenditure.

In daily practice, we continue to function as if it is the poor who are the source and the carriers of the virus, not the flying classes who pioneered the globalisation of communicable disease two decades ago. Domestic violence was always \u2018normal\u2019 in tens of millions of Indian households. The new normal? Even male police chiefs in some states are expressing fears of such violence has risen but is being even more severely under-reported than before, because the \u2018perpetrator is now [more] at home\u2019 due to the lockdown. The normal for New Delhi was that it long ago beat Beijing in the race to be the most polluted capital city in the world. The one pleasant fallout of our present crisis is that the skies over Delhi are cleaner than they have been in decades, with the most dirty and hazardous industrial activity coming to a halt. The new normal: cut the clean air cacophony. One of the most major moves of our government in the midst of the pandemic was to auction and privatise coal blocks in the country to push for a massive rise in production. It was always normal that the words climate change were largely absent in public, or political, discourse. Though human agency-led climate change has long devastated Indian agriculture. The new normal is too often the old normal on steroids. In state after Indian state, labour laws have been suspended or simply violated. The gold standard of labour law \u2013 the 8-hour day \u2013 has been scrapped in states that have made it a 12-hour day. In some states, that additional four hours come without payment of overtime. The state of Uttar Pradesh also suspended 38 existing labour laws to strangle any possibility of either organised or individual protest. Henry Ford was one of the earliest capitalists to adopt the 8-hour day in 1914. The Ford Motor Co. saw profits almost double in the next two years.

New normal: Who will buy their crops of the ongoing season? var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); In agriculture, there\u2019s a scary situation developing. Remember that millions of small and marginal farmers across the Third World shifted to cash crops over the past 3-4 decades, coaxed, coerced, goaded into doing so by typical Bank-Fund formulations: cash crops are exported, are paid for in hard currency \u2013 dollars come into your country and liberate you from poverty. We know how well that went. Small cash crop farmers, especially those in cotton \u2013 are the largest single group among farmers\u2019 suicides. A most highly indebted group, too. Now it gets worse. Much of what we call the rabi crop \u2013 harvested normally around March-April \u2013 is either lying unsold or, if perishable, has died in the fields due to the lockdown. Millions of quintals of cash crops, including hundreds of thousands of quintals of cotton, sugarcane, and other crops have piled up to the roofs of farmer homes (in cotton at least). The old normal: deadly fluctuations in prices crippled small cash crop farmers in India and across the Third World. New normal: Who will buy their crops of the ongoing season when those are harvested months from now? In the words of UN General Secretary Antonio Guterres, \u201cWe face the deepest global recession since World War II, and the broadest collapse in incomes since 1870.\u201d The worldwide crash in income and consumption does not exempt India and will very likely devastate cash crop farmers here. Last year, our greatest export market for cotton was \u2013 China. Today, relations with China are at their worst in decades and both countries are in trouble. Who will buy the gigantic amounts of cotton, sugarcane, vanilla and other cash crops piling up across many countries including India? At what prices? And with all that land committed to cash crop, and with raging unemployment \u2013 what happens if you run short of food?

Many leaders were ideologically comfortable in both camps. The normal was a Rs. 2 trillion media (and entertainment) industry that for decades didn\u2019t give a damn for the migrants whose movements they were mesmerised and mystified by after March 25. No \u2018national\u2019 newspaper or channel had a full-time labour correspondent, nor a full-time farming correspondent (as against the laughably termed \u2018agriculture correspondent\u2019, whose job is to cover the agriculture ministry and, increasingly, agri-business). The beats \u2013 full time \u2013 did not exist. In other words, 75 per cent of the population did not make news. For weeks after March 25, anchors and editors who wouldn\u2019t know a migrant if he or she kicked them in the teeth, held forth knowledgably on the subject. A few ruefully conceded that we in the media needed to try and tell their stories better. At precisely the same time, corporate owners laid off over 1,000 journalists and media workers \u2013 extinguishing any chance of covering the migrants at all with any depth and consistency. Many of these layoffs were planned for long before the pandemic and the worst offenders are amongst the most profitable media companies anywhere \u2013 with have huge cash reserves. The normal by any other name stinks just the same. Now one man runs the country on a sporadic TV reality show.

Labour movements need to not just fight for a bigger slice of the cake, but pursuer an older abnormal quest, for ownership of the bakery. Some goals are clear: cancellation of Third World debt, for instance. In India, for ending the indebtedness of our own Fourth World. Dismantle corporate monopolies. Start by evicting them entirely from Health, Food and Agriculture, and Education. Movements to force states to a radical redistribution of resources; taxing wealth, even if only of the top 1 per cent, for starters. Taxing multinational corporations that get away with paying almost no taxes. Also by restoring and improving taxation systems that so many countries have steadily dismantled for decades now. Only mass movements can compel countries to build nationwide universal systems in health and education. We need peoples\u2019 movements around Health Justice, Food Justice, and more \u2013 some inspiring ones already exist, but are marginalised in corporate media coverage. We also need, here and worldwide, to focus on those rights in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights that corporate media have simply expunged from public discourse. Articles 23-28 , which include \u2018the right to form and join trade unions\u2019, the right to work and equal pay for equal work, remuneration that ensures an existence worthy of human dignity, health \u2013 and a lot more. In our country, we need to propagate the Directive Principles of State Policy of the Indian Constitution and make some of those \u2013 Right to Work, Right to Education, to Food, and more \u2013 justiciable and enforceable. Those are the soul of a Constitution that came out of India\u2019s freedom struggle. More than one ruling of the Supreme Court these past 30-40 years has held that the directive principles are as important as the fundamental rights. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/10-031_We-didnt-bleed-him-enough_PS_Labani-Ja.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Labani Jangi Illustration (above and cover): Labani Jangi, originally from a small town of West Bengal's Nadia district, is working towards a PhD degree on Bengali labour migration at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Kolkata.

Amina and her family were moved to makeshift rooms in a neighbouring village on May 19 this year. The cyclone swept away Amina\u2019s mud house in her village of around 5,800 people in Gosaba block, located in the Sundarbans. All her belongings were swept away too. Amina, 48, her husband Mohammad Ramzan Molla, 56, and their six children, ages ranging from 2 to 16, managed to stay safe. Mohammad Molla had returned to the village just two weeks before the cyclone struck. The 56-year-old worked as a cleaner at a mall in Pune, Maharashtra, earning Rs. 10,000 a month. This time, he had planned to stay back and open a tea stall in the nearby Molla Khali bazaar. Amina used to add to the family income by setting out to catch crabs and fishes in the nearby Gomor river, after finishing her house work. She would sell her modest catch in the bazaar. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t even earn Rs. 100 a day for that,\u201d she had told me. Raquib Ali, their oldest child, dropped out of school in 2018 when he was 14. \u201cWe cannot survive on the money abba sends home,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I left to work.\u201d Raquib earned Rs. 5,000 a month as a helper in a tailoring shop in Kolkata. He was back home when Amphan struck during the Covid-19 lockdown. The family\u2019s mud house with a thatched roof stood on the banks of the river Gomor. With each cyclone that hit them \u2013 Sidr (2007), Aila (2009) and Bulbul (2019), the river inched closer to their home and slowly submerged their entire three bigha (one acre) land, where they cultivated paddy once a year, along with a few vegetables. By the time Amphan came, they did not have any land left. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/02-DSC_0093-SD.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sovan Daniary Amina Bibi stands near her ravaged home with her seven-year-old daughter Reshma Khatun Before Amphan once again flooded the village\u2019s houses home and fields with swathes of saline water on May 20 this year, Amina\u2019s family \u2013 as well as many others \u2013 were temporarily resettled in Chhota Molla Khali village, on the breached embankments of rivers Bidyadhari and Gomor. The state government and local NGOs distributed cooked food and water pouches to the families. The makeshift rooms were crowded and had no electricity, and there was no place to follow physical distancing \u2013 at a time of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cHow long will they stay here? One month, two months \u2013 then [where will they go]?\u201d asked Chandan Maity, secretary of the Sundarban Nagarik Mancha, a local organisation that was distributing food in the relief camp. \u201cThe men \u2013 even the young people \u2013 will have to move in search of livelihoods. Those who cannot migrate will be left behind to survive on fish, crabs and honey, [or depend] on the rivers and jungles.\u201d Over the last two decades, residents of the Sundarbans region have increasingly lost acres of cultivable land to the saline waters brought in by high tides, floods and cyclones. A 2020 study by the World Wildlife Fund notes that nearly 85 per cent of the region\u2019s residents cultivated a single paddy crop each year. But salinity destroys the soil\u2019s productivity and causes fresh water ponds to dry up, depleting freshwater fish species.

Similarly, a survey of 200 households in the Sundarbans by Avijit Mistri (assistant professor at Nistarini Women\u2019s College, Puruliya, West Bengal) found that at least one member in nearly three-fourth of the surveyed households has migrated to other districts and states in search of work. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/03-DSC_0516-SD.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sovan Daniary Abu Jabayyer Ali Shah and Rokeya Bini of Baliara village on Mousuni island in South 24 Parganas district lost their house too.

Molla too worked as a mason in Kerala, and had returned home to Uchildaha village in Minakhan block around a month before Amphan, due to the Covid-19 lockdown.

In Churu district of north Rajasthan, where the sandy ground sizzles in the summers and the wind feels like a furnace in May and June, conversations about the heat \u2013 and how it is intensifying \u2013 are common. Temperatures in those months easily climb up to the high 40s. Just last month, May 2020, the temperature rose to 50 degree Celsius \u2013 and was the highest in the world, news reports said, for May 26. So last year, when the mercury breached even the 51 degrees Celsius mark in Churu in early June 2019 \u2013 more than halfway to the boiling point of water \u2013 for many it was a sidebar. \u201cI recall it reached 50 degrees around 30 years ago too,\u201d says 75-year-old Hardayalji Singh, a retired schoolteacher and landowner, reclining on a cot in his large house in Gajuvas village. Six months later, by December-January in some years, Churu has seen just-below zero degrees temperatures.

In Churu district, 72 per cent of around 2.5 million people live in rural areas \u2013 where agriculture is mostly rain-fed. Over time, many have tried to reduce this dependence on the rains. \u201cSince the 1990s, there have been attempts here to dig borewells [that went 500-600 feet deep], but that\u2019s not been very successful due to [groundwater] salinity,\u201d says Prof. Isran. \u201cFor a while, some farmers could harvest a second crop like groundnut [using borewell water]\u201d in the 899 villages of the district\u2019s six tehsils. \u201cBut then the land dried up too much and most borewells shut down, except in a few villages.\u201d About 38 per cent (or 62,94,000 hectares) of Rajasthan\u2019s net sown area is irrigated, says the draft Rajasthan State Action Plan for Climate Change ( RSAPCC , 2010). In Churu, that is barely 8 per cent. While the still-being-completed Choudhary Kumbharam Lift Canal provides water to some of the villages and farms of the district, Churu's agriculture and its four main kharif crops \u2013 bajra , moong , moth and gavar beans \u2013 remain largely rainfall dependent. But the rainfall pattern has altered over these past 20 years. People in Churu speak of two broad shifts: the monsoon months have moved, and the rain has become patchy \u2013 intense in some places, sparse in others. Older farmers recall the first robust rains of a different past. \u201cIn the month of Ashad [June-July], we would see lightning, knew the rain was coming and would quickly start making rotis in the fields [before moving inside our huts],\u201d says Govardhan Saharan, 59, a farmer from the Jat community, whose joint family holds 180 bighas (around 120 acres) in Gajuvas village. Jats and Choudharys, both OBC communities, are predominant among the farmers of Churu. \u201cNow there is often lightning, but it stops there \u2013 there is no rain,\u201d Saharan adds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e6f0d76-3f78-444f-9801-bdc6cec85a5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e6f0d76-3f78-444f-9801-bdc6cec85a5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/churu-blowing-hot-blowing-cold---mainly-hot/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nSharmila Joshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Churu: Blowing hot, blowing cold \u2013 mainly hot", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/churu-blowing-hot-blowing-cold---mainly-hot/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nSharmila Joshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "f0069aa5750aa8ecc7607c0bea3a8862f338974c1fc62c40f0557bd0c2a8259c"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f3a14dc-2a8a-44ea-b0b6-4797b27d660a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/churu-blowing-hot-blowing-cold---mainly-hot/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nSharmila Joshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "ef2f3036fbd2187f0a6af1f57431009c865e8938605e557f0f244ee8da37d956"}}, "hash": "a242ba096eafc9bb4ed65754b5ab667e3d381d8038a744549ea619a92412bd6f", "text": "<img alt=\"Bajrang Goswami and Raj Kaur (left) say their 'back has burnt with the heat', while older farmers like Govardhan Saharan (right) speak of the first rains of a different past \" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/04a-IMG_0576-SJ.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/04a-IMG_0576-SJ.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:430px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sharmila Joshi <img alt=\"Bajrang Goswami and Raj Kaur (left) say their 'back has burnt with the heat', while older farmers like Govardhan Saharan (right) speak of the first rains of a different past \" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/04b-IMG_0596-SJ.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/04b-IMG_0596-SJ.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:430px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sharmila Joshi Bajrang Goswami and Raj Kaur (left) say their 'back has burnt with the heat', while older farmers like Govardhan Saharan (right) speak of the first rains of a different past var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); \u201cWhen I was in school, with dark clouds looming in the north, we could tell the rain was coming \u2013 and it would, in half an hour,\u201d says 80-year-old Narain Prasad of Sadinsar village in neighbouring Sikar district. \u201cNow,\u201d he says, sitting on a cot in his farm, \u201ceven if there are clouds, they pass.\u201d Prasad has built a huge concrete tank on his 13- bigha farmland (around 8 acres), for harvesting rainwater.

Much earlier, Ganganagar had touched the 50-degree mark in June 1934, and Alwar hit 50.6 in May 1956. Although some news reports called Churu the hottest place on the planet in early June 2019, other parts of the world \u2013 including some Arab states \u2013 have recorded 50 degrees Celsius temperatures or more, notes a 2019 report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) . Depending on how global warming patterns evolve, the report, Working on a warmer planet , predicts a temperature increase for India of between 1.1 and as much as 3 degrees Celsius from 2025 to 2085. For the entire desert region of western Rajasthan (19.61 million hectares), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other sources have projected hotter days and warm nights, and a reduction in rainfall by the end of the 21st century. \u201cAfter around 48 degrees Celsius,\u201d says Dr. Sunil Jandu in Churu town, even to people used to very high heat, \u201cevery rise by a degree matters a lot.\u201d The impact of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93778c03-f6d7-424e-8257-648d857ce0fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "93778c03-f6d7-424e-8257-648d857ce0fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/churu-blowing-hot-blowing-cold---mainly-hot/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nSharmila Joshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Churu: Blowing hot, blowing cold \u2013 mainly hot", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/churu-blowing-hot-blowing-cold---mainly-hot/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nSharmila Joshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "7184353ec39e3830834db38445d20f5c244093b97d6168fa389c3eca1b4db0fd"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c925e4a-99b0-4a3c-b9d1-fea18cef6317", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/churu-blowing-hot-blowing-cold---mainly-hot/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nSharmila Joshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "535085be7836e61791b664e7ec0e165c2ee57cd3cefff60b6291e6a84cc1a885"}}, "hash": "e71a297d4d62cd6e965db1fe16e6ec215f2c9146ffeea300d3440e9b76e9523f", "text": "48-plus degrees on the human body, he says, is huge \u2013 exhaustion, dehydration, kidney stones (due to long-term dehydration) and even heat stroke, besides nausea, dizziness and other effects.

But not all damaging effects are of a kind seen so soon, so easily, in dramatic fallouts such as a rush to the hospitals. Combining with other problems, the ILO report notes, heat stress may also act as a \u201cpush factor prompting agricultural workers to leave rural areas\u2026[and] during the 2005\u201315 period, higher levels of heat stress were associated with larger outmigration flows \u2013 a trend not observed for the preceding ten-year period. This may well be a sign that households are increasingly taking climate change into account in their migration decisions [emphasis added].\" In Churu too, falling incomes due to falling yields \u2013 partly due to the now-erratic monsoon \u2013 are among the long chain of forces that drive migration. In the past, says Dularam Saharan, \u2018We would get 100 mann [about 3,750 kilos] bajra from our land. Now it\u2019s 20-30 mann at most. In Bharang, my village, maybe only 50 per cent are still cultivating, the rest have left farming and migrated.\u201d In Gajuvas village, Dharampal Saharan says his yields too have fallen sharply. So for some years now he has been going to Jaipur or to cities in Gujarat for 3-4 months annually, to work as a tempo driver. Prof. Isran too notes that across Churu, to compensate for the loss of falling farm incomes, many are migrating to the Gulf countries or to cities in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Punjab to work in factories. (The trade in cattle being devastated by government policy is also a reason for this \u2013 but that\u2019s another story.) The world could see \u201ca productivity loss equivalent to 80 million full-time jobs\u201d due to high temperatures in the next 10 years, says the ILO report. That is, if global temperatures rise even by 1.5\u00b0 C by the end of the twenty-first century, as presently projected. ***** Why is the climate changing in Churu? Environmental pollution, says Prof. Isran, as does Madhav Sharma. That traps heat, alters weather patterns. \u201cThe heat is more because of global warming and because of concretisation.

Many of these arise in greater activity in the energy sector, increased use of fossil fuels, emissions in the agriculture sector, growing industrial processes, and due to \u2018land-use, land-use change and forestry\u2019. All these are ever-shifting links in the complex web of climate change In Churu\u2019s villages, people may not speak of GHGs, but they are living through the effects. \u201cIn the past, even without fans and coolers, we could handle the heat. But now we cannot live without them,\u201d says Hardayalj. Adds Amrita, \u201cPoor families cannot afford fans and coolers. Unbearable heat brings diarrhoea and vomiting (among other effects). And going to the doctor adds to their expenses.\u201d Before taking the bus home in Sujangarh, at the end of a day in the field, Bhagwani Devi says, \u201cIt is difficult to work in the heat. We feel nauseous, dizzy. Then we rest in the shade of a tree, have some lime water \u2013 and get back to work.\u201d With sincere thanks for their generous help and guidance: Narayan Bareth in Jaipur, Nirmal Prajapati and Umrao Singh in Taranagar, Amrita Choudhary in Sujangarh, and Daleep Sarawag in Churu town. PARI\u2019s nationwide reporting project on climate change is part of a UNDP-supported initiative to capture that phenomenon through the voices and lived experience of ordinary people.

A coin fallen in [to the bottom of the river] could be seen from above. We could drink directly from the Yamuna,\u201d says fisherman Raman Haldar, scooping a cupped palm into the muddy waters, bringing it near his mouth to emphasise the point. Seeing our mortified look, he lets it run down his fingers with a wistful laugh. In today\u2019s Yamuna, plastics, foil wrappers, muck, newspapers, dead flora, concrete debris, cloth scraps, slush, rotting food, wandering coconuts, chemical foam and water hyacinth offer up a dark reflection of the capital city\u2019s material and mythical consumption. Just 22 kilometres (or barely 1.6 per cent) of the Yamuna flows through the National Capital Territory. But the wastes and poisons emptied into that little stretch account for close to 80 per cent of all pollution in the 1,376 kilometre river. Acknowledging that, the monitoring committee report of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2018 pronounced the river in Delhi a 'sewer line'. The resulting severe depletion of oxygen levels in the water causes large-scale deaths of fish. Last year, thousands of fish were found dead at the Kalindi Kunj Ghat on the southern stretch of the river in Delhi, and other aquatic life have become a near-annual occurrence in the Delhi stretch of the river. \u201cFor a river ecosystem to survive, it needs a dissolved oxygen (amount of oxygen in water) level of 6 and above. Fish require a DO level of at least 4-5. In the Delhi part of Yamuna, the DO is between 0 to 0.4,\u201d says Priyank Hirani, director of the Water-to-Cloud project of the Tata Centre for Development at the University of Chicago. The project maps real-time pollution in rivers. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/02-20190622_DLI-BK-MN_Fishermen-025-SS-When_Y.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 People's Archive of Rural India 'There\u2019s no fish there [the Kalindi Kunj Ghat], earlier there was plenty.
