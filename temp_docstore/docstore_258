While it is not necessary to prove \u2018historic\u2019 discrimination in order to validate a programme of special measures,283 there must be persistent or structural disparities and de facto inequalities resulting from the circumstances that continue to deny vulnerable groups and individuals the advantages essential for the full development of the human personality. Appropriateness: The measures must be suitable to remedy the imbalances. States must consider and must be able to demonstrate how the measures promote the advancement, development and protection of groups and individuals concerned.284 They must be orientated towards correcting present disparities and preventing further imbalances from arising.285 This, however, has not always been clear when such measures have been applied and implemented at the country level and there is a risk that such measures serve client based political purposes aimed at securing the electoral support of a particular social group. Human rights monitoring bodies have frequently noted States\u2019 lack of clarity on the purpose of imposed special measures.286 Proportionality: The action must be proportionate to the problem and the aim. For example, would it be proportionate if problems for certain groups accessing education were sought to be remedied by preferential treatment in employment and housing opportunities? Answering this question requires a comprehensive examination of exact factors impeding access to education. Human rights treaty monitoring bodies have reiterated affirmative action must be carefully designed and implemented on the basis of need. Ensuring each of these key elements requires a realistic appraisal of the needs and concerns of individuals and communities. This has also been reiterated frequently by the CERD Committee, calling on Fiji to \u2018engage in a data-gathering exercise to ensure that special measures are designed and implemented on the basis of need\u2019.287 In turn, this requires an adequately resourced data collection system. For example, the Committee on the Rights of the Child called on Pakistan to ensure that that the \u2018Child Protection Monitoring and Data Collection System is provided with adequate resources to systematically and comprehensively collect quantitative and qualitative data for the entire country, disaggregated by sex, age and rural and urban area \u2026 with emphasis on those who require affirmative social actions due to disadvantages and disparities.\u2019288 283 See CERD General Comment No. 32 The meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, August 2009, para 22 284 See CERD General Comment No. 32 The meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, August 2009, Part V 285 See CERD General Comment No. 32 The meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, August 2009, para 22 286 For instance when considering Vanuatu\u2019s periodic report CEDAW was concerned about the State\u2019s lack of clarity of purpose of such measures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "431ad5c2-d9ab-4f34-951b-9d012ad827fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "431ad5c2-d9ab-4f34-951b-9d012ad827fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc46f9a0e66087bb65744c4f35b1780477394e5383db58f90da179355c89ac98"}, "2": {"node_id": "357c912d-4796-4fe6-85f6-71299a72e37b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1bd7b385f86e4c9a42286197426a0e67bd3e1c09c61ba5f411fe15530d8097df"}}, "hash": "eb8693087b966b49bc1e26ff0cedcf0a1b260c95c1559a50cd6bb0e9a7f0135e", "text": "See Paragraph(s) 20 CEDAW/C/VUT/CO/3 (CEDAW, 2007) 287 See Paragraph(s) 17 CERD/C/FJI/CO/17 (CERD, 2008) 288 See Paragraph(s) 21, CRC/C/PAK/CO/3-4 (CRC, 2009) Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 127 States need to gather relevant disaggregated (by amongst others sex, ethnicity, caste) data on the general situation in the country to identify patterns of inequality and reasons for such inequality.\u2019289 The data must identify who is currently benefiting from what and who is losing out.

Only diligent and thorough analysis of sufficiently disaggregated data allows affirmative action measures to be appropriately targeted and effective. States must use this information to design appropriate and proportionate programmes. Governments must consider what system is best fit to meet the goals of ensuring equality. Will it be a blanket system where groups selected will benefit from all programmes or will it be more selective and determined on a group-by-group and programme-by- programme basis? Does it need to be graduated with different groups benefitting to different degrees? How will States address the situation of sub-groups within the group, both in terms of those who are particularly vulnerable and those who represent the elite of the groups?290 Should there be specific affirmative action for the Badi caste within more general affirmative actions designed to meet the needs of the Dalit caste? Given the myriad of different factors and dynamics that generate inequality, designing appropriate and proportionate affirmative action programmes is not easy and these questions are essentially the tip of the iceberg. This underscores the importance of the process by which affirmative action is decided, implemented and reviewed. Temporary: Affirmative action programmes cannot be permanent. Any affirmative actions must be terminated when equality between the beneficiary groups and others has been sustainably achieved. The question of timing is crucial if substantive equality is to be achieved. If the programmes are withdrawn too late, they risk resulting in separate and special rights for particular groups of people, and could lead to tensions between different communities. If they are withdrawn too quickly, they are exacerbating the vulnerability of particular groups of people which could lead to tensions between different communities. States have applied the temporary requirement in different ways. The Indian Constitution of 1949, for instance, specifies that \u2018the reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the House of the People and in the Legislative Assemblies of 289 See CERD General Comment No. 32 The meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, August 2009, Part V 290 For a discussion on this, please see Galanter, M. The Structure and Operation of an Affirmative Action Programme: an Outline of Choices and Problems, Conference on Affirmative Action 128 Affirmative Action as a Way and Means of Achieving Economic and Social Rights and the MDGs the States\u2019 shall cease to have effect on the expiration of a period of fifty years from the commencement of this Constitution.291 However, even when such timelines or deadlines exist they cannot be absolute and must be accompanied by adequate monitoring using disaggregated data to see whether equality has yet been sustainably achieved. It may be the case, for instance, that affirmative action programmes should be concluded earlier or in fact extended. The human rights community has observed the notion of \u2018adequate advancement\u2019 as contained in Article 1, paragraph 4 of the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) requires programmes to be goal-directed.292 States should therefore establish goals and timetables and the means to regularly monitor, evaluate and assess the impact or progress of reaching the desired goals. This has been reiterated frequently by human rights monitoring bodies. For example, the CERD Committee asks States to include information on available mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation within periodic reports.293 The Committee has also frequently requested States to establish goals and timetables to regularly evaluate the impact of such measures to ensure they lead to desired goals and not to the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different ethnic groups after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved.294 In 2002, the Committee called on Fiji to introduce an effective monitoring mechanism to ensure programmes conform to fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and CEDAW\u2019s concept of temporary special measures.295 In practice, States have employed different monitoring mechanisms. In Fiji, for instance, Section 44 of the Constitution requires \u2018the administering department or other agency must monitor the efficacy of a program established under this section by reference to the specified performance indicators\u2019 and that \u2018the Minister must make an annual report to Parliament on the results revealed by the monitoring\u2019.296 Cottrel and Ghai however 291 See Part XV of the Constitution of India, available at http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_ India/Part_XVI 292 See General Recommendation No. 32 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination The meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, August 2009 293 See General Recommendation No. 32 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad289f7f-751f-474b-9ccd-602e9087a6cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad289f7f-751f-474b-9ccd-602e9087a6cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1548aa037c9fd2717d5b983884be87fce5d3cc3c3b4a0561110e13a15c8e572e"}, "3": {"node_id": "e1f2141c-aab3-4822-99e7-b2b2a7184944", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5bcb08f538e75d99aab208df1f42c34f514f445e69a8465d77c3552f409ba0f"}}, "hash": "7e13c61e4577005d395d175f8f68a3337f403e0717b454f7b6e7cd3972f93b45", "text": "Discrimination The meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, August 2009, Part V 294 CEDAW for instance called on the Philippines to establish concrete goals and timetables and take sustained measures, including temporary special measures, in accordance with art. 4, paragraph 1 CEDAW and CEDAW\u2019s general recommendation 25 on temporary special measures, and monitor impact of measures taken, track trends over time, take necessary corrective measures and provide in next report detailed information about results achieved See Paragraph(s) 24 CEDAW/C/PHI/CO/6 (CEDAW, 2006).

The importance of including meaningful participatory mechanisms in the design, implementation and monitoring of affirmative action programmes has been frequently emphasised by human rights treaty monitoring bodies. In 2003, the CERD Committee called on Fiji to precede any adoption of affirmative action programmes with consultations involving all ethnic communities.299 Participation forms a key part of the right to take part in public affairs. Targeted groups may already be excluded from political processes and in the development and implementation of legislation and policies affecting their lives. Not engaging in effective dialogue/communication would add to further marginalisation and exclusion. Effective participation in design, implementation and monitoring is vital for ensuring the relevance and effectiveness of affirmative actions and to prevent tensions from competing groups. Participation must be meaningful. It must be factored into the design process early with appropriate mechanisms that take into account problems and possible barriers to participation such as languages, geographic and/or social remoteness, exclusion, and power dynamics both within particular communities (for instance power imbalances between male and female members), and between different concerned groups. Fair and transparent decision making: The idea of preferential treatment for certain groups of society can ignite new or reinforce existing tensions. Therefore, States must ensure a fair and transparent process. Information and reasoning behind decisions for implementing affirmative action programmes must be clearly communicated and accessible to affected groups. 297 See Cottrell, J., and Ghai, Y., Constitutionalising Affirmative Action in the Fiji, The International Journal of Human Rights, Volume 11, Numbers 1-2, March 2007 , pp. 227-257(31) 298 Ibid. 299 See Paragraph(s) 16 CERD/C/62/CO/3 (CERD, 2003) 130 Affirmative Action as a Way and Means of Achieving Economic and Social Rights and the MDGs 4.

While the programme itself may vary in being voluntary or mandatory, targeted towards private or public bodies, successful implementation to a large degree depends on public support.

The Report observed that despite affirmative action measures for some years, \u2018the proportion of women in Indonesia\u2019s parliament was dismal\u2019 hovering around 10 per cent for a number of years. Between 1999 and 2004 the percentage of women in the lower house was 9%, increasing by approximately 25% to 11.3% from 2004 to 2009. However, from 2009 to present the number of female members of the Lower House (DPR) increased by 63% to 18% and in the newly constituted upper house (the House of Regions or DPD) where only individuals may be candidates the number of female members increased by 77 to 27.3% members. While women representation is still below what it should be, recent increases represent an important development, which UNDP attributes to public awareness rather than quotas. With democratization beginning in 1998, the movement for women\u2019s representation picked up momentum and visibility and the Election Law passed in 2004 required all political parties to apply a 30 per cent quota for women to their candidate list. However, while considered \u2018an historic achievement\u2019, this provision \u2018lacked teeth\u2019, and UNDP noted that only a few parties adhered to it. The new election law passed in 2008 combined a 30 per cent quota for party lists with a \u2018zipper\u2019 system whereby for every three candidates fielded by political parties, at least one had to be a woman. However, in late 2008 this quota was effectively dismantled by the Constitutional Court in a ruling that required the election to be decided wholly by the popular vote. Amidst this setback, however, the affirmative action debate generated greater interest in the issue of women\u2019s representation, and galvanized the efforts of different stakeholders. Civil society organizations launched activities to spread awareness of the importance of having a gender-balanced parliament. These efforts were backed by a number of political parties and some government agencies, such as the State Ministry on Women\u2019s Empowerment, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the General Election Commission. UNDP and bilateral donors also actively supported efforts of Indonesian stakeholders through civil society voters\u2019 education initiatives, media campaigns, and public consultations among political parties, academics and civil society. The results even took activists by surprise. Many more parties took the 30 per cent quota seriously, even in the absence of legislation. As many as 70 per cent of the 38 parties competing in the 2009 election nominated women for more than 30 per cent of their candidates. The Indonesian experience proves that often quotas are not enough. They must also be accompanied by a focus on increasing real public support for women\u2019s representation, which even after the quotas were effectively dismantled ensured effective female political representation. 132 Affirmative Action as a Way and Means of Achieving Economic and Social Rights and the MDGs 5. UNDP and Affirmative Action The following sections examine concrete actions and possible entry points for UNDP to undertake affirmative action initiatives.

What can UNDP do? Advocacy: UNDP can use States\u2019 commitments under human rights law and various UN human rights mechanisms to engage with governments about the possibility of implementing affirmative action. UNDP can also work towards translating various human 303 For further details see Asia-Pacific Human Development Report Power, Voice and Rights A Turning Point for Gender Equality in Asia and the Pacific UNDP 2010, page 93. 304 See UNDP Strategic Plan, 2008-2011: Accelerating global progress on human development, DP/2007/43, para 66 305 See UNDP Strategic Plan, 2008-2011: Accelerating global progress on human development, DP/2007/43, para 66 306 See Human Rights in UNDP: Practice note, UNDP April 2005 p 6 307 See Human Rights in UNDP: Practice note, UNDP April 2005 p 17 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 133 rights recommendations of UN human rights mechanisms into local languages and disseminate them through its unique and extensive partnerships. Human rights treaties recognise the importance of affirmative action (special measures) in achieving substantive equality. Many monitoring bodies such as the CERD Committee, the CEDAW Committee and the CESCR Committee have called on countries in the Asia Pacific region to take affirmative action. Examples of recommendations include the CESCR recommending India to continue making use of affirmative action measures to promote active political participation of women.308. CEDAW similarly called on Sri Lanka to \u2018take all necessary measures to increase representation of women in politics and public life at local, provincial and national levels, including through implementation of temporary special measures (affirmative action), in accordance with art. 4, paragraph 1 CEDAW.309 Both the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism and the special procedures are important sources for development practitioners to use when addressing structural imbalances causing poverty. Many of the special procedures have called on States to undertake affirmative action programmes. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of the region and/or belief similarly called on Laos to address the limited access of religious minorities to higher education, by \u2018extending affirmative action schemes, which already exist in education policy for members of ethnic minorities, to religious minorities.\u2019310 During the Universal Periodic review of Bangladesh, Brazil similarly recognized the importance of affirmative actions to guarantee access of ethnic minorities to higher education and to government recruitment.311 Using the recommendations not only helps address inequality in concerned States, it also helps strengthen and promote UN human rights machinery at both the global and country levels, which UNDP has explicitly committed to doing.312 Diagnosing the problem: UNDP could play a significant role in helping governments collect and analyse disaggregated data to capture the dynamics of development and poverty. This information can help diagnose the problem and determine a solution by identifying who benefits from what and the reasons behind who is being left behind. This information is crucial if the Government wishes to design legitimate, appropriate and proportionate affirmative action programmes. 308 See Paragraph(s) 57 E/C.12/IND/CO/5 (CESCR, 2008) 309 See Paragraph(s) 279 A/57/38(SUPP) (CEDAW, 2002) 310 See Paragraph(s) 69, Report of the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Region and Belief, A/HRC/13/40/ Add.4 2010) 311 See A/HRC/11/18, 5 October 2009 312 See Human Rights in UNDP: Practice note, UNDP April 2005 p 17 134 Affirmative Action as a Way and Means of Achieving Economic and Social Rights and the MDGs Create effective participatory measures in the design and monitoring of programmes: UNDP could take advantage of its significant experience in promoting the participation of different groups of people in different systems to help States develop effective participatory measures for affected persons in the design, monitoring and evaluation of affirmative programmes including the initial vulnerability assessment.313 Promoting implementation of programmes through training and awareness-raising: The proven strength and experience of UNDP in human rights training could be applied to specific training on the importance and implementation of affirmative action.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28d3d607-0e24-4b8d-9f7d-ad8cdaa9d818": {"__data__": {"id_": "28d3d607-0e24-4b8d-9f7d-ad8cdaa9d818", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db7c397f75e5c1ba7e13632e3bc8f06d17465ff9d88f50dce889005801aea536"}, "2": {"node_id": "3aaa9c19-4b9c-4994-8e79-2d24e156100b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84944812dd5af0391b064e15e69f1df5673245b403badd919f971bc986516bd3"}}, "hash": "9e86f270d351209d332cf269be927e2cc1ea3e2c5572dfa5540ac1fe699a6df1", "text": "In Timor-Leste, from April to June 2009, UNDP in partnership with the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights undertook a \u201cHuman Rights Capacity Building of the Provedoria for Human Rights and Justice\u201d (PDHJ) to strengthen the human rights capacity of the PDHJ and to ensure its effectiveness in developing and implementing human rights programmes.

The potential synergies between the MDGs and human rights are widely recognised by civil society, UN agencies and even governments, who affirmed that \u2018respect for and promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of effective work towards achieving the MDGs\u2019 at the MDG Summit held in New York in September 2010.318 However, translating this recognition into changes in the practice of development actors has presented challenges. Actors in the human rights field have generally advocated for a \u2018human rights based approach\u2019 to the MDGs,319 which, broadly speaking, focuses on four key areas: (1) targeting marginalised and excluded groups; (2) facilitating community participation in decision-making; (3) prioritising human rights in policy choices and resource allocation; and (4) ensuring accountability and remedies for human rights violations. National human rights institutions (NHRIs) are frequently cited as a key element in a human rights based approach to the MDGs.320 However, the rationale for this claim is 315 * The author would like to thank Pip Dargan, Chris Sidoti and Victoria Wisniewski Otero for their invaluable feedback in reviewing this chapter.ESCAP, ADB & UNDP, Paths to 2015: MDG Priorities in Asia and the Pacific, 2011, p.3. 316 Ibid., at p.8. 317 For most countries in region the Gini coefficient, the standard measure of inequality, is not only high but has been increasing.

More recently, the commission in Bangladesh commenced its work after a lengthy formation process and a commission was established in Myanmar, though it is still in the early stages of development and does not currently meet the internationally recognised criteria for NHRIs. Japan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Taiwan and Vanuatu are exploring steps to establish institutions and there is support for considering such an institution among various actors in China. The growth of NHRIs in the Asia Pacific\u2014a region whose size, diversity and political dynamics have hampered efforts to set up pan-regional human rights infrastructure\u2014 suggests that, in contrast to other regions, national leaders have preferred to respond to human rights concerns by \u2018alter[ing] domestic political structures\u2019.322 However, the 321 Parlevliet, M, \u2018National Human Rights Institutions and Peace Agreements: establishing national institutions in divided societies\u2019, International Council on Human Rights Policy Working Paper, 2006, at p.2.

In 2009, for example, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) established an Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 137 motivations for and contexts in which NHRIs in the region have been established vary significantly. To begin with, a broad correlation can be seen between democratisation and the establishment of NHRIs. The establishment of a human rights commission was a major outcome of democratic reform in the Philippines and Thailand; with both commissions strongly entrenched in new constitutions.323 In other cases such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Maldives, the establishment of an NHRI preceded later democratic reform; indicating NHRIs can operate relatively effectively under authoritarian or semi-authoritarian systems.324 Finally, reflecting the trend internationally, countries transitioning from conflict have also established NHRIs in an effort to prevent a return to the atrocities of the past, leading some commentators to describe NHRIs as the \u2018hallmark of democratic legitimacy\u2019 for countries transitioning from conflict.325 The peace agreement in Afghanistan provided for the establishment of a national human rights institution,326 as did the mandate of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).327 Despite the vastly different political and social contexts where NHRIs in the region have been established, there is notable uniformity in their form. This may be explained by well documented influence the international community has had in promoting the establishment of NHRIs.328 In the Asia Pacific, governments adopted a regional framework for technical cooperation on human rights in 1998. Known as the Tehran Framework, it was built on four \u2018pillars\u2019, namely to develop: national human rights institutions; national human rights action plans; human rights education; and the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development.329 Of the four pillars, the establishment of NHRIs in the region has been considered the greatest success.330 More significantly, perhaps, NHRIs in the region have themselves mobilised to form a robust transnational network. Established in 1996, the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF) is a membership organisation of NHRIs.

In relation to the judiciary, NHRIs can assist victims to seek legal redress; refer cases to competent tribunals; or participate in legal proceedings as amicus curiae.

Targeting marginalised and excluded groups Though the MDGs contain no explicit obligation to reduce socio-economic disparities, development actors have increasingly recognised the need to tackle inequalities in order to accelerate progress towards the MDGs. Equality and non-discrimination are core principles of international human rights law and so form a key element of a human rights based approach to the MDGs. NHRIs have exercised different functions, in particular their reporting function, to highlight uneven progress on the MDGs and to uncover hidden disadvantages faced by particular groups when looking at national averages. In Malaysia, for example, the Human Rights Commission (SUKAHAM) partnered with UNDP Malaysia and the Economics Faculty at the National University of Malaysia to disaggregate data used in the 2005 MDG Report in order to uncover \u2018red pockets\u2019 of poverty and shape 346 Committee on Economic, Social & Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 10 The role of national human rights institutions in the protection of economic, social and cultural rights, 14 December 1998, UN Doc.

The disaggregated data shows the geographically remote indigenous communities of Sabah, and Sarawak had internal poverty rates as high as 20%, which is disproportionate compared to the national average of 5%. Over the next 18 months, SUHAKAM and UNDP carried out advocacy activities in a variety of fora, including formal submissions to the Economic Planning Unit as it developed the Ninth Malaysian Five Year Development Plan. The plan was the first to specifically address the plight of indigenous peoples and included \u2018ambitious poverty and equity targets\u2019. As a result, novel budgetary allocations have been made to the Sarawak and Sabah regions.347 Facilitating community participation in decision-making A second element of a human rights based approach to the MDGs is citizens\u2019 right to meaningfully participate in developing, implementing and monitoring the policies, programmes and strategies enacted to meet the MDGs. This, in turn, increases legitimacy of the MDG agenda at the national level. As Amnesty International stresses, States must also fulfil a number of other rights and duties for the right to participate to be meaningful. These include rights to freedom of expression and association and access to information, as well as the duty to facilitate conditions where human rights defenders can work.348 The Commonwealth Guidelines on Best Practice for National Institutions highlights facilitating citizens\u2019 participation in public affairs as a key activity for NHRIs. Specifically, the guidelines advise that NHRIs should: work towards facilitating public awareness of government policies relating to economic and social rights and encourage the involvement of various sectors of society in the formulation, implementation and review of relevant policies.349 Some NHRIs have focused on facilitating participation in development processes, in particular at the community level. For example, between 2008 and 2010 the Commission on Human Rights Commission of the Philippines (CHRP) and New Zealand Human Rights Commission (NZHRC) conducted a two-year bilateral project. The project used a community development approach to assist three indigenous communities in the Philippines to identify and prioritise human rights issues and implement plans to address them. Economic, social and cultural rights issues were raised by all three communities, including concerns such as high levels of illiteracy; loss of livelihoods; malnourishment of children; and lack of professional health workers, health centres and medicine.350 At the end of the project, the Mayor of a municipality where one of the communities 347 HuriLINK Website, \u2018Malaysia\u2014Detail\u2019.

OHCHR notes that while a human rights based approach to the MDGs does not dictate what policies should be adopted or how resources should be allocated, it does provide a framework for assessing the reasonableness of such choices. In particular, by showing whether a particular policy or resource decision will: \u2022\ufffd result in other human rights being violated; \u2022\ufffd cause an absolute decline in the realisation of rights, contravening the principle of non-retrogression; \u2022\ufffd be adequately directed towards realising human rights and ensuring equality, including gender equality; or \u2022\ufffd provide adequate resources and allow sufficient policy space.352 As noted above, NHRIs perform a range of advisory functions to government. Through these functions they assess laws, policies, practices and budgets against this framework. To begin with, NHRIs have exercised their advisory role to ensure the national legal framework provides clear, legally binding, standards on economic, social and cultural rights. At a fundamental level, this includes advocating constitutional protections for these rights. For example, in Nepal, economic, social and cultural rights are protected in the Interim Constitution and the National Human Rights Commission advocates for their continued protection, as the process of agreeing on a final constitution progresses.353 More broadly, NHRIs review proposed laws and policies in development-related areas, such as social protection, livelihood security and poverty reduction to determine compliance with human rights principles and standards. For example, in 2010 the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) reviewed a draft bill on the protection of destitute persons and families. AIHRC provided comments and recommendations aimed at improving legislation in accordance with international human rights standards. These recommendations were largely accepted and incorporated into the final law.354 351 Ibid., at p.13. 352 OHCHR, Claiming the MDGs, above note 5, at p.12. 353 Interview with Commissioner Gauri Praham, Geneva, Switzerland, 18 May 2011. 354 AIHRC, (2010/2011) First Quarterly Report, p.7.

In the Philippines, for example, CHRP is the convener of committee on implementing the country\u2019s development plan.356 In other cases, policy guidance can come from a country\u2019s human rights action plan. Several countries in the region have adopted such plans, with NHRIs playing a key role in their development.357 Recommendations made in the context of specific investigations can also guide policy. In India, for example, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) developed a \u2018National Action Plan to Operationalise the Right to Health Care\u2019 in 2004. The plan contained extensive recommendations for reforming the health sector, such as enacting a public health services act; defining a list of essential services to be offered at each tier of the health system; increasing the central government\u2019s budgetary provisions for public health to 3% of GDP; and setting up a health services regulatory authority.358 Specifically, NHRIs can identify and encourage states to adopt national targets and indicators for framing development policies reflecting their obligations to progressively realise economic, social and cultural rights. Recognising concerns raised by human rights actors about global targets set by the MDGs,359 OHCHR suggests States: \u2022\ufffd adapt current indicators to human rights: e.g. disaggregate data to show marginalisation; \u2022\ufffd add complementary indicators to measure existing MDG targets: i.e. include indicators measuring the efforts a state has taken as well as outcomes it has achieved; or \u2022\ufffd identify additional indicators for new targets.360 In this light, the National Human Rights Commission of Nepal convened a working group on economic, social and cultural rights in 2009 made up of representatives from the various national commissions, government, civil society and OHCHR.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b164bc4-7a6b-40ce-b8e0-233b59422438": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b164bc4-7a6b-40ce-b8e0-233b59422438", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78c5a6260a7746af178f7945f4193d8550e803341d49439158aed1c68b705fd6"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e7725c6-c817-4086-accc-038ce3acbf0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f965a6224a3a98197b46a4e0a6c82d7e7cfe448efa597349f1860e6b7460ef5"}}, "hash": "a40fd7f7e3c163b40968fcf974b4e4b6ae0660c6ddb0543846746016bb44770c", "text": "Through consultations with local, national and international stakeholders, the working group identified indicators for the rights to food, housing, health, education and work that would be applicable to the national context.361 A user guide for the indicators was released in September 2011 and the commission expects the indicators to \u2018actively assist policy makers in the formulation of improved plans, programmes and policies to improve the enjoyment of these fundamental human rights in Nepal\u2019.362 355 UNDP, Making the Link, above note 5, at p.26. 356 Interview with Loretta Rosales, Chairperson, Geneva, Switzerland, 19 May 2011. 357 Burdekin, above note 21, at p.91. 358 See NHRC Website, \u2018Recommendations of National Action Plan to Operationalise the Right to Health", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7c5bfb6-58a8-4e82-a688-f23c880b4971": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7c5bfb6-58a8-4e82-a688-f23c880b4971", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ae3530466cf52e08580643d0c02d244b5f845fb4d3df8f144e915afbd71115a"}, "3": {"node_id": "82b11c5a-1a58-4099-99e3-55dde7f6ae18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67dee622dfcf7c35a3230f86d54f2bb713ab8d83e2478a6ef3c096e7c35c55d2"}}, "hash": "aafd091e66a65da5a01c8078f1e84ed184ed02749d3d0cbeed2175c75f89664b", "text": "Care.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 145 Finally, NHRIs can also evaluate whether resources allocated to sectors relevant to the MDGs, such as agriculture, education, health, water and sanitation, the environment, land and housing, employment and infrastructure reflect the government\u2019s obligation to allocate maximum available resources to economic, social and cultural rights. For example, in Jordan the National Centre for Human Rights conducted an initial study reviewing the budgetary allocations for health, education and employment between 2000 \u2013 2010. The study raised issues about downward trends in spending, which the Centre recommended be the subject of further research.363 To date, budget analysis has been an underutilised tool by NHRIs. However, it is encouraging that other institutions in the region, such as the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives and the Mongolian Human Rights Commission, have expressed interest in conducting this kind of work in the future.364 Ensuring accountability and remedies for human rights violations At the international level, monitoring states\u2019 efforts to meet the MDGs is generally limited to voluntary reports submitted by states themselves for a largely external audience, which, Amnesty International notes, \u2018lack an in depth assessment of progress\u2019 and are not updated with sufficient frequency.365 As a consequence, the concept of accountability \u2018often equated with monitoring and evaluation\u2019, is not always particularly strong.366 For this reason, accountability mechanisms built into the human rights system can provide important oversight of activities undertaken to meet the MDGs. In terms of national accountability, NHRIs\u2019 quasi-judicial function has been frequently highlighted as a key redress mechanism in the context of a human rights based approach to the MDGs.367 Indeed, a significant number of complaints received by NHRIs concern development-related rights violations. In India, for example, NHRC reported that in 2010 it investigated complaints on environmental pollution, facilities in hospitals, development- related displacement, and the denial of education.368 Beyond individual complaints, NHRIs\u2019 investigatory function make them uniquely placed to look into systemic or structural dysfunctions that create, perpetuate or exacerbate rights violations and inhibit progress towards the MDGs. Some institutions have exercised this function by conducting national 363 NCHR & UNDP, The actual Expenditure of the Jordanian Government Budgets on Education, health and Employment, an evaluative study: 2000-2010, 2011, Executive Summary, pp.7-8. 364 Email correspondence dated 31 October 2011 and 4 November 2011, respectively. 365 Amnesty International, above note 5, at p.11. 366 OHCHR, UNICEF & Norwegian Centre for Human Rights, Human Rights and MDGs in Practice: A review of country strategies and reporting, 2010, p.29. 367 See note 6 above. 368 NHRC, Activities of the National Human Rights Commission of India for the year 2010-2011, 2011, para.13.

Following the decision, other provincial councils voluntarily annulled similar resolutions and migrants have since been able to register for services.372 NHRIs also play a key role in terms of international accountability. Independent information provided by an NHRI can carry considerable authority either to corroborate or challenge the state\u2019s interpretation of its performance. At the same time, states should, theoretically, be more receptive to international critique if it is underpinned by information gathered by an official process at the national level. Further, as international mechanisms lack comprehensive follow up procedures at the national level, NHRIs are also an important part of promoting implementation of their recommendations. 369 See Burdekin, above note 21, at pp.87-90. The Australian Human Rights Commission pioneered this methodology and has conducted many national inquiries over the past 30 years, most of them on economic, social and cultural rights issues (e.g. on child homelessness, mental illness, rural and remote education). 370 NHRC Website, \u2018Public Hearings on Access to Health Care Delivery System\u2019.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 147 In practice, international human rights mechanisms have not to date played a prominent role systemically monitoring states\u2019 efforts to meet the MDGs,373 and NHRIs\u2019 interaction with the UN human rights system in relation to economic, social and cultural rights is still maturing. Nevertheless, some institutions in the region, including New Zealand, Afghanistan, Australia, Korea, and the Philippines, have submitted information to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in recent years and the Committee has increasingly included references to NHRIs in its concluding observations. Likewise, a number of special procedure mandate holders have noted positive engagement with NHRIs on economic, social and cultural rights, particularly in the context of country visits. A particular mechanism NHRIs have actively engaged in at the international level is the universal periodic review (UPR) process. In 2010 and 2011 the institutions of Australia, the Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand and Timor-Leste made submissions on their country\u2019s human rights record. These reports generally did not comment on the country\u2019s MDG performance explicitly. However, economic, social and cultural rights issues featured prominently. As well as reporting on the level of enjoyment of particular rights (e.g. literacy and school enrolment rates for marginalised groups374), the reports frequently commented on gaps or weaknesses in laws, policies and programmes (e.g. the lack of inter-ministerial cooperation to control the quality of supplies for school feeding programs375) and made recommendations for addressing these. A number of economic, social and cultural rights issues raised by NHRIs in their reports were taken up by members of the Human Rights Council in their interventions during debate on the country\u2019s report and were subsequently reflected in recommendations to the government; which were frequently accepted by the government. To ensure the accepted recommendations are actually implemented, a number of NHRIs in the region have convened committees to monitor progress. For example, SUHAKAM reported on the implementation of Malaysia\u2019s UPR recommendations to the Human Rights Council in September 2011. The report acknowledged progress on a number of economic, social and cultural rights issues, while also highlighting areas that require further attention.376 The institutional significance of national institutions NHRIs in the Asia Pacific have been subtly \u2018redefining the state\u2019s agenda\u2019 in relation to economic, social and cultural rights; creating \u2018new rules\u2019 for state agencies to follow; holding governments to account for their actions, and \u2018shifting social expectations\u2019 about 373 Amnesty International, above note 5, at p.14.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25f8bb0a-d767-4139-a4b8-7a1aeb458524": {"__data__": {"id_": "25f8bb0a-d767-4139-a4b8-7a1aeb458524", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c8ec0bceb4f7ca46718addc125f5f474f2afd2ea97380e28bf1882470ae5500"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab2b408a-42f9-4ec9-a50e-a2aa13b78836", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c04cfda263f6b37882ea3bb70c1f07d02969c3de66fbbfab9f45a49c584fcefb"}}, "hash": "0e3f07e1bf88e039d917f97e4b98dbb4330dfaa0817386c878da1907885ed925", "text": "374 National Human Rights Commission of Nepal, National Women Commission of Nepal & National Dalit Commission of Nepal, The Report of the NHRI of Nepal on the UPR Processes, 2010, para.31. 375 PHRJ, Joint submission of the Office of the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice and civil society organisations in Timor-Leste, 2011, para.9. 376 SUHAKAM, Information presented by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia to the Eighteenth Session of the Human Rights Council, 6 September 2011, UN Doc.

First, NHRIs bridge the divide between the national, regional and international human rights systems, having formal recognition in all arenas. Their national legislative basis provides a legally defined relationship with the state\u2014one which gives them specific duties and powers in relation to international human rights law. Because NHRIs take UN human rights instruments as their core frame of reference, a \u2018triangular\u2019 relationship exists between international human rights systems, the state and the NHRI, with information flowing to and from each point.379 NHRIs could help increase the prominence of the MDGs on the international human rights agenda by encouraging states to address the MDGs in reports to the UN human rights instruments, as well as by explicitly linking activities to the realisation of specific MDGs in their own reports to these instruments. Second, NHRIs bridge the divide between government and civil society.380 Thus, as Okafor and Agbakwa argue, the value of an NHRI comes not just from \u2018what it does\u2019, but also from \u2018what other agents are able to do with it\u2019.381 Again, the fact that NHRIs take human rights treaties as their core mandate is \u2018strategically vital\u2019 in this respect. On the one hand it bolsters them against attempts to co-opt human rights by the state. On the other hand, it limits \u2018extreme definitions of human rights\u2019 by civil society groups that risk provoking conservative reactions.382 In this light, NHRIs in the region have convened effective interactions between duty bearers, civil society and rights holders about the MDGs. SUHAKAM, for example, co-organized a High-Level Policy Dialogue on \u2018A Human Rights Perspective on MDGs and Beyond\u2019 with UNDP in 2005, creating space for different actors to voice their concerns about issues and challenges as well as brainstorming recommendations related to the MDGs in Malaysia.383 This \u2018convening\u2019 role will again be crucial ensuring genuine local participation for defining a human rights based development agenda post-2015. Third, NHRIs bridge the artificial divide between civil, political, economic and social rights; both in the NHRI mandate and in practice.

To begin with, an institution should have a clear mandate and defined powers to address economic, social and cultural rights. However, despite the strong focus on economic and social rights in the \u2018Asian values\u2019 discourse, few states in the region have enacted strong, legally enforceable, constitutional provisions on economic and social rights, instead defining them as directive principles guiding government policy.388 This has a flow on effect for the work of the country\u2019s institution. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted while the establishment of an NHRI is one step a state can take 384 Ibid, at 76. 385 CHRP & NZHRC, above note 36, at p.15. 386 NHRC, Human Rights Situation in Thailand: paper by the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand submitted to the UN Human Rights Council under the UPR Process, para.16 387 Burdekin, above note 21, at p.84. 388 E.g. in Thailand, economic and social rights are covered under \u2018Directive Principles of Fundamental State Policies\u2019, which are not justicable. 150 National Human Rights Institutions to progressively realise the Covenant\u2019s rights, this role \u2018has too often either not been accorded to the institution or has been neglected or given a low priority by it\u2019.389 The Commonwealth Secretariat nevertheless counsels NHRIs to: employ all available means to respond to inquiries related to the advancement of economic, social and cultural rights, whether or not [their] enabling statute or national constitutions recognise [such] rights as justicable.390 NHRIs in the region have indeed done this. In India for example, the commission is mandated to address rights \u2018embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India\u2019.391 Although the only rights enforceable in Indian courts are \u2018fundamental rights\u2019 enshrined in the Constitution, the commission has followed the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the right to life as encompassing a broader range of economic and social rights. In the Philippines, the CHRP only has powers to investigate human rights violations \u2018involving civil and political rights.\u2019 The Supreme Court ruled this to be an exclusion of economic, social and cultural rights.392 However, the CHRP has adopted a system of \u2018investigative monitoring\u2019, enabling it to respond to a large number of complaints concerning economic and social rights by drawing on its other powers.393 Secondly, an institution requires organisational capacity to deal with economic, social and cultural rights. According to OHCHR, many NHRIs lack an \u2018understanding of the legal nature and content of economic, social and cultural rights\u2019.394 Staff may recognise the importance of indivisibility and interdependence of rights. However, they may be insufficiently trained to deal with economic, social and cultural rights issues. On top of this, building institutional capacity on development-related issues may be given a lower to priority compared to building capacity on more urgent \u2018core\u2019 protection issues, such as torture, summary executions, arbitrary detention and disappearances.395 Accordingly, while many NHRIs have successfully influenced public policy in the political sphere, their voices have been less prominent in the socio-economic sphere. Engaging in debates affecting employment, health, housing, social security, and education requires knowledge of how these issues manifest. However, complex social arrangements, legal systems, and economic structures give rise to violations in the context of economic and 389 CESCR, above note 32. 390 Commonwealth Secretariat, National Human Rights Institutions: Best Practice, 2001, p.33. 391 Section 2(d) of the Protection of Human Rights Act 1993 (emphasis added). 392 Quisumbig, P, \u2018The Protection Role of the Philippines Human Rights Commission\u2019, in Ramcharan, B ed.

In practice, knowledge regarding the impact of economic and fiscal policies on rights\u2014 beyond a basic understanding of how the economy works and how public finance is organised\u2014varies significantly from institution to institution, depending on availability of resources and staff expertise. While NHRIs in the region have sought to contrast governments\u2019 corporatist, state-capitalist or neoliberal development models with a more egalitarian vision, their recommendations have not always been in tune with the country\u2019s economic realities. For example, in a background paper on the role of NHRIs on the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s, the APF quoted an analysis concluding: It is clearly premature to analyse the impact of the crisis on poverty or on the distribution of income and wealth in any of the severely affected ASEAN economies\u2026. While few serious commentators doubt there will be a sharp fall in household incomes\u2026it is far from clear how the decline will affect different regions, and different socio-economic groups.396 The discussion paper asked, in these circumstances, how well equipped are NHRIs to contribute to the formulation of responses to these claims? What do NHRIs\u2019 own statistics, experience and contacts have to say about actual impacts of a crisis or some systemic problem underlying violations of economic and social rights? Do NHRIs have data that can be used to quantify the consequences and identify the groups particularly affected? The paper concluded it was unclear whether or not NHRIs would be sufficiently equipped to formulate a response to this complexity; an issue of equal relevance in the context of the MDGs. In the context of the MDGs, conceptual challenges in operationalising a human rights based approach go beyond NHRIs. As Philip Alston emphasises, hesitating to use a human rights framework is \u2018deeply entrenched\u2019 and development actors resisting change towards a human rights based approach is based on more than ignorance.397 The reason for this stems, in part, from the fact that a human rights based approach is not prescriptive. It does not provide clear answers. This is especially true in debates about macro-economic policy. In Asia, \u2018more conventional economic policies for promoting growth in the short-to-medium term are still often centre-stage\u2019, with an emphasis on macroeconomic stability, trade liberalisation, foreign investment, infrastructure, privatisation and commercialisation; the 396 APF, Theme Paper: National Human Rights Institutions and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, presented to the Fourth Annual Meeting of the APF, 1999, p.9.

However, as NHRIs\u2019 advisory functions are generally spelt out in very broad terms, most have not developed the \u2018skill set\u2019 required to engage in this area. An institution\u2019s ability to engage with key stakeholders on complex debates will also depend on the dynamic of its external relationships. Anne Smith describes these relationships as moving \u2018downwards\u2019 to partners, beneficiaries and supporters and \u2018upwards to government\u2019, parliament and funders.399 By virtue of their \u2018unique\u2019 place between government and civil society, the central challenge for NHRIs, as Smith articulates, is to guard their independence, but at the same time maintain constructive relationships with both. To begin with, it is important to remember NHRIs generally lack powers to enforce recommendations. This means when the interest of a government department is not to implement recommendations, they simply won\u2019t.

It is important external support to NHRIs not \u2018reorient accountability upward, away from the grassroots, supporters and staff\u2019.406 Cooperative relationships with civil society groups, recognised in the Paris Principles as integral to NHRIs\u2019 legitimacy, are essential if NHRIs are to effectively promote a participatory approach to the MDGs. Nevertheless, such relationships can be quite complex in practice. On one hand, NHRIs depend on civil society to build pressure for the implementation of recommendations. At the same time, NHRIs must remain independent from NGOs if they are to be an effective channel through which the community\u2019s grievances can be brought to the attention of the government. As a result of this duality, it is not uncommon for NHRIs and NGOs to differ in their opinions about the appropriate role for the NHRI. Philip Alston rightly raises the concern that calls for participation in the MDG process risk becoming hollow and tokenistic if they do not spell out what this means in practice.407 In the Asia Pacific region, NHRIs and civil society sought to articulate practical channels for participation in the Kandy Programme of Action, adopted in 1999. The Declaration calls for the adoption of processes and mechanisms ensuring NHRIs engagement in transparent, inclusive and substantive consultation with NGOs.408 While a number of NHRIs have established such mechanisms and processes,409 NGOs in the region have expressed concern that NHRIs sometimes remain \u2018cosmetic\u2019 and have urged serious consideration be given to how such mechanisms and processes (which should themselves be established in a participatory manner) can be real and relevant.410 More and more, UNDP has provided crucial support to NHRIs. In January 2008, 94 UNDP country offices reported active working relationships with NHRIs, providing resources, capacity, and expertise\u2014including legal and management expertise. In many cases, this occurred in partnership with OHCHR in conglomeration with an international or relevant 405 OHCHR Website, \u2018OHCHR and NHRIs\u2019.

This might include encouraging NHRIs to more explicitly focus on the MDGs, for example when reporting to international human rights mechanisms.

This could include assisting NHRIs when carrying out capacity needs assessments, which UNDP, OHCHR and APF have been doing in the Asia Pacific since 2008. Such assessments support APF member institutions to identify current capacities with room for growth, in order to fulfil the NHRI mandate by promoting and protecting human rights at the national level. To date, these assessments have been conducted with the NHRIs of Afghanistan, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Palestine and Thailand.413 It might also include assisting an institution to seek greater harmonisation among its donors.

In relation to an institution\u2019s external relationships, UNDP is uniquely placed to help coordinate an \u2018inter-institutional\u2019 approach to strengthening a country\u2019s democratic institutions. As noted above, NHRIs are but one of a number of national accountability mechanisms. Parliament, the courts, the media, and civil society must also be functioning. However, international assistance tends to focus on a particular mechanism, without focusing on improving the relational dynamics between them. Most importantly, by virtue of UNDP\u2019s mandate to mainstream human rights into development activities, UNDP is in a strong position to support NHRIs build relationships outside the human rights and good governance fields. At the national level, entry points for UNDP might include building relationships with government ministries in finance, planning or infrastructure so NHRIs are a recognised stakeholder involved in the planning cycle for development plans or poverty reduction cycles. At the international level, one entry point might be to support NHRIs meaningful participation in the development of a country\u2019s United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), as suggested by the toolkit.415 Another entry point might be to promote linkages between NHRIs\u2019 reporting functions and MDG-related reporting, such as proposed \u2018compacts\u2019 between country governments and all major development partners recommended by the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health.416 Conclusion Despite being relative newcomers in the field, NHRIs in the Asia Pacific have established themselves as unique actors within the human rights system.

Nevertheless, NHRI activity in the area is still emerging. NHRIs have not always met high expectations placed on them to guide governments towards a human rights based approach to development. However, this has not generally been because of any fundamental weakness in NHRIs\u2019 mandates. More often, it is because of institutional weakness, competing priorities, limited resources or a lack of expertise and effective working methods. While NHRIs can build on the analytical capacity developed in relation to civil and political rights and to some extent, overcome institutional weaknesses, identifying appropriate supplementary methodologies and approaches for addressing economic, social and cultural rights and allocating priority to their implementation is crucial. UNDP has a key role to play in this respect. Alongside supporting NHRIs in the development of their internal capacity to holistically address the full spectrum of rights, UNDP can aid NHRIs by strengthening relationships with national and international development partners. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 157 The MDGs and Human Rights: An Indigenous Peoples Perspective Rajat Khosla** 1. Background and Context There are over 370 million indigenous peoples from 90 countries, living in all regions of the world. While they constitute 5 per cent of the world\u2019s population, indigenous peoples account for 15 per cent of the world\u2019s poor. Indigenous peoples are disproportionately represented among the poor and extremely poor, their levels of access to adequate health and education services are well below national averages, and they are especially vulnerable to the consequences of environmental degradation.417 Indigenous peoples have unique cultures and distinct world views. Their development needs and aspirations may differ from the mainstream population. The indigenous peoples approach to development is based on principles of respect for and preservation of land, natural resources and all elements of the natural environment; consensus in decision- making; mutual respect for peoples\u2019 values and ideology, including sovereignty over land, resources and the environment under natural law.418 Additional emphasis is placed on recognition as distinct peoples, and development must encompass the social, cultural, political and institutional dimensions of their identity and rights. This is not based on economic or monetary value, but on a holistic approach incorporating collective, spiritual and cultural values, shaped and informed by indigenous priorities on development. Equal worth and dignity of indigenous peoples can only be assured by recognition and protection of their individual and collective rights. The dominant development discourse does not adequately respond to these aspirations and needs of indigenous peoples. Major development projects often do not take into account fundamental interests of indigenous peoples and result in violations of their human rights. Full, meaningful and effective participation of indigenous peoples in development is generally not considered.419 Many argue this interpretation of development ** Rajat Khosla currently works as the ESCR Policy Coordinator with the Demand Dignity and ESCR Programme of Amnesty International.

In many developing countries, the MDG framework has brought different social groups to work towards the common development agenda. Globally, indigenous peoples are severely affected by poverty yet they have not been given enough attention in MDG-related processes.421 Indigenous peoples have the right to benefit from the MDGs and fulfil aspirations contained in the UN Millennium Declaration to the same extent as others.

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples On 13 September 2007, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the UN General Assembly424.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 159 recent and comprehensive instrument addressing the rights of indigenous peoples, and was drafted and debated for more than twenty years before being adopted by the General Assembly in 2007. It is the only international human rights instrument adopted with substantive participation and consent of indigenous peoples from all continents of the globe. The Declaration recognises the rights of indigenous peoples to live in dignity, to maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures, laws and traditions and to pursue self- determined development, in keeping with their own needs and aspirations.425 It does not accord any new rights to indigenous peoples; it reiterates and reaffirms internationally recognized rights and places them in the context and reality of indigenous peoples. The Declaration was adopted to address the historic injustices and centuries of colonization and dispossession of their lands, territories and resources, thus preventing them from exercising, in particular, their right to development in accordance with their own needs and interests.426 The right of indigenous peoples to exist as distinct peoples has been reiterated in the Declaration. The Declaration provides guidance to States in the development of a cooperative relationship with indigenous peoples living within their boundaries, to promote and protect their human rights, including their right to a distinct identity as peoples. Article 1 of the Declaration specifies that indigenous peoples have the right to full enjoyment, as a collective and as individuals, of all human rights under international human rights law. Article 1 prohibits discrimination against indigenous peoples and promotes their full and effective participation in all matters of concern. Article 3 recognises the right to self-determination of indigenous peoples, and their right to freely pursue political status as well as freely pursue economic, social and cultural development. The Declaration is a landmark legislation that signifies a shift in attitudes and understanding on indigenous issues, providing a remarkable tool to ensure greater recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples to determine their own priorities for development, and the MDGs are specific indicators that can move this process forward. To achieve full realisation of the rights contained in the Declaration, countries need to adopt participatory approaches to indigenous issues, based on effective consultations and partnerships with indigenous peoples. 3.

This section examines MDGs from the perspective of rights of indigenous peoples. 3.1. Poverty, hunger and indigenous peoples (Goal 1) Approximately 370 million people in the world identify themselves as indigenous. These people belong to more than 5000 indigenous groups in some 90 countries.431 It is estimated that whereas indigenous peoples represent 5 per cent of the world\u2019s population, they represent 15 per cent of the world\u2019s poorest people.432 Despite being among the world\u2019s poorest, indigenous peoples in many countries may not be included in one-half of the people lifted from extreme poverty by 2015.433 Furthermore, there are specific groups who are particularly disadvantaged. As pointed out by the UNFPII in its 3rd Session in 2006: \u201cIndigenous women throughout the world are among the most marginalized groups, suffering discrimination not only on the basis of gender, but also on the basis of race, culture and class as well [\u2026]. Top down and paternalistic approaches to development have provided a social and economic environment whereby indigenous women have suffered from the effects of poverty, the breakdown of traditional social mechanisms and institutions, violence and militarization, dislocation and migration, and the depletion of their natural environment and resources\u201d. Indigenous poverty is multi-dimensional, highlighting the process of impoverishment caused by dispossession of indigenous peoples from ancestral lands, loss of control over their natural resources and indigenous knowledge, forced assimilation into mainstream 427 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Resource Kit on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008, p.23. 428 Ibid., p.31. 429 Background Note for the International Expert Group Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals, Indigenous Participation and Good Governance, New York, 11-13 January 2006, UNPFII/2006/WS.3/7. 430 UN General Assembly, Outcome Document of the High level Meeting of the General Assembly, 2010, para 55. 431 http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/mdgs.html 432 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Resource Kit on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008, p.10. 433 MRG, Minority and Indigenous Peoples Rights in the Millennium Development Goals, 2003.

Further, lack of up-to-date, disaggregated data on indigenous peoples is increasingly recognized as a major obstacle in addressing indigenous poverty. Therefore, a need exists to develop culturally sensitive indicators in partnership with indigenous peoples. In recent years, UNPFII has promoted the development of indicators in terms of well-being, poverty and sustainability of indigenous peoples. As a result, in the last four years a project was undertaken by SPFII and other UN agencies \u2013 IFAD, CBD \u2013 together with indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations to establish such indicators through a participatory process. A global synthesis report was presented at the seventh session of the UNPFII and efforts to test and further these indicators continue.436 Article 1 of the UNDRIPs emphasizes that \u201cIndigenous peoples have the right to full enjoyment, as a collective or as individuals, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized in the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights law.\u201d437 The recognition of indigenous peoples as distinct peoples and the respect for their individual and collective human rights, rights to lands and territories and sustainable use of natural resources are crucial for reducing poverty among indigenous peoples. Participation of indigenous peoples in designing and formulating PRSPs as well as in the implementation and monitoring processes should therefore be ensured.438 Some indigenous groups are facing greater vulnerability because of threatened access to ancestral lands.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a44dd3c4-5a33-4483-abac-24340ee44714": {"__data__": {"id_": "a44dd3c4-5a33-4483-abac-24340ee44714", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7674cce820a35af4c47386cdc3a88ec112f5694fca48b7e78b6e08500594696"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2dbe589-9c11-4a54-897f-37fcf388970e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aaab252aedb6ad9d7680af1f302860ab6fd887e8bba5939b1d34c652c5ac4d8e"}}, "hash": "92fd98d99409f0474003e2d24129a3dea772a960b6bbb580dbd64fe0b533d891", "text": "439 This denial of access to lands because of large development projects, migration, climate change and war has dwindled natural resources leading to malnutrition and food insecurity.

Many studies confirm that poverty and extreme poverty among indigenous communities can be traced back to colonization and the continued and systematic discrimination and denial of recognition of individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples.441 Internal colonization perpetuated by states aimed at assimilating indigenous groups undermined their autonomy and local sovereignty and further perpetuated poverty among these groups.442 Legislations, such as those relating to land and natural resource management, have ignored indigenous peoples systems and practices and have contributed to the chronic poverty among indigenous peoples.443 At the 2010 High-level Summit, States agreed to accelerate progress on challenges faced by indigenous peoples in the context of food security. In this regard, States agreed to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples.444 In some countries there are initiatives underway to restore land and resource rights amongst indigenous peoples. For instance, in India, one of the first projects dealing with securing lad and resources rights was the Orissa Tribal Development Project. It had a component for land surveying which regularized tilling of lands with slopes above 10 degrees. Land settlement schemes led to the distribution of 17,175 dongar (hill) lands to the 6837 tribals. Titles were provided to the spouses and these were registered in the names of wife and husband. The collective rights of the Orissa tribe over community and forest land were also recognized. This was completed even before passage of the Panchayat Raj Act in 1996. This Act gives the rights of ownership of minor forest products to the respective Gram Sabhas and is inclusive of all the reserved forest areas since it is applicable to all scheduled areas.445 3.2. Achieve universal primary education (Goal 2) The rate of illiteracy among indigenous peoples is usually higher than other groups.446 Accessing quality education is particularly difficult for indigenous children. There are several interrelated obstacles such as distance to schools, differences in lifestyles, nomadic and semi-nomadic communities, discrimination, violence, extreme poverty and 441 Joji Carino, \u201cIndigenous Peoples, Human Rights and Poverty\u201d, Indigenous Perspectives, vol 7 No.1, p.37. 442 Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, Indigenous Peoples and the Millennium Development Goals, Civil Society Perspectives on MDGs, Tebtebba, 2005, p.64.

Indigenous peoples have fewer years of schooling and less access to education and vocational training compared to the majority of the population. Further, indigenous educational systems are often not recognized at the same level as the mainstream system. Indigenous educational systems have generally been disregarded by the mainstream system. To remedy this, indigenous peoples are seeking to have their cultures and histories accurately portrayed in curricula, improve access to education provide teaching in their own languages and develop their own schools and universities.450 According to the CRC: The education of indigenous children contributes both to their individual and community development as well as to their participation in the wider society. Quality education enables indigenous children to exercise and enjoy economic, social and cultural rights for their personal benefit as well as for the benefit of their community. Furthermore, it strengthens children\u2019s ability to exercise their civil rights in order to influence political policy processes for improved protection of human rights. Thus, the implementation of the right to education of indigenous children is an essential means of achieving individual empowerment and self-determination of indigenous peoples.451 Indigenous world views, perspectives and history are invisible from text books and school curricula.452 Bi-lingual education, especially in the mother-tongue, is considered 447 Report on the fourth session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc.

The indigenous right to education in native languages is therefore not being adequately implemented and requires attention for realization of MDG 2. There is a need to endorse inter-cultural education to ensure equal access for indigenous children to quality and culturally appropriate primary education as stipulated in the CRC and UNDRIP.455 There is also a need to increase substantially state budgetary allocation to meet MDG 2 for indigenous children. To tackle these issues, the UNPFII in its fourth session (2005) recommend that States: \u201cEstablish effective arrangements for the participation of indigenous parents and community members in decisions regarding the planning, delivery and evaluation of education services for their children, including in the design and implementation of indigenous education at all levels, including developing appropriate teaching materials and methods\u201d. A study on lessons learned and challenges to achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education, observed examples of important existing legal provisions include those giving recognition to pluralistic systems of education, equal importance to traditional ways of teaching and learning, indigenous peoples\u2019 control over their own curricula and learning institutions, and adequate financial and infrastructure support for the implementation of these initiatives.456 Such legislations have led to the establishment of indigenous learning centres benefitting communities and allowing indigenous organisations to secure financial support from their respective Governments or interested donors. Examples of important existing education legislations include recognizing the integration of indigenous perspectives and languages into mainstream education, culturally appropriate curricula, mother-tongue-based bilingual education, intercultural education and the effective participation of indigenous peoples in designing education 453 Report on the fourth session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc.

Promote gender equality and women empowerment (Goal 3) Indigenous women face multiple forms of discrimination, based on gender, race/ethnicity and poverty.459 Violent conflicts and militarization further affect the lives of indigenous women as well as their families and communities, causing violations of human rights and displacement from ancestral lands.460 Indigenous women are one of the most marginalized groups in many countries, being victims of serious acts of discrimination and flagrant violations of fundamental rights.461 In certain communities, indigenous women have often been kept in a situation of dependency. They are often marginalized, refused access to land or subjected to other forms of discrimination. For instance, in a patriarchal society, a woman has to leave her natal home after marriage and work for her husband and his family. Consequently, parents are reluctant to send their daughters to school or to pursue higher education because this is not considered beneficial or productive. Each time that these situations are reproduced gender disparity in educational attainment of indigenous men and women increases.462 In indigenous communities, women have taken on the great responsibility of transmitting traditional knowledge, skills, and intangible heritage from one generation to the next. However, when foreign values are introduced, this conception is severely affected or even destroyed. As a result, there is a negative impact on the relationship between men and women, as well as on women\u2019s role within their communities. There has been improvement in the ratio of girls to boys in primary schools among indigenous peoples but the rate of dropouts and repetitions remain higher among girls. At the secondary school level, there are widespread disparities whereby families prioritize the education of indigenous boys over girls.463 While indigenous women and girls are important as traditional knowledge holders, they have at the same time been particularly disadvantaged in formal education systems.464 457 The General Law on Education and General Law on Linguistic Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Mexico); the Policy on complementary education for indigenous peoples (Colombia); section 6 (2) of the Constitution of South Africa; and the bilingual education policy of Australia. 458 UN Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2nd Session 2009, A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/2, 26 June 2009, para 55-56 459 IANGWE, Indigenous Women and United Nations: Good practices and lessons learned, 2006. 460 Report on the third session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc.

The status level for women is low in terms of right to inheritance, legal and political rights, decision-making powers and other spheres. One of the most acute problems faced by indigenous women is the denial of access to customary owned land. This adds to gender-based discrimination in many ways. Land scarcity among indigenous communities generally affects women more adversely than indigenous men. The inheritance laws of most indigenous peoples, including the most numerous groups such as Chakma and Santhal, tend to be discriminatory against women. The notable exceptions are in the case of Khasi in greater Sylhet and the Mandi or Garo in the plains, and to a lesser extent, the Marma in the southern Chittagong Hill Tracts. The denial of indigenous women\u2019s substantive participation in political spheres further reinforces their low status in society and their substantive invisibility in the eyes of policymakers.465 The UNDRIP and the Beijing Declaration stress the need to address the vulnerable situation of indigenous women.466 Indigenous women, while sharing many concerns in the areas of poverty, human rights, and economic and social development with other women throughout the world, also offer a distinct and important perspective on these issues, which should be a central premise for the design of policies and programmes for implementation of MDG 3. MDGs provide a strategic framework for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women, including indigenous women.467 It is also important to fully integrate gender perspectives into the implementation and monitoring of objectives associated with the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs.468 3.4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03636a3c-bac2-4f2c-86f8-65b91eb8e278": {"__data__": {"id_": "03636a3c-bac2-4f2c-86f8-65b91eb8e278", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "756b212ca1834f144ac8383de7eecd0922703ccddef3e9d5d4b5c9f40fb1b16b"}, "2": {"node_id": "76b701a2-b6ef-4c59-860d-d2e3a3a2aebd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eef9c01a2bfad3904636f46a6cfb03d1c228fb2f0ec439176cdc7fae85184726"}}, "hash": "aeeb2180bedbe2514b9709ab25564e425e19d178ab42e26dc0b083e869a6ba03", "text": "Reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (Goals 4, 5, 6) There are significant disparities between the health of indigenous people and that of non-indigenous populations in many countries around", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "145f0118-27b3-410f-81ce-4bdad71e99d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "145f0118-27b3-410f-81ce-4bdad71e99d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6822620c38292feeee29e2609aa7b1e766e9c2cdb3ecf0e53a83fc12fcea0a4"}, "3": {"node_id": "a38388f4-5ecf-4dbe-a17b-e49ff6bc8261", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a28cb242025498fe3945a7b132b7019c5aa6d08f3a87d7e2552e6ec94f253d2"}}, "hash": "a154249ff85124031e4d66654d29eac0f3d35f893dab06235c44c83e3c3d3467", "text": "the world.469 Indigenous people tend to die younger and generally live in poorer health than other population groups.

This is a trend fuelled by factors including social and economic exploitation of indigenous women, as well as a lack of access to health-related information. Infant, child and maternal mortality rates in many indigenous communities are significantly higher compared to non-indigenous groups.470 Indigenous peoples\u2019 wellbeing cannot be measured using health indicators such as disease and treatment. For indigenous peoples, wellbeing is distinct and includes physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. Social determinants therefore play a crucial role determining indigenous health. These determinants include cultural factors, such as loss of language, loss of connectivity to the land, and other factors primarily linked to indigenous identity. 471 Some governments have adopted policies focusing on \u201cclosing the gap\u201d with respect to disparities in human development indicators between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. The impact of these initiatives so far has been low. 40% of the indigenous population in Latin America lacks access to basic health services, and major differences between health rates among indigenous and non-indigenous populations persist. Indigenous children continue to display extraordinarily high malnutrition rates.472 Health of indigenous peoples is affected by multiple factors such as low income levels, low availability of safe water, scarcity of food, poor sanitation and a lack of access to health services. One of the main threats to indigenous\u2019 health is the destruction of their habitat which provides spiritual and material sustenance. According to the WHO, acculturation and the loss of cultural cohesion also have a deleterious impact on health.473 Discrimination, as well as costs, may also prevent indigenous people from seeking basic health care, which is especially problematic in context of the HIV/AIDS crisis. In some cases, indigenous peoples have purposefully isolated themselves in an attempt to maintain traditional cultures and practices.474 Lack of reliable data exists with respect to the true level of HIV infection among indigenous peoples. Relationship to land, poverty, geographical isolation, marginalization, different demographics, different understanding of health and medicine and low levels of participation in political and policymaking processes, are considered by UNAIDS as key factors affecting the impact of HIV epidemic on indigenous populations. The absence of reliable data about HIV infection in indigenous populations has made it more difficult for concerns about the impact of the HIV epidemic on indigenous populations to be given priority in national and international policy agendas. 470 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, UN Doc.

The health needs of indigenous women are particular to their ethnicity and gender. Also, these needs may be different those of other women and male members of indigenous communities.476 Inadequate and limited access to health services, lack of culturally appropriate approaches to health care, lack of outreach clinics in remote areas, deteriorating quality of air, water and land due to unchecked industrial development are a few factors contributing towards a downward trend. Changes in traditional, social, cultural and political institutions have led to a loss of traditional health practices, erosion of culturally appropriate health rules and diminished codes of behaviour which have been instrumental for ensuring gender-sensitive approaches to health.477 Full participation of indigenous peoples in the management of health services in their communities, better access to modern diagnostic processes and treatments as well as use of traditional healing and culturally appropriate reproductive health services are considered steps to improving the health of indigenous peoples. Reproductive health services for indigenous peoples must be improved in terms of coverage and quality, including information, pre and post natal care, and emergency obstetric care.478 According to UNDRIPs and international human rights law, indigenous people have the right to specific measures for improving access to health services and care as well as the underlying determinants of health.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 169 The 2005 Social Justice Report considered progress towards achieving improvements in the health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. According to the report, both chronic and communicable diseases are recorded at much higher rates in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities than in non-Indigenous communities. Chronic conditions include heart disease, diabetes and cancers. The causes of chronic conditions are believed to include: poor foetal and child health; poor diet throughout the lifecycle; smoking and alcohol misuse; a lack of access to primary health care (which is important in the detection and early prevention of chronic conditions); and social stress. Communicable diseases, such as trachoma and tuberculosis, are linked to overcrowding and poor sanitation in living conditions. The report points out that a major health inequality exists insofar as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples do not have equal opportunity to be as healthy as non-Indigenous Australians in two key areas: primary health care and health infrastructure. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples do not enjoy equal access to primary health care and health infrastructure including safe drinking water, supplies of healthy food, effective sewerage systems, rubbish collection services and healthy housing. Without effectively addressing underlying causes of health inequality, disease or condition-focused programs are unlikely to result in sustainable changes. The report makes key recommendations for achieving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health equality within a generation. Importantly they require the governments of Australia to commit themselves towards achieving equality of health status and life expectation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous people within 25 years.480 3.5. Ensure environment sustainability (Goal 7) Land rights, access to land and control over land resources are central to indigenous peoples throughout the world, making MDG 7 crucial for survival. The 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development identified indigenous peoples a major stakeholder in Agenda 21.

However, these global biological and environmental indicators must be complemented by human and social indicators which duly reflect critical human development factors affecting biodiversity. Although indigenous peoples have demonstrated their close relationship with the environment makes them the world\u2019s best environmental guardians, the strong environmental movement emerging after World War II made no reference to indigenous peoples. For many years, efforts focused more on how nature could be protected from damaging interventions by human activities as opposed to the impact of environmental degradation on human beings.482 As a result, projects and programs, having a serious impact on indigenous lands and resources, have been implemented without the Free Prior and Informed Consent of indigenous peoples. These projects and programmes include commercial agriculture such as mono-cropping, tree plantations, oil palm plantations and others; development and operation of large scale mining; construction and operation of large dams, and water privatization policies.483 Land has material, cultural and spiritual dimensions for indigenous peoples and, through their profound understanding, indigenous peoples sustainably managed their territories for generations. In order to survive as distinct peoples, indigenous peoples and their communities must be able to own, conserve and manage their territories, lands and resources on the basis of collective rights. Therefore, protection of collective right to lands, territories and natural resources must be given priority.484 Indigenous women and men both offer unique perspectives by taking into account traditional knowledge and awareness of environment. Indigenous peoples\u2019 societies generally view gender as complimentary and egalitarian, where each role is defined but complimentary to each other. For instance, indigenous men may focus on cultivation and indigenous women may plant and gather foods. Therefore, both roles are necessary and complimentary in the holistic relationship of the family/community. Traditionally, both indigenous women and men had equal access to lands, animals and resource use, which was extremely beneficial to the collective. However, since the integration and assimilation influences of dominant cultures, and the ideal of individual ownership, indigenous peoples, in particular women, experience fewer opportunities to access their natural resource and lands. Gender relations within indigenous communities have been changing alongside the transformation of their own environment, especially in the face of colonization.485 482 UN, State of World\u2019s Indigenous Peoples\u2019 2010, p.83. 483 International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, Goal 7: Ensure Environmental Sustainability, available at http://www.iwgia.org/sw16048.asp 484 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Resource Kit on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008, p.14-16. 485 UNFPII Briefing note Gender and Indigenous Peoples Environment, available at http://www.un.org/esa/ socdev/unpfii/en/women.html Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 171 Indigenous peoples have been at the frontline of the climate change crisis. For example, Inuit people have been affected by large-scale melting in traditional Arctic territories. This was also the subject of a recent petition lodged by the Inuit Circumpolar Conference with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights against the United States of America.486 The reduction of water reserves throughout the world has also threatened the survival of indigenous of indigenous populations.487 The UNDRIP (articles 25 and 26) and ILO\u2019s Convention No. 169 (article 14) both recognize the right of indigenous peoples to own and control traditional lands and, to differing degrees, the right of indigenous people to own, use and manage natural resources on those lands. Several other articles within the Declaration also recognize a number of related rights, including the right to free and informed consent prior to approval of interventions affecting their lands. However, this recognition has not been translated into betterment of conditions for indigenous peoples. In the name of development or free trade, mining, oil and gas developments, plantations etc., encroach on indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and territories, making life and survival increasingly difficult.488 The UNDG Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples (2008) note: \u201cIndigenous peoples\u2019 lands have been disproportionately affected by national development activities because they often contain valuable natural resources including timber, minerals, biodiversity resources, water and oil, among others\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb160ccc-1fa8-4f15-bf16-07f14929218a": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb160ccc-1fa8-4f15-bf16-07f14929218a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8235351bf6a01336155f7b19b8c95bd8e71cef76d97a797cb21cf0359f2a6ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "c347ec65-38f0-490c-9dcd-17100bab3ed2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7501fc2544a07a013ecff44da67f42e727bc28166b2d494169551eed62045f72"}}, "hash": "2888fcc8e750874e125dde1c18475b8deecf053b6b5ab5425adaba83fe862bec", "text": "It is feared by many that unless efforts are made to integrate indigenous peoples perspectives, the programmes and policies aimed at meeting the targets laid down for the MDGs could in fact have harmful effects on indigenous peoples.489 Peru also witnessed violent clashes between indigenous groups and the government due to legislation approved by the government allowing mining, logging, and large scale farming in the rainforest.

Today, however, indigenous peoples\u2019traditional knowledge and practices, which were formerly undervalued and ignored, are considered important and necessary contributions to the conservation of biodiversity. Yet this knowledge is under severe threat of being eroded, lost or misappropriated.492 At the COP meeting, a programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) was launched by the Norwegian government, pledging to spend NOK 3 billion annually to support developing countries fighting deforestation and reducing global CO2 emissions. The REDD programme, too, has been met with criticism. It makes no reference to the rights of indigenous peoples and it is argued indigenous rights will be undermined by a centralized, top-down management of forests. Concerns regarding the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and REDD were also raised at the Seventh Session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in May 2008, with the theme being climate change. Recommendations related to adaptation and mitigation initiatives were made emphasizing all actions being implemented with the participation or consent of indigenous peoples and in accordance with the UN Declaration.493 At the High-level Summit in 2010, States undertook a commitment to continue pursuit of a more efficient and coherent implementation of the three objectives regarding the Convention on Biological Diversity and address implementation gaps, where appropriate, including fulfilment of commitments significantly reducing the rate of loss of biodiversity, including by preserving and maintaining knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities; and continuing ongoing efforts towards elaborating and negotiating an international regime on access and benefit sharing.494 Goal 7, more than any, demands recognition of indigenous peoples as valuable partners, not only for the achievement of 2015 targets but also in devising sustainable adaptation strategies to combat climate change. 3.6. Global partnership for development (Goal 8) MDG 8 focuses on addressing the structural causes of poverty, emphasizing fulfilment of other goals depends on the success of creating global partnerships for development. Indigenous peoples are subjected to external factors such as national development plans, international trade agreements, market dynamics etc.495 The impact of trade agreements and debt burdens on indigenous peoples is often overlooked.

MDGs therefore provide an opportunity to raise awareness regarding the rights of indigenous peoples. Monitoring: MDG benchmarks can be used for measuring the realization of rights of indigenous peoples. MDG targets can provide the basis for assessing State compliance with rights protected under UNDRIP. On the other hand, measuring will also ensure national level programming, in accordance with the MDGs, is respectful of the rights of indigenous peoples. Political commitment: Given the international and growing national mobilization behind MDGs, they can provide a political process based on political commitments made at the highest level, through which rights of indigenous peoples can be claimed. Resources: National and international efforts around MDGs have led to mobilization of resources that can be applied to implementation of the rights protected under UNDRIP.501 3.7.2. How can UNDRIPs reinforce the realization of MDGs Focus on excluded and marginalized: MDGs aim at achieving reduction in poverty and human development over a period of time. However, some of the MDG targets are not sufficiently focused on the poorest groups in society such as indigenous peoples. An approach based on the rights of indigenous peoples focuses on the realization of rights for all including indigenous peoples. Holistic approach: Achieving MDG targets is not possible without addressing root causes of poverty such as discrimination and powerlessness. Programming based on the rights of indigenous peoples takes a holistic approach by considering the social, political and legal framework underpinning rights and duty holders.502 Participation: While MDGs focus on results, an approach based on the rights of indigenous peoples reminds policymakers that processes are equally important. In particular a human rights-based approach seeks to both assist in the participatory formulation of needed policy and legislative framework, and to ensure that participatory and democratic processes are institutionalized locally and nationally.503 Accountability: Accountability mechanisms for MDGs are weak. A human rights-based approach sensitive to rights of indigenous peoples supports the monitoring of State 501 UNMC, The Millennium Development Goals and Human Rights, 2008, p.9-10. 502 UNOHCHR, Frequently Asked Questions on a Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Cooperation, 2006, p.16. 503 Ibid., p.17.

However, in most cases, those reforms have not been able to eliminate discrimination against indigenous peoples. In some cases, the very existence of indigenous peoples is not recognized in constitutions and laws and they are even denied citizenship.507 Non-recognition of indigenous peoples and their customary land rights of indigenous peoples has resulted in loss of control over land and natural resources for indigenous peoples. Ambiguities within the legal situation of indigenous peoples and communities are of concern to indigenous peoples around the world.508 In Africa, for instance, the Amazigh people, who inhabit several countries of North Africa, demand legal recognition and respect of their cultural and social rights as an indigenous people. Within the framework of constitutional review, the Ogiek, a hunter-gatherer people of Kenya, are claiming recognition as a distinct indigenous minority. The Maasai pastoralists are considered to be an indigenous minority in several East African countries and their legal recognition varies in different States. 504 UNMC, The Millennium Development Goals and Human Rights, 2008, p.11. 505 MDGs Reports and Indigenous Peoples: A Desk Review, 2006-2008, available at http://www.un.org/esa/ socdev/unpfii/en/publications.html 506 Report on the fourth session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc. E/C.19/2005/9, 2005, para 14. 507 UNDG, United Nations Development Group Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008. 508 Communications addressed directly to the Special Rapporteur between July and October 2001. 176 The MDGs and Human Rights: An Indigenous Peoples Perspective The Special Rapporteur on the situation of indigenous peoples emphasised women and children as being particularly affected by the lack of citizenship documents because they become more vulnerable to exploitation. Indigenous women suffer terribly from violence occurring in many indigenous lands.509 Therefore, the challenge is to bring about development with a strong social and cultural dimension, promoting respect for basic human rights of indigenous peoples, integrating their views on development visions. Recognition of indigenous people\u2019s identity is considered as the first step in that regard.510 4.1.2. Explicitly recognize and integrate rights of indigenous peoples in policies and programmes for implementation of MDGs Indigenous peoples are entitled to a full range of rights established under international law, such as non-discrimination, participation in public life, and the right to maintain distinctive identities, cultures, languages and ways of life. The right of indigenous peoples to self-determination is increasingly expressed through self-governing or autonomous arrangements. Both ILO\u2019s Convention No. 169 and the UNDRIPs recognize indigenous peoples\u2019 right to own and control their lands and, to differing degrees, recognize their rights to own, use and manage natural resources on their respective lands. According to the Declaration, States should establish mechanisms to guarantee these rights. The right to development is understood in this context to imply the right of indigenous peoples to decide the kind of development that takes place on their lands and territories in accordance with their own priorities and cultures.511 The UNDRIPs calls upon States to consult with indigenous peoples to obtain their free, prior and informed consent to approval of any project affecting lands and resources.512 ILO Convention No. 169 underlines the right of indigenous peoples to be consulted in relation to developments that may affect them.513 4.1.3. Problem of disaggregated data Disaggregated data on the conditions of indigenous peoples is limited and it is therefore difficult to develop and implement policies to address discrimination. The UNPFIIs and several UN agencies have recommended data be disaggregated specifically for indigenous peoples. Data provides a key tool for the planning and execution of programmes and projects and the monitoring and evaluation of the achievement of the MDGs. However, there are several inconsistencies that inhibit data with respect to indigenous peoples. There is no standard or agreed upon definition of \u201cwho are indigenous peoples\u201d and \u201cwho 509 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, UN Doc.

There is also a need to add complementary indicators to measure existing targets, where needed, and to ensure rights of indigenous peoples are adequately highlighted. 4.2. Promote greater equality and empower indigenous peoples According to international human rights standards, indigenous peoples, as all human beings, are entitled to enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms including both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights. Indigenous peoples have the right to equal treatment and to benefit, as any other citizen of the State in which they live, from economic development and other progress. These rights apply to all indigenous peoples, i.e. men and women, children and adults alike. In practice, however, indigenous peoples have often not been treated equally and face social exclusion.515 Dominant sections of society consider indigenous people inferior, and often deny them equal opportunities with respect to livelihood and education. Further, indigenous women continue to suffer from multiple forms of discrimination, both as women and as indigenous individuals. They are subjected to extreme poverty, trafficking, illiteracy, lack of access to ancestral lands, non-existent or poor health care and to violence in the private and the public sphere. This violence is exacerbated when indigenous communities find themselves in the midst of conflict and women become the target of violence with political motives, when going about their daily work, such as fetching wood or collecting water for the family. Ensuring indigenous peoples have equal opportunities requires States to take special or positive measures to compensate for historic injustices and disadvantages. The purpose of special positive measures is to bring living conditions of indigenous peoples to the same level as those of others in society. The objective should aim for development reflecting indigenous peoples\u2019 vision, perspectives and strategies of self-determining development within the framework of respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.516 514 Edilberto Loazia, \u201cData and Indicators for Indigenous Issues\u201d, World Bank Conference on Poverty and Indigenous Peoples, 2006, p.10.. 515 Vital Bambazne, \u201cDimensions of Poverty and Well-Being among Indigenous Peoples in Africa\u201d, World Bank Conference on Poverty and Indigenous Peoples, 2006, p. 9. 516 Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, \u201cA Framework for Advocacy in Support of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Visions, Perspectives and Strategies for Self-Determining Development\u201d, in UNDP, Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights- Based Approach to development: Engaging in Dialogue, 2007, p.96. 178 The MDGs and Human Rights: An Indigenous Peoples Perspective In an innovative move, the United Nations Development Programme, the central Chinese government and a cosmetic firm named Jala Group, have recently launched an initiative offering support and guidance to Mosuo women for launching and maintaining successful businesses. The focus of this initiative is to provide management skills to organize a workforce and make products by providing training workshops. The programme aims to help the community build a sustainable, culture-based ethnic minority business model, reduce poverty and instil a sense of pride among Mosuo women toward for culture that will inspire them to protect it.517 4.2.1. Respect for individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples Various international treaties protect individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples. These rights are indispensable for their existence, well-being and holistic development as peoples. Policies and programmes designed for implementation of MDGs could result in violation of rights of indigenous peoples. A large developmental project aimed at achieving MDGs for instance could result in the violation of rights of indigenous peoples. Therefore, a need exists for respecting the rights of indigenous peoples while designing developmental programmes and policies. The collective rights of indigenous peoples include recognition of distinctive histories, languages, identities and cultures and the collective right to lands, territories and natural resources they have traditionally occupied and used, as well as the right to collectively held traditional knowledge. In establishing and fulfilling collective rights for indigenous peoples, the international community has affirmed such rights should not conflict with existing international human rights norms but complement them, i.e., the implementation of collective human rights should not adversely affect the implementation of individual rights. 4.3. Participation and representation (free, prior and informed consent) Indigenous peoples are often unable to participate fully in public life and are rarely present in decision-making bodies of the State. In order to address this situation and promote social inclusion and political participation, Governments are increasingly revising laws and introducing special measures to combat prevailing discrimination and improve opportunities for indigenous peoples.

The Second International Decade of World\u2019s Indigenous People called for promoting full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in decisions which directly or indirectly affect their lifestyles, traditional lands and territories, cultural integrity as indigenous peoples with collective rights or any other aspect of their lives, considering the principle 517 Zhou Wa, An end to matriarchy?, China Daily, 27 Sept 2011. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 179 of free, prior and informed consent.518 The rights to participation and to free, prior and informed consent are an integral part of a human rights\u2013based approach. The principle of free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples to development projects and plans affecting them, is emerging as a standard to be applied for promoting and protecting their rights in the development process.519 This principle should be respected and used as a methodology whenever designing programmes and projects that directly or indirectly affect indigenous peoples, as defined in the context of a human rights\u2013based approach. According to UNPFII, FPIC should be sought sufficiently in advance of commencement or authorization of activities, taking into account indigenous peoples\u2019 own decision-making processes in all phases of a project. Information should be accurate and communicated in an accessible and understandable form, including translation into languages widely understood by indigenous peoples. Information should be distributed in a format that takes into account oral traditions of indigenous peoples and their languages. Consent to any agreement should be interpreted as implying indigenous peoples have a relative understanding of the terms of agreement.520 For indigenous peoples, being part of the decision making process is fundamental to meeting development challenges\u2014in particular, the achievement of the MDGs. Participation and free, prior and informed consent are therefore key to realizing the rights of indigenous peoples and the MDGs.521Articles 18 and 19 of the UNDRIPs emphasize the principles of participation and free, prior and informed consent. Article 6 of ILO Convention No. 169 speaks of \u201cconsultation with the peoples concerned\u201d to be \u201ccarried out in good faith and in a form appropriate to the circumstances \u2026 with the objective of achieving agreement and consent to the proposed measures\u201d. Para 1 of OP 4.10 of World Bank provides the borrower must engage in FPIC with indigenous peoples for Bank-financing relative to indigenous peoples. Further, the UNPFIIs has called for increased and improved participation by indigenous women in activities related to a broad range of themes, including the following:(a) Legal processes, including the creation of mechanisms to enable indigenous women to take advantage of available juridical instruments and encouraging the appointment of qualified indigenous women to decision-making positions; (b) Governance and decision-making structures at all levels ensuring equal access of indigenous women to decision-making and governmental bodies; (c) Economic and social development, including development processes such as the common country assessment, the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, and poverty reduction strategy papers; (d) Human rights processes such as reporting to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 518 The Second International Decade of World\u2019s Indigenous People, 2004, main objective, available at http:// www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/second.html 519 Ibid., p.98. 520 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Resource Kit on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008, p.17. 521 Ibid. 180 The MDGs and Human Rights: An Indigenous Peoples Perspective and other relevant human rights bodies; (e) Dialogue on climate change; and (f) Health education programmes for indigenous women and men.522 While mechanisms for participation can vary, participation should not be confined to mere consultation. For example, Indigenous peoples\u2019 representatives should be involved with other sectors of civil society and conduct meetings with government officials. Specific and culturally appropriate consultation mechanisms can also be established through the creation of consultative groups of indigenous leaders to advise governments at all stages of the programming process, or through consultations at the local level.523 The idea, as explained by the Inter-Agency Support Group, should be to develop mechanisms at the country level giving indigenous peoples a greater sense of ownership within intergovernmental organizations and to enable full participation of indigenous peoples in activities directly affecting them.524 The government of the Philippines has enacted the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3aaa7d15-db2f-44da-bff1-1a1124d08e93": {"__data__": {"id_": "3aaa7d15-db2f-44da-bff1-1a1124d08e93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "978d70937d6b4c765ede48cad9aeec92a2895d819d85152550a9e9ae34fbf797"}, "2": {"node_id": "995576b6-416c-4d40-83e4-5675a28851cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d9d4b00e884e3e433138cb39f130172f3a4bcb380c23f3c109ca7586b72b8fd"}}, "hash": "6af4218260dc739eacbd20f5eb98adfa4412810b25e629d01d977232f2c16421", "text": "According to the law, consent of indigenous peoples is required for the following activities: \u2022\ufffd exploration, development and use of natural resources; \u2022\ufffd research and bio prospecting; \u2022\ufffd displacement and relocation; \u2022\ufffd archaeological explorations; \u2022\ufffd policies affecting indigenous peoples like Executive Order 263 (Community-based Forest Management); \u2022\ufffd entry of military.

International Development Cooperation and Indigenous Peoples While principal responsibility for the realization of the right to development and human rights rests with each state, rich States have some responsibilities towards the realization of human rights in poor countries within the context of international cooperation. These responsibilities arise, inter alia, from the provisions relating to international assistance and 522 UNPFIIs, Analysis prepared by the secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues: indigenous women, E/C.19/2009/8, 2009. 523 UNDG, United Nations Development Group Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008. 524 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Resource Kit on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008, p.17. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 181 cooperation in international human rights law. Importantly, international assistance and cooperation should not be understood as meaning only financial and technical assistance: it also includes the responsibility of rich States to work actively towards an international order that is conducive to the elimination of poverty and the realization of human rights. The parameters of international assistance and cooperation are not yet clearly defined. However, in principle, international assistance and cooperation requires individuals in a position to assist should first, refrain from acts that create difficulties for indigenous peoples achieving full realization of human rights and second, take measures to remove obstacles that impede indigenous peoples\u2019 realization of their human rights. Both governments and international development agencies have responsibilities for including indigenous peoples in development processes. Numerous policies have been adopted over the years by World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, United Nations Development Programme, and a number of bilateral donors for the inclusion of rights and interests of indigenous peoples in development programmes. These policies and strategies reflect positive steps helping place indigenous peoples on the international development agenda.525 Nevertheless, there are challenges with regarding implementation of these strategies, including lack of mechanisms for securing participation of indigenous peoples, paucity of specific statistics or data available on the situation of indigenous peoples and lack of knowledge for staff in development institutions and government on indigenous issues. For indigenous organisations, it remains a challenge to push further participation in development processes, particularly as the process becomes more centralized at the national level through the Aid Effectiveness Agenda.526 4.5. Effective accountability International human rights empower individuals and communities by granting entitlements and placing legal obligations on others. Critically, rights and obligations demand accountability: unless supported by a system of accountability, rights and obligations will be no more than window-dressing. Accordingly, a human rights approach emphasizes obligations and requires all duty-holders be held to account for their conduct. States and other duty-bearers are answerable for the observance of human rights and must comply with legal norms and standards enshrined in human rights instruments. When States fail to do so, aggrieved rights-holders are entitled to institute proceedings for 525 ILO, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples\u2019 Rights in Practice, 2009, p.119. 526 Ibid. 182 The MDGs and Human Rights: An Indigenous Peoples Perspective appropriate redress before a competent court or other adjudicators in accordance with rules and procedures provided by law.527 Accountability mechanisms in the context of MDGs are weak. One possible vehicle for accountability is the country-level Millennium Development Goals report. Several such reports have been published over the years.528 These Reports are emerging as one of the most important instruments for tracking and monitoring progress at the national level. They are, however, primarily intended for \u201cawareness advocacy\u201d, rather than policy formulation or accountability. These reports can be used to hold governments to account with respect to MDG commitments in relation to indigenous peoples. Human rights, including the rights of indigenous peoples, can strengthen weak accountability mechanisms presently associated with all MDGs. Provided the mechanisms are adequately briefed and resourced, existing human rights accountability mechanisms can consider the adequacy of what States are doing to realise MDGs in context of indigenous peoples.

Conclusion and Recommendations Policies and strategies that integrate the rights and aspirations of indigenous peoples are more likely to be effective, equitable, robust, participatory and meaningful to indigenous populations around the world. These policies and strategies should be culturally appropriate, taking into account the right of indigenous peoples to exist as distinct peoples. States should adopt national processes to implement the MDGs with the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples.530 527 Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, \u201cA Framework for Advocacy in Support of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Visions, Perspectives and Strategies for Self-Determining Development\u201d, in UNDP, Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights- Based Approach to development: Engaging in Dialogue, 2007, p.99. 528 MDG Reports and Indigenous Peoples: A Desk Review, 2006-2008, available at http://www.un.org/esa/ socdev/unpfii/en/publications.html 529 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, UN Doc.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 183 In particular, Governments and other actors should make every effort to ensure: (a) The disaggregation of data by ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, cultural or tribal affiliation and language; (b) The active and informed participation of indigenous people in the formulation, implementation and monitoring of MDGs policies and programmes; (c) As far as possible, the availability of programmes and projects, and MDGs-related information, in languages spoken by indigenous peoples; (d) Strengthening of MDG programmes in indigenous communities, including adequate budget allocation and outreach services to indigenous communities; (e) Training of government officials and others to raise awareness of, and sensitivity towards, issues of ethnicity and indigenous culture; (f) The establishment of monitoring and accountability mechanisms in indigenous communities in relation to abuses and neglect in the health system. For no other group of people does the attainment of MDGs matter more than for indigenous peoples. MDGs offer a powerful tool for converting the rights and aspirations of indigenous peoples into reality. Together we can ensure realization of the rights of indigenous peoples and achieve the MDGs. 184 Legal Identity and MDG Implementation Legal Identity and MDG Implementation Tiernan Mennen 1. Introduction Possession of legal identity is a fundamental threshold for gaining access to a range of goods and services with the potential to improve people\u2019s lives and help countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Legal identity establishes citizenship and/or residency and can provide access to education, health care and social welfare, registration of title to land, receipt of pension or social security, obtaining utility connections, enforcing inheritance rights, and even registration and protection of small businesses. Legal identity also protects human rights such as freedom of movement, property rights, and the right to vote; helps limit crimes against minors such as trafficking and child labor; and improves government databases for better development planning and the adequate and equitable distribution of public resources to those who need it most. Legal identity is a cornerstone for access to justice. Despite the unequivocal provision in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, tens of millions of people lack a formally documented legal identity. Yet, the number of people without legal identity is shockingly high in many countries. It is estimated more than seven in ten children in the world\u2019s least- developed countries do not have birth certificates or other registration documents. Over half of all births in South Asia go unregistered, leading to complications for obtaining legal identity later in life. In Nepal, for example, 80% of citizens are unregistered and as a result are often denied lawful access to education, employment opportunities, and the political process.531 Lack of legal identity prevent the most marginalized and vulnerable people from accessing critical healthcare and education services, furthering the cycle of poverty and frustrating efforts to meet the MDGs.

Ultimately, legal identity is a complex combination of factors enabling a person to access rights, benefits, and responsibilities. 531 Deprived of an individual identity: citizenship and women in Nepal. Mona Laczo, 2003 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 185 Legal identity includes the legal registration and documentation of name, personal data, date of birth, and unique characteristics such as biometric data or an identifying number. Legal identity typically accords personal possession of an official, government- issued and recognized identity document containing basic information attesting to the holder\u2019s name, age, status, legal relationship(s), unique identification number and photo form of identification. Most countries have a range of identity documents serving a variety of purposes from birth, marriage, and death certificates to passports and professional licenses. Birth certificates are, however, seen as the preferred standard and are the most common form of establishing legal identity. The lack of legal identity, in particular birth certificates, is a chronic problem worldwide, especially in parts of Asia. In 2008, UNICEF estimated approximately 36% of all births worldwide went unregistered.532 South Asia had the largest number at 63% (about 23 million)533, representing 47% of all unregistered births worldwide. 19% of all births in East Asia and the Pacific and 55% in Sub-Saharan Africa were unregistered. According to UNICEF in India, only 41% of children under five were registered at birth. There is a substantial urban rural difference in registration with 59% of urban children under five being registered at the time of the survey versus only 35% in rural areas. An unregistered birth results in no birth certificate and complicates the process of obtaining legal identity later on in life. The inability to prove identity results in a hampered capacity to exercise a person\u2019s full rights, including access to entitled public services. Lack of legal identity as an adult can be depicted in a few ways: a) absolute\u2013when the person\u2019s birth was not registered and therefore they have no birth certificate or identity document; b) relative\u2013the person\u2019s birth was registered but no registration document was received due to a registration or other error, and thus never obtained a national identity document, c) partial \u2013 the person has a national identity document but it is incorrect in one of many ways preventing the person from exercising his or her rights.534 Legal Framework Almost all countries have international obligations to provide legal identity to their citizens. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) provides for the universal right to nationality (Art. 6) and the right to be considered a citizen of some state (Art. 15). The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides for \u201cthe right to be recognized as a person before the law\u201d (Article 16). Article 24 provides for the rights for children (status as minors, nationality, registration and name). And Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), states, \u201cThe child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name [and] the right to acquire a nationality.\u201d Article 7 contains a second paragraph explicitly requiring state parties to ensure implementation of this right. 532 UNICEF State of the World\u2019s Children, 2008 533 This number reportedly increased to 69% according to the 2010 UNICEF SOWC 534 See. Democratic Governance, Citizenship, and Legal Identity, Linking Theoretical Discussion and Operational Reality, Mia Harbitz, Bettina Boekle-Giuffrida, Working Paper, Inter-American Development Bank, May 2009 186 Legal Identity and MDG Implementation All countries have corresponding national legislation and norms for the registration of persons, their vital events, and the granting of legal identity. Most nations also have institutions regulating and enforcing these procedures and requirements, to provide processes by which citizens can access documentation proving their legal existence. Institutions and Procedures Civil registries are typically the most important institution for documentation and birth registration. The civil registry fills various functional roles within the state including, establishing legal identity; providing basic demographic statistics; providing the basis for the electoral registry; and, in many countries, access to social programs. Birth certificates are generally preferred as legal identity because they document age, place of birth, and familial relationships from the very beginning of life.

In Guatemala, for example, the individual must have a certificate of live birth, a birth certificate, and a national identity card. Without a birth certificate it is nearly impossible to obtain an identity card.535 With respect to registration of births, there are various scenarios: a) registration that is free of charge within timeframes established by law in each country\u2013generally between 30 and 60 days following birth, but sometimes up to 12 years; b) late registration, which occurs later than the time periods established by law in each country and generally requires the payment of fees and administrative and judicial procedures; c) the absence of registration or when no legal registration of birth exists\u2013such situations usually need to be resolved by costly administrative and/or judicial processes; and finally, d) duplicate registration, the results of scant or deficient controls and security measures that enable duplication of registration and issuance of duplicate documents. Causes pertaining to lack of legal identity can be nuanced\u2013some people were never registered in the first place; some never obtained identity documents; some misplaced their documents and never obtained replacements; some had their records lost (e.g., deterioration or disappearance of registration books); some were registered but the personal data at the registry is incorrect (e.g., spelling errors in the first or last names\u2014a situation which occurs frequently among indigenous populations because of the inadequate knowledge of indigenous languages on behalf of civil registry staff); and 535 The Significance of Legal Identity in Situations of Poverty and Social Exclusion: The Link between Gender, Ethnicity, and Legal Identity, Mia Harbitz, Maria del Carmen Tamargo, Inter-American Development Bank, November 2009 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 187 some have invalid documents due to changes in countries\u2019 documentation systems.536 The failure to register births in a timely fashion is the precursor to most problems related to lack of legal identity in adulthood. Indigenous right to identity The International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 protects the rights of indigenous populations worldwide. Specifically, it allows for self-identification and guarantees the right of citizenship without discrimination. Indigenous groups and ethnic minorities still suffer disproportionately from discriminatory practices that deny their legal identity and thus further their marginalization vis-\u00e0-vis the state. A lack of legal identity exacerbates social barriers to participation in the formal economy and receipt of public benefits. Examples include: \u2022\ufffd Thailand\u2013over half of the Hill Tribe population has been denied access to Thai citizenship as a result of excessively burdensome requirements to prove their nationality, even though the Hill Tribe people, who number over one million, were born in Thailand and have lived there all of their lives. \u2022\ufffd Bangladesh\u2013over 200,000 stateless Biharis initially granted citizenship at the time of Bangladeshi independence were later denied citizenship by the Bangladeshi government and today live in camps in Bangladesh. \u2022\ufffd Kuwait\u2013the government has excluded the Bidun\u2013descendants from nomadic tribes and migrants who have lived in Kuwait for decades. \u2022\ufffd Burma\u2013members of the Rohingya Muslim minority, who have been living in the northern state of Ankara since the 12th century, are excluded from citizenship by the 1982 citizenship law, which provides several categories of citizenship, none of which the Rohingya are deemed to satisfy. \u2022\ufffd Middle East \u2013 Palestinians in Syria and other Arab states have been barred from acquiring citizenship. \u2022\ufffd Russia\u2013regional authorities in Krasnodar Krai have arbitrarily denied approximately 13-16,000 Meskhetians, a Turkish-speaking Muslim ethnic minority, all rights of Russian citizenship to which they are entitled as former Soviet citizens. \u2022\ufffd Kenya\u2013the Nubian community, composed of more than 100,000 descendants of persons originally from the territory of Sudan who were resettled by the British colonial government, live as de facto stateless persons without adequate legal protection as they are systematically denied their right to Kenyan citizenship and to own land.537 Much is made of the chronic and growing problem of statelessness \u2013 where individuals do not have recognized legal identity in any country and are continuously deported and 536 M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los promedios: afro descendientes en Am\u00e9rica Latina.

Economic barriers, geographic isolation, burdensome procedures, socio-cultural barriers, discriminatory laws and practices, institutional deficiencies, and a lack of adequate information about the benefits of legal identity all serve to discourage or prevent people, especially the most vulnerable groups, from attempting to register themselves and their families. A birth registration document is the first and founding document of a chain of rights that should be gradually granted in one\u2019s lifetime. Ideally, every child should be registered at birth and thereby have automatic access to all citizenship rights. In reality, this does not always happen. Without a birth registration document, access to all other documents, such as a passport or driver\u2019s license, will be either denied, complicated, or associated with extra administrative or legal costs. Economic barriers While registration of birth is an obligation of the state and technically free in many countries, the reality is that most poor, rural and indigenous populations lack access to government registry offices and would incur considerable travel expenses to register birth of their children. Most births still do not occur in hospitals and even when they do, there is no system for automatic birth registration. In addition, many countries charge fees for registration. Countries typically have a 30 to 60 day requirement for registering a birth, after which a more complicated application is required. Late registration of both children and adults requires extemporaneous creation or replacement of birth certificates and implies considerable administrative procedures. Often, a series of affidavits must be generated, necessitating the hiring of a notary public and/or attorneys. This cost is too high for many families to bear. Corruption or rent-seeking, often by local officials or elites, can create additional economic barriers for access to legal identity. In Bangladesh, for example, procedural barriers help construct additional economic barriers. Citizens requesting legal identity or late registration of a birth are required to apply for a recommendation letter from a local official such as a mayor. Applicants complained that they were often unable to obtain the required recommendation without paying a bribe. Those who cannot provide cash nor goats are denied legal identity.538 538 See. Legal Identity for Inclusive Development, eds. Caroline Vandenabeele and Christine V. Lao, Asian Development Bank, 2007 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 189 Geographic barriers Lack of legal identity is particularly high in rural areas throughout the world. In India studies have shown up to a 24% difference between rural and urban registration. In parts of Latin America, the number of unregistered rural births is triple the amount of urban births.539 Government legal identity campaigns often fail to access rural areas and remote populations. A lack of access to government offices, civil registries, lawyers, and public notaries in rural areas compounds gender, ethnic and other barriers, particularly for attempts to retroactively register a birth or establish legal identity. The establishment of legal services offices in rural areas addressing legal identity among other issues has demonstrated a positive impact in strengthening identity in remote and disadvantaged populations.540 Procedural barriers Various mechanisms, procedures, and administrative arrangements governing the granting of birth certificates, revision of faulty legal identity, and retroactive establishment of identity can severely hamper legal identity efforts. These procedures raise costs, take up time, serve as disincentives, or represent insurmountable barriers that disproportionately affect economically and socially disadvantaged groups. They also create an environment for rent seeking by public officials. Paying bribes to obtain or change identity documents is a normal practice in countries throughout the Asia region. Most births are not registered immediately after their occurrence (see example in Figure 1). Yet many countries have procedural burdens for late registration of both children and adults requiring production of affidavits and sometimes references from government officials. This results in substantial delays, extra costs, and exposure to rent-seeking. 539 Supra note 5 540 See.

Discriminatory laws and practices Discriminatory laws, practices, and attitudes toward registrants, particularly women and minorities, create further difficulties and discourage potential registrants. Citizenship, birth registration as well as marriage and inheritance laws can contain discriminatory provisions undermining the goals of universal registration. However, the practices of officials at registries and other institutions are the leading cause of abuse. Additional procedural requirements facilitate discrimination by officials. For example, in many countries a migration certificate is required to obtain a legal identity document in a place other than the district where the father\u2019s citizenship is registered. Research has shown ethnicity and gender to be aggravating factors of the structural causes towards lack of legal identity.542 In Guatemala, for example, only 10% of the entire population is unregistered compared to 40% of the indigenous population.543 Migrants and minority groups are often denied legal identity or registration of the birth of their children. In Syria, ethnic Kurds are systematically denied identity documents and citizenship. Local control of citizenship registration can encourage discriminatory practices by local majority groups over minorities or outsiders. Women are systematically discriminated against in registration, particularly if they are also a minority, indigenous or rural poor. In some countries, only male or paternal relatives 541 Supra note 7 at 48 542 Supra note 5 543 Id. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 191 can apply for the registration of a relative\u2019s birth, even if the father is unknown, residing elsewhere, or refuses to provide assistance. Officials have also been found to refuse transfer of ownership of inherited property to female applicants if their family name differed from that of their deceased husbands.544 Social and cultural barriers Cultural norms and lack of awareness can complicate or provide additional disincentives to registration and obtaining legal identity. Language barriers for ethnic minorities impede communication of the importance of legal identity. Some religious and racial minorities as well as immigrants fear obtaining legal identity out of concern that government recognition could enable discriminatory treatment. Parents often do not associate birth registration with access to benefits such as education and healthcare. There is often a stigma for single mothers associated with registering children born out of wedlock. In many instances, girls are under-registered because they are perceived as not desirable or requiring extensive education. Many people will remain unmotivated to register unless there are obvious payoffs for doing so. Weak institutions Civil registries are essential institutions for maintaining accurate birth registration and identity records. However, registries often lag behind other institutions with respect to modernization and budgetary support, despite the ramifications for public service planning, elections and other aspects of government that depend on demographic information. Establishing and maintaining a complete, effective, and accessible civil registration system requires sufficient resources, political priority, enforcement capacity, and administrative infrastructure. Registries are typically understaffed and have low national coverage, particularly in rural areas. Low levels of information processing technology and expertise and the persistence of manual practices have also plagued reforms. Centralization of civil registries creates a number of benefits for consistency, accuracy and safety of information across countries, particularly those with high rates of migration and urbanization or displaced populations. However, centralization can create its own technological barriers such as a lack of reliable, consolidated databases, electronic infrastructure failures, and inadequate electronic connectivity between district and municipal offices. Despite centralization and computerization efforts, most people have to return to their place of birth to properly register or change identity documents. Institutional deficits also relate to how countries register births. Hospitals and maternal health centers are often the frontline for birth registration, yet often they do not have registration capabilities, requiring families to instead register separately with the civil 544 Supra note 7 192 Legal Identity and MDG Implementation registry or appropriate authority. Even when hospitals are able to link birth records with the central registry, over half of all births in developing countries occur outside the public health system. Political barriers Capacity-building efforts and direct registration efforts are far too often frustrated by political barriers excluding targeted segments of the population from full participation. This problem is particularly acute for groups denied citizenship on grounds of ethnicity or status as refugees or migrants. Examples of groups having no formal citizenship rights, or limited citizenship rights, include the Kurds in Syria and Turkey, the Palestinians throughout the Middle East, Nubians in Kenya, Bihari in Bangladesh and Rohingyas in Myanmar.

Formal registration is a threat to the incumbent elite because it would incorporate greater numbers of poor and indigenous. Understanding the country context, including the incentive structure of institutional actors, is essential. Establishing and maintaining a complete, effective, and accessible civil registration system requires sufficient funding, human resources, political priority, enforcement capacity, and administrative infrastructure. 4. Legal Identity Impacts Having a document that verifies one\u2019s identity is fundamental for the ability of any citizen to protect their rights and access benefits and services. Identity provides legal protection and redress for violations by allowing access to state institutions such as courts and law enforcement agencies. Identity also provides access to social welfare, health care, professional opportunities and a range of other public services and entitlements. Having a legal identity is increasingly important as countries strive to improve services for the poor and meet MDG obligations. Without proof of one\u2019s legal identity, it is difficult, if not impossible, to exercise and enforce one\u2019s full set of rights and obtain public benefits and opportunities. Consequently, legal identity can be construed narrowly to refer to the full set of identity documents that prove one\u2019s status as a legal person and allow access to institutions and benefits. There are often multiple required documents depending on the service or benefit. Most documents derive from a valid birth certificate, but not all are easy to obtain even with registration. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 193 Protection of Rights Legal identity is critical to protecting a litany of human rights and facilitating enforcement of laws and regulations intended to protect the poor and disadvantaged. Weak civil registration has been linked to patterns of exploitation and abuse related to child labor, underage marriage, and trafficking. Registration of land and property is also dependent on having legal identity. There is an extensive corpus of laws to protect children, yet few cases of violations actually find their way into the courts. Children\u2019s rights are often dependent on being able to prove age based on a valid birth certificate. Laws seeking to protect children from exploitation and abuse include, juvenile justice sentencing and due process requirements, child labor laws, anti-child trafficking efforts, and laws banning child marriages. All depend on verification of age. Such laws are often violated with impunity. Moreover, access to courts, prosecution, and public defender services to enforce these rights is contingent upon being able to demonstrate legal identity and/or citizenship. Legal recognition aside, victims may still not have the financial means and know-how to access the legal system, or may view lack of prosecution as more socially acceptable. Property rights and the ability to register, sell and inherit land is a major impetus for acquiring legal identity. In many countries, lack of a birth certificate can significantly impair access to land markets. Lack of legal identity documents can lead to lengthy and expensive litigation for inheritance of land. In Bangladesh, for example, there are a large number of unnecessary legal proceedings taking place simply because there is no record of birth which presents a significant barrier to obtaining a succession certificate.545 Access to Benefits A major advantage generally associated with birth registration is that it enables access to benefits and opportunities. The premise is that laws or policies make access contingent on providing formal proof of one\u2019s identity through an identity document, primarily a birth certificate. 545 Id. 194 Legal Identity and MDG Implementation Figure 2 outlines the range of benefits and activities, presuming they are available, requiring a birth certificate or other form of recognized legal identity document.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 195 \u2022\ufffd A recently unemployed worker will not be able to receive unemployment benefits or access to government employment schemes \u2013 such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. While legal identity is a fundamental precursor to obtaining benefits, it is not a magic bullet. Barriers to access are often varied, complex and context-specific. Possession of a legal identity document does not guarantee access to services. Depending on the country as well as the benefit, service, or opportunity in question, budgetary constraints and other barriers (geographical, discriminatory practices) often make government services unavailable. Those services that are available can, in many instances, be obtained without presenting a legal document. Health treatment and school registration, for example, are often provided regardless of documentation. The nexus between legal identity and access to benefits and opportunities depends on certain underlying assumptions: 1) services, benefits, and opportunities actually exist; 2) laws, policies, or practices make access strictly contingent on the possession of a birth certificate or identity document; 3) available identity alternatives are not acceptable; and 4) other more fundamental economic, political, and social barriers do not impede access.546 Public Planning Accurate demographic information provided by civil registries is an essential element of public planning for development, funding and provision of public services. Civil registration systems enable government agencies to properly plan and define development priorities and provide for the proper allocation of resources and benefits, especially for poor and disadvantaged communities. However, low registration rates, particularly in rural areas and among the uneducated and impoverished, make it impossible to plan based on vital statistics. Many citizens lack legal identity and documents because of insufficient financial resources for registration services and, consequently, inadequate service coverage, especially in remote areas. From a budgetary perspective, this also means unregistered citizens do not pay income or payroll taxes and thus governments have less means to repair critical holes in the tax system.8 Moreover, if considerable numbers of citizens are unable to exercise their rights to vote and/or be elected to office, it will be difficult for a modern nation state to reach a higher degree of democratization. Economic Growth and Millennium Development Goals Legal identity has profound implications for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. As many of the MDGs relate to provision of public services for the poor and 546 Id at 8 196 Legal Identity and MDG Implementation disadvantaged, the inability of the poor to access these services due to systemic barriers is a critical consideration. Beyond access to public benefits, birth certificates and other identity documents are often required for sophisticated transactions with ramifications for economic opportunity. On a macro level, activities such as registration and land transfer, access to credit, starting and registering a business, getting a professional license, and opening a bank account directly affect economic growth and development. According to an econometric study in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Nicaragua the pervasive problem of under-registration of births is central to poverty reduction. Children and adults without legal identity are more prone to lack of access to health, education, housing, and nutrition benefits guaranteed by public poverty reduction policies.547 The study shows children from low socioeconomic backgrounds face higher risks of being unregistered from birth to the age of five and that poverty and under-registration are strongly connected to each other. The nexus between the MDGs and legal identity is pronounced in each of the seven goals, but is particularly strong for goals that relate to public service provision: \u2022\ufffd Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger \u2013 poverty and hunger are byproducts of a range of structural issues, denial of human rights, and lack of access to public benefits and poverty reduction schemes.

Lack of accurate birth registration and access to legal identity also undermines demographic-based planning efforts to meet demands for health services. It also prevents individual barriers to health services requiring some proof of identity or citizenship. Obtaining a medical card allowing 547 Study \u2026. Duryea, Oligati, and Stone (2006), Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 197 access to services is difficult without a birth certificate and can require days of travel to a government office where women, especially single mothers, are often harassed.

Legal Identity Programming Programming specifically targeted at increasing access to legal identity can have a multiplier effect on other development efforts, including the MDGs. However, it is also worth cautioning that legal identity is not the only or even a primary solution to development problems. There are many other barriers to receiving benefits and protecting rights, regardless of whether legal identity exists. For example, legal identity can help ensure access to benefits and livelihood opportunities, but such services, benefits, and opportunities must actually exist. Unfortunately, in many countries across the Asia region, these benefits are far removed from large segments of the population that rely on agriculture and the informal economy for their livelihoods. Programming should appropriately consider underlying causes of various barriers to legal identity and design interventions. The barriers detailed here can generally be categorized under three primary causes: \u2022\ufffd First, many countries lack an effective bureaucratic system for providing accessible, reliable, and low-cost registration services for all people who would like to formally register themselves with the state. This encapsulates a range of technical and management capacity, geographic, procedural and financial barriers. \u2022\ufffd Second, the denial of legal identity is often the result of a deliberate interest in excluding certain groups from full participation in the economy and public sphere. Sometimes this exclusivity arises because of acute discriminatory practices. In other cases, such as those involving long-term migrant or refugee populations, the problem is more complex, and may implicate the policies of more than one state. \u2022\ufffd Third, some poor individuals may lack formal legal registration because they choose not to take necessary steps to acquire it. Sometimes avoidance is rational and based on disincentives toward registration. In other cases, avoidance is due to lack of awareness of the benefits registration accords. Programming efforts often focus on and advocate for universal birth registration as the primary means for ensuring legal identity. The reality of universal registration is, however, more complicated. Significant geographic, socio-cultural and discriminatory barriers exist in most countries that make complete formal registration impossible. Concurrently, many laws, procedures and institutions need updating, streamlining and modernization with potentially larger, more cost-effective benefits to provide legal identity for both adults and children. 198 Legal Identity and MDG Implementation This chapter groups programming efforts to strengthening legal identity into two categories\u2013community empowerment and institutional support, or demand and supply.

A. Institutional and legal framework reforms Programs that improve institutional capacity and address legal and procedural barriers can facilitate access to legal identity documents. Civil registries are a primary institutional focus. Lack of a consistent, comprehensive and centralized registration database creates gaps and duplication, especially for mobile populations in regionally diverse countries. In many countries citizens have to travel back to their birthplace to obtain identity records or to make revisions to erroneous identity documents. At the same time, overly centralized civil registries create access problems for rural populations. Travelling to regional or national capitals to register a birth is a major disincentive. Improved capacity and autonomy of civil registries Modernization programs can buoy under-resourced government agencies to introduce best practices and technology. In many countries creation of a single agency is needed to coordinate registration and provision of legal identity documents. Institutional support to registries, or the agency tasked with registration, should include expanding operations to underserved areas, improving connectivity of these offices, introducing better databases, computerization, and improving internal staff capacity and procedures to ensure accurate and reliable information. Establish autonomous civil registration institutions. Without independence from the political arm of government, a civil registry will not develop the administrative capacity required to function adequately and will be at risk of a high turnover of personnel as successive, new governments assume power. A further risk in non-autonomous registries is manipulation and malfeasance for rent-seeking purposes or political maneuvering.548 Where an autonomous agency is not possible coordination between government agencies is essential. Many countries have multiple agencies with identification responsibilities. Each agency often administers databases for their specific function, without cross-checking statistical information. In these instances, programs should identify the benefit of creating a centralized agency that coordinates and ensures standardization and accuracy across each database. Decentralization Support to building institutional capacity should not ignore the role that local and municipal governments, religious institutions, and civil society play in providing information for registration. For example, church parishes, synagogues and mosques 548 Supra note 4 at 36 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 199 have played a key role keeping registries of births, marriages and other important life events in their communities. These resources have been used and trusted at the local level to create a legal or public identity. In Cambodia, commune councils submit monthly registration statistics to district level authorities, which in turn pass them to provincial level authorities. These authorities provide quarterly statistics to a central ministry by entering the registration data in a basic computerized spreadsheet with columns for population, numbers registered, and percentages registered. Such a system enables data to flow seamlessly from district and provincial levels to the central level.549 Programs should strive to establish standard mechanisms and procedures for collecting, documenting, transmitting, storing, consolidating, and analyzing data collected by local registrars and community partners. On the most basic level, this requires local registrars to effective procedures and mechanisms for verifying the accuracy of collected information. For example, all local registrars must consistently submit periodic reports to a central authority responsible for consolidating and analyzing data. Increased use of computers and digital databases at local registrars can assist this process, but often face additional obstacles. Legal and Regulatory Reform Legal and regulatory reform can relieve bottlenecks and inefficiencies preventing the efficient operation of civil registries thus creating barriers for poor and marginalized people when accessing legal identity documents. Legislation in most countries requires registration of a birth within 30 to 60 days. At any point beyond this legal grace period, registration becomes more complicated, costly, and lengthy. In some cases, this becomes too onerous, especially for the poor. Other changes to identification documents, such as correcting an erroneous name or wrong birth date often requires multiple affidavits, a judicial decision, and multiple trips to central government offices along with long waiting periods. Legal and procedural reforms should seek to increase the grace period for free birth registration \u2013 some countries have extended to 10 to 20 years\u2013bearing in mind access issues for the poor and isolated. Other reforms include decreasing formal legal processes required for late registration or considering alternative forms of supporting documentation for fixing erroneous identification such as documents available through local councils or community leaders. Programs should push to eliminate fees for birth registration and first applications for legal identification documents. The usual arguments supporting user fees for government services do not apply for legal registration.

Regulatory reforms are needed in these instances to allow institutions and service providers provision of benefits without onerous identification requirements. Regulations should be altered to consider whether identification is needed at all, such as for health services, and if so, to accept a variety of documents, besides a birth certificate, as legal identification. Examples of over-formalized and cumbersome national identity legislation are abundant. Restrictive legislation creates an environment furthering exclusion and informal economic activity. The 2004 Registration Act of Bangladesh, for example, mandates the production of birth certificates for a wide array of purposes\u2013going to school, employment in the formal sector, registering to vote, formally owning land and registering title to land, opening a bank account, receiving public utilities, paying taxes, obtaining a drivers license or registering a car, obtaining a trade license, passports for international travel, etc.550 Requiring a birth certificate creates barriers to formal economic opportunities, driving growth of the informal sector, and limits democratic participation for the majority of the population born outside of hospitals with no registration of their birth. B. Community\u2013based programs Large community awareness and direct documentation campaigns are essential for tackling the sheer size of legal identity gaps in many countries. They are often needed as an implementing mechanism for new legal and policy reforms to ensure reforms do not remain paper tigers. Developed and implemented correctly, reforms can also empower communities and citizens to build further momentum behind legal identity policy and legislation reform efforts. Awareness-raising Awareness-raising campaigns can serve to cultivate the agency of citizens to strengthen their own legal identity through better understanding of the benefits it provides to them and their children. Campaigns also increase knowledge of how to access identity documents, where to register births, and the availability of legal or other assistance for more complicated cases. Campaigns should be sensitive to cultural barriers, low literacy rates and the prominence of indigenous languages in many isolated communities and therefore incorporate methodologies such as radio programs and community drama groups to spread awareness. Direct documentation Civil registration and documentation campaigns can provide direct services to targeted, underserved populations that might otherwise face insurmountable barriers to legal 550 Supra note at 16 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 201 identity. Such populations include ethnic minorities, migrants, slum dwellers, rural communities, single mothers, and other isolated communities. Documentation campaigns should encourage alternative approaches such as the creation of ad hoc, itinerant and decentralized systems to register individuals. Many countries conduct campaigns boosting registration in underserved areas, only to see results not sustained over time. A successful example is Chile, which has annual expeditions to the remotest areas of the country to register civil events and issue identity cards. 551 Strategic documentation campaigns containing long-term perspectives will increase the level of general awareness in society and demonstrate the benefits of registration, thus increasing demand and community-driven solutions. Campaigns should be timed, coordinated, financed, and organized in a way that allows a long- term impact, including cooperation with civil society organizations closer to the needs of local people, their languages, and cultural traditions. In order to reach remote areas, it is equally important to develop strategies that diversify the support structure of civil registration with the help of local NGOs, churches, and community organizations. This has been the case in Nicaragua, an example highlighted later. Local organizations, such as the municipality, the church, or any other community organization, play important roles by encouraging and facilitating the process of civil registration for events such as birth, marriage, divorce, and death. In some countries, midwives and other individuals trusted by the community have been trained to register births and other civil events as an approach to increase the rate of registration. Advocacy Awareness-raising and access to registration services can sometimes have limited effect due to powerful underlying causes. Political and local power dynamics often create suspicion by the poor toward the state and its agents or create disincentives for registration that outweigh any benefits.

Programs should be careful to identify these causes and analyze the underlying dynamics to design appropriate interventions. Programs encountering barriers will likely have to address wider structural inequalities and integrate legal identity efforts into broader legal reforms. Broad-based legal service programs that include support to policy reform, advocacy and litigation have shown promise towards addressing these issues. Community legal services Access to community legal services can often provide a key, missing component of a systematic approach to fighting barriers to legal identity. Legal support services are commonly needed to respond to the often onerous administrative and legal requirements for late registration or revision of faulty legal identification documents. Programs, such as 551 Supra note 5 202 Legal Identity and MDG Implementation community justice, legal aid and information centers can play an essential role helping marginalized communities access information on securing legal identity and provide legal representation necessary to ensure enforcement.552 Public-interest litigation Lack of legal identity is sometimes a product of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender or other issues. In these instances, legal action is required to enforce rights. Systematic legal identity discrimination against entire segments of the population is common throughout the world, including the Roma in Europe, Dominicans of Haitian descent, and Nubians in Kenya. Immigrants are also systematically denied their right to an identity. There are active class action suits in both domestic and international forums according to violations of international treaties and jus cogens. International human rights litigation is most effective as part of a broader political strategy. International tribunal decisions are rarely enforced, but the visibility and political pressure they generate can stimulate compromise and mobilize domestic actors. Civil society plays an important state-monitoring role and creates the groundswell ensuring all people are recognized as \u2018people\u2019 in the eyes of the law. C. Country Examples UNDP has been implementing the Equal Access to Justice Project in Sri Lanka since 2006. The project has supported legal and mobile clinics through war-affected areas in the north and east. As part of its legal assistance work, the project supported mobile documentation clinics in priority areas by providing documentation services to large segments of the population, including large numbers of displaced people. The Project expands legal awareness on basic civil and human rights, as well as on the importance of civic documentation, through radio campaigns, schools, hospitals and other social services. There were over 29,000 legal identity beneficiaries in 2009 alone. The project provided a range of legal identity documents, including birth certificates, ID cards, marriage certificates, and titles to land. The Project also supports long-term sustainability through work with the Registrar General and the Registration of Persons Department to build capacity toward a national mechanism for the provision of civic documents. A number of donor-funded initiatives have attempted to modernize registration systems in Bangladesh. Responsibility for birth registration is decentralized and delegated to various local level authorities, resulting in inconsistent standards and widely divergent practices. Handwritten ledgers of births are stored with local municipal corporations, 552 For more detail on legal service programs assisting access to legal identity see.

A number of donor-supported initiatives provided computers, servers and other equipment as well as staff trainings in an attempt to digitize, centralize and standardize the central registry. However, human resource shortages and continued low capacity have resulted in most officials continuing to manually register people into ledgers. Central-level ministries rarely receive regular, reliable reports of registration from numerous local authorities. The World Bank, UNICEF and other international actors have been providing support to the Egyptian government to help thousands of women obtain legal identity cards, relying on local NGOs and community-based organizations. These local organizations have proved particularly valuable in registering wary, marginalized groups, such as women and ethnic minorities. UNICEF has worked in Angola for many years to strengthen national and local administrative systems and community capacity to increase access to legal identity. Local community workers are trained to write formal documents and to negotiate with government officials. Angola has introduced new systems such as specialized units within the civil registration system to work with excluded and vulnerable populations, created mobile registration units to access isolated communities, placed civil registration facilities in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d53983b2-5527-45ba-9114-8b678aa2fd46": {"__data__": {"id_": "d53983b2-5527-45ba-9114-8b678aa2fd46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62ebe1007017abdfb6e408e019d69710ba450f7b5686c76d6d15116af8681d36"}}, "hash": "62ebe1007017abdfb6e408e019d69710ba450f7b5686c76d6d15116af8681d36", "text": "hospitals, and introduced a unique personal identification number used on all legal identity documents from birth certificates to driver\u2019s licenses. 6. What UNDP can do? Conclusion and recommendations Access to legal identity is a crosscutting issue that should be addressed by all UNDP programs. Legal identity affects development objectives pertaining to virtually all of the Millennium Development Goals. The causes and ramifications are often not readily apparent upon initial program design, thus country offices should anticipate legal identity barriers and consider potential interventions. For example, empowering health care professionals to provide pre-natal care for registering newborns can substantially improve registration efforts. Recommendations for UNDP country offices include: 1. Analyze and be cognizant of registration requirements when designing develop- ment interventions, but at the same time ensure these interventions do not lead to unintended consequences.\u2013Development partners must determine if nation- al legal identity requirements could prevent mainstream development projects (e.g. in diverse areas such as health and education, development of small and medium enterprises, and delivery of utility services) from reaching target beneficiaries who lack necessary documentation. 2. When designing mainstream development projects in areas such as education, health, land rights, small and medium enterprise development services, and deliv- ery of utility services, development partners must critically analyze the potentially negative impact of the existing identity regime, i.e., how could existing legal identity regulations limit the range of project beneficiaries? 204 Legal Identity and MDG Implementation 3. Programs attempting direct registration campaigns in coordination with government partners should encourage outsourcing registration processes to local organizations, community councils, chiefs and elders, churches, mosques, and other places peo- ple engage in social and economic activities. In essence, make legal identity a part of everyday life. Local authorities play an important role providing local knowledge to the registration and legal identity process. Incorporating community councils, local chiefs, and community leaders can help civil registries and other centralized institu- tions liaise better with poor communities. Local leaders can provide information to the community as well as deal with state authorities. 4. Legal and regulatory reform is an important aspect for lengthening the period of birth registration as well as taking into consideration the objective and symbolic-cul- tural conditions of diverse population groups. 5. Incorporate legal service provision and strategic advocacy on legal identity issues, in particular to help drive reform of regulations to reduce barriers for the poor and marginalized. 6. Institutional improvements to improve the quality of civil registration depend not only on the individual agency and how it performs independently, but also on the importance of communication and coordination between agencies. 7. Complementary reforms are needed to make legal identity meaningful. Legal iden- tity documents can accomplish little by themselves but they can be an important component of a larger reform agenda for promoting inclusive development. 8. Understanding the country context, including the incentive structure of institutional actors, is essential. 9. Unless identity documents serve a higher purpose and have apparent relevance to people\u2019s daily lives, people are unlikely to take the time, money, and effort to register. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 205 Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups: A Personal Essay Based in Insights from Three Decades of Advocacy Madhu Purnima Kishwar The following chapter is based on a presentation given by Madhu Purnima Kishwar at a regional workshop on Ways and Means to Realize Social and Economic Rights at the Asia Pacific Regional Centre of UNDP in Bangkok on 6 September 2011. It is a personal account of three decades of advocacy on behalf of India\u2019s rural and urban poor. It offers a type of \u201cinstitutional and context analysis\u201d approach to the discourse on legal empowerment, legislative and institutional reform and access to justice. In its sober and pragmatic tone it represents a reality check to what is sometimes perceived as the idealistic and euphemistic manner such issues are at times discussed among development professionals. Kishwar describes various insights she and her organization, Manushi, have gained over three decades working on reforming inheritance legislation and practice in rural Bihar, the successful use of mythology-based community mobilization to enhance women\u2019s economic rights, and years of campaigning for a more sensible pro-poor approach to regulating rickshaw pulling and street hawking in Delhi. Kishwar concludes the potential of legislation as an instrument for strengthening the rights of vulnerable groups can be realized only if such efforts: 1.

The Battle for Women\u2019s Land Rights in Rural India Today, it is widely acknowledged economic dependence of women on men of their families is a prime cause of their vulnerable status in society. My involvement with this issue began with women at the bottom of our economic and social hierarchy. In December 1980, I was invited by a group of activists working in what was then south Bihar (and later became part of the new state of Jharkhand) to investigate allegations of sexual violence against women from tribal communities.553 During the course of this enquiry, one of the reasons for the initial reluctance of tribal women to speak openly about having been victims of sexual violence by someone outside the tribe was that they automatically lost their economic, social and ritual rights. They were considered ritually impure\u2014even water was not accepted from their hands or offered to them. If married, their husbands would have the right to divorce them without providing for them. If unmarried, they lost their right to work on and maintain by their parental land. They were usually forced to leave their homes as well as their village. Often, the only means of survival most of them had left were begging, prostitution and migration to the cities where they ended up as bonded labour in severely exploitative employment such as in the brick kilns. These findings, however, pointed to a broader context of systematic discrimination excluding women from equal rights to inherit land and hold title over property. These discriminations exist, despite the fact that, among all these communities, women are the primary cultivators. More than 90 per cent of economic activities, including agricultural operations, forest gathering, animal rearing, marketing of farm and forest produce, are performed by women. Except for ploughing, which is ritually prohibited for women, all other agricultural operations are essentially carried out by women. This discrimination is being given dubious legitimacy through a distorted interpretation of customary tribal law. Women are permitted only limited usufructuary rights in the family land, whether they are living with their parents as unmarried daughters, or after their marriage, in their marital home. In these tribal areas, as also in other parts of India, an unmarried or widowed woman exercising her usufructuary rights over land becomes very vulnerable to the rapacity and land-hunger of unscrupulous male relatives who think they can grab the land if they 553 The initial purpose of the visit was to investigate allegations of sexual atrocities and human rights abuses inflicted by the state police and paramilitary forces on tribal communities of the area battling for restoration of their traditional forest rights. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 207 can only get her out of the way. Thus, she is often either forced to surrender her lifetime usufructuary right or she becomes a target of violent attacks of various kinds. a. The land can only be inherited by sons or grandsons or other male descendants. Even in cases where there is no direct male heir, the woman still does not get any share in the land. The land goes to the nearest male agnates (relatives on the father\u2019s side) and if there are no eligible agnates, then the land becomes the common property", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83bd1d95-0cea-41d4-8041-92bc0dfeb779": {"__data__": {"id_": "83bd1d95-0cea-41d4-8041-92bc0dfeb779", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8afc1386c53c574aa7f74079bc954bc35df484230872fceb634eedb56b326608"}, "3": {"node_id": "aed8caca-8ab9-4084-af6c-ed11ea9fcfd3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3e6f13341807893149ffc574ecf2d22ed0c520f23778a14735a5b46132b248c"}}, "hash": "b555479ebfe909dafc4b187a82047e7512bd8091c0dfbc9f81f9cb37ee2c7758", "text": "of the village community represented by the Munda (headman). b. If a man dies, leaving a widow or a daughter, she is entitled to maintenance from the next male relative who takes the land and receives the gomong (bride price) on the daughter\u2019s marriage. This makes women totally dependent on their male relatives for their daily sustenance despite the fact that they may continue being primary workers on the land. c. In theory, a widow has usufructuary rights in the family\u2019s land for her lifetime. But in practice, when there are adult male heirs, the land is often taken over by them and there is no guarantee that her usufructuary rights will be respected. An unmar- ried daughter has usufructuary rights in the family\u2019s land only up to the time of her marriage. In both cases, women have no right to dispose of the land as and when they find it necessary. However, the male relatives who inherit the land, should they decide to mortgage or otherwise dispose of it, do not even need to consult the wom- en of the family who have usufructuary rights. d. In cases where a woman gets raped by a non-tribal man, even her usufructuary right in the land is denied to her. In District courts of this region, many of the lawyers brought to my attention a number of cases wherein single women \u2014 unmarried or widowed \u2014 had been murdered by their own relatives. In some of these cases, the ostensible reason given for killing them was that they were witches. But the real motivation was to eliminate the woman and take away her land. Local lawyers narrated numerous instances whereby women unmarried or widowed were implicated in false court cases as a strategy to deprive them of their land rights. Whichever way the case is decided, the women are likely to end up landless and destitute because if they are sentenced to a prison term on the charge of murder, the land will be taken over by the agnates; however, if they are acquitted, most of the land is likely to be under mortgage on account of the expenses of the court case. These women can only raise money by mortgaging their land, since they were very poor. The loss of usufructuary rights of tribal women due to rape by dikus (outsiders; non- tribals) has been increasing as the tribal society is increasingly invaded by outsiders and the immiserization of the tribal peasantry forces the tribals to seek outside employment in order to survive. Women constitute the bulk of this desperate migrant labour force. Wherever they are forced to seek work, be it in mines, in brick kilns, or on irrigation projects, as agricultural labourers or as domestic servants, they are subjected to sexual abuse and exploitation. But even when they are residing in their villages, they are not safe from sexual abuse by male outsiders such as the forest guards and the police. 208 Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups: A Personal Essay Based in Insights from Three Decades of Advocacy A Bitter Lesson Learnt From Early Setbacks During the course of my travel, I met a 55 year old Ho554 woman named Maki Bui, in Lonjo village of Sonua block, in Singhbhum district. Her husband, a retired police constable, had died about three months before I met her. While her husband was posted to different places, Maki Bui stayed in the village to take care of the land. But after he died, her husband\u2019s brothers and nephews became hostile. She told me that she feared for her life, that she might be killed any day by her husband\u2019s younger brothers and their sons. She had only one married daughter, and no sons. Her husband\u2019s brothers and nephews were determined to take away her land. They threatened that if she ploughed her land, they would forcibly take away the harvest.

But tribal women are not allowed to sell or mortgage their land because they are considered maintenance holders, not title holders. When I met her, her husband\u2019s agnates had already started accusing her of being a witch as part of a conspiracy to eliminate her. According to customary practice in her area, Maki Bui was entitled to occupy her husband\u2019s share of the family land during her lifetime. After his death, the land would revert to one of her husband\u2019s agnates rather than her already married daughter, Sonamuni, who would have been allowed limited usufructuary rights in her natal family land only if she had remained unmarried. When Maki Bui sought my help, I suggested we challenge the constitutional validity of the discriminatory tribal law. It appeared to me that it would be simple to get the Supreme Court to rule that those aspects of tribal customary law which discriminate against a woman\u2019s inheritance rights were unconstitutional. Manushi filed a petition in the Supreme Court on behalf of Maki Bui and her daughter, Sonamuni, whereby we challenged the denial of equal inheritance rights to women of their Ho tribe. Though this petition focused on the plight of Ho women, the conditions that contribute to women\u2019s vulnerability are as true for tribal women in most other parts of India, as well as peasant women in many other caste Hindu communities. Following Maki Bui\u2019s petition, which was published in Manushi No. 13, many other individuals and activists wrote to us saying the situation was similar among several other communities and therefore, they wished to join us in challenging these laws that 554 The Ho people are a tribe of people concentrated in what is now the Indian state of Jharkhand (previously southern Bihar), where they number around 700,000 people. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 209 discriminate against women in matters of inheritance. This included Mary Roy, from the Syrian Christian community, who filed a petition along the lines of the Manushi petition challenging similar discrimination against Syrian Christian women. From Maharashtra\u2019s Dhulia district, Sharad Patil, a prominent political activist working among tribals, also filed an intervention petition because many tribal communities in that area practiced similar denial of land rights to women. From within Bihar some activists working with the Jharkhand movement brought more intervention petitions involving other tribal communities. In Mumbai, activists of Nivara Hakk Samiti, who were fighting for the housing rights of pavement dwellers, wrote to say that they had decided to demand house pattas in the name of the women in these families. Even in neighbouring Nepal, activists who were in touch with Manushi such as Hisila Yami\u2013who worked as a volunteer with Manushi in 1980, and later became a prominent Maoist leader and government minister\u2013 responded to this issue with great enthusiasm and made it part of their own campaigns in villages of Nepal. Maki Bui\u2019s case thus seemed to have a large ripple effect. Within a short time, we had succeeded in getting the issue of women\u2019s land rights debated and discussed among a whole range of social and political organizations. However, in the Jharkhand region, almost all political leaders opposed our intervention. Many prominent church leaders of the area came out against it on the specious ground that giving women inalienable land rights would destroy the \u201ctribal culture and way of life\u201d. They dubbed it as a conspiracy to facilitate the takeover of tribal lands by scheming outsiders. They argued that it was impractical to give land rights to women because they go away to their marital homes and claim land rights there.555 Even though several leading activists of tribal rights movements in the region actively assisted Manushi in mobilizing opinion in favour of our petition, women of this region who stood to gain most from our intervention could not get organized and put up a united front in the same way that men did to safeguard their collective interests. In fact, Maki Bui\u2019s own female relatives turned against her, since her land was expected to revert to their families after her death. Since in most instances women\u2019s identification with men of their own families is much stronger than their sense of solidarity with other women, we could not unite them on gender lines. Those few who dared stand up were silenced through threats of violence. At the other end, the Supreme Court proved very ineffective in dealing with the case. Getting the case admitted into the Supreme Court was no problem.

The years that followed were full of unending petty harassment, slipshod court procedures and interminable delays. After the case was admitted on August 20, 1981, the Supreme Court ordered the Bihar government to ensure that during the period that the case remained before the court and until final orders were passed, they were to see to it that Maki Bui continued to enjoy her customary rights as a widow without fear or hindrance. 555 For a detailed study of the impact of denial of land rights to tribal women and response to the specious argument to justify the disinheritance of women see \u201cToiling without Rights\u201d, (Economic & Political Weekly, Vol XXII, No.3 17 January, 1987) 210 Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups: A Personal Essay Based in Insights from Three Decades of Advocacy But that was not to be. After the Court asked the Block Development Officer (BDO) to conduct an enquiry into her allegations, her in-laws\u2019 family began to harass and intimidate her even more for having dared to take them to Court. The B.D.O. was bribed to give a report in favour of her tormentors. We did all we could to get her case expedited. However, the Bihar government kept requesting postponement after postponement on one pretext or the other. In the meantime, Maki Bui was getting desperate as her in-laws made concerted efforts to drive her out of the village. Finally, she had to leave her village, Lonjo, and go far away to live in her daughter\u2019s village. Maki Bui had started off by asking our help to enable her to pass on her piece of land to her daughter. Instead of assisting her to get more than the discriminatory customary law allowed, her approaching the Supreme Court had actually endangered her life even further and she could not even continue living in her village. The local police as well as other government officials actively supported those who were endangering Maki Bui\u2019s life both in the village as well as by submitting false affidavits in the Supreme Court. We filed a petition alleging contempt of court against the Bihar government for violation of the court\u2019s interim orders that Maki Bui be offered protection. Even though, by now, our expectations of the Supreme Court had been scaled down considerably, we were still not prepared for what happened. Justice Ranganath Mishra, who heard the case at that stage, said openly in a packed court: \u201cWe can pass a contempt order if you insist. But what good will it do for the petitioner? The Bihar government or its police are not going to heed it any more than they did our original order. Better that you advise that old woman to continue staying with her daughter so at least she is safer than in her own village. Or else bring her to Delhi and keep her with you so she is safe.\u201d The Bihar government showed no inclination to propose a solution and the Supreme Court insisted on waiting for the Bihar government\u2019s proposal for finding a satisfactory formula on this issue. We had approached the Supreme Court in the hope that its judgment would help millions of women, not just Ho women, but other peasant women as well. Now the Supreme Court was itself admitting that it could not even provide this one woman with elementary protection, let alone strengthen her economic rights. Maki Bui and her daughter both died under mysterious circumstances years before the Supreme Court pronounced its judgment. Their deaths left me deeply traumatized and remorseful. Maki Bui\u2019s fate came to be a permanent symbol and reminder of the dangers of legal interventions without preparing adequate support within the community. It also taught me the importance of avoiding situations in which our interventions appeared like an attack from \u201coutsiders\u201d. This caution becomes doubly necessary when you are dealing with groups and communities who are much poorer and in a weaker position than those of us who take up their causes. Men of such communities are already victims of exploitation, discrimination and contemptuous treatment meted out to them by powerful outsiders. The low self-esteem and frustration of men of such downtrodden communities finds an easy outlet in oppressing women in their own community. That is the only way they can feel \u201cmanly\u201d since, in the outside world, their manhood is constantly crushed by powerful aliens.

Using \u201cshame\u201d or statist interventions as a weapon of transforming gender relations tends to generate anger and resentment rather than make them more sensitive to women\u2019s needs. In the intervening years, my experience of dealing with victims of domestic violence had demonstrated that when you appeal to men\u2019s sense of honour and justice, and work with them to find a solution to their problems rather than present work through statist measures, it produces far better results. Freeing of Enslaved Goddesses Fortunately, we had a chance to test this approach on a large scale through Manushi\u2019s association with Shetkari Sangathana (\u201cFarmers Organization\u201d)\u2013one of the largest and politically innovative mass-based movements of farmers at that time. The organization was founded in Maharashtra in 1980 by Sharad Joshi\u2014a former UN official turned farmer. In 1986, Joshi invited Manushi to come and participate in their newly formed women\u2019s front \u2013 Shetkari Mahila Aghadi and develop a programme of action aimed specifically at empowering women of farm households who had, till then, been mobilized mainly on economic issues affecting the farm sector. Since the Sangathana is committed to non-violent methods of agitation, their meetings and rallies are exceptionally disciplined without any policing methods. Therefore, women have always felt very safe and comfortable in this movement and participated in massive numbers. Many of them came into the movement with a do-or-die spirit. For many years they participated only on general issues affecting the farm sector as a whole without raising gender specific issues till Joshi decided to set up a separate wing for women. For the farm sector as a whole, the movement\u2019s emphasis was on farmers receiving due price for their labour, with economic freedom being the core issue rather than a demand for subsidies or protection from the government. Similarly, I advocated that the women\u2019s strategy should be to ensure they too do not have to live a life of hapless dependence with all economic resources concentrated in the hands of the men of the family. I was able to convince Joshi that for strengthening women\u2019s rights in the family, they need not wait till the government agrees to change this or that law. It was far more important that the Sangathana be able to persuade its followers to willingly give women of their family their due share in the family land. The product of this collaboration between Manushi and Shetkari Mahila Aghadi and Manushi was a unique campaign called Lakshmi Mukti Karyakram (\u201cLakshmi liberation programme\u201d). Sharad Joshi announced that any village which performed the following three acts for women\u2019s empowerment would be honoured as a Jyotiba Gram: 212 Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups: A Personal Essay Based in Insights from Three Decades of Advocacy 1. Voluntarily transfer a piece of land from husband to wife by a hundred or more fami- lies in the village. Such a village would be honoured as a Lakshmi Mukti gaon (a village which had liberated its hitherto enslaved Lakshmis) through a public function at which Sharad Joshi would personally distribute certificates of honour to each such family. 2. Close the village liquor shop by mobilising the whole village in order to curb drunk- enness and wife beating. 3. Ensure by consensus the victory of an all women panel in panchayat elections, A small remote village named Vitner in Jalgaon district made history by performing all the above tasks within a month and received the Jyotiba Phule award from the then Prime Minister of India. My very positive report on the amazing change in village culture as a result of these achievements enthused Joshi to launch a movement for the implementation of Lakshmi Mukti in all the districts where they had a stronghold. The only incentive offered was that Sharad Joshi himself would go and bestow certificates of honour to each such village. The nomenclature and symbolism of this unique campaign is in itself fascinating. In the Hindu mythology, the goddess of wealth is named Lakshmi. However, a wife is also traditionally referred to as \u201cgriha Lakshmi\u201d \u2013 i.e., goddess of the household. Likewise the birth of a daughter or daughter-in-law is also meant to be celebrated as the coming of Lakshmi in the family, even though many communities have come to see females as a burden rather than a blessing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac884c44-0013-434b-9bb6-d1a9bd18bc34": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac884c44-0013-434b-9bb6-d1a9bd18bc34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25eb86c8ea6b0f4874936d03a10efb8cd9bbf3caec8cc47a7aca719024416081"}, "2": {"node_id": "69aa16c5-174b-4c9c-987f-7be0c0315b74", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "218b7f420954f76c8c3b4b5cf10e6583e8db9cba82bce8241ccc5f669b47109e"}}, "hash": "aaf9e75dd65e309339eb3ffc06acac7144ca66a4f4d6c0b81393e03da62ccbab", "text": "Thus, the core message of the Lakshmi Mukti Karyakram was that by enslaving their household Lakshmis, the farmers had incurred the curse of poverty.

My own campaign speeches were more focused on the advantages Lakshmi Mukti would bring to farm families but Joshi\u2019s speeches dexterously used economics, mythology, and a sense of sacred and dharmic responsibility to get his point across. He would introduce the Lakshmi Mukti campaign by saying that so far the Sangathana had worked tirelessly to get various exploiters off the farmers\u2019 backs and ensure that farmers received fair and remunerative prices for their produce. Now, it was time for the Sangathana to ensure that men associated with the movement also were just to the women of the household. Their slogan \u201cBheekh naka hawe ghamache daam\u201d (we don\u2019t want concessions, we want the due price for our labour) could easily be used for lending legitimacy to women\u2019s right to land because women in most farm families are the primary workers on the land. Joshi linked the whole endeavor to an earlier Karzmukti Andolan (movement for freedom from debts) whereby he had built a case through careful economic calculations that the farm community needed to be liberated from the stress of indebtedness to government banks by writing off of their loans since the government robbed the farm sector of Rs.72,000 crores (72 billion) every year by artificially depressing prices of farm produce through numerous authoritarian, statist controls. He would then give them a similar lesson in household economics to explain the debt they owed their wives for the work they had performed but not been fairly compensated for. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 213 In village after village I would see men reduced to tears listening to Joshi\u2019s appeal. Within two years, men in hundreds of villages carried out the Lakshmi Mukti programme of land transfer to wives, celebrating the occasion as though it were a sacred festival. The entire village would be spruced up and decorated with men dancing to the beat of drums. We would be received with much fanfare with women performing art and singing songs as they received Joshi to preside over the certificate giving ceremony. Men seemed even more elated than women. Much of the initiative for preparing villages for Lakshmi Mukti was taken by young male cadres of the Sangathana. Some of the men I interviewed described the whole campaign as a mahayagna (a sacred dharmic ritual). The occasion would attract many people from neighbouring villages. After each public meeting, men from surrounding villages would come up and volunteer to establish similar transfers of land in their own village provided Joshi joined them likewise for the celebration. Thus far from creating a backlash among men, the approach of appealing primarily to the sense of fair play and justice among men created a supportive atmosphere for women to exercise their rights. Domestic violence went down dramatically in all such households where the beginnings of a new equation between men and women were being established. The Gandhian paradigm within which Joshi operated put great emphasis on self-respect and justice. Once men become self-respecting by giving up groveling before their own tyrants (in this case various government agencies) they are more easily able to extend the same respect to women. Men who themselves live under authoritarian regimes and controls become less self- assured and, therefore, more tyrannical towards women. Most important of all, the key men of the Sangathana led by personal example. They not only transferred land to their wives\u2019 names, but also encouraged them to take a part in Sangathana work. Their domestic conjugal lives showed visible improvements rather than becoming more stressful. Therefore, people could see for themselves that strengthening the rights of women need not lead to breakdown of the family or greater conflicts between husband and wife. Rather it could lead to happier relations. Men did not feel attacked; rather they felt elevated when being called upon to do justice and being honored for it. This campaign led to far reaching changes in the area, including creating greater space for women in political and public life of Maharashtra and curbing domestic violence. While the entire might of the Supreme Court and agencies of the Indian State failed to protect one Maki Bui, the enthusiastic response to the message of a respected leader could move many thousands of families into changing repressive norms towards women.

Why don\u2019t their owners invest in improving their technology so that pulling them does not involve such Herculean effort?\u201d The facts that emerged from informal interactions with rickshaw owners and street vendors told a story of daily economic war being waged against two groups of self employed urban poor by agencies of the state on account of perverse laws that trap both these legitimate occupations in a web of illegality. The License Quota Raid Raj Enshrined in the Cycle Rickshaw By-Laws: Policy Reforms Sabotaged Cycle rickshaws are the most eco-friendly of all vehicles. Since they do not consume petrol or diesel, they cause neither air nor sound pollution. Cycle rickshaws are a popular mode of short distance transport in most towns and cities of India. They provide one of the few \u201cinstant means of livelihood\u201d for poor rural migrants. Most pullers are seasonal migrants who leave their families in the villages so that they can keep their living expenses low and save as much as they can for sending home. Within a few hours of arriving in the city, by renting a rickshaw for the day, a migrant is able to not only earn enough to buy food for the day, but also to save something for sending home. As per the figures provided by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to the Delhi High Court there are nearly 600,000 rickshaws in Delhi alone requiring at least as many pullers who earn their living from it. In addition, thousands of people get employment in the small-scale industry that produces rickshaw parts. The rickshaw trade of Delhi also makes use of the services of thousands of repair mechanics and assemblers. At an average of four dependents per person, the survival of 35 lakh (3,5 million) people may thus be linked to Delhi\u2019s rickshaw trade. Less than 13 per cent of the citizens in Delhi own private motorized vehicles while 85 per cent have to rely on public transport, of which cycle rickshaws are a very crucial part, because they are versatile and multi-purpose in their uses for short distance commutes. However, instead of encouraging the use of this eco-friendly and employment friendly vehicle, municipal agencies and police have imposed numerous restrictions on this trade though laws and regulations, including arbitrary entry bans on plying cycle rickshaws on city roads on the plea that they are \u201cbackward\u201d relic and obstruct the smooth flow of motorized traffic. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 215 It is noteworthy that there are no quotas on the number of cars, trucks and other motorized vehicles plying in urban centers even though they cause deadly pollution. But cycle rickshaw ownership and operation is subject to draconian controls and stringent quotas. For example, in Delhi, the quota for rickshaw licenses was fixed at 600 during the 1960s; it was raised to 20,000 in 1976; and to 50,000 in 1993, when the actual number plying was reported to be 450,000. In 1997, it was raised to 99,000 and remains the same at a time when according to MCD\u2019s own admission in the High Court more than 600,000 rickshaws are reportedly plying in the City, including trolley rickshaws for carrying goods and garbage. The actual number of licenses issued to rickshaws in the year 2006-07 was 89,429. This quota was further reduced to 52,000 in 2007 However, all of rickshaws including the supposedly licensed ones carry the stigma of \u201cillegality\u201d because of the following restrictions that govern this trade. a.

Anyone can own a fleet of cars, trucks, or even airplanes. However, possessing more than one cycle rickshaw has been treated as a legal offence, punishable with the con- fiscation and destruction of the vehicle. Although this law was ostensibly meant to protect rickshaw pullers from being fleeced by supposedly exploitative rickshaw fleet owners, it is essentially a tool of exploitation by the police and municipal officials to extort bribes from unlicensed rickshaw owners and pullers, using the threat of impounding such rickshaws, destroying and selling them as junk. This is a major reason why most rickshaws are in a pathetic state in terms of their technology, functioning and visual appearance. Since the vehicle can be impounded any day with or without reason, owners spend no more than is absolutely necessary to keep the vehicle moving on the road. The situation on the ground is totally contrary to the legal requirement. The vast majority of cycle rickshaws (almost 99%) are owned by entrepreneurs who own 5 to 500 rickshaws and give them out to others on rent. The \u201cOwner must be Puller\u201d policy is impractical given the nature of the trade and the compulsions of those who come to pull cycle rickshaws. But the very existence of rickshaw fleet owners is illegal. Therefore, the 89,429 licensed rickshaws also end up being illegal. Since legally, no rickshaw operator is allowed more than one license, all others have to be made as benami licenses in the name of real or hypothetical rickshaw pullers. Thus, even after paying bribes, no one, including those who have paid bribes to secure benami licenses, can ply all their rickshaws legally and each one remains vulnerable to his vehicles 216 Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups: A Personal Essay Based in Insights from Three Decades of Advocacy being confiscated. Also, since most of the city roads have been officially declared as out of bounds for rickshaws, they are all vulnerable to seizure, extortion and harassment by the municipal agencies and the traffic police. There are a number of reasons why rickshaw pullers have no interest in owning their rickshaws: a. Unlike registration for motorized vehicles, licenses for cycle rickshaws have been frozen indefinitely by the MCD. Applications for owner/puller are accepted once in every 2-3 years. Application forms are given selectively to those who have made prior \u2018arrangements\u2019 with MCD officials. This denies opportunity to those pullers who may want to own a rickshaw to legitimize their status. b. Most pullers are seasonal migrants and stay in the city for some months, save mon- ey and go home for some days or weeks. Often they have to leave at short notice due to some emergency at home or their own sickness. Many prefer to go and work in the fields during harvest and sowing seasons, or for festive or family occasions. During the periods where they are absent from the city, they have no way to keep their vehi- cles safe. c. If they rent out or even let a family member drive their vehicle when they go to their village, it is likely to be confiscated. Therefore, even if they have the money they pre- fer not to buy a rickshaw. d. Even when they are in the city, most pullers sleep on the pavements or share small illegal jhuggis with fellow migrants. They have no place to park their vehicle safely at night. The vehicle is likely to be stolen if they leave it out in the open at night. e. Since a rickshaw license is not available on demand as a right, MCD officials take hefty bribes for issuing and renewing these licenses, which are valid for three years and require to be renewed every year. Pullers can neither afford the time and bribes required in getting a license, nor take the risks involved in owning a rickshaw that may be confiscated any day. f. Even licensed rickshaws are not spared confiscation and destruction on patently illegal grounds. The MCD routinely rounds up and confiscates a large number of rick- shaws under the guise of checking licenses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc9c056b-7064-4234-a5ec-2b969e9eedd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc9c056b-7064-4234-a5ec-2b969e9eedd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c330bbd21e9ae9c19bd0aa2a03ec2745114644e3902be8a875d71ca03570c03"}, "2": {"node_id": "493f004d-d5ac-4cc6-9b9e-bc8680829781", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b5ba8a0e486fea01dc24cec3299f45a7cf1fb8e02f4599da6bc7526c66bdc68"}}, "hash": "c3d8cae0d7f88c9997f095bd8d737ff4a63bdb43c76a3e85b5fa6df15fe3c8df", "text": "But an owner can get it released only if he can provide \u201cproof\u201d that he is the real owner and also that he was pulling the rick- shaw himself.

If it were his own vehicle, he would have to spend days, and a considerable sum of money, getting the vehicle released. An illit- erate and poor puller is far more vulnerable to abuse and fleecing than a fleet owner, who over the years acquires some bargaining power with those he pays bribes to. None of the pullers have the staying power to spend days and large sums of money on bribes to get the vehicle released without earning anything for that time/peri- od. By hiring a rickshaw on a daily basis, they lose nothing if the vehicle is confiscated and they can go and rent another rickshaw. Once the vehicle is confiscated, the owner has to pay a minimum fine of Rs. 325 to get the vehicle released, plus Rs. 100 per day as store charges for each day that the vehicle stays in municipal custody. Once it enters municipal records, the average expense for getting Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 217 a rickshaw vehicle released from the MCD yard comes to around Rs 600-1,000, including fines, store charges and payoffs. Often the fines demanded can be as high as Rs. 2,200 for passenger rickshaw and Rs. 5,000 for a goods carrying trolley rickshaw. Such expenses can only be incurred by those owning substantial fleets that give them staying power and a good profit margin to pay the bribes. Therefore, rickshaw owners run after municipal officials and try to strike a bargain so that they can get the vehicle released before it is entered in the record book. They do this by paying Rs. 200 to 300 in bribes, since in almost all cases, the owner is not the puller and most rickshaws are unlicensed. After seven days, even if you pay fines, the vehicle cannot be released and has to be crushed and sold as junk. Therefore, pullers find it preferable to rent the vehicle from fleet owners. Large parts of the city and all arterial roads have been declared as \u201cNo Entry Zones\u201d for rickshaws. The zoning rules formulated by the Traffic Police are arbitrary and impractical, since the forbidden zones cannot be avoided while ferrying passengers and goods. \u201cNo Entry Zone\u201d regulations do not mean that the police disallow rickshaws from plying on those roads. All it means is that rickshaw pullers are terrorized into paying extra bribes for plying there. In most instances there is no road sign to warn a puller that he is getting into a \u201cNo Entry Zone\u201d. The fleet owners survive by working out elaborate arrangements for monthly bribes through elaborate camouflage. For example, almost all rickshaws have embossed a word or real name of the fleet owner. This indicates to the police and MCD staff the identity of the man responsible for paying the bribe for that particular vehicle. Anyone who tries to ply a rickshaw without entering into such an arrangement will never get his vehicle back once it is impounded. As per the MCD\u2019s own admission, nearly 60,000 rickshaws were destroyed and sold as junk in 2005-2006. Many more times this number is released after the payment of bribes and penalties. (Hemraj Vs C.P. Delhi, CWP 3419/99). This indicates the number of rickshaws that were being junked every year. As per Manushi\u2019s estimates, the cycle rickshaw trade loses a minimum of Rs. 360 crores (3,6 million) every month in bribes, fines, confiscation and destruction of vehicles. In response to a sustained advocacy campaign and public hearings of rickshaw pullers organized by Manushi, Prime Minister Vajpayee announced a rational policy framework for the cycle rickshaw trade provided in the New Policy for Cycle Rickshaw Pullers and Street Vendors in August 2001. This policy accepted the need to dismantle the arbitrary \u2018License-Raj\u2019 and instead let market demand determine the number of cycle rickshaws in the city of Delhi. It also provided for on-demand registration as well as a ban on confiscation and destruction. However, instead of implementing this policy with a degree of sincerity, the entire machinery of governance, including the police and politicians went to great lengths to sabotage the new policy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf7d2b74-719d-4ce4-9221-07beb03bd8cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf7d2b74-719d-4ce4-9221-07beb03bd8cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90735be22e191647bb9769458a4ace586145efeb0ebc13eb2e6a3615107813ab"}, "2": {"node_id": "28f29390-535f-4345-acc6-1c4583c271b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89292e4c89dfee6f15d1565fea4aa9b6ad26c1470f95819e26e344929b0e462f"}}, "hash": "db17f56e2b0cfbb48b7de5f546ab68ad3f02311691e7fe5f3b454b28c6136dc5", "text": "The Municipal Corporation and police became more aggressive 218 Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups: A Personal Essay Based in Insights from Three Decades of Advocacy about confiscation drives.

This inevitably led to an increase in the bribe rates. A bizarre new scheme with many more restrictive clauses for issuing of licenses was announced by the municipal corporation in addition to reducing the license quota to 52,000 for the entire city. Simultaneously, they also stopped renewing old licenses and issuing new ones. Again, advocacy and regulatory change had resulted in unintended consequences that had made the lot of the targeted beneficiaries even worse in the short term. In 2006, Manushi filed a case at the Delhi High Court challenging unconstitutional provisions of cycle rickshaw policy and demanding a new legal regime that treated non- motorized vehicles (NMVs) as an integral necessary and desirable part of city transport. In a historic judgment, on February 10, 2010, a Constitutional Bench of the Delhi High Court declared the existing rickshaw policy unconstitutional for its patently discriminatory provisions. Most importantly of all, the court ruled that the city government must provide equitable road space for NMVs. For this purpose it ordered that the Delhi Government should appoint an empowered Task Force for evolving a new road transport policy for the city so that NMVs are treated as an integral part of traffic in the city. As a member of the Task Force, I took on the job of drafting a proposal for new legislation of NMVs. This legislation marks a major departure from the general run of laws in India which are drafted more with the intent to inflict punitive measures against citizens for not complying with unrealistic and unreasonable regulations rather than enabling citizens to exercise their citizenship right to livelihood with dignity. As opposed to cycle rickshaw by-laws whose stated intent was to control the number of rickshaws plying in the city, the new draft law defines its purpose as follows: \u201cto make provisions to protect the Constitutional rights to equality and livelihood of persons engaged in the non-motorized vehicles sector, promote the use of eco-friendly employment friendly and cost-efficient non-motorized vehicles as an integral and necessary part of vehicular traffic, provide equitable road space and separate NMV tracks for such vehicles on city roads as mandated in the Delhi Master Plan-2021.\u201d The Draft Law also eliminates the colonial minded licensing system by creating a separate Authority (Non Motorized Vehicle Use Promotion Authority) for registration of NMVs. It takes away the arbitrary power of refusal previously vested in the licensing department of the municipality. It mandates that registration will be granted instantly on payment of prescribed amount as a fee so fixed by the Authority from time to time. It abolishes the existing system of quotas and caps to limit the numbers of cycle rickshaws in the city. In case the registering authority fails to issue a registration certificate within the specified timeframe without assigning a valid reason, the application itself will be considered as Deemed Registration. Registration of cycle rickshaws as well as pullers is to be made available on demand on any working day of the year. While issuing the pullers\u2019 Photo I Card, it will be the duty of Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 219 the registration issuing authority to ensure that the applicant views a well designed video recorded training module regarding the traffic regulations of Delhi, So that new entrants to this occupation coming from rural areas are not harassed by the police for their lack of knowledge of traffic regulations. Even with such a clear mandate from the Court, city authorities are reluctant to implement the new policy. It was a stroke of luck that the Supreme Court refused to issue a stay order and in fact asked the High Court to monitor the implementation of the new policy on a monthly basis. However, the case will be heard in full by the Supreme Court and if we get a bench unsympathetic to the cycle rickshaw pullers, we could well end up losing the ground gained so far. But if we win the case and the High Court monitors the new policy diligently, the road architecture of not just Delhi will have to undergo a sea change to create an NMV-friendly, pedestrian-friendly city. As of now, both the police and MCD are doing all they can to slow down the construction of NMV tracks and sabotage the functioning of those already constructed as pilot projects. \u2022\ufffd Delhi Police continues with arbitrary bans for NMVs and creating No Entry Zones. \u2022\ufffd In addition, the police has appealed to the Supreme Court that it also be given the power to confiscate and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3979b85-1582-4ba0-973f-96dd90d48f3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3979b85-1582-4ba0-973f-96dd90d48f3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa975b524e55a05b7db1f4573d4f221aef1378d1c214a0b4a267ada273414856"}}, "hash": "fa975b524e55a05b7db1f4573d4f221aef1378d1c214a0b4a267ada273414856", "text": "junk rickshaws if they are plying without license.

The Case of Delhi Street Vendors Street vendors in countries like India provide a vital link between the producer and consumer, connecting the two in innovative, cost effective ways according to varied requirements of people during different seasons, festivals as well as during various times of the day or night. As per the National Policy for Street Vendors, nearly 2.5% of the urban population is involved in street vending and hawking. This means that this occupation provides livelihood to nearly 10 million people in India. With an average of four dependents per vendor, the survival of 50 million people relies on street trading. A sensible policy would be to encourage this form of self-employment in a country with high levels of unemployment and 93% working in the unorganized sectors of the economy. Instead, government rules and regulations are designed to keep hawkers vulnerable to extortion and human rights abuses. Despite Supreme Court judgments declaring that street vending is covered under the fundamental right to livelihood clause of the Constitution, municipal agencies all over India have managed to keep the vast majority of vendors illegal and insecure by ensuring 220 Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups: A Personal Essay Based in Insights from Three Decades of Advocacy a gross mismatch between the number of vendors on the streets and those who are bestowed licenses. For example, as per the affidavit to the Supreme Court, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi claims there are at least 300,000 vendors in Delhi alone. Unofficial estimates put the figure at 500,000. But licenses have been issued to less than 3,000. This in effect means less than one percent of vendors have a legal status while 99 percent are treated as law offenders and face their daily work under perpetual insecurity. Municipal Corporations all over India carry out daily raids to remove vendors and confiscate their goods in addition to frequent large scale \u201cclearance operations\u201d under the guise of decongesting roads or \u201cbeautification\u201d of the city. The real purpose of these eviction drives is to keep vendors terrorized so that they dare not resist paying bribes. In Ahmedabad, the Municipal Corporation issued a circular in 1993 saying that henceforth no new licenses would be issued and all old licenses stood cancelled. In Mumbai, after several High Court and Supreme Court orders, in 2005 licenses were issued to about 15,000 out of an estimated 250,000 vendors but in past five years nearly 200,000 vendors have been pushed out from this mode of livelihood. In Patna, 2,000 vendors out of 80,000 have received licenses after a long struggle both in and out of courts. There have been cases of vendors burning themselves to death in front of municipal offices in smaller cities like Gwalior, Patiala, and Lucknow in order to protest against repeated eviction drives and daily harassment. There is not even a semblance of \u201cdue process\u201d in all of this. The municipal employees swoop down and pick up what they can from whoever fails to run away fast enough to save his/her goods. Often the fines imposed or the bribes demanded for returning confiscated goods are so outrageous that in most cases the vendors cannot afford to pay the sums demanded so that their goods are either stolen by municipal employees or rot in municipal warehouses. This is illustrated by the following examples: On the basis of citywide interviews carried out in the year 2001, Manushi calculated that in Delhi alone the terror unleashed by the threat of clearance operations targeted at vendors leads to loss of income due to bribes and confiscation of goods worth Rs 500 crores (50 million) per year, plus enforced idleness for long periods and heavy indebtedness. Absurd restriction and quotas on street vending are a by-product of municipal laws imposed on India by the British in the 19th century making it illegal to vend without a license, which is issued at the sole discretion of the municipal officers.

Municipalities all over India stopped issuing licenses to street vendors since the 1960\u2019s and those received got licenses represent only a minuscule proportion of vendors operating in any urban area. Individual vendors as well some of their unions have had to fight long drawn-out battles in the High Courts of various states as well as in the Supreme Court of India demanding the right to pursue their occupation legally. The judgment of 30th August 1989 delivered in the Saudhan Singh and Others Vs NDMC case (1989) became a historic landmark because it ruled that \u201c\u2026the fundamental right of livelihood under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution cannot be denied to street/pavement hawkers\u2026\u201d and that \u201cstreet trading should be seen as a \u201clegitimate trade, business or occupation\u201d. The Supreme Court also Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 221 ruled that proper hawking zones should be created in cities and towns so that hawkers could operate without inconveniencing other citizens. In addition to mostly ineffectual interventions by the Supreme Court and various cases in the High Courts of India, there have been two national level policy reform measures by the Central Government. In August 2001, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office announced a new policy for street vendors and cycle rickshaw pullers in response to Manushi\u2019s campaign on behalf of these two sectors (see above). This historic document accepted the basic premise that the economic reforms agenda needs to be extended to those working in the self organized informal sectors of the economy. Therefore, it recommended easy entry into these two occupations by dismantling the restrictive licensing policies as well as banning confiscation and destruction of their means of livelihood. In the same year, a Task Force for Street Vendors was appointed by the Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation for drafting a National Policy for Street Vendors, which was duly adopted by the Central Cabinet in January 2004. The most significant innovations of this policy were that it \u2022\ufffd Laid down guidelines for \u2018regulation\u2019 instead of \u2018prohibition\u2019 of street vending and rickshaw pulling. Licensing was to be replaced by a simple registration process without any arbitrary quota. \u2022\ufffd Mandated that street vendors cannot be evicted in the name of beautification or cleaning drives. If vendors have to be moved or evicted due to unavoidable circumstances,, they should be simultaneously rehabilitated to restore their livelihood to the previous level. Despite repeated interventions by the courts, asking various governments to implement the National Policy for Street Vendors, municipal authorities all over India have failed to implement orders requiring them to rationalize the licensing system for vendors. If anything Clearance Operations have become more frequent and more violent, even in smaller cities. For example, during the \u201cbeautification drive\u201d to prepare Delhi for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, more than 1.5 lakh (150,000) hawkers were driven out of Delhi. Despite repeated interventions by the courts and reminders by the Urban Development Ministry, only a handful of towns and city governments have made provision for Hawking Zones. These two are on a very modest scale. No city has legalized all existing vendors. In a few cities, a token amount of space has been earmarked for hawking zones. The disregard for livelihood concerns of the urban poor is evident in the fact that the ambitious Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission does not even mention the need to provide space for micro- enterprises in City Development Plans. The battle is becoming more and more unequal as the elite sections and town planners develop ambitions for western-style gentrification of our towns and cities. In such an environment vendors are portrayed as causes of chaos and disorder and become easy targets. The battle is becoming so grim that there have been several cases of self-immolation by street vendors to protest clearance operations without alternative sites being provided to them in their respective cities.556 556 See article: \u201cDestroying Swadeshi Retail Sector\u201d Manushi issue 153 of 2006 222 Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups: A Personal Essay Based in Insights from Three Decades of Advocacy History of the Model Market at Sewa Nagar A key argument offered by municipal agencies and the police for not legalizing the status of street vendors is that street hawkers cause obstructions for other road users and also spread chaos and squalor.

We raised funds through personal donations from Manushi supporters, hired a team of architects and submitted a detailed plan of action to MCD. Each project member voluntarily signed an oath (Shapath Patra) on Rs. 10 stamp paper agreeing to abide by the following disciplines: a. Pay a monthly rent of Rs.390/ to the MCD through Manushi; b. Contribute towards the salary of the Cleaning Brigade specially hired to maintain cleanliness in the project area; c. Stay within the agreed-upon Sanyam Rekha, (Line of Discipline) Hawkers who do not observe this discipline agreed to be fined Rs. 100 per violation of Sanyam Rekha. d. Promise not to build any extra structures above or outside the stall area; e. Promise not to sell or rent out the allotted stall.557 The vendors accepted that those who violate these disciplines are liable to have their membership cancelled. Manushi also took the responsibility for redesigning the vending platforms to improve their functionality, and aesthetic appeal. On April 10, 2003, Supreme Court gave a go-ahead to MCD to execute two pilot projects but the police succeeded in sabotaging one of them at inception. For the second one, we were able to get the municipal corporation to sign an official Agreement with Manushi on April 7, 2004. This empowered Manushi to implement and manage a pilot project at Sewa Nagar to create a model hawker market. 557 It is noteworthy that while in the case of rickshaws we battled hard to get the Court and policy makers to accept that owning multiple rickshaws ought not to be treated as a crime, in the case of street vendors, the draft law mandates that no one be allowed to own more than one stall. It also mandates an exit policy for vendors whereby they cannot hold a vendor registration beyond a 15 year period whereas for rickshaw owners there is no such requirement. This in itself poses a tough challenge for the implementation authority. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 223 The Sewa Nagar project started in October 2004 amidst violence and repeated assaults from the police and local extortionist mafia for the following reasons: 1. Since membership of the project gave legal protection to vendors who are members of the Manushi pilot project vendors stopped paying monthly bribes. The police as well as the local mafia panicked at the long term implication of letting a disciplined, self regulated \u201cBribe Free Zone\u201d survive because it would create a \u201cdangerous\u201d role model. 2. Manushi refused to give in to threats, violent attacks and blackmail tactics of local mafia including intervention by the municipal councilor, Member of (State) Legis- lative Assembly (MLA) and Member of (Union) Parliament of the area, each of who wanted a certain number of stalls to be handed over to \u201ctheir men\u201d who act as local touts for bribe collection and play a \u201chelpful\u201d role in elections. As a result, the new civic infrastructure was repeatedly damaged and the new pavements, drains and stalls were time and again vandalized during and even after construction. Project members were repeatedly subjected to violence, intimidation and life-threats to make them abandon the project. When the terror tactics failed, the mafia approached the High Court for a stay order on the basis of bogus and flimsy allegations. The High Court refused to grant a stay. But the goons keep filing more and more bogus objections to harass and tire us out. Despite the violent attacks and endless harassment, we managed to create India\u2019s first \u201cBribe Free\u201d well ordered hawking zone. It was selected as a role model by the UN Commission for Legal Empowerment of the Poor. That certification, however, seems to have endangered us further and triggered off more violent attacks. Unable to grab stalls through violence or blackmail, the local mafia developed a new strategy. Due to the absence of credit facilities, many vendors are indebted to the mafia. Even when vendors pay hefty installments, the debt keeps mounting because the interest rate is astronomical.

Therefore, on January 4, 2007 eleven stalls were sealed by the MCD. This firm action aimed at the mafia unleashed a new and more deadly wave of violence and terror against Manushi. The reason for the violence is understandable. Due to the transformation of Sewa Nagar from a slum-like hawker market to a neat and well-developed area, the market value of each stall and the combined value of the entire pilot project area is today worth several crores. Each stall already commands a black-market price of Rs.5 to 15 lakhs (500,000 to 1,5 million) depending on its location. Before Manushi took charge of the area, the vending spots used to sell for prices ranging from Rs 1 lakh to 1.5 lakhs (100,000 to 150,000) each. 224 Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups: A Personal Essay Based in Insights from Three Decades of Advocacy Since April 30th 2007, none of us can enter that area without risking our lives. Several pilot project members were beaten out of the area. I myself faced several murderous attacks by the local goons. Even though the Lt. Governor of Delhi as well as the Prime Minister\u2019s Office intervened to demand strict action against the antisocial elements, the pilot project eventually collapsed because the police ganged up with local politicians and failed to take necessary action against them. In fact, the police gave full support to anti-social elements in registering false criminal cases against me and key members of the pilot project to browbeat Manushi into yielding to their demand. These cases started in 2007 are not likely to conclude any time soon. The ultimate failure of the Sewa Nagar project taught us once again the limitations of legal measures for empowerment of the poor without an honest and effective implementation and monitoring machinery in place. Therefore, when asked to help with drafting model legislation for street vendors by the Urban Development Ministry and later the Delhi State Government, I had to go beyond scrapping the restrictive licensing regime. The draft law I prepared mandates the creation of an autonomous body capable of not only institutionalizing transparent procedures for ensuring that only those who are actually vending on the streets themselves are registered as vendors but also creating adequate and functional hawking zones with the required infrastructure in place. In addition, the draft law envisages hi-tech monitoring through CCTV cameras to ensure that those allotted stall spaces do not end up getting evicted forms of coercion. The Proposed Draft Act on Street Vending and Hawking The purpose of this Act is not to \u201ccontrol\u201d but to \u201cto protect the Constitutional right to earn a livelihood of persons engaged in street vending and hawking in Delhi; to include street vendors as an integral, lawful, legally protected and necessary part of the urban economy; to implement the National Policy for Street Vendors (NPSV) to create legally protected hawking zones and hawking clusters; to plan space for street vendors in consonance with the Delhi Master Plan-2021; to constitute a \u201cStreet Vendor Protection and Regulation Authority\u201d (SVPRA) to ensure the implementation of the street vendor protective provisions of the NPSV in the National Capital Territory of Delhi; to end illegal harassment, beatings and confiscations of goods of street vendors; and for matters connected therewith or incidental to the above. Key features of the proposed law are as follows: 1. Quota free registration: There shall be no numerical limit placed on granting regis- tration for vendors and hawkers. 2. Rules for registration: The SVPRA will establish simple, transparent rules and proce- dures for registration of vendors within a specified time frame 3. Deemed registration: If on completion of the specified period, no response is received by the applicant about rejection or deficiencies in the application, the appli- cant shall be deemed to have been registered.

Disciplinary Action against malafide denial: The failure of the SVPA to provide regis- tration or the Deficiency Memo within the prescribed time limit as well as the failure to include the applicant in the digitalized waiting list shall invite disciplinary action against the concerned officer as per the rules prescribed under this Act. 8. Validity period of vending: A vending registration will be valid for a period of 5 years. It may be renewed for a further two terms (a total of 15 years) after which the vend- ing holder will surrender all claims to that site. 9. Vending is non-inheritable: Vending sites shall not be ordinarily inheritable, except in case of demise of the registered vendor during the 15 year term. In case of the death or incapacity of the registered vendor, it shall be incumbent upon the legal heirs of the person to inform the concerned Authority. Any move to illegally sell off or rent that vending site shall lead to eviction from the site. 10. Surrender of registration: If the Vending Authorization holder leaves the City, gets a full time job or becomes incapable of vending on account of illness or other fami- ly compulsions, he/she shall surrender the vending registration within the time frame mandated in the Rules under this Act. 11. Draw of lots for registration: The Zonal Vending Authorities will decide on new regis- tration by a draw of lots held every six months for hawking zones and clusters under the respective jurisdiction of each Zonal Authority. 12. Registration data to be available on website: Each Zonal Vending Authority (ZVA) will provide on its website the exact data about the number of vendors registered in that Zone along with photograph, name, address of the registered vendor and the exact location of his vending site. It shall also provide the names and addresses of vendors whose registration has been suspended, cancelled or revoked along with the reasons for the above mentioned disciplinary action. The SVPRA will provide the comprehensive, combined data provided to it by ZVAs on its website along with all relevant information regarding vending applications, registration procedures and waiting list of Vending applicants. 13. Pending applications: The ZVA website shall also provide on its website the names and addresses of all the pending applicants for vending sites or for mobile vending and list the reason for delay in granting a vending site. 14. Assessment of Holding Capacity: The SVPRA shall regularly assess the holding capacity of each zone to absorb street vendors in a manner that provides avenue for gainful employment to the maximum possible number of vendors without causing undue inconvenience to other road users. 15. Deficiency Memo: If the application does not fulfill the stipulated requirements, a Deficiency Memo, in respect of vending registration, as the case may be, shall be 226 Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups: A Personal Essay Based in Insights from Three Decades of Advocacy provided to the applicant instantly. As soon as the deficiency is complied with, the applicant shall be entitled to be put on the waiting list for vending site. 16. Year round applications: Application forms for vending will be made available on the website of SVPRA and accepted on all working days of the year at all the ZVAs. 17. The draft law tries a delicate balance between easy entry into this occupation for new migrants to the city and the need to maintain civic discipline by preventing a free for all situations in the city by earmarking three kinds of zones: 18. \u201cGreen Zone\u201d means an area notified by the SVPRA or the Zonal Authority where a vendor may start hawking without the necessity of prior registration and without prejudicing the vendor\u2019s right to apply for registration in an \u201cAmber Zone\u201d 19. \u201cAmber Zone\u201d means a clearly delineated area notified by the SVPRA or the Zon- al Vending Authority (ZVA) where a vendor must have prior registration in order to occupy a designated space for setting up his/her vending stall. 20. \u201cRed Zone\u201d means a clearly demarcated area where vending is altogether or partially prohibited during certain hours or days by SVRPA. Despite all these \u201csafeguards\u201d, there is very little chance of an effective street vendors law getting enacted and even less of a chance of it being implemented with sincerity because elected representatives are not willing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa5205a7-ea74-4b5a-b915-f770b7df9b9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa5205a7-ea74-4b5a-b915-f770b7df9b9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f29e84341a7d773ace84362ad1251808628f532024d7e5de51fb62468b33edda"}}, "hash": "f29e84341a7d773ace84362ad1251808628f532024d7e5de51fb62468b33edda", "text": "to accept a system where they do not have ultimate authority deciding who gets registered and who does not, as well as administering the location of hawking zones. With land being scarce and a very high priced resource, vendor stalls have become highly valued assets. This occupation, especially in big cities, provides an entry point into the world of entrepreneurship and avenue for upward mobility. Yet, as of now, political mafias often exercise control over vending spots in collaboration with the police. To break this unholy nexus, far reaching police and judicial reforms must ensure law and order machinery supports lawful practices and acts in accordance with the Constitution. Reform must also ensure courts have the capacity to offer effective and speedy protection to people whose rights are violated. In addition, radical electoral reforms need to ensure money and muscle power do not dominate politics and the machinery of governance and that elected representatives cannot manipulate the administrative machinery for building illegal empires of wealth and patronage for themselves. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 227 Human Rights and Poverty in Development Programming Alison Graham 1. Why human rights in development programming? The understanding of poverty has moved beyond previous definitions of insufficient income. It is now understood as a result of mutually reinforcing deprivations including feelings of powerlessness, entrenched discrimination, marginalisation and a lack of access to essential social services such as education and health. As the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, \u2018in the recent past, poverty was often defined as insufficient income to buy a minimum basket of goods and services. Today, the term is usually broadly understood as the lack of basic capabilities to live in dignity. This definition recognizes poverty\u2019s broader features, such as hunger, poor education, discrimination, vulnerability and social exclusion.\u2019558 Following the indivisibility of human rights, each of these deprivations affects and reinforces the others and perpetuates the cycle of poverty. Understanding poverty in this way, as the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty559 has recognised, demonstrates human rights and extreme poverty as being linked in at least three ways: (a) poverty can be both a cause and a consequence of human rights violations; (b) the realization of all human rights and efforts to eliminate extreme poverty are mutually reinforcing; and (c) human rights norms and principles provide the framework for poverty reduction and/or eradication.560 2. The international human rights normative framework:561 Human rights principles & standards, and monitoring mechanisms Individuals\u2019 and peoples\u2019 human rights are recognised and guaranteed by international human rights treaties dealing with, amongst others, civil and political rights; economic, social and cultural rights; and the elimination of racial discrimination. Several human rights treaties also address the situation of particularly groups, many of which are especially 558 See Poverty and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 4 May 2001, E/C.12/2001/10. 559 The Independent Expert is one of the thematic special procedures of the Human Right\u2019s Council. 560 See Progress Report of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep\u00falveda Carmona, on the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights A/ HRC/15/41, 6 August 2010 561 While in Africa, Latin America and Europe there are regional human rights systems, there is no such regional system in the Asia-Pacific Region. 228 Human Rights and Poverty in Development Programming vulnerable to human rights violations and are often subsequently living in precarious situations including extreme poverty. These include the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the Convention on the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Their Families; and the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Human rights most often denied or jeopardised for persons living in extreme poverty include the rights to: recognition as a person before the law; privacy and protection from intrusion in family life; life, personal security and physical integrity; equal and effective access to justice; an adequate standard of living, including access to food; safe drinking water and sanitation; adequate housing, security of tenure and protection from forced evictions; the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; work and rights at work; social security; education and take part in cultural life.562 UN Monitoring mechanisms at the global level The UN has developed a number of monitoring mechanisms aimed to review States implementation of human rights obligations.

Each State party is reviewed by the treaty body on a periodic basis, usually every 4-5 years. The review is based on the State party\u2019s own report and information submitted by civil society and non-governmental organisations (parallel or shadow reports). After concluding its review the treaty body issues Concluding Observations/Recommendations to help assist States implement their obligations. To also assist States, treaty bodies develop authoritative interpretations on the content of rights and provisions contained in their respective treaties. These are called General Comments/Recommendations. Many of the treaty bodies are also able to consider individual complaints.564 By helping states realise human rights, all of these treaty monitoring bodies deal with issues related to the MDGs but several are particularly relevant such as the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. All of these address issues such as the right to food, health, education and the vulnerable situation of marginalised populations. 562 These have been identified by the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty. See Progress Report of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep\u00falveda Carmona, on the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights A/HRC/15/41, 6 August 2010 563 For more information on the human rights treaty monitoring bodies see Simple Guide to the UN Treaty Bodies, International Service for Human Rights, 9 July 2010.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 229 The Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council565 The term \u2018special procedures\u2019 is the general name given to mechanisms established by the Human Rights Council to address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Currently, there are 33 thematic and eight country mandates. Special procedures\u2019 mandates usually call on mandate holders to examine, monitor, advise and publicly report (including to the Human Rights Council and sometimes the General Assembly) on human rights situations in specific countries or territories, known as country mandates566, or on major phenomena of human rights violations worldwide, known as thematic mandates.567 Various activities are undertaken by special procedures, including responding to individual complaints, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation at the country level, and engaging in general promotional activities. The importance of special procedures on the Human Rights Council has already been acknowledged by UNDP. For instance, UNDP has asserted the Human Rights Council\u2019s special procedures are valuable in \u2018assist(ing) UNDP Country Offices in determining possible new programme areas in a particular country.\u2019568 In recent years, these Special Procedures have increasingly begun to reflect and refer to the importance of human rights in achieving the MDGs. On 17 September 2010, just prior to the High Level Summit on the Millennium Development Goals, UNDP released a press release entitled \u201cWithout human rights, Millennium Goals will fail.\u201d569 The Universal Periodic Review mechanism is a new mechanism of the Human Rights Council that comprehensively reviews implementation of all human rights obligations of a given State on the basis of: reports submitted by the State itself, civil society and information contained in the reports of independent human rights experts and groups known as the Special Procedures, human rights treaty bodies, and other UN entities. Following its review, the Human Rights Council issues an \u2018outcome report\u2019 providing a summary of the actual discussion. The report consists of questions, comments and recommendations made by States to the country under review, as well as responses by the reviewed State including whether or not it accepts the recommendations. During the UPR process, States are increasingly recognising links between poverty, the MDGs and human rights.

Useful tools for development practitioners Each of these monitoring systems has a number of tools that can be used by development practitioners in adopting a human rights based approach, particularly in the context of working to achieve the MDGs: Treaty body system: Concluding Observations are extremely useful for development practitioners to gain an idea of priority problems for human rights implementation in a particular country and are often of particular relevance to the MDGs. For example, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has frequently noted issues of concern such as child malnutrition and quality of maternal healthcare. The Committee expressed concern over the Maldives\u2019 high rates of child malnutrition, the quality and accessibility of maternal health care, and the unavailability of essential medicines on many of the small islands. Concluding Observations/Recommendations typically consist of three sections: acknowledgement of positive steps; identification of problematic areas; and practical steps for States to improve compliance with the respective treaty. While not legally binding, they are authoritative since by ratifying the relevant treaty, State parties accept the competence of the treaty body to review their compliance with the treaty. Development practitioners can also use jurisprudence arising from various individual complaints mechanisms and the General Comments/recommendations to gain more information about how a specific right should be implemented. Of particular interest for development practitioners are the General Comments of the Committee on Economic, Social Cultural Rights elaborating the content of rights such as the right to health, water, food, social security and work. Special procedures: Each Special Procedure produces a number of reports and recommendations on both thematic and country specific issues. Each of these reports can be used by development practitioners to identify many issues affecting people, especially poor individuals and families vulnerable to human rights abuses and violations. Many of the Special Procedures have also specifically dealt thematically with the issue of poverty and the MDGs. The Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty drafted a Progress Report regarding guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights, which specifically addresses how States should implement human rights obligations with regards to people living in extreme poverty. This provides assistance for removing barriers facing the poor in their attempt to escape poverty.571 The Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation report to the 2010 571 See Progress Report of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep\u00falveda Carmona, on the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights A/ HRC/15/41, 6 August 2010 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 231 General Assembly focused on how human rights, in particular human rights for water and sanitation, can help realize the Millennium Development Goals.572 Universal Periodic Review Mechanism: As the outcome of a unique universal State-led review mechanism, the Outcome Document carries significant weight as the voice of the international community of States. UN agencies can play a critical role supporting states following-up the review process and implementing recommendations contained in the Outcome Document including translating and disseminating recommendations, providing technical support and helping mobilize necessary resources for implementation 572 See the Report of the independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related

Introduction This paper573 is written in the context of discussions within UNDP and the wider development community in Asia-Pacific on how to structure programmes aimed at meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. As per UNDP\u2019s 2010 MDG Breakthrough Strategy, renewed and concerted efforts are to be made to help developing countries accelerate progress towards reaching the Goals, but also to ensure longer term sustainability of the progress made, and to ascertain overall progress made by countries also reaches the poorest of the poor, marginalized people and those otherwise left behind. The article discusses the MDGs within the context of the Millennium Declaration and revisits debates of the past decade on the complex relationship between the Millennium Declaration, the MDGs and Human Rights. The article also highlights the dimension of democratic governance for the MDGs. Following this rather conceptual and normative perspective, a brief summary outlines actual progress made in the context of the MDGs a decade into the new Millennium and offers an interim view on the effectiveness of MDGs to implement the Millennium Declaration\u2019s aspirations. With less than five years to go before reaching the 2015 target date, the article captures main features of the 2010 review and various efforts aimed at breakthroughs and acceleration.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b4712dc-61f9-47b5-8b1f-b35109394b58": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b4712dc-61f9-47b5-8b1f-b35109394b58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b330344ecace352bafa7070f2b58fc59a51da6e7d0c4c78644eeb3e9bdc739c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "84615e9f-b4af-40ba-a0fa-6c0ee2e2474d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7961be9fffa6835fb99c461e0c1c6db84d451e11d0926d824aaf6fcde291702e"}}, "hash": "619783e6e5ebfd500f5a93abcef1566e608dad0af99155c7383a3fdc1459d5a5", "text": "In doing so, the document finds that while the relationship between human rights, governance and the MDGs has been dealt with exhaustively at the conceptual level, in practice there has been a mixed record integrating the two frameworks.

The opinions expressed herein are those of the author, and do not reflect the official position of UNDP. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 235 were not incorporated into the MDG Acceleration Framework (MAF) to the extent they could have been, and much of the current reporting and programming on MDGs still fails to take this connection fully into account. Finally, the paper proposes a number of concrete steps how ongoing and future MDG-related efforts could benefit from stronger linkages to human rights and democratic governance. The paper ends with a tentative outlook and some reflections for a possible post-MDG development agenda, which needs to be more fully aligned with the values and principles of the Millennium Declaration, and should integrate a human-rights-based approach, governance dimensions and human development more comprehensively from the outset. 2. The MDGs within the context of the Millennium Declaration In order to carry out meaningful work at the country level in the context of the MDGs, it is essential to fully understand and appreciate the origins, strengths and weaknesses of the MDGs, as well as the broader context under which they were developed and have matured. The relationship between the MDGs, human rights, and democratic governance is of particular relevance here because these two areas constitute both values and principles included prominently in the Millennium Declaration. The goals are fully rooted in the broader framework of human rights law and standards but are also essential ingredients for achieving the MDGs in a sustainable, equitable and effective manner. Despite having become one of the most persuasive \u201cbig ideas\u201d of the global development discourse in a generation, the origin, nature and content of the MDGs, as well as their relationship with other sets of international standards and commitments, remains a subject of debate.574 Some of the earlier discussions, in particular on the relationship of the MDGs with human rights and democratic governance, have again come to the fore with a renewed focus regarding the MDGs in the international development arena as the 2015 deadline line for their achievement edges closer. When Heads of State and Government met at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2000, they adopted the Millennium Declaration.575 With the hope of galvanising genuine political commitment at the turn of the millennium, the Declaration built on many previously-made commitments which had resulted from a number of global conferences led by the UN in the 1990s related to human rights, women, the environment and development. With the Cold War receding into history, new waves of democratization increasing the number of electoral democracies to a majority of all Member States, alongside the forces of globalization, it seemed like a unique opportunity to unite global efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate extreme poverty, achieve human development and guarantee human rights for all. 574 See for instance, the conference on the MDGs and Human Rights at Harvard University in March 2010. Conference Report at http://www.jus.uio.no/smr/english/about/programmes/serp/conferences/docs/ mdg-2010.pdf 575 For an overview and a collection of all relevant documents, see the UN web-portal on the MDGS at http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml 236 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific Indeed, the Millennium Declaration goes far beyond what would later become a rather bland and technical approach of the MDGs. In the Millennium Declaration, world leaders committed they would \u201cspare no effort to promote democracy and strengthen the rule of law, as well as respect for all internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development.\u201d576 The MDGs were presented in 2001, aiming to introduce an implementation plan for goals generally outlined in the Millennium Declaration a year earlier.577 They included, as an additional element, targets and indicators, which were to be applied not only globally, but also at the country level, with respect to the countries considered to be developing countries.578 The MDGs, in significant contrast to both international human rights law and the Millennium Declaration itself, address developed and developing countries differently, and are therefore, not entirely universal. Whereas Goals 1-7 are understood and applied only to developing countries, Goal 8 refers to a partnership between developing and developed countries, and is generally understood as a commitment by wealthier countries to boost their levels of development aid to poorer ones.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8795a081-d228-4f34-93ed-52cee6e888e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8795a081-d228-4f34-93ed-52cee6e888e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "260660a8082471164d8e6d6b726fba96d299f7e9c34010796de1fe2e4ac5bcb2"}, "2": {"node_id": "c7a1536f-54e5-4f76-a900-efdc13041dff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b0a47383486c4a7de5e84742303371b9aa88f93e087ff27d5c9dd94efd3a35c"}}, "hash": "66213f78111b3bf7488b4d289fb8cc0348510e3db2ad6740be37327df88a6ac9", "text": "The MDGs also included a number of changes to the wording and emphasis of the Millennium Declaration.579 The General Assembly\u2019s review meeting of 2005 formally endorsed the MDGs and the related process proposed by the UN.

The Secretary General was asked to issue periodic reports for consideration by the General Assembly. In contrast, the 2010 review meeting addressed only the MDGs. 576 Text of the Millennium Declaration: http://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.htm 577 The Millennium Declaration has eight sections: I. Values and Principles; II. Peace, Security and Disarmament; III. Development and poverty eradication (from which most of the MDGs were later derived, with some changes); IV. Protecting our common environment; V. Human Rights, democracy and good governance; Protecting the vulnerable (with a focus on assistance for assistance and protection in humanitarian emergencies); Meeting the Special Needs of Africa; and VIII. Strengthening the United Nations. 578 The relevance of the MDGs may not have been part of the original concept, according to some. At the March 2010 Harvard conference on the MDGs and Human Rights, Jan Vandemoortele, formerly UNDP, explained that the MDGs were an attempt to \u201crevive\u201c the Millennium Declaration, and were not originally intended to be operationalized at the national level or used as uniform yardsticks or as an analytical framework. Rather, they were designed as rallying points. 579 Critics consider it unfortunate that the UN, in its official communications about the MDGs, continues to blur this distinction. Its MDG web-portal states: \u201cIn September 2000, (...) world leaders came together at UN Headquarters in New York to adopt the UN Millennium Declaration, committing their nations to a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and setting out a series of time-bound targets\u2013with a deadline of 2015\u2013that have become known as the Millennium Development Goals.\u201d Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 237 Differences580 between the Millennium Declaration, the MDGs, and the process in which the MDGs were developed and presented a year after the Declaration have been described as less-than-optimal. However, this did not stop the MDGs from becoming the single- most important reference framework for the global development agenda in our time. This was significantly enhanced by the advocacy of Jeffrey Sachs and others closely involved in the drafting process who promoted the beginning of a \u201cdecade of bold ambition\u201d to \u201cend poverty\u201d, as per the title of one of Sachs\u2019 widely read books. This decade of bold ambition was to consist of unprecedented and coordinated efforts to mobilize resources, build capacity and strive towards concrete targets and indicators. Accordingly, the 8 Goals were accompanied by 21 targets and an even larger number of indicators. The targets and indicators were slightly amended in 2007.581 While the first years into the past decade were characterized by a number of national level reports and rather disjointed and selective efforts by the development community to operationalize the Goals, in 2005, the UN Member States decided in the General Assembly \u201cto adopt, by 2006, and implement comprehensive national development strategies to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals.\u201d582 Technically, this was the first time Governments explicitly committed themselves to the MDGs, as they had not yet been included in the Millennium Declaration. However, the fact that Governments were committed to them, and that they should be considered as country-level targets and indicators had already come to be established by 2005. What was still missing was the grand strategy, proposed in 2005 in the form of the Report of the Millennium Project already commissioned at that time by the UNSG for this purpose. The Millennium Project Report was never formally endorsed by the UN. However, it inspired efforts, in particular by the UN agencies including UNDP, to make the MDG agenda a core priority, align all development programmes accordingly, and focus on the MDGs and their targets and indicators in their reporting and advocacy. This has remained the case ever since, at least at the level of public policy statements. 580 These differences have already been discussed extensively in the context of analyzing the MDG framework from a human rights perspective.

Past debates revisited: The Millennium Declaration, the MDGs and human rights The MDGs had originally not been a product of the traditional human rights establishment within the UN and elsewhere. While the aspiration of the MDGs is largely congruent with the human rights movement, the MDGs purported to do things differently, and had a much stronger emphasis on results, rather than normative considerations. This may have been a reason why the MDGs were originally not necessarily embraced by the human rights community. The reaction to the MDGs from a human rights perspective developed slowly from ignorance to criticism them and finally incorporation into the larger human rights discourse. What follows is a short summary of how the process unfolded. From the outset, debates existed regarding how MDGs relate to the much broader normative and organizational context of human rights. When reading the MDGs together with the Millennium Declaration, it may be surprising how a question about the relationship to human rights and democratic governance could have arisen. The Declaration emphasizes human rights and democratic governance unreservedly, and posits the development goals (the third of its eight sections) clearly in this broader context. The Goals are aimed at translating the shared values of freedom, equality and solidarity into actions. The early years of the new Millennium also witnessed commitments to democracy and human rights unprecedented in their clarity and elaboration by the UN and its agencies.583 The landmark human development reports of that period are perhaps the most prominent, but far from the only example for development. And yet, the MDGs, which had been presented as the single most important set of development goals of the international community and thus also the UN when they were announced, came under criticism from human rights groups and the human rights establishment even within the international system. One early critical observation was the Statement of the Asia-Pacific Civil Society Forum on the MDGs and the Eradication of Extreme Poverty and Hunger, in Bangkok, held from 6-8 October 2003. In its recommendations to the UN, it stated, i.e., the following: \u201cThe MDGs sideline the critical and important issue of human rights. Certain norms are particularly pertinent in addressing the problem of poverty, such as effective non- discrimination, the recognition of vulnerable groups, the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to freedom from hunger, the right to economic self-determination 583 The general commitment of the UN and its member states to human rights and democracy dates back much further, of course. For instance, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 already included the following: \u201cThe will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.\u201d Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 239 and the right to development. The Committee [on Poverty Reduction] should affirm and operationalize rights-based approaches to poverty eradication.\u201d584 \u201cThe MDG itself formulates the problem of poverty too narrowly in terms of vision, scope and direction. It cannot simply be reduced to a numerical target to be achieved by a certain date and by technical fixes. Durable and sustainable solutions to poverty will require the active involvement of the poor and civil society, a more comprehensive understanding of the root causes of poverty and its multidimensional and diverse consequences and the right policies.\u201d585 Similar concerns were also raised within the UN itself. In 2003, a UN interagency meeting on human rights approaches stated, \u201cthere is a concern that, taken in isolation, the MDGs might lead us back into a technocratic (input/output) approach to development. But this worry would be allayed if Human Rights Based Approaches were applied to MDG processes, both in reporting and in programming to achieve the MDGs.\u201d586 A commitment was adopted soon after and in the 2003 \u201cCommon Understanding on the Human Rights Based Approach to Development Cooperation\u201d587 UN Agencies agreed: 1.

In the Note, UNDP said it would take the following six concrete steps to further contribute to the realisation of human rights and the reduction of poverty: 1. Governments and other actors will be encouraged to adopt a human rights-based approach in tailoring and customising the MDG targets to the local context. 2. Development assistance will focus on the capacities of duty-bearers, at all levels, to meet their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil rights; as well as the capacities of rights- holders to claim their rights. 3. A country\u2019s ability to reduce poverty is intimately linked to its capacity for democratic governance and the strength of its civil society. As such, UNDP will enhance the synergy between poverty reduction and democratic governance. Programmes for local govern- ance, access to justice, capacity of human rights institutions, grassroots initiatives for community development, and human rights education will be included among pro-poor poverty programming. 4. UNDP will engage in the work of UN Human Rights Treaty Bodies and in particular, strive to incorporate selected and relevant recommendations as a result of periodic reviews into programme development. 5. Rights-sensitive participatory assessment methodologies will be developed to link rights, obstacles and strengths around which poor people can secure their livelihood.591 6. In-house capacity will be built to undertake multi-disciplinary reviews and analyses maximizing meaningful participation of poor women, indigenous groups and disadvan- taged people. Selim Jahan, the Director of the UNDP Poverty Group, made very similar arguments related to the MDGs and human rights in a number of articles and debate contributions at the time.592 He observed part of the challenge was changing the mind-set of those who consider human rights and poverty reduction as two separate issues and to pursue more convincing analytical work.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a04057c-763c-4bd9-aeb2-2dd3ccf0d0c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a04057c-763c-4bd9-aeb2-2dd3ccf0d0c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b082136675ca67d9d5d4a51bceb71c56c80b6f8d9c4fa37b620ddfc418f93643"}, "2": {"node_id": "525a940e-15bd-4396-83e0-f991a345bdcd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "959706cb49dbbfa13690301bc1995d91bd4973f47bf2fd7e93a86e255d2e9f3c"}}, "hash": "b4e692807e946ffcd4711dc8f60ec8dbe5711a0d7e16f710b44603aa4b30f45a", "text": "He identified issues such as methodologies, standards and norms as inhibiting a more comprehensive integration of the two frameworks with many unanswered questions hindering a broader consensus.

One area emphasised as requiring refocusing was bringing a human rights-based approach into the Poverty Reduction Strategy papers (PRSPs) \u2013 both in terms of content as well as the process. As previously mentioned, in 2002 the UN Secretary-General commissioned the Millennium Project to develop a concrete action plan for the world to achieve the MDGs. In 2005, the independent advisory body headed by Jeffrey Sachs, presented its final recommendations to the Secretary-General in a synthesis volume entitled, \u201cInvesting in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\u201d The Millennium Project Report made a number of important recommendations with regard to governance and human rights. As part of its recommendations on how to support governments in poor countries with the genuine will to implement the MDGs, the Report listed \u201cPromoting Human Rights\u201d as one of the pillars of a governance strategy. This in itself was seen as essential for any successful MDG-based development framework. The Millennium Project \u201cfully endorsed\u201d the commitment of the Millennium Declaration to fully protect social, cultural, economic and political rights for all, including the right to development, and stated the belief that \u201ca human rights framework, as outlined, for example, in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, is an essential prerequisite to achieving all the Goals.\u201d593 The Report, however, acknowledged \u201cthere has been no systematic effort to integrate development planning with a human rights framework, even though such integration has tremendous potential and relevance.\u201d More specifically, the Report recommended ensuring the Goals are applied in a manner consistent with human rights. Governments need to recognize the relevance of their human rights obligations, encourage community participation, and develop human rights-based accountability mechanisms. With regard to human rights obligations, the Report suggested each country make reference in its MDG-based poverty reduction strategy to the international human rights obligations it has voluntarily undertaken. Going beyond the mere listing of international instruments, this should \u201ctake the form of a human rights assessment\u201d. Moreover, national MDG-based strategies should be consistent with the principles of equality and non- discrimination, implying \u201cstrategies are designed to reach the entire underserved population, irrespective of ethnicity, religion, regional background, or gender.\u201d It also suggested \u201ctaking steps to ensure the most underprivileged and marginalized sections of society can exercise their rights.\u201d The Report also implied \u201cstrategies and actions do not worsen existing inequities.\u201d594 With regard to community participation, the Report clarified \u201csuch participation should always include the right to criticize official policy positions\u201d. Governments needed to 593 Millennium Project Report, 2005 594 Ibid. 242 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific identify mechanisms to allow groups commonly excluded from the political process to participate actively in decision-making, especially in countries with rich social diversity and indigenous and tribal populations.595 In terms of human rights-based accountability mechanisms, the Report called for an appropriate legal framework to ensure the Goals are met on the basis of respect for human rights. An important role for national human rights institutions, and additionally, international human rights mechanisms, was recommended. The importance of disaggregated reporting to take account of such disparities as gender, regional differences, and the situation of the most disadvantaged groups, was highlighted in this respect. When present discussions on the MDGs often call for a more tailored approach to specific country situations and a stronger emphasis on people left out at the bottom end of the spectrum, it is worth recalling the Millennium Project already recommended as much in its 2005 report: \u201cAchieving the Goals will require national stakeholders to agree the Goals constitute a minimum set of objectives that can be more ambitious in different contexts. And it will require implementing the Goals in a way that focuses on reaching marginalized and underprivileged groups and regions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22bb65c2-d218-4597-8e13-6d01b66b9090": {"__data__": {"id_": "22bb65c2-d218-4597-8e13-6d01b66b9090", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35eaab9f5b48ec69d1f31df87e036e1b8f15ef57f4c6b99e0fb0e2ce8008caae"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe25486b-f2e9-43f7-9f9d-5632566d463c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b78516a7fc768b0a0d3a568b43168530beee9df575f5550e2345f52923ab572"}}, "hash": "6670fb689e81501d73c413cea5e365755b4375124e3215db8f9bf724ceddd47f", "text": "(...)

The September 2005 General Assembly World Summit to review the implementation of the Millennium Declaration again brought together more than 170 Heads of State and Government. The agenda was based on a set of proposals outlined in March 2005 by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his report \u201cIn Larger Freedom: Towards Security, Development and Human Rights for All\u201d. The report was the first comprehensive five- year report on progress toward achieving the MDGs, but it also included other important issues emanating from the Millennium Declaration as well, such as human rights (a unified system of reporting and the creation of the Human Rights Council) and the rule of law (the responsibility to protect and rule of law unit), democracy (the creation of the Democracy Fund) and UN reform (the UN resident coordinator system). It also drew on the Millennium Project and its reports. 595 For a more detailed analysis of the issue of indigenous peoples and the MDGs, see Millennium Campaign and UNDP APRC, Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples (Bangkok, 2010) which also takes into account the 2007 UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (DRIP). 596 Millennium Project Report, 2005 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 243 In the 2005 Summit Outcome Document, the General Assembly reaffirmed \u201cgood governance is essential for sustainable development sound economic policies, solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people and improved infrastructure are the basis for sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and employment creation; and freedom, peace and security, domestic stability, respect for human rights, including the right to development, the rule of law, gender equality and market-oriented policies and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies are also essential and mutually reinforcing.\u201d597 For a number of years, the human rights community apparently refrained from fully engaging with the MDG agenda, and the MDG framework itself emphasized the comparison of aggregate statistics, and rather narrowly defined interventions to meet specific MDG targets. One of the most prominent and influential critiques of the relationship between the MDGs and human rights as two separate frameworks was composed by the Australian human rights lawyer Philip Alston in 2005.598 In his \u201cShips Passing in the Night\u201d article, he described how neither the human rights nor development communities had embraced the linkage between the two with enthusiasm or conviction. Alston called for a new approach to ensure a complementary relationship between human rights and the MDGs. He addressed much of his criticism to the human rights community itself, who, he said, had not been especially supportive of the mainstreaming agenda. However, serving as the Special Advisor to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on the MDGs at the time, Alston stressed \u201cthe MDG initiative is of major relevance for human rights\u201d. Alston described in his article how the UN Commission on Human Rights and its Special Rapporteurs had taken minimal account of the MDGs until then, and also how the wealth of information provided by various human rights monitoring and reporting mechanisms could be used in assessing the degree to which MDGs had been fulfilled. That potential had not been mobilized. He argued it was both possible and desirable to insist on a contextualized MDG approach located within a human rights framework, flexible and able to be adapted to local needs and changing circumstances. A human rights approach to the MDGs, in his view, would also require an insistence upon the state as the actor with ultimate responsibility for ensuring respect for human rights, despite the growing relevance of the private sector in the economy. Alston also defends the MDGs and their proponents against human rights critiques focusing on issues such as \u201cthe perceived technocratic nature of the process\u201d, the \u201climited goals that are set\u201d, the \u201clack of a full human rights framework especially in relation to civil and political rights\u201d, and \u201cinadequate monitoring and follow-up\u201d. He argues most, if not all, of these criticisms can be adequately addressed within the MDG framework.

It was not long before the UN\u2019s own institution with a particular human rights mandate reacted to the critique and made efforts to actively integrate the two frameworks. In 2006, UNDP\u2019s Human Rights Policy Network (HuriTalk) and the MDGNet hosted a six week e-discussion titled: \u2018How to Effectively Link the MDGs and Human Rights in Development?\u2019 The e-discussion among practitioners examined complementarities and differences between the MDGs, human rights and related processes, and explored how the links could be strengthened in practical programming work. A resounding conclusion of the e-discussion was that the link between the MDGs and human rights is both necessary and beneficial. At the same time, practitioners identified the key concerns and \u2018tensions\u2019 when applying these links in their work and expressed the need for more guidance on how to make them operational in MDG-based programming, analytical and advisory work. Based on the findings and recommendations of the discussion, UNDP developed the Primer: \u201cHR and MDGs\u2013Making the Link\u201d.600 It stated \u201cwhile the policies of aid agencies increasingly emphasise the connection between human rights and development, in practice the two concepts often remain on separate, parallel tracks. Indeed, many observe that, in practice, the operational link between MDGs and human rights is tenuous at best.\u201d601 UNDP unequivocally stated \u201clinking human rights and MDGs does matter. The human rights framework provides an important tool for achieving the MDGs by helping to ensure the Goals are pursued in an equitable, just and sustainable manner.\u201d602 On the basis of the six-week e-discussion and drawing from the collective expertise of UNDP at the time, the main contributions of adopting a human rights based approach to the MDG agenda were identified to lie in the following four areas: \u2022\ufffd A Lens of Analysis: Improving ways of \u2018how to look\u2019 at the policy dimension of achieving the MDGs. \u2022\ufffd A Framework for Guiding and Influencing State Action: Providing principles and parameters for \u2018how to address\u2019 MDG progress. \u2022\ufffd Setting Minimum Standards of Service Delivery: Providing standards for \u2018how to judge\u2019 the quality of MDG services. \u2022\ufffd Emphasizing the Accountability of all Relevant Actors: Framing MDG progress in the context of an internationally agreed legal and normative framework.603 As another result of these efforts, and for practitioners seeking more information on how to link human rights and the MDGs, a web-portal was set up (HuRiLink WebPortal: http:// hurilink.org), which hosts a collection of practitioner experiences, intended to guide and 599 Ibid. 600 UNDP, Human Rights and the Millennium Development Goals\u2013Making the Link (2006) 601 Ibid. 602 Ibid. 603 Ibid. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 245 inspire efforts to link human rights and the MDGs in development practice. The website is organized into sections presenting narrative examples, common strategies, challenges and lessons learned, as well as tools and resources developed or recommended by practitioners.604 Unfortunately, the site has not been updated since 2007 and has therefore not taken into account the important developments related to the MDGs and human rights since then, and has not been adequately incorporated into the elaboration of the MDG Acceleration Framework and related processes. In 2008, OHCHR formally and fully entered this debate with its report \u201cClaiming the Millennium Development Goals: A Human Rights Approach\u201d. Louise Arbour, then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, summed up the prevailing scepticism expressed by many others: \u201cDisembodied from the human rights context and purposes in the Millennium Declaration, I would question how far the MDGs will ultimately take us.\u201d This was perhaps the most scathing criticism any high level official of the UN system had uttered of how the MDG agenda

Goal 3 sets women\u2019s empowerment as the objective but the related target 3.A is narrowly concerned with education. Target 7.D focuses on improving the lives of 100 million slum- dwellers but a human rights-based approach would put greater focus on basic security of tenure for all, which may actually be more affordable. 607 OHCHR, Claiming the Millennium Development Goals: A Human Rights Approach, 2008 246 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific Perhaps the most pointed criticism expressed by OHCHR hinted at something even more fundamental: \u201cThe overly technocratic nature of the MDGs and closely associated institutions has been questioned. The MDG project places great emphasis on the mobilization of financial resources and technical solutions, but less on transforming power relations that are partly responsible for current levels of poverty in developing, and developed, countries. The World Bank has also observed that it is becoming clear in many situations that the real barriers to progress on the MDGs are social and political. Realization of human rights is therefore a precondition for development.\u201d608 OHCHR recommended the following elements for a more genuine human rights approach to the MDGs: 1. Align the Goals with human rights by harmonizing MDG targets and indicators with human rights standards. This includes ensuring targets and indicators effec- tively correspond to economic, social and cultural rights, that gender equality is mainstreamed, and that efforts are adequately directed towards marginalized and disadvantaged groups. This may mean some countries should go beyond the MDGs, while others may need to adopt more modest though reasonable and human rights- consistent goals and targets.609 2. Be transformative, not technocratic, by adopting a human rights-based approach to empowerment and participation in target-setting, policymaking and implementa- tion. In order to create conditions for effective participation and good governance, civil and political rights must be effectively respected. 3. Prioritize rights by making policy choices and resource-allocation decisions with- in a human rights framework. MDG-related policies should do no harm (for example, choosing to build a dam to reach a goal must not violate human rights), evaluated as to whether they will actually reduce inequality and poverty, and sufficient resources should be provided to reach human rights-consistent goals. 4. Claim the MDGs by ensuring enforceable rights, accountability mechanisms and sus- tainable strategies. The human rights framework offers a relatively objective and comprehensive framework for legal empowerment and accountability, to help ensure the MDGs are not only reached but the achievements are sustained after 2015. OHCHR stressed the MDGs should be considered indicative, for country level monitoring, and should be nationalized, localized, tailored and contextualized.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b20ac5d4-00e8-47ca-be47-48741ee10a23": {"__data__": {"id_": "b20ac5d4-00e8-47ca-be47-48741ee10a23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "418a417cb23d2d0840d317a7a1ae9023995436f5b840b8a6e68b73d586dd85b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "39a6a799-d6a8-42ac-894d-144a22825a17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bfcf0faf7b4fe390eee2b85fc7ae6f4d380ef316ce6f77d1f0937041d36daaa"}}, "hash": "26c195eed57a2d09efee9207955af81b809903e9e8db3f4690fd7f43abba3298", "text": "This would suggest a much less rigid approach to applying the Goals and in particular the target.

It positions the MDGs clearly within a context of social and economic rights and elaborates on the many parallels between the two. For social and economic rights, OHCHR clarified that according to the ICESCR, a minimum of the right in question must be achieved immediately. The full right must be progressively realized within the State\u2019s maximum available resources. Progressive realization also means the level of realization of the right cannot decline without strong justification (principle of non-regression). Social and economic rights are sometimes portrayed as positive obligations of states to actively provide services. While this is doubtless, in cases for some aspects of social and economic rights, they should not be seen as exclusively related to a state\u2019s welfare services and programmes, but should also include economic freedoms allowing individuals to pursue their own livelihoods with minimal interference by the state. At a 2010 symposium on human rights and the MDGs, Jean Pierre Chauffour of the World Bank and formerly the IMF, presented evidence demonstrating a causal link between economic freedom and economic growth. He also mentioned studies showing the shape not the size of social spending matters most for both equality and growth, and actual government spending was not necessarily a good indicator of the level of public services people receive.610 The High Commissioner also addressed an issue related to process, or participatory governance, which had already been highlighted by the Millennium Project a few years earlier. In fact, the Millennium Declaration already called for \u201cgenuine participation\u201d. And yet, in 2008, the OHCHR found: \u201cToo often, participatory processes are cosmetic, reduced to mere consultation. Participatory processes should therefore be critically assessed, according to standard human rights criteria, to see whether they: \u2022\ufffd Reflect minimum standards for the process, which should be agreed on by all participants; \u2022\ufffd Operate at all stages, including the design, implementation and monitoring of development strategies; \u2022\ufffd Include women and marginalized groups and develop specific channels of participation if this is necessary; \u2022\ufffd Prevent elite capture and reinforcement of existing social hierarchies and power relations; \u2022\ufffd Are transparent and provide sufficient and accessible information; \u2022\ufffd Provide accountability mechanisms to ensure the participatory process is held to these standards.\u201d In 2005, both Alston and the Millennium Project suggested a more formal link between various human rights mechanisms and the MDGs framework, at very least to draw mutual recognition of each other. Following a review of the relevant human rights reports 610 MDGs and Human Rights, International Symposium \u2013 Conference Report, Harvard Law School, 22-23 March 2010. 248 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific prepared within UN human rights machinery (Treaty Bodies, Special Rapporteurs) in 2005, Alston still came to the conclusion \u201cnone of the treaty bodies thus far appears to make any significant use of any part of the MDG apparatus.\u201d The concluding observations \u201crevealed no references to the MDGs, and no attempts to encourage governments to attach any particular importance to their MDG commitments.\u201d Concurrently, proposals were being brought forward to include in the core document by governments on their human rights treaty obligations a \u201creference to the MDGs and also including relevant statistical and other data generated by the MDG process\u201d.611 It took formal human rights mechanisms a relatively long time to acknowledge and take position on the MDGs. The various treaty bodies and Rapporteurs either ignored or underemphasized the relevance of the MDGs. Only recently has this trend been reversed. The now fully established and tested Universal Periodic Review mechanism (UPR) incorporates the MDGs in its reports, its debates and follow-up discussions. Given the reservations that existed vis-\u00e0-vis the MDGs among the human rights community only a few years ago, this is doubtless a remarkable development. A question demanding further examination is whether the MDG-related programmes, reports and initiatives of the past decade have lived up to the letter and spirit of the inter- agency agreement on a Human Rights Based Approach with credibility and rigour. Also, whether or not scope exists for revisiting these agreements in the context of discussions about breakthroughs, acceleration and scaling up for the remaining years until 2015.

Democratic governance and the MDGs Democratic governance614 is closely related to the human rights dimension of the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs. Constitutional reforms, structural political reforms, reorganization, establishment of independent institutions, increased transparency, functioning and accessible judicial bodies, accountable public management, and an empowered and informed citizenry are all ends in themselves but are crucial for sustainable progress in terms of poverty reduction, in particular as seen through a lens of equity and equality. In 2002, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan held \u201cgood governance is perhaps the single most important factor in eradicating poverty and promoting development.\u201d615 The Millennium Declaration reaffirmed among the values essential to international relations in the 21st century that \u201cmen and women have the right to live their lives and raise their children in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression or injustice\u201d and it added \u201cdemocratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people best assures these rights.\u201d The Declaration links poverty reduction with democratic governance: In the section on \u201cDevelopment and poverty eradication\u201d, States resolved to create an environment at the national level conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty adding \u201csuccess in meeting these objectives depends, inter alia, on good governance within each country.\u201d In its section on \u201cHuman rights, democracy and good governance\u201d, States agreed to \u201cwork collectively for more inclusive political processes, allowing genuine 612 Alston is also realistic enough to be cautious in his expectations: It should be understood that there is \u201ca need for a demonstrable grounding in human rights law of any principles put forward, a degree of modesty acknowledging that a human rights approach will not in fact have clear answers, or perhaps any answers, in relation to at least some of the more intractable problems, the need for a judicious blend of process and outcome requirements, specificity in the sense of a list of requirements that is able to be stated with reasonable certainty or clarity, and manageability in terms of a list of requirements that is not utopian and does not impose impossible demands upon the relevant processes.\u201d (2005) 613 See, for example, Helen Clark\u2019s remarks at a March 2010 lecture at the LSE at http://content.undp. org/go/newsroom/2010/march/helen-clark-meeting-development-challenges-in-the-21stcentury. en;jsessionid=aGEsCWTxrgvf 614 On the more general debate regarding the relationship between development and governance, see the good overview on ODI Briefing Paper of March 2006: Governance, Development and Aid Effectiveness: A Quick Guide to Complex Relationships.

The interrelationship between poverty reduction, human rights and democratic governance was perhaps best encapsulated and most profoundly elaborated in UNDP\u2019s \u2018human development\u2019 concept, expressed in a series of Human Development Reports at the global, regional and county level since the mid-1990s:617 An adequate conception of human development cannot ignore the importance of political liberties and democratic freedoms. Indeed, democratic freedom and civil rights can be extremely important for enhancing the capabilities of people who are poor. They can do this directly, since poor people have strong reason to resist being abused and exploited by their employers and politicians. And they can do this indirectly, since those who hold power have political incentives to respond to acute deprivations when the deprived can make use of their political freedom to protest, criticize and oppose.618 The importance of capable democratic state institutions and democratic practices of decision-making and accountability has been recognised as crucial by the human rights community. OHCHR considers it \u201cnecessary to build strong democratic institutions and safeguard the rights to vote, freedom of expression and freedom of association, all of which are crucial to ensuring that the MDGs are reached in almost all contexts.\u201d619 Indeed, while the commitment to democratic governance per se is much less explicit in international law and standards, governments rarely remain undemocratic without serious and sustained violations of internationally codified human rights law, from genuine elections, to the freedom of association, assembly and speech and the prohibition of discrimination. 616 Millennium Declaration, 2000 617 First developed by economist Mahbub ul Haq in 1990 for UNDP\u2019s Human Development Reports, the concept had the explicit purpose \u201cto shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people centered policies\u201d. A number of prominent economists further developed the concept and its application, but it was mainly Amartya Sen\u2019s work on state capabilities and governance that provided the underlying conceptual framework for the linkages to human rights and democracy. Sen also laid out these ideas in his 1999 book \u201cDevelopment as Freedom\u201d, which is likely to have influenced the thinking behind the Millennium Declaration. 618 UNDP Human Development Report 2000 \u201cHuman Rights and Human Development\u201d 619 OHCHR, Claiming the Millennium Development Goals: A Human Rights Approach, 2008 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 251 The 2005 World Summit Outcome also reaffirmed \u201cgood governance is essential for sustainable development; that sound economic policies, solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people and improved infrastructure are the basis for sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and employment creation; and that freedom, peace and security, domestic stability, respect for human rights, including the right to development, the rule of law, gender equality and market-oriented policies and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies are also essential and mutually reinforcing.\u201d It thus provided an official confirmation by governments of the prevalent understanding among the development community, in particular as expressed by numerous human development publications of UNDP, that not only is there a conceptual link between development and democratic governance, but development efforts must aim at improving the capabilities and performance of governance institutions in order to create a basis for sustainable, people-centred economic development. As already stated in the preceding chapter, in 2005, the Report of the Millennium Project620 presented ten key recommendations for implementing the MDGs. They included a number of recommendations aimed directly at improvements in governance and at a stronger role for human rights in the context of poverty reduction, education and health policies:621 Recommendation 2: The MDG-based poverty reduction strategies should anchor the scaling up of public investments, capacity building, domestic resource mobilization, and official development assistance.

The Report recommended a strategy for strengthening governance be included in every developing country\u2019s long-term MDG framework, recognizing no one-size-fits-all approach exists for undertaking highly contextualized approaches based on local needs. The Report also added it was the responsibility of countries themselves to strengthen their own governance systems and advocated \u201cthe upgrading of public administration will take centre stage in the scaling up of public investments and services to meet the Goals\u201d. This point was also later reiterated by a UN study on Governance and the MDGs: \u201cMany donors view capacity constraints as barriers to scaling up their financial commitments. In such cases the focus should initially be on capacity building. Capacity for service delivery can be increased through investments in human resources, physical infrastructure and management systems. In the medium to long term, people can be trained, infrastructure built, and new management systems\u2013consisting of effective processes and structures for service delivery \u2013 put in place to enable a country to deliver and manage services at the scale required to meet the MDGs.\u201d622 The Millennium Project Report sets aside an entire chapter on \u201cGovernance to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\u201d. It contextualizes and categorizes countries according to their governance characteristics and recommends using the MDGs to promote and measure progress makes sense only in some, not all, countries, depending on the quality of democracy and effective rule of law. The report comes to a number of conclusions which may be difficult to accept at the intergovernmental level of the United Nations. This may be a reason why subsequently, the emphasis on governance within the MDG\u2019s context appears to have receded, and why so many MDG related reports and publications are rather silent about these issues. 622 UN, Governance for the Millennium Development Goals: Core Issues and Good Practices, January 2007- This report will be discussed in more detail below. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 253 The report recognizes difficulty \u201cquantifying and measuring\u201d elements constituting good governance. It lists a number of approaches developed for assessing governance. These include the country policy, institutional assessments and other governance related sources from the World Bank and the Millennium Challenge Account of the US Government. Two prominent non-governmental outfits were also included namely Freedom House and Transparency international. Notably, this was written before major advances had occurred in systematically and transparently assessing democratic governance indicators, an area on which UNDP has invested considerably in recent years.623 It is also unfortunate, but in light of the previous chapter not completely surprising, that the wealth of country reports emanating from the UN\u2019s human rights system was not mentioned as a possible source of information for assessing governance in this regard by the Millennium Project. A particular difficulty remaining in this context is to separate the \u201cintention\u201d of governments from their capacity to govern well. The Millennium Project Report acknowledges available indicators only partially reflect the will and actions of policymakers, but nevertheless the Report concludes two broad sources of inadequate governance have occurred: \u201cbad volition and lack of capacity\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0ab53fe-e110-45a3-9601-a04241f546d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0ab53fe-e110-45a3-9601-a04241f546d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "501f349abb8fa3738fb2b3d0a22d828051bacd00cd6e7cbec705610b7ab4f98d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e5fe5ef-66dd-48b1-9fae-360129a754a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b9e35b7fef7ac2e3baa0ae3b208310824796ea4c0c090c5f640d69771bc4bd9"}}, "hash": "130f23a446e25910d7b68dceed80524a84f2a554b3c7889394e715c60aa79953", "text": "The Report recommended that in countries with \u201cgenuinely \u2018corrupt\u2019 governments where political power is held by larcenous leaders, where the state may be run for the personal plunder of a narrow elite, a particular interest group, or an ethnic group\u201d, or countries \u201cwith a truly rapacious government leadership\u201d, including some that are the \u201coutcome of deeply", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d8e128b-a736-4607-b550-e5aba0c3ddb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d8e128b-a736-4607-b550-e5aba0c3ddb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98d06cf756d0824d6e56e0a79320f0ad010c0da80639aaa3cb9f62dae4cf19a8"}, "3": {"node_id": "60d7baac-6289-4164-a7d0-2d10df5a8b12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcd5bfba851f6c7a9a6ed4ebfe50ec2813a14a6d95aa5a56d1d256fffe507ac2"}}, "hash": "33f31d9df79babfc70fdb2f01effbacfa470c0186ef9a39c9ba4280d1111f7f3", "text": "flawed political processes\u201d, the international community can play a role in humanitarian assistance and deliver aid through NGOs, but there was little hope for achieving the Goals.

Unfortunately, few practitioners in the fields of development, governance or human rights have found this analysis sufficiently precise to follow its recommendations.

In practice, it would also be politically difficult, if not impossible, for UNDP to draw the line. Therefore, including governance assessments in all its programmatic work in order to address cross- cutting challenges in this regard is extremely important. Similar to the discussion on linkages between Human Rights and the MDGs, UNDP was a frontrunner for establishing linkages between the MDGs and democratic governance as a field of practical engagement with developing countries. In 2008, UNDP organized an e-discussion on \u201cRethinking Democratic Governance and Leadership for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals\u201d.626 Discussions in the \u2018Phase I: Strengthening Democratic Governance Engagements with the MDGs Achievement Process\u2019 focused on the role of government institutions to achieve the MDGs. Discussions in the \u2018Phase II: Leadership and Innovation for the Achievement of the MDGs\u2019 firmly endorsed the critical needs of both the \u2018innovation in leadership\u2019, and, the \u2018leadership in innovation\u2019, and \u2018leadership support to innovation\u2019. \u201cChampions and change agents are rarely created; they emerge from the society following either an enabling environment for their rise or a desperate situation that pushes natural leaders to stand up for the rights of the people. However, governments, international community, private sector, media, NGOs, CSOs- all stakeholders could forge a meaningful partnership to achieve MDGs, and, more importantly, to look beyond the 2015 timeline.

There is a need to expand the constituency that can scrutinize public policy and anchor government commitments to goals beyond growth and FDI. Availability of resources alone is not enough in the absence of transparency in public management and public investment.\u201d627 The challenge of combining the MDG agenda with democratic governance was also taken up by the UN Secretariat\u2019s Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), which leads the organization\u2019s efforts to bring governments together on a variety of public policies. In 2007, DESA\u2019s initiative \u201cReinventing Government\u201d produced a study which aimed at promoting good governance towards the realization of the MDGs: \u201cGovernance for the Millennium Development Goals: Core Issues and Good Practices\u201d.628 The report argues achievement of the MDGs will require substantial scaling up of investment in developing countries, which in turn requires good governance for proper utilization of additional resources. The report proposes a number of reforms to improve and strengthen governance in the context of the MDGs: i. Developing a poverty reduction policy framework which provides an appropriate mix of macroeconomic and sectoral policies. The former should focus on macroeconom- ic stability, high growth and employment, and the adoption of a poverty reduction strategy as a road map for the attainment of the long-term development vision based on achieving the MDGs. ii. MDGs have to be contextualized and disaggregated to the local level. Their prioritiz- ing, timing, and sequencing need to be attuned to local political, socio-economic and geographical conditions. iii. Reforming public administration by focusing on four \u201cbuilding blocks:\u201d first, strong central capacity for formulating and coordinating policy; second, reforms of institu- tions for the delivery of services; third, motivated and capable staff and leadership development; and, fourth, effective mechanisms for interface among the public sec- tor agencies. These will require investment in personnel (increase in salaries/rewards, training, capacity building, etc.) and improvement in systems (ICT hardware and soft- ware, simplification of processes, etc). iv. Moving towards decentralized local governance is the most effective mechanism for achieving sustainable improvements in service delivery. v. Specific/targeted interventions in critical areas like education, child and maternal health care, HIV/AIDS, water supply and sanitation, slum improvement etc., aiming to expand coverage, improve quality and enhance affordability, are essential. vi. Free and fair elections accompanied by strengthening of representative and respon- sive governance institutions, opening up of media and information flows and giving a voice to the people is essential for improved accountability and transparency. 627 Ibid. 628 UN, Governance for the Millennium Development Goals: Core Issues and Good Practices, January 2007, presented at the 7th Global forum on Reinventing Government, 26-29 June 2007, Vienna, Austria (ST/ ESA/PAD/SER.E/99).

Hereafter, three areas of particular importance to the programming of UNDP in developing countries are mentioned \u2013 the issue of scaling up and support of country-level development policy, participation and decentralization are briefly discussed.630 Scaling up One of the concepts often referred to is the idea of \u201cscaling up\u201d innovations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63e4917c-9488-4abb-9362-ce0ff1c14bbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "63e4917c-9488-4abb-9362-ce0ff1c14bbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64a22fc37538b79a6d9622c3eb7b76b08054c10e3eaf75e9d619ed564780001a"}}, "hash": "64a22fc37538b79a6d9622c3eb7b76b08054c10e3eaf75e9d619ed564780001a", "text": "proven to work in a given context. This idea is frequently drawn on in the 2010 review meetings and various MDG reports, and has also found entry into the thinking on MDG acceleration. However, the idea is far from new and critical reflections must accompany recommendations towards \u201cscaling up\u201d successful projects. Such recommendations often fall short of fully acknowledging significant governance limitations, in terms of resources, capacity, structural constraints and insufficient collective political will and consensus-building, and therefore tend to remain in the realm of wishful thinking. The simplistic message of 2010 on the MDGs \u2013 \u201cwe know what works, we just need to scale it up\u201d \u2013 may therefore need to be taken with a good dose of caution, and may need to be calibrated with a more realistic approach of governance constraints. 629 Ibid. 630 The selection is limited only due to space constraints, but it should be said that many other areas, such as anti-corruption, women\u2019s participation in politics, and access to justice programmes, provide opportunities for practical linkages. The three areas selected here maybe of broader relevance as cross- cutting issues, however. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 257 The UN Millennium Project strongly recommended CSOs participate in the design implementation and review of MDG based poverty reduction strategies. This relates both to the articulation of needs of the most marginalized groups and regions in society, but also to the important area of \u201cscaling up service delivery\u201d. The Project recommended \u201ccivil society partner with governments to help scale up investment through four main channels: engaging local communities, building human capacity, strengthening local governance, and leading implementation and service delivery\u201d.631 The idea being \u201cCSOs innovate to establish successful delivery models that governments can replicate on a larger scale, often offering lessons for hard-to-reach areas and conflict regions\u201d, which resonates so much with the basic concept of the new MDG acceleration framework, can therefore be traced back some years. It was already included in the Millennium Project Report in 2005, which itself reflected insights from many years of development cooperation. While this is essentially logical and easy to follow, the hard part remains determining how \u201cscaling up\u201d is to occur and carving out the roles of various institutions involved\u2013 the state (central, provincial, local), development partners and external donors, and non-governmental groups \u2013 could be. What has the record been with efforts to scale up successes in more limited areas? Do we have enough understanding of what it takes to successfully scale up local innovations, in particular when their nature as \u201clocal\u201d projects was an essential ingredient in their success? Basically, it constitutes a challenge of governance because it involves the major and long-term mobilization of public funds, a predictable and rule-based cooperation between different tiers of government, and the application of good governance principles such as transparency, accountability and rationality. The Millennium Project Report also recognized most low-income countries require technical support from the international system to put forward scaled-up investment plans to achieve the Goals. But the report also acknowledges \u201cthe international agencies that are the global repositories of sector specific knowledge \u2013 such as FAO, or IFAD for agriculture, UNICEF for child health, UNIDO for industrial development, or WHO for health systems and disease control \u2013are usually asked instead to focus on small pilot projects. In general, the technical UN agencies on the ground are not prepared to help countries scale up national programs.\u201d632 Whether this is still a correct observation in most cases, there certainly remains an element of caution regarding how the UN can mount sufficient leverage for scaling up major investment programs, in particular since significantly scaled up funding flows do not appear to be likely at this point. Working with key players like national planning commissions and central level coordinating bodies might be a good starting point. However, a more profound understanding of the political economy of major social and economic policies and the interrelations between different tiers of government will be key to successfully advocating for any scaling up of individual projects or programmes. 631 Millennium Project Report, 2005 632 Ibid. 258 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific Scaling up practically always entails a significant increase of funding for certain activities, mainly in the form of investments in infrastructure, expansions of major social policies for services such as health and education or the provision of social protection programmes.

It identifies a number of governance risks and constraints which, if removed, could improve the outcome of social safety nets as they are scaled up.

This will mean opening up services to a wider range of providers \u2013 and to greater public participation and scrutiny.\u201d635 However, for public services and investments to be truly beneficial for the poor and improve their lives on a sustainable basis, an even more subtle understanding of the political economy of participation and representation, and of government expenditure policies, is necessary. Even in democracies and countries with the basic political will to reach the MDGs, policymakers regularly divert spending away from areas benefitting the poor, or fail to implement policies that improve services known to disproportionately benefit poor people. In a 2005 article, World Bank economists Keefer and Shemani explained this as the result of three political market imperfections particularly important for understanding government incentives to serve the poor: lack of information among voters about the 633 Sara Giannozzi and Asmeen Khan, Strengthening Governance of Social Safety Nets in East Asia, World Bank Social Protection Discussion Paper, August 2011 634 UNDP Poverty and Human Rights Practice Note, 2003 635 ADB/ESCAP/UNDP 2010 Regional MDG Report: Paths to 2015 \u2013 MDG Priorities in Asia and the Pacific Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 259 performance of politicians, social fragmentation among voters manifested in identity- based voting, and the lack of credibility of political promises to citizens.636 They also showed how health and education \u2013 the largest public sectors relevant for the MDGs \u2013 are the most vulnerable to these distortions. These imperfections \u2013 information asymmetries, social polarization, and non-credibility of political promises \u2013 undermine the role of elections in guaranteeing accountable and responsive government, and are highlighted here because they are all endemic in Asia Pacific countries: \u201cInformation constraints reduce the ability of citizens to hold politicians accountable and encourage politicians to cater to special interests, thus distorting incentives to provide social services to poor people. Even if poor people actively participate in the political process, imperfect information about politicians\u2019 contributions to social service improvements can distort incentives. Broad segments of the poor population might be particularly disadvantaged in accessing information \u2013 because of illiteracy, limited mobility, and underdeveloped media for mass communications \u2013 creating space for organized and informed special interests to push for narrowly targeted policies at the expense of broad services.\u201d637 External interventions, such as supporting independent public policy research institutes, data collection, analysis, and publication, journalist training, subsidized information transmission, or information campaigns by civic society organisations may all be useful in promoting the diffusion of information needed for political accountability, and therefore the improvement of public services for the poor. Social services for poor people also suffer when societies are deeply divided. In many countries, identity characteristics along ethnic, linguistic, and religious lines dominate political behaviour and electoral politics. \u201cLike uninformed voters, polarized voters are less able to hold politicians accountable for their performance in office. There is compelling evidence to show that the provision of public goods suffers under these conditions.\u201d638 The nature of a political environment as a set of patron-client relationships is another factor prevalent in many developing countries, including nations within Asia and the Pacific region. Patron-type politicians, socially if their credibility emanates from belonging to a particular ethnic or social group, have relatively weak incentives to provide non- targeted public", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1dc82a2f-d7b4-4b5b-aefc-a90e62343599": {"__data__": {"id_": "1dc82a2f-d7b4-4b5b-aefc-a90e62343599", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b942bd2b7a7f94e7090fb38371bb3d9dff86e1ddcfb370caf314b34d2f5910ce"}, "3": {"node_id": "a41f752a-3bd6-453c-b16f-f1f57ebe6b93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3017770c0ef39f35cb31b2abef48ba00e45e7977d3d89ec84284523d5109418"}}, "hash": "9e02419d83efc9361cfa0868eb9368f73a35c79aa92147f24e0f32b0cd84f7f0", "text": "good because they benefit clients as well as non-clients.

The 2005 world summit outcome document underlined the important role of local authorities in contributing to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the MDGs. A 2007 MDG- Net e-discussion on \u2018Strengthening Efforts to Eradicate Poverty and Hunger\u2019 (March 2007) manifested a need to strengthen the democratic governance dimension of the MDGs. It drew attention to the political nature of many policies aimed at reducing poverty, with special reference to decentralization as a means of attending to equality through formulas redistributing and securing transfers among regions. Another joint e-discussion of the Poverty Reduction Network (PR-Net) & MDG-Net on \u2018Fiscal Space\u2019 (June 2007) came to a similar conclusion. It drew particular attention to the types of bottlenecks requiring removal in order to develop the local capacity for spending and delivering. As fiscal resources often finance expensive salary bills, the issue of civil service reform becomes pertinent. Often, this is not just a technical problem. \u201cDecentralization and de-concentration of decision making and implementation is necessary for achieving MDGs at local levels. At the same time, capabilities of local partners and institutions are limited and therefore, training, support and capacity building efforts are required.\u201d640 Similarly, in 2007, UN DESA stated \u201cthe prioritizing, timing and sequencing (of the MDGS) need to be attuned to local political, socio- economic, and geographical conditions. Awareness campaigns have to be innovative, persistent and contain messages with a local flavour.\u201d641 Many factors determine the success of decentralization including: a clear and coherent set of rules delineating the powers, responsibilities and resources of each level of government; appropriate government policies, including an enabling legal framework and an increase in local autonomy with proper checks and balances and institutional structures; partnership among different actors at the local level; leadership at the local level; and administrative capacity and adequate financial resources.642 In turn, these factors determine the capacity to effectively roll-out national programmes, encourage local level innovations as well as identify and scale up successful programmes in other contexts. However, the improvement of services sometimes cannot wait for the right conditions to emerge. This describes a fundamental tension between the humanitarian approach (viz. \u201cdevelopment emergency\u201d) to the MDGs, with a focus on meeting the Goals by a certain target date (\u201cacceleration\u201d), versus considerations of longer-term sustainability, both in institutional or financial terms. 640 UNDP, Reference Note\u2013Rethinking Democratic Governance and Leadership for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals, 2008 641 UN, Governance for the Millennium Development Goals, 2007 642 Ibid.

The focus must be on delivery of services in critical sectoral areas, particularly lagging MDG areas, with clear linkages between the national policy level, the local service delivery level and a systematic identification and removal of bottlenecks along the MDG \u201csupply chain\u201d. This includes fiscal transfers; administrative reform and incentives; human resource development and deployment, especially in under-served and lagging areas; planning monitoring and evaluation capacities; and service delivery capacity.645 Therefore, the Government of Cambodia and development partners have agreed: \u201cA large part of a national MDG acceleration strategy will be to assist the emerging sub-national entities to develop their own MDG-based strategies, to assist sectoral line ministries to decentralise and give more responsibility and resources to their sub- national offices, and to integrate sectoral actions into the overall sub-national plan. For the national level, the focus also needs to be on adopting policies and procedures that support sub-national service delivery, and on considering various regional needs and developing specific strategies for regional development.\u201d646 643 Ibid. 644 Government of Cambodia, \u201cAchieving Cambodia\u2019s MDGs: 2010 Update\u201d, at http://www.un.org.kh/undp/ media/files/CMDG%20Report%202010.pdf 645 Ibid. 646 Ibid. 262 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific Along the same lines, the 2010 Regional MDG Report recommended Governments allocate budgets wisely to spend more where services are urgently needed, such as teachers in rural areas and high productivity inputs such as medicines and textbooks. They may also be able to \u201censure services better match demand, especially from the poor, by moving away from overly-centralized systems of both financing and service provision, and decentralizing more functions to local administration.\u201d647 This is particularly important for public infrastructure investments, often seen as critical for further progress on the MDGs: \u201cIn many countries, most of infrastructure investment related to the MDGs is likely to come from the public sector. But this can only be effective if it is accompanied by reforms in governance and also by efforts to increase capacity, especially in local government in countries that have achieved extensive decentralization. (\u2026) While new major infrastructure is typically created by the central government, the task of maintenance generally falls to local administrations which have fewer financial or human resources to fulfill this responsibility.\u201d648 In summary, the dimensions of governance capacity (including motivation and incentives among the public administration), genuine participation, and multi-level governance relations are all key factors for any successful development strategy, including strategies aimed at meeting the MDGs in a sustainable and equitable manner, rather than a side- effect of rapid economic growth. Governance considerations must therefore be central to efforts to accelerate the MDGs and make progress and poverty reduction more inclusive. 5. A decade into the new Millennium \u2013 How far have we come on the MDGs? Previous sections looked at conceptual linkages between human rights, democratic governance and the MDGs, and outlined debates surrounding these issues. This section inquires how far we have come in terms of fulfilling the commitments of the Millennium Declaration, meeting the MDGs, and in integrating the MDG framework with human rights and governance considerations as has frequently been recommended. When asking, what the progress has been on the MDGs, we must also ask: \u201cHow do we know?\u201d, \u201cWhat do we know on how the progress has been achieved?\u201d With regard to human rights and governance, we can mainly look at the reports and strategies specifically referring to the MDGs and at various policy and programme documents and ask \u201cto what degree have human rights and governance factors be considered?\u201d What emerges is a mixed picture in all respects. While many opportunities appear to have been missed, there is room for a fresh look at the MDGs, and a renewed effort to link the MDGs with human rights and governance might be key to reinvigorating the agenda and making progress sustainable and irreversible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33ea071e-f55a-498f-b9a9-0401d594cc3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "33ea071e-f55a-498f-b9a9-0401d594cc3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35d13aa717b55f4aefade7cc4fb328c3e4bd0cfc1ce2f9742a487a1786d11194"}, "2": {"node_id": "63c43225-9c40-4dd0-83ca-56d986d73f28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a02a0b11c80a2fd2ec0424da24e2d9a18722d0c80ba8435fbb19cdd9f749a97b"}}, "hash": "2af52891869945f5ed738b7cc94e6ad23cf30992663b8766bcc0ecc3a0b0d974", "text": "The 2005 Report of the Millennium Project, coordinated by Jeffrey Sachs, famously included the recommendation that high-income countries should increase official development 647 ADB/ESCAP/UNDP 2010 Regional MDG Report: Paths to 2015 \u2013 MDG Priorities in Asia and the Pacific 648 Ibid.

Overall, developed countries should also make efforts to reach the long-standing target of 0.7 percent of GDP. Sachs essentially called for a doubling of aid, to finance the investments necessary to reach the MDGs he described in the Millennium Project Report. The Report stated, \u201cpoverty in the poorest countries can be dramatically reduced only if developing countries put well-designed and well implemented plans in place to reduce poverty \u2013 and only if rich countries match their efforts with substantial increases in support.

As previously mentioned, the 2005 Report of the Millennium Project called for a \u201cdecade of bold ambition\u201d and stated achieving the MDGs could not be done on the basis of a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach. \u201cWithout a bold breakthrough (in 2006), a large number of countries that could still achieve the Goals will be consigned to failure,\u201d the report said. It recommended a number of MDG fast track countries be identified (by 2005), \u201cthat are ready for scale-up\u201d. It used a series of parameters (\u201cgovernance qualification\u201d)651 to recommend a list of more than 60 countries including the following in Asia Pacific: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri-Lanka, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu and Vietnam. Preliminary MDG needs assessments were carried out by the Millennium Project (including in Bangladesh and Cambodia in the Asia Pacific region. The methodology was also applied for assessments at the subnational level in India, for the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh.)652 The results of the assessments at the country level projected \u201ca step increase in investment levels during 2006, to be funded largely through official development assistance\u201d, combined with a substantial increase in domestic resource mobilization by governments and households. The report also stated \u201cthe confluence of the 0.7 (percent of GNP spent on ODA by the developed countries) target and the Goals is an important one\u201d implying a follow-through on commitments already made would make the Goals affordable. It would have required a \u201cdoubling of annual development assistance to USD 135billion in 2006, rising to USD 195 billion by 2015\u201d. These proposals, which were also mirrored in Sachs\u2019 2005 book \u201cThe End of Poverty\u201d653, received significant attention and inspired many, but also met some important criticism from sceptics of such an approach. 649 Millennium Project Report, 2005 650 Ibid. 651 The criteria were inclusion in the following: African Peer Review Mechanism (for countries in Africa), HIPC completion point, Millennium Challenge Corporation qualifier, Millennium Challenge Corporation Threshold, Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and World Bank Absorptive Capacity Study.

Piecemeal reform, by contrast, motivates specific actors to take small steps, one at a time, then tests whether that small step made poor people better off, holds accountable the agency that implemented the small step, and considers the next small step.\u201d655 Whatever the merits of this discussion may be, it is now clear the big push in the form of doubling development aid never came and neither have the drastic reforms suggested by the Millennium Project in terms of governance and state capacity been made, at least not to the extent proposed by Sachs. The OECD recently published figures demonstrating the combined effect of increases has been to raise ODA by 37 per cent in real terms since 2004, or about USD 30 billion (in 2004 dollars). However, when comparing the 2010 ODA outcome with the promises made in 2005, this still represented a shortfall of about USD 19 billion. Only a little over USD 1 billion of the shortfall can be attributed to lower than expected GNI levels due to the economic crisis. The remaining gap of USD 18 billion was due to donors not meeting their ODA commitments.656 The OECD has conducted a comprehensive survey of donors\u2019 future spending plans which provides an indication of the collective forward programming of bilateral and multilateral donors through 2013. It shows that it is rather unlikely donors will catch up with the Millennium Project\u2019s proposals, or their own long-standing commitments in terms of funding volumes any time soon. Rather, the preliminary findings based on DAC members\u2019 returns to the forward spending survey suggest slower aid growth ahead. Global country programmable aid is planned to grow at a real rate of 2% per year from 2011 to 2013, 654 Washington Post article: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25562-2005Mar10.html. See also William Easterly, \u201cThe Big Push Deja Vu \u2013 A Review of The End of Poverty\u201d, Journal of Economic Literature, Vol.44/1, March 2006 655 Easterly is not outright dismissive of what Sachs proposed in detail. He pointed out that many of Sachs\u2019s specific recommendations such as vaccination campaigns might make sense as piecemeal reforms \u2014 i.e., if done one at a time in small steps, with subsequent evaluation and accountability. 656 OECD Aid Statistics at http://www.oecd.org/document/35/0,3746, en_2649_34447_47515235_1_1_1_1,00.html Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 265 compared to 8% per year on average over the past three years. For DAC countries\u2019 bilateral aid only, the projected increase is slightly lower at 1.3% per year.657 There is also evidence that targeting of aid to countries most in need and to those who most deserve it, by making significant reforms in terms of governance and human rights, is not occurring in the manner proposed by the Millennium Project. The OECD-DAC itself refers to a large body of literature on the empirical determinants of foreign aid, trying to disentangle the influence of geo-political ties and donor self-interest from recipient needs and their ability to make use of aid. It overwhelmingly concludes the former two factors outweigh the latter, though responsiveness to need has also been seen as growing since the end of the Cold War. A recent study using DAC bilateral data finds that almost half of the predicted value of aid is determined by donor-specific factors, one-third by needs, a sixth by self-interest and only 2% by performance.658 One may argue reaching the MDGs may not be as dependent on a significant boost of aid-money as suggested by Sachs and the Millennium Project. However, it is hard to convincingly argue the difference between the MDGs and earlier development goals is the character of a \u2018deal\u2019 between the developed and the developing world, where both parties live up to specific commitments. A more realistic assessment may conclude the MDG agenda has not fully lived up to the highest expectations. It is still fair to say the MDGs mobilized unprecedented amounts of funds and focused minds like no other development concept before. It is easy to see that not only the developed world has fallen short on commitments.

Human rights and governance should indeed be included in considerations regarding how MDGs have been met, and why others have not been met. Already in 2005, before many countries developed MDG-based development strategies and presented their national MDG reports, the Millennium Project Report identified the following as overarching reasons for shortfalls in achieving the goals: \u201cSometimes the problem of poor governance is, marked by corruption, poor economic policy choices, and denial of human rights. Sometimes the problem is a poverty trap, with local and national economies too poor to make the needed investments. Sometimes progress is made in one part of the country but not in others, so that sizeable pockets of poverty persist. Even when overall governance is adequate, there are often areas of specific policy neglect that can have a monumental effect on their citizen\u2019s well-being.\u201d659 As stated above, Sachs\u2019 analysis and recommendations have at times been criticized for too strong a fixation with poverty traps, and his idea of a \u201cbig push\u201d to \u201cend poverty\u201d. However, when taking a closer look at the Report of the Millennium Project, the emphasis on governance failures, pockets of poverty and areas of policy neglect sounds strikingly familiar and in line with the latest cross-dimensional thinking on the Goals. \u201cThe rule of law involves security in private property and tenure rights, safety from violence and physical abuse, honesty and transparency in government functions, and predictability of government behaviour according to law. Too many countries fail to achieve these basic standards, sometimes due to authoritarian rulers who use violence and corruption to hold on to power \u2013 but often because upholding the rule of law requires institutions for government accountability, and those institutions are missing. Political and social rights should ensure equality before the law and fairness in society across groups. These rights must be substantive and not merely formal. The poor must have a meaningful say in the decisions that affect their lives. Women and girls must be assured freedom from violence and from legal, economic, and social discrimination. In many places, access to public good and services is restricted to certain groups. Minority groups, for their language, religion, or race, suffer discrimination at the hands of more powerful groups.\u201d660 In order to address governance failures inhibiting progress to achieve the MDGs, the Millennium Project noted \u201caccountable and efficient public administration requires transparency and administrators who are qualified, motivated, and adequately paid. It also requires efficient management systems, to disburse and track large investments, and monitoring and evaluation systems.\u201d The link between achieving the goals and properly addressing all these areas of governance was clearly expressed. \u201cThere is no excuse for any country, no matter how poor, to abuse its citizens, deny them equal protection of the law, or leave them victims of corruption, mismanagement or economic irrationality. Some improvements in governance do not cost money, if any, and some actually save money. Some improvements in economic outcomes are therefore available at low cost, and such opportunities must not be squandered.\u201d661 659 Millennium Project Report, 2005 660 Ibid. 661 Ibid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff259a79-2e69-4a93-be71-33e891c0972e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff259a79-2e69-4a93-be71-33e891c0972e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b46e8164b04b02c53860db64c16091edbb92289098c0a63fa150c3727b21fb4"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4919e47-0ad6-4767-8f1f-8eac0f8b1d89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47dcdab06ba7dd44a5ea5de3f3e4611cab5a77c9130540f3219efabda698ac28"}}, "hash": "a5c5cbcc5d3a3fa53f5b865823868eb39a914c14b5e463c6fd084c3cc2acc89e", "text": "661 Ibid.

From looking at these reports, and the data presented therein, it is clear many countries were far from incorporating a human rights and governance dimension. In 2006, UNDP stated the \u201cMDGs are not embedded into the development psychology of Governance. The MDGs have not been integrated into national planning, development strategy making and budgeting processes. This was sighted as one of the reasons of failure of timely achievement of MDGs.\u201d663 Turning to progress on the MDGs, and the question regarding to what degree the various targets are being met, it is best to look at the global MDG reports published by the UN. The 2010 MDG Report664 concluded \u201cwithout a major push forward, many of the MDG targets are likely to be missed in most regions.\u201d665 While the world on the whole was \u201cstill on track to meet the poverty reduction target\u201d the combined global financial, economic, food, fuel and climate crisis has slowed progress. Employment has declined, and more workers have been forced into vulnerable employment. Hunger spiked as a result of the 2009 food and financial crisis, and progress to end hunger had been stymied in most regions. Hope was dimming for universal education by 2015, with education remaining elusive for girls in some regions. Child deaths are falling, but not quickly enough to reach the target. The sanitation target appears to be out of reach. The report also highlighted the particular plight of people in armed conflict, and the large populations of refugees. It emphasized the added vulnerability resulting from climate change.

The latter are disaggregated into nine sub-regions, including, for what for UNDP constitutes the Asia-Pacific region, the following: Southern Asia (including Iran), Eastern Asia (including the Republic of Korea), South Eastern Asia, and Oceania. 665 UN MDG Report 2010 268 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific has been sluggish on all fronts and the number of undernourished people has continued to grow. What constituted the main emphasis of the report was perhaps the \u201cincreasing inequalities between rich and poor\u201d.666 This can only be read as a rather sobering assessment, and provides little ground for optimism. Since 2005, the ADB, ESCAP and UNDP have been publishing MDG reports with a focus on the Asia Pacific region.667 The 2010 regional MDG report, Paths to 2015 \u2013 MDG Priorities for Asia and the Pacific, emphasized that despite some notable progress, economic growth needs to be more inclusive \u201cwith the fruits shared more equally among different social and economic groups. This too would require a deliberate change in course \u2013 both in the growth pattern and in government policies.\u201d It further explained \u201ceven in countries where significant progress has been made towards the MDGs, there are often disparities within the country \u2013 between urban and rural areas, between rich and poor, between women and men, and girls and boys.\u201d In Asia Pacific, recent years have experienced dramatic growth overall, and the region has emerged as an anchor of the global economy as a result of significant economic changes in the past two decades. However, as underlined by a series of recent reports, this growth has not always specifically reduced poverty as inequality within countries has sharply risen and gains in terms of overall income appear fragile in a context of climate change, resource depletion, food and fuel crises, and growing public discontent with the status quo in many countries around the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "070d07f6-e8db-479d-8791-55286e29077c": {"__data__": {"id_": "070d07f6-e8db-479d-8791-55286e29077c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92e9d0234fe12208fa80fcff0ed12212c0a5002e600f0a8747239916a66099a6"}, "2": {"node_id": "9304e7b5-3ffd-45c4-82f1-75f64a51846d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e4c691a061fec7d0aad742b5fcfa2a2c25db797a206e739b817c3d4b3a9c74b"}}, "hash": "fb5d3c9d3e3293fc8874fb35084299a34d059b7b61c2d8f8b8c5fb90d2fd8184", "text": "The 2010 Asia Pacific Report on MDG priorities stated \u201ceven in countries where significant progress has been made towards the MDGs, there are often disparities within the country \u2013 between urban and rural areas, between rich and poor, between women and men, and girls and boys\u201d In some countries, belonging to certain social groups, indigenous communities or regions can be a significant cause for poverty and deprivation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a32cf5d-3180-465f-b32d-2b27bdd31698": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a32cf5d-3180-465f-b32d-2b27bdd31698", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d98cf6d29068197e4d497dad5eb9af66bb8047ac423a5b8da20efc34332d70b4"}, "3": {"node_id": "8277641d-f87c-4173-8d49-f8fd839fde0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c762eff32d5861ec7ec4fd734c4da0be6ef8698a74d2f6dacc6ac281e6be551"}}, "hash": "edf79b20751ca34fff210b00a6cd1cb8bc3e1013c1c4e621f6115ec4908a724d", "text": "It is disheartening the report\u2019s findings still suggested \u201cmany countries do not regularly report sex-disaggregated data that would help track the gender dimensions of MDG targets and indicators, the available data on outcome indicators of poverty, such as education, nutrition, health and child mortality\u201d although evidence from case studies suggest gender disparities. Subsequent sections of this paper attempt to reflect whether lessons from discrepancies between the MDGs and human rights and governance in the early phase of the MDG agenda were learned, whether the bridges with the human rights agenda, as encouraged by UNDP and others were actually built, and whether we currently look at an MDG framework, fully aligned with broader human rights and democratic governance principles emphasized in the Millennium Declaration. 666 Ibid. 667 The definitions o what constitutes Asia-Pacific differ between these bodies, however. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 269 An analysis of the first generation of national MDG reports identified a \u201clarge discrepancy in the ways in which human rights issues are dealt with in the context of MDG reporting. (...) When moving from the policy domain to examine the programmatic side, the discrepancy between rhetorical references to human rights and actual program context becomes even more marked.\u201d668 In UNDP\u2019s own 2003 Assessment of the early MDG reports provided by governments, it was stated \u201cit may be unreasonable to expect a government to discuss \u2018sensitive\u2019 issues, such as documenting human rights violations, discrimination against marginalized communities, neglect of remote areas, or to discuss unresolved conflicts, especially closer to the time of elections\u201d.669 Alston identified this as the crux of the human rights critique of MDG reporting: \u201cIf these reports fail to address, or even acknowledge, existing human rights problems they will often be excluding the very issues that are crucial to understanding the principal obstacles that are inhibiting the realization of the MDGs. If it is not possible to mention sensitive issues such as deeply entrenched discrimination against women, the effective exclusion of certain racial, religious, linguistic or other minority groups from the development process, or the systematic harassment of anyone expressing dissenting or alternative viewpoints, the report not only will be unrealistic in natures but will also be unable to address the critical steps that needs to be taken if the MDGs are to be met.\u201d670 Also with regard to global reports, Alston found that \u201cunfortunately, the great majority of analyses undertaken on the MDGs [until 2005] do not approach them as being situated within a human rights framework.\u201d671 He commented in more detail on the World Bank and IMF Global Monitoring Report of 2004, which was characteristic for many similar reports on the global and regional level. It called for the acceleration and deepening of reform in many countries if the MDGs were to be realized, and identified four priority areas where such reforms were deemed to be essential; however, \u201cwhile a human rights dimension would appear to be both obvious and unavoidable in relation to each of them, the reports succeeds in either ignoring that dimension or addressing it clandestinely\u201d.672 It is worth recalling what Alston identified as elements of a genuine human rights perspective to the first priority\u2013improving the enabling climate for private sector activity. 668 Philip Alston, \u201cShips Passing in the Night\u201d (2005).

Alston reserved his strongest criticism for the third and fourth priorities put forward in the WB/IMF report, namely the scaling up of infrastructure investment and improving its effectiveness, and to \u201cbetter target education, health, and social assistance services toward poor people, addressing governance related impediments to service equality and effectiveness, increasing community participation\u201d. It is interesting to mention these as well as Alston\u2019s critique in full, as the issues and challenges remain more or less identical to how they had been identified in the immediate follow-up to the launching of the MDG agenda\u2013despite the slightly different terminology used almost a decade later. Alston takes issue with the fact that MDG-related reports speak of \u201cparticipation\u201d in order to avoid any overt reference to the human rights implications of what is being proposed. \u201cInstead of discussing it as the quintessential civil and political rights issue that it is, the [World Bank and IMF Report on the MDGs] presents the problem of grossly unequal rights and capabilities to participate in decision making in terms of a technocratic challenge to find better techniques for \u201cscaling up on the basis of successful programs\u201d. \u201cThe systematic suppression of women\u2019s voices, the exclusion of minorities from the political and economic spheres, the brutal suppression of dissent, and the resulting prevention of debate over alternative policies to achieve the agreed objectives, are all commonly present elements that would render ineffectual any well-meaning project-based efforts, no matter how assiduously designed, unless the broader human rights policy dimensions are addressed. Unlike human rights norms, concepts such Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 271 as community involvement, participatory inputs, and consultative mechanisms are, in part, appealing precisely because they cannot be clearly defined, by reference to objective or fixed standards. Such concepts are almost always invoked in relation to initiatives, that are undertaken on an individual project basis, as though a participatory process could effectively be implemented within a broader context in which, for example, women\u2019s voices are ignored, minority groups are excluded, and political dissent is not tolerated.\u201d Taking another look at the text of the Millennium Declaration, on the basis of which the MDGs were later developed, offers an interesting insight pertaining to the issue of inclusiveness and equity already considered as core values and principles at the time. World leaders recognized their collective responsibility to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity, and leaders had a duty to the people around the globe, especially the most vulnerable, in particular children. The Declaration also recognized while globalization offers great opportunities, at present its benefits are very unevenly shared, and its costs are unevenly distributed.673 Have the human rights concerns expressed by OHCHR and others been addressed? Have the MDGs been aligned with a human rights approach? Have efforts to implement the MDGs in practice around the world been transformative, rather than technocratic, as Louise Arbour suggested in 2008? For one, the debate on the connection between human rights and the MDGs has continued throughout the past decade, and the human rights institutions within the international system have paid increasing attention to the MDG agenda. At a March 2010 high-level gathering of human rights experts to discuss the relationship between the MDGs and human rights, participants agreed evidence existed proving the MDGs had so far not contributed to improving equality, and in some cases may have even contributed to further marginalisation.674 Gay J. McDougall, UN Independent Expert on Minority Issues, emphasized MDG reports still demonstrate a dearth of attention towards minorities and indigenous persons, with less than a third noting ethnic discrimination.675 She advocated for integrating non-discrimination into the assessment of every goal and measurement of progress indicators.

It analyses recent national MDG progress reports and pertinent national development strategy documents from 15 countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, the Lao PDR, Nepal, Thailand and Viet Nam in the Asia Pacific region.677 The commissioned quantitative and qualitative research, secondary literature, as well as consultations at regional dialogues (including one in Bangkok for Asia), brought out a number of common challenges in regards to integrating human rights in MDG implementation efforts, along with \u201cinnovation and positive examples that may be replicated elsewhere\u201d. The report concludes that despite increasing recognition of the theoretical and operational links between human rights and the Goals, \u201cin many ways the full potential of the rights- based approach, as set out in Claiming the Millen nium Development Goals, has yet to be fully explored at the country level.\u201d While there have been a number of improvements on the level of general awareness and the linkages between human rights and the MDGs at level of global commitments,678 there have also been some notable failures. Initial examination of the selected MDG reports in most countries under review was considered \u201cnot particularly encouraging\u201d. A number of countries are recognized for departing from the rather narrow conception of the original MDGs. Thailand\u2019s MDG plus model has set specific targets for women and marginalized regions679, and Bangladesh680 has acknowledged the Goals imply halving share of the poorest quintile in both national income and consumption, and further acknowledged it was not meeting this target despite having succeeded in halving income poverty. However, none of the other countries in the sample attempted to introduce targets of the poorest of the poor and excluded. Only few countries disaggregated data by region. With regard to the hunger target, none provided hunger data disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, indigenous ancestry, rural/urban divide, agro- ecological zone, administrative region, social class, caste or religion. The assessment is not much more positive for the other Goals and targets either. On education, the OHCHR found that no country reviewed has set targets for other aspects of the right to education such as a quality, free and compulsory primary education system. While many countries provide primary schooling without school fees, other costs often make it hard for families to send their children (especially girls) to school. However, there is no attempt to set targets for or measure the affordability of primary school education. With regard to maternal mortality (\u201cof all the Goals, the furthest from being achieved\u201d), the report found that MDG reports and country policies \u201cindicate a general trend to begin to recognize the importance of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) in strategies, but it is generally neglected in MDG reports in terms of indicators or development of targets\u201d. In India, discrimination on 677 OHCHR, Human Rights and the Millennium Development Goals in Practice: A Review of country strategies and reporting, 2010 678 OHCHR mentions the 2005 World Summit Outcome which contained clear and unprecedented commitments by Member States to mainstream human rights in their national policies. 679 Reducing by half the under-five mortality rate in highland areas, selected northern provinces and the three southernmost provinces by 2015. 680 Millennium Development Goals: Mid-Term Bangladesh Progress Report 2007 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 273 the basis of caste and ethnicity seems to be under-measured, suggesting a critical need to disaggregate the indicators according to caste and tribal group.681 Notably, there has been some progress in target setting, monitoring and reporting on water and sanitation targets.

This is unfortunate, as it is potentially one of the areas where a pragmatic human rights approach has contributed, among other factors, to the relative success of meeting the Goal, at least in the Asia-Pacific region.

Clifton Cortez, leader of the HIV, Health and Development Team at the APRC, recently unveiled a presentation on stigma and discrimination-reduction strategies for stopping the spread of HIV.683 He also underlined the importance of data and data gathering which is critical for advancing this particular agenda. The most vulnerable individuals and groups are sometimes not even on the government radar. People, particularly women, living with HIV; sex workers; men who have sex with men (MSM); drug users; transgendered people; are often \u2018most at risk\u2019 of contracting HIV and being invisible to policy makers. The contextualized and evidence- supported human rights based approach followed in recent years is a key contributing factor to why the MDG itself may be closer within reach than others. On a more general note, OHCHR identified a key challenge for many countries to recognize the link between MDG-related policies and their possible harm to human rights, 681 OHCHR, 2010 682 Ibid. 683 UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre Dialogue Bangkok, 6-7 September, 2011: Human Rights for Development: Ways and Means\u2013Workshop Report (DRAFT) 274 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific recommending it may be necessary in many cases to carry out independent human rights impact assessments of policies before they are approved. In many reports \u201caccountability is equated with monitoring and evaluation and mechanisms are not always particularly strong. Even so, it is clear that there are real gaps and challenges in just ensuring basic monitoring of programmes and data collection.\u201d684 Many countries still \u201clack effective independent and easily accessible complaints mechanisms to address denials of, or interference with, economic and social rights.\u201d OHCHR acknowledges in some countries, litigation has helped to mobilize constituencies to monitor government performance in delivering social services, \u201cbut access by individuals is heavily dependent on access to lawyers or access to local administrative mechanisms\u201d, which are often heavily biased against marginalized groups. Therefore, provision of effective remedies through legal recognition of all human rights, improvement of the courts, the rule of law and access to justice should be seen as integral components of the overall development policy agenda for the sake of greater accountability.685 The more widespread ratification and implementation of international human rights treaties may help to fill accountability gaps in the MDG policy and institutional architecture. How ever, the impact of this will depend upon the strength of complementary components of the national human rights system, including the existence of an independent and functioning judicial system, a free press, and a constitutional and legislative framework aligned with international human rights law.686 Among the key observations and conclusions of OHCHR features an aspect not commonly recognized as a human rights concern per se. It nevertheless constitutes one of the main areas to improve if a genuine human rights and democratic governance approach are to be integrated in the MDG agenda: the issue of collecting and publicizing reliable, disaggregated data and making information on the connections of these data to policies and expenditures easily available. While a lack of national resources\u2014both financial and human\u2014is an obvious constraint on realizing the Goals, the limited availability of reliable, quality data can make human rights-based analysis diffi cult for many countries.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 275 Accountability for MDG progress is undermined in many countries by the lack of access to informa tion and transparency in public policymaking, budget processes and the use of aid. The human rights principles of equality and non-discrimination must underpin the implementation of all the Goals. Re source allocations, as a direct reflection of power relationships and policy choices, must be thoroughly monitored and analysed.688 A number of \u201cspecial procedures\u201d of the UN Human Rights Council, including those dealing with extreme poverty, health, indigenous peoples, and water and sanitation, have been actively engaging with the Goals. This is one of the most encouraging developments with regard to the linking of human rights to the MDGs in recent years. In 2005, Where Alston still saw \u201cships passing each other in the night\u201d it appears the human rights community, both in terms of the UN\u2019s formal mechanisms and in terms of advocacy and reporting, has by now fully embraced the MDGs and includes MDG-references as a matter of routine in its work. The creation in 2006 of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is one of the most significant innovations of the new Human Rights Council (HRC).689 Under this system, for the first time, the fulfillment by each UN Member State of its human rights obligations and commitments is regularly reviewed through a mechanism of the HRC. Each state undergoes the review every four years, meaning 48 states are reviewed per year. Each country review is based on three documents: a report prepared by the individual State and two reports prepared by OHCHR, i.e. a compilation of UN information and a summary of stakeholders\u2019 input. The UN information report is prepared by OHCHR by compiling information contained in the reports of treaty bodies, special procedures and other relevant official United Nations documents, including those published by all UN entities such as national Human Development Reports and MDG Reports. Homayoun Alizadeh, the Regional Representative of OHCHR in Bangkok, presented the Three-Pillar Strategy of the international human rights mechanisms in relation to the MDGs at a regional workshop to discuss the linkages between human rights and the MDGs.690 The UPR became operative in 2008 and now, with 175 members having undergone the process, is moving into its second round of reviews. It seems the UPR may have been initially underestimated in its effect, particularly in the Asia region. A number of the recommendations relate directly (and indirectly) to the MDG targets. The UPR also goes beyond national MDG targets and considers a disaggregated country process, focusing on the most marginalized people. It is also notable that contrary to the relatively strong divide between the human rights and the MDG frameworks around a decade ago, human rights mechanisms, reports and the UPR itself routinely addresses and includes references to the MDGs. 688 Ibid. 689 It was created by the General Assembly under resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 as part of UN Reform. 690 UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre Dialogue Bangkok, 6-7 September, 2011: Human Rights for Development: Ways and Means\u2013Workshop Report (DRAFT) 276 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific The recent report by the UN\u2019s independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sepulveda Carmona, mandated by the Human Rights Council, is a good example of this development.691 The Council had asked the expert, i.a, \u201cto submit recommendations that could contribute to the realization of the MDGs\u201d.

This was not built into the original concept of the MDGs. It was a perspective advocates of a human rights approach to the MDGs have always claimed as lacking. As recently as this year, in her report on human rights and extreme poverty, the UN independent expert Sepulveda emphasized \u201cthe human rights approach is fundamental in channelling policies related to the MDGs towards those who are most vulnerable and suffer most from direct and indirect forms of discrimination.\u201d However, she also concluded at present, \u201csuch channelling is an element missing from the MDG agenda.\u201d693 Could it therefore be some countries are winning the numbers battle and losing the war on poverty? There are creeping doubts, especially among globally connected civil society networks following the MDG progress, that the focus of the MDGs needs to be adjusted and move away from country level aggregates statistics towards a quest for equality and equity. A series of reports related to the MDGs at the global and regional level appear to point in the same direction. Therefore, it is this context that will shape and inform the MDG-related efforts over the coming years. 6. The persisting data gap Before moving to questions concerning how human rights and governance can be effectively integrated in ongoing and future efforts related to the MDGs, it is necessary to ask how one could possibly know whether they were met or not \u2013 which brings up 691 UN GA, A/65/259, 9 August 2010, Human rights and extreme poverty \u2013 Report of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty 692 http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/WaterAndSanitation/SRWater/Pages/SRWaterIndex.aspx 693 Ibid. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 277 the crucial issue of \u2018measuring\u2019 progress on the MDGs. In fact the MDGS have often been juxtaposed and compared favourably to human rights and other global commitments because the targets and indicators made the goals very easy to measure. However, this presupposes reliable information or data exists in this context and allows comparisons between countries and over time, is sufficiently disaggregated to understand a context beyond national averages. Here lies one of the major shortfalls in the overall MDG framework despite many efforts to correct it, as the gap between reality and assumption remains large. In fact, early criticism of the MDG agenda related to the measurability of the goals. The ability to accurately measure data is also a prerequisite within the context of accountability.694 In 2005, Attaran argued \u201cmany of the most important MDGs, including those to reduce malaria, maternal mortality, or tuberculosis (TB), suffer from a worrying lack of scientifically valid data. While progress on each of these goals is portrayed in time-limited and measurable terms, often the subject matter is so immeasurable, or the measurements are so inadequate, that one cannot know the baseline condition before the MDGs, or know if the desired trend of improvement is actually occurring. (...) In short, five years into the MDG project, in too many cases, one cannot know if true progress towards these very important goals is occurring. Often, one has to guess.\u201d695 Attaran indicated it was particularly hard to get sufficient and reliable data for the health MDGs, whose quantification he considered irretrievably flawed: \u201cEven the most basic life indicators, such as births and deaths, are not directly registered in the poorest countries. (...) Without reliable vital registration systems to track even the existence of births or deaths, naturally the data for the medical circumstances of those births or deaths\u2014or the lives in between\u2014are unreliable. Accordingly, most of the available data on the health MDGs come from methods of estimation, censuses, specialised household surveys, or all of these together.\u201d The idea regarding aggregate comparisons giving incomplete pictures has already been emphasized by UNDP in its Human Development Report of 2002: \u201cWhen considering human development, within-country inequality must be taken into account because simple comparisons of per capita GDP assume that everyone in a country has the same income.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f14a430a-68a8-46df-9654-788b95af2dbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f14a430a-68a8-46df-9654-788b95af2dbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7c1aa2704cc9e58a454d21749117d3ce53d12d12c13110da76970e57127d1d4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5f9d231-9a6d-4570-8a3b-3d2a5427395b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9cfa20f4966004cb3ab5909814615dc31edf89334a3a5806c3c2360ef0c77356"}}, "hash": "6dc992f67a6204885bbcce3a8a8691ac18acf954208a63725e68e5ec9394b226", "text": "Data on within-country inequality, based on household surveys, are often not comparable across countries or over time, so conclusions must be tentative.\u201d UNDP then suggested reasonable estimates can be made, and studies have found, that long-term trends in interpersonal inequality, using PPP exchange rates, prove the world has become much more unequal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b94a22fb-999f-489a-b094-76d1d86983fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "b94a22fb-999f-489a-b094-76d1d86983fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4250f12902f161398b8c3b3a163b302fde61f97207183bdb4c8abbbf13a3346c"}, "3": {"node_id": "71dbebd9-7d7f-4240-bbe5-708c1e525e9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76ed8dfd52a2b709e22bf4ac7c36a5b887d0f873c64e6372b05bcc72228def02"}}, "hash": "e510f630f0100f2651e4efd89485c4a3613469674b76d3e9853edd66258926b1", "text": "The limited available evidence indicated that worldwide, within-country income inequality had been increasing for the past 30 years.

There is more to the availability of data and government information than its seemingly technical nature might suggest. There is a clear linkage to transparency and accountability, which was already emphasised in the Report of the Millennium Project in 2005: \u201cIn practice, accountability depends on citizens\u2019 awareness of the Goals and their corresponding rights and information about government actions. Governments need to introduce greater openness and provide full access to official data and performance indicators. They should produce timely publications of the fully audited accounts of the central bank and of the main state enterprises, such as those related to extractive industries. Other information for publication includes laws, regulations, budgets, procurements rules, incomes and assets of public officials and parliamentarians, and public access to parliamentary voting records and political funding contributions.\u201d696 The 2005 Millennium Project Report stated, \u201cInvestments in statistical services are urgently needed. Today\u2019s ad hoc international statistical efforts are unreliable \u2013 often duplicative, inconsistent, and burdensome to national governments. Sustainable statistical capacities must be available to run population and housing censuses, conduct household surveys, set up vital statistics and health information systems, and compile indicators on food, agriculture, education, and the economy, among other areas.\u201d697 The 2006 e-discussion on democratic governance and the MDGs conducted by UNDP highlighted the significance of evidence in policy processes and monitoring the pro poor impact of policy. The discussion underscored the need for updated and credible data for establishing responsive governance. Citizens need valid, reliable information to be able to hold governments accountable. Planning at sub-national levels is carried out using national level aggregate data, resulting in fallacious planning. Also, it was highlighted that qualitative assessment and lessons learned are equally important along with statistical/ quantitative analysis. The lack of data at the sub-national level was identified as the weakest link when it comes to monitoring and evaluation. Institutional capacities to collect, compile, analyze and use statistics for policy and project formulation and management are weak. Such weaknesses make it impossible for leadership to make the right decisions based on accurate timely information.698 Developing institutional capacities to produce quality statistics would not only facilitate monitoring and reporting on MDGs, but also contribute to greater transparency and accountability.699 The connection between disaggregated data, human rights and non-discrimination has also been understood some time ago and was highlighted by UNDP in 2006: 696 Millennium Project Report 2005 697 Ibid. 698 UNDP, Reference Note DG and MDGs, 2006 699 Ibid. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 279 \u201cEfforts to monitor progress in relation to human rights or MDG targets depend crucially on statistics-based evidence. Moreover, the data collected needs to be disaggregated, making it possible to judge whether as many girls as boys attend primary school, or whether maternal mortality falls in all regions of a country, or among all groups, including minorities. Not all states collect reliable statistics, and few do so with the objective of identifying discrimination. Accordingly, in order to track whether MDGs are being achieved equitably, there is a need for increased investment and capacity building in monitoring systems. In many cases, this is a necessary first step towards applying a human rights lens to MDG programming.\u201d700 In 2008, the UN report on Governance and the MDGs previously referenced found that in order to properly contextualize the MDGs at the national and local level, they must be disaggregated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71dbebd9-7d7f-4240-bbe5-708c1e525e9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "71dbebd9-7d7f-4240-bbe5-708c1e525e9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4250f12902f161398b8c3b3a163b302fde61f97207183bdb4c8abbbf13a3346c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b94a22fb-999f-489a-b094-76d1d86983fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e510f630f0100f2651e4efd89485c4a3613469674b76d3e9853edd66258926b1"}}, "hash": "76ed8dfd52a2b709e22bf4ac7c36a5b887d0f873c64e6372b05bcc72228def02", "text": "The Report also identified a need to develop a monitoring methodology, identify benchmark surveys, and collect disaggregated data through development of statistical capacity.

The Millennium Project Report highlighted significant disparities on the subnational level when looking at target-related indicators.702 For instance, when listing investment priorities for reaching the MDGs in various global regions, the Report highlights how \u201cpockets of the region (of South East Asia), especially in Lao PDR, Cambodia, and parts of Indonesia remain trapped in poverty.\u201d703 The stark regional imbalances in China and India are also pointed out (and illustrated in maps). Taking another look at these maps today, only half a decade later, it is strikingly obvious these regional imbalances have expanded. In 2005, the Minority Rights Group International (MRG), the \u201cfocus on aggregate results, rapid development and achieving the greatest good for the greatest number could mean that the particular needs of the most excluded groups \u2013 of which minorities form a major part \u2013 will be ignored in the interests of meeting the targets on paper\u201d.704 The Millennium Project Report also makes a very clear and vivid connection between an MDG-focus on marginalized groups and disadvantaged regions and conflict prevention. \u201cTo prevent conflict, MDG-based scale-up programs need to narrow rather than widen existing ethnic, regional, or communal divides. In practice, countries must ensure the equitable provision of services and infrastructure to all groups in society, including people in disadvantaged 700 UNDP, Human Rights and the Millennium Development Goals\u2013Making the Link (2006) 701 UN, Governance for the Millennium Development Goals, 2007 702 See for instance, the maps on infant mortality and underweight children (p.17 and 170), per capita incomes in provinces of China (p-160), or literacy rates for girls and boys in India (p.164). 703 Millennium Project Report 2005 704 MRG, The Millennium Development Goals: Helping or Harming Minorities?

Major projects in countries at risk should conduct regular peace and conflict impact assessments to ensure they do not exacerbate existing tensions and increase the risk of conflict.\u201d705 In order to carry out this task, the Report urged countries to \u201cundertake disaggregated reporting on how different regions or groups within a country are progressing toward the Goals in order to shed light on patterns of inequality across groups and help mainstream conflict prevention.\u201d706 Moreover, in terms of the content and quality of the public investments to be considered in this regard, the Report deviates far from the classic \u2018MDG-interventions\u2019, and focuses right on core governance functions. It recommends MDG-based strategies \u201cshould include specific investments aimed directly at enhancing peace and security. Measures are needed to strengthen state capacity, including investments in justice and security.\u201d This would include training and providing incentives to \u201cthe police and military to provide accountable and rights based public services\u201d which itself should be a priority for development planning.707 The 2010 Global MDG Report stated, The lack of good quality surveys carried out at regular intervals and delays in reporting survey results continue to hamper the monitoring of poverty. (...) Only with more timely data can accurate reports on progress towards the MDGs be provided.708 Improved data and monitoring tools are crucial for devising appropriate policies and interventions needed to achieve the MDGs. Although some progress is being made, reliable statistics for monitoring development remain inadequate in many poor countries, and the challenge of building in-country capacity to produce better policy- relevant data is enormous.709 A March 2010 symposium on the MDGs and human rights also urged states to collect disaggregated data in particular with regard to children with disabilities and minorities.710 A recent UN report on human rights and extreme poverty signalled, \u201cStates must conduct a comprehensive and disaggregated gender analysis assessing vulnerabilities of both genders as potential beneficiaries\u201d of social protection policies. \u201cThe collection of disaggregated data, in terms of both sex and age, is essential not only for the design of effective social protection systems, but also for the unmasking of gender dynamics underpinning \u2013 and often undermining \u2013 achievement of the MDGs.\u201d711 Indeed, a prerequisite for effective social protection is 705 Millennium Project Report 2005 706 Ibid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "849531c8-c33c-4abf-96f3-558b2d7699eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "849531c8-c33c-4abf-96f3-558b2d7699eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3f81ae685e95cc751e9329b1147955eddfa3919d4aa9d18088e8ff501716c72"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6823187-f43f-4e9b-a940-736e5935bd40", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "caf724ee3c4a594a1d0629df8e091c3a0ca77fe44378cdc8e2dece9095738f55"}}, "hash": "6f6247abb53ed8fbf057de5fc318edde754044d0806b12a43cd1bdf1f3c39301", "text": "707 This recommendation actually goes back to one UNDP already made in 2002 in its global Human Development Report. 708 2010 Global MDG Report 709 Ibid. 710 MDGs and Human Rights, International Symposium \u2013 Conference Report, Harvard Law School, 22-23 March 2010. 711 UN GA, A/65/259,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc77b102-402a-475d-85ea-6ef2aad19050": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc77b102-402a-475d-85ea-6ef2aad19050", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e5c909cb07b47f1d1ba2e326d39556a6560020a5646138410d64650bb54a474"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb8a99fe-8d49-4cb8-8fd9-dca33e57ef43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25d868c5c046235ef0d1ca7ee01d8229187f7e3c5f6f18a3b02190172412e8c0"}}, "hash": "914d1e0ae4e8af40651bf8f2c1b6f975197330390516d40f1ef1a2aa79941bb6", "text": "9 August 2010, Human rights and extreme poverty \u2013 Report of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty (Magdalena Sepulveda Carmona) Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 281 accurate identification of the poor and their needs as well as a deep understanding of the circumstances in which poverty occurs. 7. Five years to go: The 2010 review, \u201cbreakthrough\u201d and \u201cacceleration\u201d The 2010 Global MDG Report, presented in preparation of the September 2010 review summit, concluded \u201cthe Millennium Development Goals are still attainable. The critical question today is how to transform the pace of change from what we have seen over the last decade into dramatically faster progress. The experience of these last ten years offers ample evidence of what works and has provided tools that can help us achieve the MDGs by 2015.\u201d The \u201cMDGs summit\u201d in September 2010 was seen as, \u201can opportunity for world leaders to translate this evidence into a concrete agenda for action.\u201d712 At an intergovernmental meeting on the MDGs in Asia-Pacific, the UN SG also declared one of the main goals of the September Summit was to \u201cshowcase what works \u2014 in order to scale it up.\u201d713 In September 2010, UN Member States reconvened for their ten-year review of the Millennium Declaration. Essentially, what they reviewed was a relatively narrow conception regarding progress towards achieving the MDG targets. \u201cWhile expressing deep concern that it falls far short of what is needed\u201d, they welcomed the progress made since 2005, and \u201crecognize developing countries have made significant efforts towards achieving the MDGs and have had major successes in realizing some of the targets.\u201d However, the General Assembly also warned, \u201cwithout substantial international support, several of the Goals are likely to be missed in many developing countries by 2015.\u201d714 An analysis of the text of the September 2010 outcome document reveals a number of interesting changes in the form and focus of the debate since 2000. For one, the 2005 outcome document unequivocally reaffirmed the Millennium Declaration, and addressed all aspects of development; peace and collective security; human rights and the rule of law; and strengthening of the United Nations. The MDGs were addressed under the chapter of development. In contrast, the 2010 outcome document is entirely devoted to 712 UN MDG Report 2010 713 Secretary General\u2019s message at the \u201cSpecial Ministerial Meeting for MDGs Review in Asia and the Pacific: Run up to 2015\u201d on 3-4 August in Jakarta, Indonesia 714 September 2010, Summit Outcome Document 282 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific \u201cKeeping the Promise\u201d to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.715 References to the Millennium Declaration are minimal and indirect: \u201cWe reaffirm our resolve to work together for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, recalling the development goals and commitments emanating from the UN Millennium Declaration (...)\u201d. The MDGs take absolute centre stage and the values and principles of the Declaration are understood in the context of achieving the MDGs.716 The term \u201chuman rights\u201d features in the 2005 outcome document 49 times, whereas it is mentioned only 13 times in the 2010 outcome document. Of course, the number of times a word is used in a document does not directly co-relate to the quality of the references. However, further analysis of the context and the quality also points in the same direction. Democracy, which appeared 14 times in the 2005 document, was mentioned only twice in 2010. In the 2010 outcome document States reaffirm the \u201cimportance\u201d of freedom, peace and security, respect for all human rights, including the right to development, the rule of law, gender equality \u201cand an overall commitment to just and democratic societies\u201d for development. The only other reference to democratic governance in the text is with regard to ensuring official development assistance is used effectively.717 One cannot help but notice a certain shift in emphasis when comparing the Millennium Declaration and the 2005 Secretary-General\u2019s report and outcome document with the 2010 Secretary-General\u2019s report and review meeting outcome documents.

The Millennium Declaration included a commitment of its review at regular intervals. The 2005 Summit was a review of the Declaration as a whole. The 2010 Summit, however, was a review of progress made on the MDGs.

This is due to the problem that inequality has now been amply recognized as a priority and issues such as addressing the poorest of the poor, reaching the most marginalized and reducing internal disparities are woven into the text\u2019s substantive sections.

Policies and actions must therefore \u201cfocus on the poor and those living in the most vulnerable situations\u201d, so they may benefit from progress towards achieving the MDGs and need to provide more equitable access to economic opportunities and social services. What the document fails to provide is clarity regarding how inequality can be concretely measured in the context of the MDGs, what specific goals, targets and indicators could be used to address these particular concerns, and how possible discrepancies between reaching the aggregate target at country level and aiming to prioritize the bottom rungs could be resolved. This, presumably, will have to be completed at the country level. In 2010, governments also agreed to accelerate progress in order to meet the MDGs by \u201caddressing the root causes of extreme poverty and hunger\u201d as well as \u201cspecial actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples\u201d. However, they did not identify what the root causes might be nor how they could be addressed. Judging from what has been learned in recent years about the linkages between empowerment and exclusion, discrimination, human rights and poverty, it is clear that explicitly enunciating root causes might be beyond the comfort zone for many governments at the General Assembly. Nevertheless, these commitments open a door to a more determined human rights based approach for identifying and addressing root causes at the operational level. The 2010 outcome document introduces the dimension of geographic disparities and thus reemphasizes the need for area-specific programmes in order to fulfil the promise of the MDGs. States committed to \u201cproviding and strengthening comprehensive and affordable community-based primary health-care services (...) while paying particular attention to poor people and populations, especially in rural and remote areas, with a view to extending health protection to all those in need\u201d and to \u201cstrengthening basic infrastructure, human and technical resources and the provision of health facilities so as to improve health systems and ensure the accessibility, affordability and quality, especially in rural and remote areas, of health-care services, as well as sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.\u201d Again, this provides an opportunity for targeting MDG specific initiatives at the subnational or local level, through area-based strategies. For most UN agencies, 2010 was also a review year for progress made over the past decade, and an opportunity to reenergize and refocus their own efforts for the period up to 2015. UNDP\u2019s approach in this regard has been laid down in a Breakthrough Strategy and the MDG Acceleration Framework (MAF) which has in the meantime, been endorsed by the UNDG as a UN system-wide tool.722 The MAF was applied on a pilot basis in ten countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia Pacific and the CIS in 2010, and has been \u201crolled out\u201d in the course of 2011 to several more. In the Asia Pacific region, only Lao PDR and Papua New Guinea participated in the pilot phase, but following a recent MAF workshop at the UNDP 722 See the UNDG website on the MAF at http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=1505 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 285 APRC in Bangkok, a number of additional countries in the region are expected to carry out MAF analyses and develop MAF Action Plans in the coming months. UNDP launched its MDG Breakthrough Strategy several months prior to the September 2010 review summit.723 The document was pitched as a \u201ccall to action for all UNDP staff\u201d and was described as the organization\u2019s highest priority to support countries in their efforts to fully achieve the MDGs. The document acknowledged, \u201ctoo many MDGs are off track and, in the current context of crisis, unlikely to be realized\u201d. However, the effort through to 2015 \u201ccannot be business as usual\u201d.

Rather optimistically, it claims \u201cthe international community has the knowledge, experience and resources to close the gap. It knows what works and where to invest to solve what is a development emergency.\u201d The strategy includes three main elements: 1) scaling up of initiatives in gender, energy, water and sanitation, education, health and sustainable agriculture with a focus on acceleration (by applying the MAF \u2013 see below); 2) interventions that address longer-term structural development constraints by investing in effective policies and institutions, improved conditions for peace, security and good governance, public private investments that accelerate pro-poor growth, an equitable framework on trade, technology and innovation and environmental sustainability; and 3) a rejuvenated advocacy campaign around the MDGs to bring about a groundswell of public and political support for closing the MDG gap. Subsequently, the focus has shifted almost entirely on the MAF itself, which is designed to be a tool for only part of the strategy. This may explain some of the scepticism facing the MAF region. This rather broad and comprehensive strategy essentially covers all main areas of UNDP\u2019s operational involvement at the country level. Another way of framing the issue suggests work on the MDGs cuts across all thematic programmes, sections and practices. One cannot fail to notice, however, that the areas of human rights and democratic governance are less visible and prominent in the strategy than could have been expected based on past achievements of UNDP in these areas, and as its historic contribution as a leader on human development may have suggested. 723 UNDP, \u201cMDG Breakthrough Strategy \u2013 Accelerate and Sustain MDG Progress\u201d, May 2010 724 UNDP Administrator Helen Clark in her foreword to the MDG Breakthrough Strategy, May 2010 286 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific To be sure, the achievement of MDGs is very narrowly defined as meeting the targets and indicators at the country level within the parameters as defined in 2001 and revised in 2007. There is no explicit vision of implementing the broader scope of the Millennium Declaration as such. The metaphors and vocabulary used are drawn from medicine, engineering and transport. Although the vision consists of a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d, the action proposed resembles technical upgrading of a factory assembly line aiming to boost the quantity of output.725 Moreover, it is perhaps less clear than the strategy suggests that sufficient knowledge about the problems causing poverty and hunger in concrete circumstances, about cause and effect of certain public policies on certain statistical indicators and benchmarks, and in particular about \u201cwhat works and where to invest\u201d is at hand. It is true that the international development community has learned a great deal in the past decade, and deliberate efforts have been made to improve the collective understanding. But it is also true that prescriptive policy choices do not always flow easily from such insights. The developments in society measured by looking at certain indicators are often the result of a myriad of complex factors where the effect of well-intentioned interventions is not always easy to detect, especially not within rather short time frames. Furthermore, what has been the core of the learning process are the abstract, conceptual elements that can be deducted from particular country experiences. These need to be reapplied to every single concrete context, requiring local knowledge, data and an open mind. Adopting a short-term view focused on immediate results is often deceptive, as short term results can often not be sustained in the longer run, especially in countries with low levels of resources. However, there are, of course, areas where the benefit becomes visible more quickly compared to others. It will not be hard to establish causal linkages between vaccination campaigns and the reduction of certain infectious diseases, or the availability of emergency obstetric care for birth-related mortality for instance. But there exists great doubt in the global development community that all problems and solutions are known and well- understood, and if only there were enough resources, all these problems could be solved on a sustainable basis. It appears this rather simplistic approach, which has underpinned the MDG concept from the outset, has lost much of its persuasive power. At its core, the UNDP Breakthrough Strategy proposed to use what it called \u201can innovative problem-diagnosing tool\u201d in the form of the MDG Acceleration Framework (MAF).726", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d5753b0-df7e-4c1a-8ca1-3742b1d2307a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d5753b0-df7e-4c1a-8ca1-3742b1d2307a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af97a14f4846b563ad8e47400db4ca156801a6c3ea7a6bab831ee29ee101f4cb"}, "3": {"node_id": "bbf814d7-c397-4f11-82f1-1fad7c827e68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6674ce3e708d6a30da70801ef4e8b10333cd3f05060719d5a5224a551e0b692d"}}, "hash": "324f4eaf2799f574a3d846007ff2e42c06ab6759875d444d943955344d54b3df", "text": "The MAF is a tool available for UN Country Teams led by their Resident Coordinators to support governments on MDG Acceleration.727 The MAF is based on the assumption governments are often unable to effectively prioritize and implement interventions required to meet the MDGs \u201cdue in large part to policy, resource and/or service delivery constraints\u201d.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 287 with earlier analyses, the governance dimension is crucial for areas largely dependent on input-based, top-down service delivery. However, the MDGs also depend on empowering people to independently improve their own lives through decent work that provides a livelihood, through exercising rights to make choices affecting their lives, to full participation in decision-making on public investments, and to have complete and timely information in order to do so. Sometimes, it is a question of the state getting out of the way, of abandoning overregulation, rent-seeking or practices that discriminate or harass poor people thus preventing them from ensuring their own livelihoods. These instances are hardly captured by the rather limited scope of \u201cservice delivery\u201d. The strategy assumes most governments and partners \u201cknow the interventions required to meet the MDGs\u201d and identifies three factors constraining implementation: \u201ca lack of capacity to systematically identify and address bottlenecks/constraints; poor alignment of efforts to overcome bottlenecks; and limited accountability for government agencies and development partners\u201d.728 All three reside at the core of governance concerns and need to be addressed with determined and comprehensive efforts to address features of poor governance, including adoption of a human rights based approach. This valuable insight does not seem to be picked up in the strategy or the operational parts of the MAF. An opportunity to highlight UNDP\u2019s particular expertise in these areas thus appears to be missed. \u201cWORK IN PROGRESS: MAF ROLLOUTS TO DATE\u201d \u2022\ufffd presented by UNDP BDP at the APRC Bangkok MDG Acceleration Framework Workshop, 6 October 2011 728 These observations are very similar to the findings of a study by the author of this paper done in 2008 for the Millennium Campaign on Nepal. The Country Facts and Campaign Guide Sheet is a reference work analyzing the political, social and economic context of the country, including policy drivers and obstacles to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.

Human rights or democratic governance are not mentioned among the guiding principles or organizational implications.

This should not be optional, and the incentive should not be to \u2018optimize results\u2019. UNDP, along with all other UN agencies committed to a human rights based approach to development, have more of an obligation in terms of human rights and democratic governance than merely offering government assistance \u2018to strengthen their governance capacity\u2019 in order to achieve certain MDG targets. Democratic governance is not only a means to achieve MDGs. Systems also have to be more than \u201caccountable, transparent and responsive\u201d to be genuinely democratic. Unfortunately, the opportunity was missed to build on significant advances made earlier in aligning the MDGs with the human rights and democratic 729 UNDP 2010 MDG Breakthrough Strategy Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 289 governance agendas, and to learn lessons from criticism of an overly technocratic approach to the MDGs predominant in earlier years.730 The longer annex version of the strategy provides a few more references on governance. The strategy adds that UNDP will \u201ccontinue providing demand-driven support for democratic governance linked to MDG achievement\u201d. Democratic governance support, as has been explained in the previous sections, is both of intrinsic value and flows directly from the Millennium Declaration. It also acts as a means to ensure better and more sustainable progress on achieving the MDGs. However, it is not clear why support to democratic governance was not included more visibly and resolutely in the package of initiatives offered by the organization with regard to MDG acceleration. The strategy further states \u201cat the country level, UNDP can help governments at all levels to address MDG gaps and reversals by strengthening their ability to be accountable, transparent and responsive\u2013in particular to those traditionally excluded from services and the opportunities of citizenship. It is essential that citizens understand that their experience, voice and feedback inform and shape MDG interventions, so that they are empowered to take individual initiative, hold partners to account, and ensure that decisions are being made fairly.\u201d This formulation carefully avoids referring to political will as the basis for accountability, transparency, and responsiveness. Democratic governance also includes exclusion and discrimination, in particular those lacking opportunities for citizenship, and empowering people to provide \u201cvoice and feedback\u201d only if and when their basic human rights, including the rights of political participation, are fully respected. The proposal emphasizing \u201caccess to water and basic sanitation\u201d makes an important point, namely \u201cthe principal driver that affects country progress lies in the area of governance and therefore improving sector governance needs to be a key focus of efforts to accelerate these MDGs.\u201d Again, the connection is recognized, but the conclusion is not necessarily in line with a human rights based approach and lessons learned from the past. \u201cImproving sector governance\u201d says too little about the dimension of rights, in particular the human right to water. Governance problems causing poor access to water and sanitation are rarely limited to the sector of water and sanitation itself. Efforts to improve access must therefore look at the broader context. There is, however, some recognition for such an approach in the last proposed areas of intervention \u2013 development dimensions of HIV/AIDS and health, where the need for broader approaches addressing underlying structural drivers of infection and a human rights context is highlighted. While this does not fully reflect the successful human rights based approach UNDP\u2019s work on HIV/AIDS has been following in recent years, it provides encouragement for integrating considerations in the context of MDG acceleration. 730 This is not to suggest that UNDP has a human rights monitoring role. In 2007, UNDP\u2019s Executive Board clarified that while UNDP does not have any normative or monitoring role with regard to human rights, UNDP will uphold universal UN norms and standards, including those related to human rights, by taking a human development-based approach to programming, and by designing its coordination and programmatic to reflect the commitment to support the realization of the values of the Millennium Declaration around the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ef12f63-2a8a-4ee4-9564-3ee66bbe6550": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ef12f63-2a8a-4ee4-9564-3ee66bbe6550", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3239f27e95cf7358a04f03f094ca62806cab7b984cde8d64eaf9e65ccf85e490"}, "2": {"node_id": "43229a10-2d8a-4dd4-adeb-4e25fa6c239e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b6b4e51d03ff3578d51fb12de5d61590aaa1c4674a35b76f5071ceebdcd658f"}}, "hash": "34b298c569a1aeac3b85ea2346e3825bc4a75db3d97a353762523d0d98327c84", "text": "See: http://www.undp.org/execbrd/word/dp07-43_updated.doc 290 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62afddfe-c775-4ee6-b73d-fc630d15f065": {"__data__": {"id_": "62afddfe-c775-4ee6-b73d-fc630d15f065", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0b47de54b1c97205efd8c675f6df022aaa2eb27930d6d977cb7d3c697d7418f"}}, "hash": "d0b47de54b1c97205efd8c675f6df022aaa2eb27930d6d977cb7d3c697d7418f", "text": "MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific The strategy goes on to suggest the MAF \u201cwill contribute to identifying and implementing innovative and catalytic approaches to speed and sustain MDG progress\u201d. Among these, \u201clegal empowerment of the poor\u201d is listed.731 Even so, it remains somewhat unclear what exactly UNDP could do in terms of an innovation \u201cto support legal empowerment of the poor\u201d. The Strategy states UNDP will utilize multiple arms of its work across practices to sustain and accelerate MDG progress through legal empowerment. It also states by addressing the structural causes of poverty and exclusion, work designed to advance legal empowerment of the poor can help to sustain MDG progress. Again, a human rights issue is presented in its utility for MDG progress, while the text is silent on the intrinsic value of legal empowerment for more effective human rights protection. The text also recognizes \u201clegal empowerment can be used as an instrument for ensuring that the poor can and do benefit from services and reforms\u201d and it \u201coffers an assessment methodology that can help clarify who benefits from which rights and identify bureaucratic bottlenecks that prevent the poor and excluded from exercising their rights.\u201d The methodology of legal empowerment is therefore recognized \u201cas a critical contribution to MDG diagnostics.\u201d While the connection between the MDGs and legal empowerment clearly flows from years of applying a human rights based approach to poverty reduction efforts, the enormity and complexity of the challenge is perhaps not fully acknowledged here. Addressing legal empowerment is, as the Strategy itself recognizes, a long-term structural problem, and may not be suitable for producing quick, visible results as intended with the overall purpose of \u201cMDG acceleration\u201d. From a human rights perspective, keeping in mind the new emphasis on inequality within the MDG debate, as well as a decade of leading human development issues, UNDP should not make legal empowerment of the poor merely an optional tool within its well-stacked MDG toolbox. Together, with the related goals of effective enjoyment of human rights and effective access to justice, legal empowerment should be central to all efforts related to the MDGs in all countries in the coming years, and would deserve to receive prominent inclusion among the priorities, guidelines and principles of MDG acceleration efforts. The strategy does not provide adequate guidance on how to approach difficult choices likely to be made in view of a rather limited availability public finance, MDG-related or other development funds. Priorities need to be established between accelerating progress to meet the MDG targets by 2015 and investing in areas promising more sustainability beyond that date. Priority should also be given to areas which help to reach the poorest of the poor, or to areas most deprived of development, at the risk of lower overall acceleration measured by an aggregate target.732 These are difficult choices to make but are common in any country where financial and human resources are limited. Essentially, 731 The Strategy introduces the point by saying that \u201capproximately four billion people are currently excluded from the rule of law.\u201d It is unclear from the text how this figure was calculated, and what exactly this statement entails. It only states that \u201cthat they live their lives without the protections and opportunities afforded by the legal framework and without access to the laws and formal institutions that underpin society.\u201d 732 For instance, to reach an aggregate target, it would be more rational to invest in those already closer to reach it, and lift those above a target line, rather than investing in raising the indicators of those that are too far off to have a chance to meet the target in the short timeframe remaining. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 291 some investments need to be prioritized over others. From a human rights perspective, it appears the latter, i.e. reaching out and focusing on the poorest of the poor, is the most ethical and urgent choice to prioritize. However, it may not be the choice leading to optimal MDG acceleration or even the option providing the best incentive for decision- makers in a given country. The strategy also includes a section on resource implications. A UN MDG Acceleration Fund was proposed (but has not come to fruition as of yet). Through the strategy, UNDP was \u201cseeking supplemental resources in the form of multi-donor investment packages in the following areas: investing in women and girls, access to clean and affordable energy for the poor, unlocking institutional and human capacities, strategic governance reforms, and investments in the sub-national level for local development.\u201d Most, if not all,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a26f04cf-db32-4205-85f1-8e5d6345e80e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a26f04cf-db32-4205-85f1-8e5d6345e80e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7ae54353bb063c37e74bc514f5cecd4541eeda55a9afff9cca8b4d152dda3df"}}, "hash": "d7ae54353bb063c37e74bc514f5cecd4541eeda55a9afff9cca8b4d152dda3df", "text": "of these areas directly relate to democratic governance and/or human rights. It is also evident these dimensions could have been emphasized more in the formulation of the strategy itself and made extremely visible in the MDG acceleration framework. What is perhaps the greatest missing link of the Breakthrough Strategy is the focus on in-country inequalities, the investment in better disaggregated data and analysis, and addressing the needs of the most marginalized. The omission is all the more unexpected, as many human development reports, MDG reports, including those prepared by UNDP, and even intergovernmental commitments such as the 2010 outcome document, increasingly emphasize this dimension. The inclusive and non-discriminatory manner in which the Goals are to be met in order to be fully in line with the spirit of the Millennium Declaration has perhaps even superseded the purely technocratic approach fixated at national aggregate target figures, in particular if they are based on questionable statistics. It may be considered unfortunate that UNDP\u2019s Breakthrough Strategy did not fully embrace this new thinking. While other forums and agencies base their MDG-related efforts at social protection with the specific aim of reaching people at the bottom of the economic and social order, the Breakthrough Strategy mentions social protection only twice, and it is clearly not central to the approach. As will be argued after a brief comment on the MAF, these apparent shortcomings may be overcome by a contextualized and flexible approach to MDG acceleration at the country level. It is encouraging to see that where the MAF has already been applied, countries did in fact often include a dimension of social inequalities, regional disparities and have hinted at underlying governance and human rights problems such as structural discrimination. When trying to understand and analyse the MDG Acceleration Framework as proposed and outlined in the Breakthrough Strategy, the following documents need to be considered: the 2010 collection of case studies from the ten pilot countries that applied the MAF, which also includes a brief guide on the methodology used, Unlocking progress: MDG acceleration on the road to 2015, the more detailed reports of the individual pilots published in 2011 and the 2011 Operational Note for UN Country Teams. The MAF itself should not be understood as a grand new strategy. It is designed to be \u2018piggy-backed\u2019 upon existing plans and strategies rather than duplicating or replacing them. It presupposes such plans exist, sufficient political will is in place to reach the 292 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific Goal, and to apply the MAF tool to achieve the goal. It is also presented with a significant disclaimer: \u201cAn acceleration solution may not always exist, as complex political, social, economic and environmental issues that hamper progress may require time to resolve. (...) But if a solution exists, the MAF provides an orderly way of identifying it, and operationalizing its implementation.\u201d733 It essentially includes four steps: intervention prioritization734, bottleneck735 identification and prioritization, acceleration solution selection, and implementation planning and monitoring, each of which being quite narrowly defined. The MAF analysis proceeds through four sequential steps, namely 1. Identify and codify the interventions required to meet the MDG targets 2. Help identify and prioritize MDG bottlenecks 3. Identify solutions to form an MDG Acceleration Compact that aligns and focuses stakeholders and resources on accelerating MDG progress 4. Implement and Monitor the MDG Acceleration Compact to ensure required impact736 The first is to identify the relevant MDG target (generally one that is off-track or unlikely to be met, based on current projections) and enumerate the key interventions considered necessary to reach it. \u201cIn most countries, these interventions are known and have been implemented since early on in the MDG timeline. In fact, key interventions can often be drawn from the national development plan, sector strategies and plans, and any relevant policy and planning document related to the MDG target selected.\u201d Prioritization means selection. If one goal is prioritized over others, this means the MAF is not designed to be a tool to meet all MDGs at the country level, but only a technique to be used to achieve a particular goal, chosen and identified by relevant government counterparts. This has also led to questions on how much the choice of interlocutors at the country level, the selection of a ministry, or the selection of a particular priority determines the way in which the MAF is applied, resources and political attention are channelled, and what the UN\u2019s role might be in this regard.

The MAF itself does not provide many answers to this question, as it takes the existence of an MDG-related policy (at the national country level) and the choice of certain MDG priorities as a given, rather than looking at a country setting in a broader context. Bottlenecks identified in the process are the obstacles to meet that particular MDG through a given policy (intervention), and not the broader, often systemic obstacles to reaching the MDGs in an accelerated, more inclusive and more sustainable manner. 733 Unlocking progress, 2010 734 An intervention is defined as \u201cthe delivery of a package of goods, services, and/or infrastructure to achieve development goals and targets within a set timeline\u201d. The prioritization is to be informed largely by country/sector plans and focused on off-track or with slow-progress MDG targets. 735 Bottlenecks are broadly defined as proximate and removable constraints that impede implementation of MDG-related interventions. 736 Presentation on the MAF methodology by Shantanu Mukherjee of UNDP BDP at the APRC Bangkok MDG Acceleration Framework Workshop, 5-7 October 2011 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 293 For those MDG targets where the progress has been unsatisfactory, \u201cit is likely that there are bottlenecks that get in the way of realizing the full potential of these interventions on the ground.\u201d The second step is therefore \u201cto analyse the causes of the lack of complete success of each intervention, thus identifying the bottlenecks. Once identified, bottlenecks should be prioritized in terms of their potential impact on the MDG target, were they to be removed. In general, bottlenecks identified can either be cross-cutting in nature, selecting several MDGs at the same time, or specific, selecting primarily the MDG in question. Countries often find it useful to classify each specific bottleneck into one of the four categories\u2013policy and planning, budget and financing, service delivery and service utilization\u2013suggested under the MAF.\u201d737 Again, these findings may well point to more systemic issues related to governance and human rights in a country. However, the purpose is not to identify and address issues through the MAF but instead, focus on issues with the potential to be overcome by particular \u201cacceleration solutions\u201d. It also presupposes that for every MDG an equivalent central government ministry exists as the natural counterpart, which may not be the case for all MDG targets in the same manner. The approach unfortunately relates exclusively to central government executive branch agencies, and disregards any possible role of parliaments as legislative, budgetary or control bodies, the judiciary as ensuring effective access to justice, independent bodies such as national human rights institutions, as well as subnational and local government levels. The focus on off-track MDGs risks missing areas where a MDG might be on-track or already met at the national level. The national government might therefore not attach importance to the goal any longer. However, there are still significant disparities in terms of social stratification and regional inequality. The MAF recognizes but circumscribes the governance dimension: \u201cWhilst MDG financing gaps continue to be a critical bottleneck for scaling up services in many cases, the financing deficit is often compounded by inadequate institutional capacities for planning, monitoring and delivering services of adequate quality to meet local demand.\u201d Governance issues are circumscribed as \u201cservice delivery (supply) bottlenecks\u201d. The February 2011 version of the MAF Operational Note states these \u201care likely to occur in areas such as human resources availability and development, supplies and logistics, lack of decentralized capacity, technical and organizational quality, procurement systems, value chain analysis, sector management and institutions, and the absence of comprehensive monitoring and evaluation systems.\u201d738 As these are essentially governance questions, bottleneck analysis should make use of the full range of assessment tools available for these factors, including many prepared and used by UNDP itself.

For example, a human rights based approach should indeed be an integral part of the MAF rather than an optional possibility. In the section on \u201cbottleneck identification and prioritization\u201d, the note also includes some reference to human rights in the context of \u201cservice use (demand)\u201d. It mentions \u201cbottlenecks in the use of goods and services on the ground from the demand side are likely to occur in the following areas: empowerment of users to use the services when available, information and education available to explain the service, advocacy, intervention promotion, physical distance (lack of transportation), affordability of services, and gender and cultural barriers (e.g., women may face unique difficulties in accessing services). As a matter of fact, culture, human rights and gender are critical pillars in addressing demand side issues.\u201d This is certainly correct, but it still views the MDGs merely in terms of service delivery. It also portrays human rights purely with regard to use of such services, falling short of adequately capturing the full and unhindered enjoyment of all human rights and the effective empowerment of people and communities.740 It may therefore not be surprising that the report on the 10 MAF pilot741 countries, \u201cUnlocking progress: MDG acceleration on the road to 2015\u201d, also released in 2010, mentions rights only in the context of one project related to property titles and women\u2019s rights. The term \u201chuman rights\u201d is not mentioned at all. Ten pilot countries all prepared an MDG Action Plan which included identification of projects, most of which have yet to receive funding. Lessons identified from the pilot exercise included a need to increase the sense of national ownership, cross-sectoral collaborations, and civil society participation. It should be considered important to learn from these lessons and ensure these components of a successful approach are adequately reflected in any future MAF activities. The inclusion of a recommendation to \u201cinvolve civil society in the MAF process\u201d, through \u201creputed civil society organisations especially those representing the most disadvantaged groups\u201d in the latest MAF Operational Note is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of an approach based on genuine participation, democratic legitimacy and genuine local ownership of \u201cacceleration solutions\u201d. The pilot case studies concerning how the MAF has been applied at the country level demonstrates the enormous flexibility and contextuality with which the concept has 740 There is a third brief reference to human rights in the document, which recommends \u201censuring that national legislation is aligned with human rights principles, including those of non\u2010discrimination and equal educational opportunities set out in international instruments, and enforcing laws against discrimination\u201d as part of the checklist for target 2A. The inclusion is noteworthy, but could have deserved a much more prominent place in the document, as it points to a much larger issue than what can reasonably be expected of \u201cacceleration solutions\u201d to address. 741 The ten pilot countries were: Togo, Tanzania, Ghana and Uganda in Africa, Tajikistan in the CIS, Jordan in the Middle East, Belize and Colombia in Latin America and Lao PDR and Papua New Guinea in Asia- Pacific. In Colombia the MAF was applied at the sub-national and local levels. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 295 been applied. What is more, the creative approach taken at country level has repaired what could be taken as conceptual shortcomings of the strategy and the MAF guidelines. It is interesting that the MAF process has helped in many of the pilot countries to increase focus on existing subnational disparities by looking at the needs of the most poor and vulnerable, including women, the elderly and ethnic minorities, ensuring equitable measures and solutions are devised.742 It is a step in the right direction that the maps of Togo, Uganda, Laos, and Colombia in the MAF pilots report show data, as available, on MDG status on a sub-national (in the case of Colombia even the local) level.

Although not explicitly highlighted in the strategy or the MAF, the MAF country analyses often identified governance problems as \u2018bottlenecks\u2019. The pilot study from Uganda found \u201cthere are not many bottlenecks in policy and planning, bottlenecks in areas such as financing and delivery of services impede the full implementation of each of these interventions\u201d. This is reminiscent of the situation in many developing countries. A great number of excellent policies and plans are worked out at the central level of government, often with international assistance, but they are never fully implemented due to insufficient resources and poor service delivery on the ground despite some formal steps towards decentralization, in this case due to widespread absenteeism of health care workers. This is a typical governance problem in many poor countries throughout a variety of regions. A governance approach would suggest looking into how these plans and policies were worked out in the first place, rather than simply blaming the problem on poor delivery away from the capital. Meaningful and effective decentralization, genuine participatory planning processes, and perhaps a more modest and realistic setting of local goals could perhaps be useful new dimensions to this approach. The lack of coordination across ministries was also identified as a \u201csignificant bottleneck\u201d but no clear solution to this problem was presented. 742 Unlocking Progress, 2010 296 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific \u201cGOING BEYOND THE NATIONAL: COLOMBIA\u201d \u2022\ufffd presented by UNDP BDP at the APRC Bangkok MDG Acceleration Framework Workshop, 6 October 2011 Among the three priority cross-cutting bottlenecks, the removal of which would accelerate progress in Togo, the MAF pilot report lists inadequate availability (lack) of statistical information relating to various interventions (coverage, targets) making it difficult to determine the effectiveness of interventions relating to MDG 1 in the rural environment. Although a long list of priority bottleneck interventions743 is provided, there is unfortunately no indication of how cross-cutting bottleneck on disaggregated statistics may be overcome. The MAF pilot project in Lao PDR also emphasized the dimension of subnational disparities and internal social inequalities. Laos, like Papua New Guinea, was a latecomer in terms of developing country-led MDG-based development plans. The government only recently began to attach any importance to applying an MDG approach within its own development policies. With the MAF, the Government expressed its intention \u201cto accelerate progress towards the MDG achievement with a particular focus on the unreached \u2013 the people confronted with challenging outcomes due to the country\u2019s diverse geographical and ethnic features\u201d.744 The MAF aims to reach the most vulnerable population, especially in rural 743 29 \u201cidentified solutions\u201d with a total estimated cost of USD 250m, of which around 10 percent had been obtained. 744 Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sisoulith in his foreword in \u201cLao PDR: Reaching the Unreached\u201d at http://www.undplao.org/newsroom/publication/MAF%20Report_Lao%20PDR_ September%202010.pdf Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 297 areas through innovative options ensuring \u201csocially and geographically disadvantaged communities are given the opportunity and capability to enter the development agenda\u201d.

It may not matter that human rights and governance dimensions are not explicitly referred to, but at least they are understood as what they are, and are approached with the appropriate set of assessment tools. Renewed efforts for progress accelerating achievement of the MDGs in a sustainable and equitable way could be enhanced by integrating country programming, and by overcoming what UNDP staffs informally often refer to as \u201cworking in silos\u201d. The Breakthrough Strategy acknowledges \u201cUNDP rarely leverages the full breadth of its mandate at the country level. UNDP Country Office programming for the MDGs tends to focus mostly on poverty reduction (MDG1), sustainable development (MDG7) and MDG-based planning and resource mobilization (MDG8).\u201d However, rather than suggesting that UNDP should be engaging in interventions traditionally carried out by specialized/technical agencies, it asserts \u201cUNDP- specific tasks such as coordination, advocacy, governance and capacity development can be leveraged across all MDG sectors, effectively complementing and supporting the work of other specialized UN agencies and development partners.\u201d If significant leadership exists by the Resident Coordinator and a common understanding among development partners on MDG priorities is developed at the country level, opportunity to address possible shortcomings at the conceptual level could be overcome by a coordinated, cross-dimensional and comprehensive approach to MDG acceleration. This fully embraces governance and human rights considerations in analysis, process and programmes, and is aimed at sustainability, inclusiveness and equality in the same way as at the accelerated attainment of aggregate statistical targets. 298 Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with Human Rights and Democratic Governance: Proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia-Pacific 8. How MDG acceleration efforts could be complemented through stronger linkages to human rights and democratic governance One of the greatest strengths of the MAF is that it can be used as a tool adapted to specific country contexts. Country Teams who have adopted the MAF demonstrate considerable flexibility in applying it, and have found practical ways of reenergizing the MDG agenda at both national and subnational levels in many countries. MDG-related work holds different meanings in different countries. Significant development assistance is still concentrated on meeting the MDGs, even though massive amounts of expected additional aid never materialized \u2013 not in 2001, not in 2005, and not in 2010. Often, pragmatic and practical approaches to rolling out the MAF at the country level were informed by what essentially constitutes a human rights based approach, namely the identification of the most vulnerable groups and those farthest away from reaching the MDG targets, which is laudable. In terms of genuine participation, another important element of a HRBA, the MAF has remained behind well-established practices and long-standing recommendations from human rights bodies. In the analysis, MAFs often identified governance challenges, in terms of capacity, the legal and regulatory environment, public finance, transparency and accountability. UNDP and UNCTs should not interfere in the prioritization of \u201cwhat should be done about the MDGs?\u201d However, they do possess considerable leverage when presenting incontrovertible data and evidence to advocate emphasis on the underserved, the poor and the most marginalized in society. Experience has taught us that normatively lecturing countries on human rights rarely produces a conducive environment for effective remedial action. While UNDP should not be part of the decision on prioritization, it should help provide data on which the discussion and decisions should be based as well as support an inclusive and transparent process. UNDP therefore suggests to continue \u201crolling out\u201d the MAF in Asia Pacific and other regions, but to also accompany the MAF with efforts to create and maintain an enabling environment and process facilitation with a focus on inclusiveness and transparency. Increasingly, efforts by the UN and development partners need to shift from helping countries to meet the MDGs (on which development aid in any case may have only limited influence) to trying to influence how the goals are being met (the \u201cways and means\u201d), with emphasis on reaching the most disadvantaged (which may have little visible effect on aggregate or even global statistics), and doing so in a manner that is sustainable, human rights-based, transparent and fair.

Recognizing these as rights makes them non- negotiable, consistent and legitimate.745 Five years later, this recommendation appears to be more relevant than ever. The interdependent and mutually reinforcing process rights of meaningful participation, the right to receive and publicize information, and the rights of association and expression remain essential to making genuine progress on the principles outlined in the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs in a more sustainable and equitable manner. Given the relative ease with which statistical parameters can be adjusted (for instance, by lowering the national poverty line, a process often marred by nontransparency and controversy), and the degree to which statistics themselves can be massaged, \u2018moving the goalpost\u2019 appears to be an increasingly attractive option for governments to show \u201cprogress\u201d on some of the Goals. Given the persistent gaps on reliable disaggregated data, it is indispensable that governments and the international development community, led by the UN, raise the game considerably on data and statistics related to the MDGs. This will ensure UNDP\u2019s commitments remain credible. Only recently has progress been made with regard to the subnational calculation of the Human Development Index. However, the advances made in Latin America appear to be significantly ahead of those in Asia-Pacific.746 For many years, the absence of data has prevented the application of this key development indicator below the national level. It is of great significance that the 20th anniversary Human Development Report of 2010 introduced the Inequality-Adjusted HDI, the Gender Inequality Index, and the Multidimensional Poverty Index. Updated editions of these complementary indices will be included in the 2011 Report, published online and in print in November 2011.747 It is essential such tools be further developed and

hurilink webportal) \u2022\ufffd Use governance assessments to identify \u2018bottlenecks\u2019 and better understand their systemic aspects, including those that focus on governance performance as well as the democratic quality of institutions and processes \u2022\ufffd Develop a stronger emphasis on the collection and analysis of disaggregated data, which may involve proactive engagement of Statistical Offices, and coordination with other UN and development agencies, in order to use such data for making disparities easily understandable and evident, building on considerable advances made in this field in recent years (as through DevInfo and other GIS-based tools) \u2022\ufffd Develop a much more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of multi-level governance in the context of the MDGs (decentralization, role of local governments, etc), integrated as a standard element in all MAFs \u2022\ufffd Apply MAFs at the sub-national level as a rule, on the basis of better understanding the latter point, which means active engagement of subnational authorities on the MDGs and assistance to such authorities for adopting locally specific development plans and goals (building on the experiences from Colombia) \u2022\ufffd Widen the scope of reporting on the MDGs from a purely numerical, statistics-based view of the MDG targets, to a more qualitative and fine-grained view of the MDGs as a whole, ideally picking up information and recommendations emanating from the human rights system (don\u2019t let the MDGs be defined by the targets and indicators only!) \u2022\ufffd Help and encourage countries to fully and comprehensively integrate a human rights and governance dimension in their future MDG-related reports, in particular the final assessment in 2015 There is one

That is to uncritically support efforts \u201cto meet the goals\u201d, such as striving for aggregate country-level statistical results that meet certain targets which can be at odds with efforts to identify and address the needs of the poorest of the poor. MDG \u201cacceleration\u201d risks focusing too much on the former, while under-emphasising the latter.749 Token references to a human rights approach, as they are 748 The actions proposed here do not claim to be new or particularly original. In 2004, a UN Guidance Note on Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers noted that the Country Team can \u201chelp to establish a poverty monitoring and public expenditure tracking system, the development of country specific indicators for monitoring the impact of their strategies on poor people and regions, and strengthening national statistical capacity and to make use of such information to assist the government to use data, analysis, and evaluations effectively\u201d. UN Development Group, 2004. 749 OHCHR in 2010 reiterated this point recalling that one of the key criticisms of the income poverty target is that it can be attained without improving the situation of the poorest of the poor or excluded groups. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 301 included in various recent MDG acceleration-documents may not be sufficient to ensure a genuine human rights approach to MDG-oriented development work in the coming years. The development community must be prepared to accept that certain targets may not be met, if it is the result of an emphasis on reducing the vulnerability of the most marginalized in society. Targets also may not be met if creating effective social floors for the poorest are not initiated, or building better institutions and training more qualified staff in the public service is not made a priority. Lessons from the MDGs, in particular from the upcoming phase of \u201cacceleration\u201d until 2015, must be learned and acted upon as a possible agenda for human development post-2015. The fixation with the 2015 date, or any future date chosen to meet certain development goals, bears the risk of sacrificing sustainability for short term \u201csuccesses\u201d. To make investments effective on a sustainable basis, spending now to meet the 2015 Goals could enhance capital investment without much thought to longer term maintenance or operating and staff costs. Is this what the UN is advising poor countries to do? A new push to collect and present reliable and disaggregated data will not only have benefits for the MDG process with an eye on 2015, but will also enable countries and development partners develop concrete goals post-2015. This will create a better understanding of the dynamics to poverty than what was available in 2000. Presenting the 2010 Global MDG Report, UN SG Ban Ki Moon stated \u201cthe world possesses the resources and knowledge to ensure that even the poorest countries, and others held back by disease, geographic isolation or civil strife, can be empowered to achieve the MDGs\u201d.750 More than a decade after the Millennium Declaration and first introduction of the MDGs, it is increasingly likely most countries possess the resources and knowledge to ensure even the poorest citizens, and others held back by disease, geographic isolation or civil strife, can be empowered to achieve their respective development goals. While not abandoning the commitments of the developed world in this regard, the UN family may have to pay much more attention to make countries \u201cmore stable, more just and more secure\u201d751 from within. More responsive, capable and inclusive states are better equipped to meet the multiple challenges emanating from recent crises, and are more likely to attain economic progress in a way that does not leave large sections of society behind, trapped in cycles of poverty lacking opportunity. Problems related to governance can be looked at both from a \u2018supply-side\u2019 perspective of government services such as how states are structured and organized, how policies are developed and coordinated, and how capable public servants are to implement plans. The \u2018demand-side\u2019 takes the perspective of rights and entitlements, outlining how mechanisms, such as a functioning judiciary and effective national human rights institutions, can help claim such rights.

The scepticism of many developing countries about what is perceived as a \u201cNorthern\u201d human rights agenda752 needs to be addressed, especially if post-2015 is to be fully aligned with the values and principles of the Millennium Declaration. It is also the understanding of the UNDP that responsive, capable and inclusive states, along with better democratic governance, helps prevent violent conflict. The freedom from conflict is not only a right recognized in the UN Charter, the MD and many other documents, but it is also a prerequisite for poverty reduction and the enjoyment of social progress. Although it is often argued more funding is required to reach many of the MDG targets, there are also inexpensive ways and means to accelerate progress, in particular governance innovations and improved practices of delivering services. With increasing resources, various impact evaluations show the \u2018quantity\u2019 of health and education services has increased over the recent years, but not the \u2018quality\u2019. This could be one of the key reasons progress has been slower for MDGs measured by outcomes (e.g. health) than for those measured by access (e.g. education). Improving governance can therefore enhance incentives for service providers directly accountable to the poor and disadvantaged. This establishes a clear link between the governance sector, and efforts to enhance government performance per se. 752 Mac Darrow of OHCHR at the March 2010 Harvard symposium on the MDGs and human rights.
