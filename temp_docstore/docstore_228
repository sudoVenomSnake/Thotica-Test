size of most Pacific Island Countries means they have a very narrow economic base, and consequently exhibit a small suite of potential exports. Many of these countries, however, do have large ocean territories. Kiribati for example has a combined land area of just over 800 km\u00b2, but has claim to more than 3.5 million km\u00b2 of ocean territory. This potentially gives these countries access to fishing and other underwater resources, although the potential of these resources is often not fully realised by countries themselves as discussed below. Furthermore, as most Pacific Island Countries comprise groups of scattered islands, their domestic markets are highly fragmented. \u25aa Pacific\ufffdIsland\ufffdCountries\ufffdare\ufffddistant\ufffdfrom\ufffdexternal\ufffdmarkets,\ufffdand\ufffdin\ufffdmany\ufffdcases\ufffdhave\ufffdpoor\ufffdtransport\ufffdlinks\ufffdwith\ufffd global commercial centres. A 2006 study which sought to quantify remoteness found \u201cthe average Pacific island country is 11,500 km away from any other randomly selected country.\u201d4 The same study found that Pacific Island Countries are not only further away from major economies than other island states\u2014such as those in the Caribbean\u2014 but they are also \u201cmuch further away in terms of airfare-based measures of distance.\u201d It is not only external markets that are distant and expensive to reach: many Pacific islanders face isolation within their countries, as people live across widely dispersed islands or in tropical highlands poorly serviced by road infrastructure. Distance from markets, and consequent transportation costs, means that inputs for production are expensive and export sectors are reliant on limited shipping and air-freight services. \u25aa Pacific\ufffdIsland\ufffdCountries\ufffdare\ufffduniquely\ufffdvulnerable\ufffdto\ufffdnatural\ufffddisasters. Strung out as they are across a warm tropical ocean, and along major tectonic plate lines, these countries \u201crank among the most vulnerable in the world to natural disasters.\u201d5 In any given year Pacific Island Countries face cyclones, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, flooding, landslides and droughts. The impact of natural disasters is particularly acute in small states. In Samoa, for example, a cyclone in 1991 caused damage to homes, crops and livelihoods that was measured to be the equivalent of 230 percent of the country\u2019s GDP.6 Samoa also experienced a devastating tsunami in 2009, which killed hundreds of people and caused more than $40 million in property and infrastructure damage. Recurring natural disasters have been particularly damaging for Samoa\u2019s export of traditional root crops. Climate-related disasters, particularly high- intensity cyclones, pose an increasing threat across the Pacific. 5 Taken together, the unique features of the economies of Pacific Island Countries make it difficult for producers and business enterprises to participate competitively in international trade.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6427265-4e95-4668-9c19-5e9e384fbb7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6427265-4e95-4668-9c19-5e9e384fbb7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4389acae530908465eb1cf69d7ae91a26b4ee2306e4d5f09cbf558dae1d4fdf"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b04809e-b53f-465d-8890-d4f7faa44b6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c7ed08053b8920deaa6cd19071c04fafb1b0de90b9f087ec1ae8b4bdea7e60a"}}, "hash": "4a98e3390f06180dd6e650d6c69fbe8a5d806b362755687acb759f3c3c7756a3", "text": "The United Nations has recognised the trade-related challenges that beset small island states for decades: in 1994, the UN organised a global conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in Barbados that acknowledged the unique vulnerability of small island economies; and, a twenty-year anniversary conference will be held in Samoa in 2014 focusing of sustainable partnerships.

Exports of goods are a relatively small feature of Pacific economies. Only in the larger Melanesian states \u2013 Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu \u2013 do goods exports constitute more than 20 percent of national GDP.9 Petroleum gas and mineral resources are very significant in Papua New Guinea; Fiji has a significant clothing and textiles export industry; otherwise primary agricultural exports predominate throughout the region.10 In many cases, colonial-era crops remain important sources of export earnings and rural employment. In Papua New Guinea, for example, it is estimated that more than half of all rural households earn cash from selling coffee destined for export.11 Key commodities exported from Melanesian states include timber, sugar, oil palm, coffee, copra and coconut products, cocoa, vanilla, beef, and sandalwood and other high-value timbers. Reflecting colonial-era production, even in the new millennium more than half of Pacific agricultural products were exported to the European Union.12 Other key export destinations include China, Japan, Malaysia and the United States. Fiji has the most diversified economy in the Pacific, with agricultural exports complemented by some manufacturing and a strong tourism sector. For most of the past century, raw sugar exports to Britain dominated Fiji\u2019s export profile. While in decline in recent years, sugar exports continue to provide direct and indirect employment for some 200,000 people \u2013 around 20 percent of the population.13 Attempts at diversification into higher-value tropical crops have been more successful in Fiji than elsewhere in the Pacific, and around 200 different agricultural products are now sent to 20 different export destinations. Nevertheless in 2010 sugar exports were still worth more than five times the value of Fiji\u2019s other agricultural exports combined.14 Marine resources, including the southwest Pacific tuna fishery, are also significant to Pacific Island Countries. By some estimates 70 percent of the world\u2019s tuna is sourced from the Pacific. Despite this, fish remains \u201ca modest export item nearly everywhere in the Pacific.\u201d15 Most tuna is caught by vessels from distant nations, and Pacific Island Countries earn income by selling fishing licences to foreign vessels. Under such arrangements relatively little of the commercial value of the tuna fishery remains in the Pacific.16 There are tuna canneries located in Fiji and the Solomon Islands, and tuna processing has expanded significantly in Papua New Guinea in recent years. Underwater exploration for possible future extraction and exploitation of oil, gas and minerals is ongoing in the region. With relatively few opportunities to pursue competitive goods exports, many Pacific Island Countries have turned to providing services instead. In this regard, tourism is particularly important. For those countries that are well serviced by international flights or cruise ships, attracting visitors from abroad has proved a key source of export earnings. For a number of countries, tourism receipts constitute more than 20 percent of national GDP, namely: Fiji (20.1 percent), Palau (57.5 percent), Samoa (20.5 percent) and Vanuatu (31.5 percent).17 6 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS In addition to tourism, a number of Pacific Island Countries also pursue opportunities to provide less orthodox international services including so-called \u201cjurisdictional services\u201d such as \u201coffshore banking and related financial services ... citizenship, residency and work permits, and paradiplomacy,\u201d18 as well as the sale of internet domain names and \u201cflags of convenience\u201d for shipping registration.19 Given the relatively few economic opportunities at home, workers from Pacific Island Countries often pursue jobs overseas. For those countries with access to developed country labour markets, money sent home by workers living abroad has also become particularly important. Remittances form a substantial proportion of the GDP of the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu. Indeed Samoa and Tonga are widely recognised as some of the most remittance dependent economies on earth.20 Another way that Pacific Island Countries earn income is through aid and concessional loans from the international community. While countries with more successful economies, such as Fiji, receive very low levels of development assistance, aid is particularly important for developing infrastructure and maintaining government services in a number of countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d486b117-6047-4d9c-9d4a-e3252de0e72f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d486b117-6047-4d9c-9d4a-e3252de0e72f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74a829e5ed98b84e80be5691dc96f71b96cd7f23bd045090eff2f32cb5bd3dce"}, "2": {"node_id": "235fcda3-6bb0-4bf6-b13c-5b25f4362aa1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e20378b3b2de7050b83e10a8e2001ccc068891e94bd99d50b8daa050e677cd6"}}, "hash": "ca8f3b918591aee17ec6cf53b7108a1d73e16fc905f5ea5bd57de67221af9472", "text": "For example, more than 40 percent of the government budget is provided through aid in Kiribati, Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Nauru.21 Increasingly there is a view that for those Pacific Island Countries lacking potential exports of goods and services and/or the abilities to earn significant remittances, aid is likely to be a long-term feature of their economies.22 Finally, it should be noted that many Pacific Island Countries have very large traditional economies\u2014which are frequently and variously referred to as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a771ee63-b3a0-4896-b4df-fe8aeb9009b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a771ee63-b3a0-4896-b4df-fe8aeb9009b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "864c9c73c19043ceb3107838898ab467c26a321906bd81aebf584d5757394f1f"}, "3": {"node_id": "8c816436-77eb-46c0-baf4-3964e15687b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e1990169b76de00d6597bf2f4fe02ea391bda07720b42b717a3e1a36f035d11"}}, "hash": "ca484f7a217c8cd597e1a8abc786f1c70923fab7f9eeccad1b74286f683002fe", "text": "the informal sector, the non-monetised sector, or the subsistence sector. Traditional economies revolve around food gardens and small-scale cash cropping, and have proved to be an extraordinarily resilient source of livelihood and food security in the Pacific Islands region. While urbanisation is a growing trend, most Pacific islanders\u2014 particularly in larger Melanesian states\u2014live in rural and remote areas and rely on localised economies for much of their needs. Production is characterised by village-level farmers who grow and distribute a large quantity and varied range of fresh vegetables, root crops, nuts and fruits.23 Because this produce is often shared through cultural systems of exchange, much of this economic activity is not monetised. Indeed Pacific Island Countries have among the lowest rates of monetisation on earth with a regional average of just over 50 percent of GDP.24 Particularly in the Melanesian states of Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, the vast majority of people are not engaged in formal employment. While the traditional economy is an often under-counted strength of Pacific island societies, some argue the relative \u201csubsistence affluence\u201d enjoyed by Pacific islanders can \u201cact as a disincentive for local people to make trade-offs required for economic growth.\u201d25 c.\ufffd Key\ufffdtrade\ufffdpolicy\ufffdconsiderations\ufffdfor\ufffdPacific\ufffdIsland\ufffdCountries Pacific Island Countries are some of the youngest nations on Earth, having achieved independence from colonial powers only in recent decades (except for Tonga, which was never colonized).26 For much of the post-colonial period, the countries have had preferential access to developed country markets particularly in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the United Sates of America. A number of key exports, including fish, tropical crops, canned tuna, and clothing and textiles, have relied heavily on preferences provided by the 1975 Lom\u00e9 Convention (and annexed Sugar Protocol) with the EU, and the 1980 South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA) with Australia and New Zealand. 7 Changes in the global economy in the mid-1990s\u2014especially the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations and the establishment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)\u2014had significant consequences for trading opportunities in the Pacific Island Countries. Crucially, the move towards global free trade served to undermine the value of existing preferential market access arrangements, in turn exposing inherent competitive disadvantages faced by producers located in the Pacific.27 It had been suggested global trade liberalisation would offer benefits to all developing states; however, closer analysis indicated Pacific Island Countries were at risk of losing out and would face unique difficulties taking advantage of new opportunities.28 While globalisation was high on the agenda in the mid-1990s, so too was regionalism: the EU was developing a common market, a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was concluded, and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) states agreed to move toward free trade among themselves. In this context, regional integration was seen by Pacific policy-makers as a suitable response to changes in the global trade regime.29 Three Melanesian states led the way with the conclusion of a Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) Trade Agreement in 1993. Then, in 1997, a Pacific regional trade agreement was proposed among the island states. However, the two developed country members of the South Pacific Forum, Australia and New Zealand, insisted on being included in processes of regional integration. In 2001, two separate trade agreements were negotiated, namely the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA) and the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER). The former provided for the liberalisation of trade in goods among the island states, while the latter provided for the possible future negotiation of a free trade agreement with Australia and New Zealand. In addition to a general trend toward regionalism, changes in the global trade regime provided an impetus for Pacific regional trade agreements in a more direct sense as well. Following the establishment of the WTO, preferential access to European markets was increasingly deemed to be inconsistent with the EU\u2019s obligations to WTO members. Policy- makers in Brussels proposed that trade preferences contained in the Lom\u00e9 Convention should be replaced with a reciprocal regional trade agreement, thereby bringing the trading relationship in line with WTO obligations. The 2000 Cotonou Agreement provided for the negotiation of a regional Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between Pacific island countries and the EU. By early in the new millennium, the trade policies of Pacific Island Countries were circumscribed by an increasingly complex array of trade arrangements (see Table 1 below).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c816436-77eb-46c0-baf4-3964e15687b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c816436-77eb-46c0-baf4-3964e15687b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "864c9c73c19043ceb3107838898ab467c26a321906bd81aebf584d5757394f1f"}, "2": {"node_id": "a771ee63-b3a0-4896-b4df-fe8aeb9009b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca484f7a217c8cd597e1a8abc786f1c70923fab7f9eeccad1b74286f683002fe"}}, "hash": "1e1990169b76de00d6597bf2f4fe02ea391bda07720b42b717a3e1a36f035d11", "text": "Many of the countries were considering joining the WTO (only three Pacific Island Countries were founding members), and looked set to negotiate and implement free trade agreements among themselves and with the EU, Australia, New Zealand and USA.

The notion of \u2018comparative advantage\u2019 refers to that which can be produced with the lowest possible foregone benefits from not producing something else (i.e. the lowest possible opportunity costs). Broadly speaking, countries have a comparative advantage in goods and services that local firms can produce most efficiently given relative input costs. Neoclassical theory also suggests that free trade will help to restructure national economies. Over time productive resources will be moved to areas in which firms have a genuine comparative advantage. In turn, this should improve the efficiency of the domestic economy as a whole and increase export earnings. While neoclassical theory suggests maximum gains are to be had from liberalising domestic markets to foreign competition, it should be noted that prominent arguments have been made for retaining policy instruments needed to shelter domestic industry from external competition for a time, to help foster new and more dynamic sources of comparative advantage (see for example Stiglitz 2012, Greenwald and Stiglitz 2006). Furthermore, the historical record suggests virtually all developed states have used protectionism to achieve more dynamic sources of comparative advantage before moving towards free trade. When and how states should open their economies to foreign goods, services and capital remain keenly debated questions in contemporary economics. Early in the new millennium, economists interested in the unique vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States suggested trade liberalisation alone was unlikely to address the underlying structural factors limiting trade in most of these countries. They argued that in island countries the pursuit of comparative advantage was not enough: the cost disadvantages of production in small and remote economies were such that trade liberalisation would be insufficient to develop new economic activity (Winters and Martin 2004). Furthermore, a number of reports pointed to significant revenue losses if the island states concluded trade agreements with developed country partners (Nathan Associates 2007). In recent years, policy-makers from Pacific Island Countries have sought to convince key trading partners and the broader international community that innovative solutions would be needed if these countries were to benefit from regional and global trade integration. Allied with other states in the Caribbean, Pacific governments encouraged WTO members to recognise the trade-related challenges faced by small island states, a campaign which bore fruit in 2001 when WTO members formally agreed to establish a work programme for \u201csmall, vulnerable economies.\u201d30 However, no new official category of states with special safeguards or benefits has been created at the WTO, and small island countries are still required to abide by the same WTO obligations as all other developing countries. Subsequently Pacific Island Countries also sought to pursue unique \u2018FTA-Plus\u2019 arrangements in Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations with the EU, and more recently in PACER-Plus negotiations with Australia and New Zealand. Pacific governments proposed unique policies\u2014such as special labour mobility arrangements allowing Pacific islanders to work temporarily in developed-country markets and integrated aid-for-trade commitments\u2014arguing these would help countries take better advantage of international trade. However, it is not clear that these proposals have gained significant traction. Trade negotiations with the EU, Australia and New Zealand, remain an on-going process. 9 It is widely acknowledged that governments of many Pacific Island Countries face capacity deficits that limit their ability to effectively engage in highly complex international trade negotiations. With small trade departments and a relatively high staff turnover, the governments are typically marked by paucities of expertise regarding both regional and global market opportunities and the contemporary regulatory frameworks that govern multilateral trade. Given such paucities in all but the bigger island states, Pacific policy-makers are presented with a uniquely difficult task when determining their interests in international trade negotiations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1430e129-9569-4e94-832b-1acb0962b0d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1430e129-9569-4e94-832b-1acb0962b0d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "297f9e4805fdd82047b2b5ef184b4ee7429e6206d8a9b870e8a7633ee48e03c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "245af5b8-f319-4c90-9611-f8b7f800434b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49bbaf799c08e933090614223e3b30f81c7ce2460087f7683cdf1921f80bdfe3"}}, "hash": "99d1f74aec4f31245a0f95bfc74dd81b23f2caec80636526a00890d7ef705162", "text": "It is hardly surprising that when the governments considered participating in new PACER-Plus negotiations the then deputy secretary general of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, Peter Forau, argued bluntly that \u201cthe PICs do not have the capacity to negotiate for this agreement.\u201d31 Table\ufffd1:\ufffdA\ufffdcomplex\ufffdtrade\ufffdarchitecture:\ufffdTrade\ufffdagreements\ufffdin\ufffdPacific\ufffdIsland\ufffdCountries Trade agreement/s Member\ufffdStates\ufffd(date\ufffdratified) status coverage Multilateral WTO Fiji (1994), Papua New Guinea (1994), Solomon Islands (1994), Tonga (2007), Samoa (2012), Vanuatu (2012) Doha Round negotiations (launched in 2000) remain ongoing.

Human rights are recognized in international treaties and domestic laws; and, consequently, human rights obligations can be enforced through a variety of means, including domestic courts, national human rights institutions, and international mechanisms such as treaty bodies. Elimination of all forms of discrimination is at the core of a human rights-based approach to trade. States have an obligation to ensure both formal and substantive equality. For example, this includes ensuring that agreement do not formally discriminate against a specific groups in the population. It also recognizes that some marginalized groups might need specific attention to ensure that they can catch up with the rest of the population and that they are empowered to benefit equally from trade and development. In broad terms, the negotiation and implementation of trade and investment agreements have implications for the State\u2019s human rights obligations in the following manner: \u25aa states have an obligation to mobilise the maximum available resources in order to progressively realise economic,\ufffdsocial\ufffdand\ufffdcultural\ufffdrights,\ufffdincluding\ufffdthe\ufffdright\ufffdto\ufffdhealth\ufffdand\ufffdother\ufffdhealth-related\ufffdrights.32 Promoting free trade and investment is one option for governments in supporting economic development that can contribute to the realisation of human rights. However, free trade agreements also often have provisions that have profound effects on governments\u2019 existing sources of revenue\u2014which may jeopardise their ability to deliver social programmes. States must therefore be mindful of the short and long-term fiscal impacts of free trade agreements as they affect the resources available to fulfill human rights. 12 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS \u25aa states have an obligation for policy coherence.33 States should not view their human rights obligations in isolation, but rather as an integral part of the government\u2019s overall legal requirements and policy objectives. This means that States should ensure coherence between human rights and the laws and policies that support trade, investment, taxation and business enterprises. As economic development is a dynamic process, States should be very cautious not to limit their \u201cpolicy space\u201d for the future. In other words, they should resist provisions in trade agreements that could undermine the ability for the government to implement future measures to ensure human rights are protected and respected. \u25aa it is in the interest of states to conduct Human rights impact assessments (Hria) of trade and investment agreements.34 One practical and evidence-based manner for States to ensure policy coherence is to prepare human rights impact assessments of the trade and investment agreements that they conclude. As stated by the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food: \u201cHuman rights impact assessments can be an important tool for States in negotiating trade and investment agreements, particularly to ensure that they will not make demands or concessions that will make it more difficult for them, or for the other party or parties, to comply with their human rights obligations.\u201d35 Furthermore, human rights principles and considerations can be integrated into other impact assessment processes\u2014 such as for environmental, social and/or health impacts. Text Box 2: UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA) of Trade and Investment Agreements In 2011, the UN Guiding Principles on HRIA of Trade and Investment Agreements was presented to the UN Human Rights Council to provide methodological guidance to conduct such assessments*. While each State may decide on the methodology by which human rights impact assessments of trade and investment agreements will be prepared, a number of elements should be considered: (a) Making explicit reference to the normative content of human rights obligations; (b) Incorporating human rights indicators into the assessment; and (c) Ensuring that decisions on trade-offs are subject to adequate consultation (through a participatory, inclusive and transparent process), comport with the principles of equality and non-discrimination, and do not result in retrogression (Guiding Principle 5). States should use human rights impact assessments, which aid in identifying both the positive and negative impacts on human rights, including the right to health, of the trade or investment agreement, to ensure that the agreement contributes to the overall protection of human rights as well as health and societal well-bein.

In other words, where trade agreements stimulate or facilitate activity in a particular economic sector, the State should be aware of the typical impacts that business enterprises in that sector may have on human rights. The State should take appropriate steps to ensure that such changes in business activities do not result in infringements on the human rights of workers, communities and consumers. \u25aa states should ensure public consultation and debate prior to the conclusion of free trade agreements. 37 The right to take part in the conduct of public affairs implies that no trade or investment agreement should be concluded in the absence of a public debate. In principle, trade and investment agreements should be elaborated within a democratic process that provides opportunities for parliamentary approval, participation by stakeholders and access to information. Human rights impact assessments serve to inform such public debate. b.\ufffd Responsibilities\ufffdof\ufffdbusiness\ufffdenterprises\ufffdfor\ufffdhuman\ufffdrights With the endorsement of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011, there is a new global consensus about that all businesses, including multinational and domestic enterprises have the responsibility to respect human rights throughout their operations. Although States have the primary obligation to address the human rights impacts of trade liberalisation, trade agreements form an important backdrop and context for business enterprises to understand their human rights responsibilities given that provisions in these agreements have impacts on the development or decline of specific economic sectors. The responsibility to respect human rights applies to both the multinational enterprises and the domestic enterprises that will take advantage of and/or be impacted by changes to trade and investment rules in Pacific Island Countries. However, these international human rights principles are more likely to be understood and implemented by large multinational enterprises than by many of the smaller domestic enterprises that will be most affected by trade liberalisation in Pacific Island Countries. The main responsibilities of business enterprises include the following: \u25aa Business enterprises\u2019 responsibilities to respect human rights. 38 This means that they shall avoid infringing on the human rights of others and address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved\u2014including when they take advantage of trade and investment agreements. The responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights exists concurrently yet separately from States\u2019 abilities and/or willingness to fulfill their own human rights obligations, and does not diminish those obligations. And it exists beyond compliance with national laws protecting human rights. Addressing adverse human rights impacts requires taking adequate measures for their prevention, mitigation and, where appropriate, remediation. \u25aa Business enterprises should not undermine states\u2019 abilities to meet their own human rights obligations. 39 In the context of trade and investment agreements, this responsibility applies to the process of negotiating and lobbying for certain types of provisions, concessions and/or exemptions, as well as by actions that might weaken the integrity or effectiveness of mechanisms that protect human rights and provide access to remedies. 14 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS c.\ufffd Improving\ufffdaccess\ufffdto\ufffdremedies\ufffd Human rights and obligations demand accountability. This implies that decision makers ought to be transparent about their actions and justify their choices and that redress mechanisms should be established. States should promote better access to remedies for individuals, workers and communities who believe their rights have been infringed, and business enterprises are also encouraged to promote access to remedies\u2014particularly through operational-level grievance mechanisms. In the context of trade and investment agreements, this raises issues related to the dispute mechanisms that are included in the agreements themselves\u2014and whether they are accessible and transparent for affected stakeholders and not just foreign investors. It also involves strengthening the domestic judicial and non-judicial mechanisms that provide persons with access to justice, including through the courts, labour tribunals and national human rights institutions. Furthermore, at the operational level, business enterprises are encouraged to establish site-level grievance mechanisms that allow affected workers and communities a direct channel to deal with complaints through dialogue with the company. In Pacific Island Countries, there are many challenges for States to provide access to remedies. This includes the task for States themselves to respond to investors\u2019 challenges raised through the dispute resolution mechanisms in trade", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42142041-8208-4b65-9867-d377db60494f": {"__data__": {"id_": "42142041-8208-4b65-9867-d377db60494f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88db9c26d15396e0ec546b18814d941b5d529d9fd30dc2b54b340ce9319258af"}}, "hash": "88db9c26d15396e0ec546b18814d941b5d529d9fd30dc2b54b340ce9319258af", "text": "and investment agreements in a manner that protects the rights of persons under their jurisdictions. There are imbalances in capacity and resources between the governments of Pacific Island Countries and many of their global trading partners, as well as the multinational enterprises whose activities may have adverse impacts on human rights. Another key issue with respect to access to remedies at the domestic level relates to the capacity of various actors to establish and/or use formal mechanisms for dispute resolution\u2014especially in a context where there are strong traditional or informal mechanisms to address issues. It is therefore important for any proposals for strengthening access to remedies to be carefully tailored to the local realities and serve to improve effective access for the local population as well as foreign investors. d.\ufffd Key\ufffdhuman\ufffdrights\ufffdissues\ufffdin\ufffdrelation\ufffdto\ufffdtrade The full range of international human rights can be linked to trade.

Table\ufffd2:\ufffdPotential\ufffdTrade-Related\ufffdImpacts\ufffdon\ufffdHuman\ufffdRights Economic, social and cultural rights Increases in revenues from trade provide governments with the resources to progressively realise the full spectrum of economic, social and cultural rights. Trade can facilitate or create barriers for access to essential medicines, which is a central element of the right to health. The privatisation of public services, often linked with trade liberalisation, can have impacts on the enjoyment of the human rights to health, education, water and sanitation. Changes to tariffs on agricultural products can have impacts on the right to food. Reduction of import tariffs as part of regional trade negotiations impact countries ability to collect revenue and support basic social service such as health care. It does also affect countries ability to implement fiscal measures to limit import of food products high in fat, sugar and salt. 15 Civil and political rights The ability of persons to participate in informed public debate and decision-making about trade policy depends on the right to participate in public affairs (in particular in matters that affect them), freedom of expression and freedom of association. The right to access to remedies implies that individuals and communities have the ability to effectively raise concerns about the impacts of trade agreements through judicial and non-judicial mechanisms at the domestic and international levels. Women\u2019s human rights Trade agreements raise particular concerns for women, who are affected differently by trade policies. Many women confront sexual violence, lack of security, credit and education as factors impeding their access to markets. Women\u2019s work in the global market \u2013 particularly migrant women\u2019s labour \u2013 tends to be concentrated in informal sectors which expose them to a heightened risk of abuse, including low wages, long hours and uncertainty of tenure. Labour rights Trade agreements have impacts on different economic sectors, which filter down to individual business enterprises and their workers. Potential increases or decreases in the availability of jobs have impacts on the right to work. The availability of better quality jobs should fulfill the rights to safe, healthy, just and favourable conditions of work. However, competitive pressures can put these labour rights at risk, and affect the right to organise and to bargain collectively. Indigenous peoples rights Increased investment and trade can encourage development on the traditional lands and territories of indigenous peoples. This raises issues related to whether there are adequate domestic processes to ensure the right of indigenous peoples to free, prior and informed consent, on-going consultation and participation in the benefits of these developments. Extractive industry projects increasingly take place on indigenous peoples lands and are facilitated by trade agreements. These large-scale projects present opportunities for significant benefits to indigenous peoples through jobs, contracts, taxes and royalties. However, they also present risks to a broad spectrum of indigenous peoples rights related to non-discrimination at work, community development, cultural survival and preservation of the environment. Rights of minorities and vulnerable groups Non-discrimination is a cross-cutting human rights issue: all human rights must be implemented in a manner that does not discriminate on the basis of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, economic status, property, birth or other status. Notably, other status is increasingly being defined to include health status, strengthening the legal framework for protection again discrimination on the basis of health status. Concretely, this means that the must be special attention to the potential impacts of trade on children, national, ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities, migrant workers, persons with disabilities, lesbian gay bisexual and transgendered persons (LGBT), older persons and other vulnerable groups. Some of these groups are protected by additional international human rights provisions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4100d6f6-0f57-47c7-97b1-3a28aaee40d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "4100d6f6-0f57-47c7-97b1-3a28aaee40d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e87c07a58c4ca5bddc5f27355a74fe8ea97c0c935ec4a5b8df2f563bbfda420b"}}, "hash": "e87c07a58c4ca5bddc5f27355a74fe8ea97c0c935ec4a5b8df2f563bbfda420b", "text": "16 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS e.\ufffd Key\ufffdhuman\ufffdrights\ufffdinstruments\ufffdand\ufffdreferences When referring to human rights, this report is focused primarily on the international human rights standards that apply to Pacific Island Countries.

In Pacific Island Countries, however, there currently are some significant challenges for the implementation of international human rights standards. There continues to be a lack of ratification and implementation of key international human rights instruments by many Pacific Island Countries. In particular, more formal recognition through becoming State Parties of key UN human rights treaties such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is needed in order to advance the understanding and institutional foundations for linking human rights, trade and development. On the ground, the impact of poverty has a profound effect on the realisation of human rights. Poverty deprives people of basic human needs and opportunities. It constrains the ability of individuals to take advantage of jobs and business opportunities; and, it limits the choices individuals may have as consumers. As discussed above, poverty also limits the capacity of governments to negotiate advantageous trade provisions and/or implement adequate remedial measures. Therefore, efforts to combat poverty and to promote human rights should go hand in hand. 18 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 4. illustrative case studies This report has presented some of the conceptual, normative and legal implications of the nexus between trade and human rights. This section aims to supplement this discussion by examining four case studies that illustrate the links between human rights and trade in the context of Pacific Island Countries. These illustrative case studies also serve to highlight how a human rights focus can help avoid adverse impacts, promote inclusive processes, and support positive outcomes for affected stakeholders. a.\ufffd Structural\ufffdreform\ufffdresulting\ufffdfrom\ufffdtrade\ufffdliberalisation:\ufffdWinners\ufffdand\ufffdlosers\ufffd in\ufffdthe\ufffdPacific? introduction This case study provides an overview of the linkages between trade policy changes in the Pacific (often associated with obligations in international trade agreements), the resulting structural changes in Pacific island economies, and the realisation of human rights. In particular, over recent decades, economists and trade policy advisors have encouraged Pacific governments to cut tariff rates and remove other barriers to trade and investment. Reducing tariffs has led to cheaper prices for many consumer goods \u2013including food (processed foods in particular). Furthermore opening service sectors to foreign competition has sometimes led to increased competition and better service provision. For instance, this has been the case with telecommunications, as new market players (including in Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu) have improved the affordability and uptake of mobile phone and Internet technology, with flow on benefits across society.41 Trade liberalisation has often led to structural reform as Pacific economies have adjusted to new price signals and international competition. These reforms have had, and will continue to have, both positive and negative implications for the realisation of human rights. In general, more efficient production should in the medium to long term encourage economic growth, helping to create new jobs and improve incomes. Cheaper goods should also leave more money in people\u2019s pockets. Both increased employment and greater incomes help to realise the right to work and the right to an adequate standard of living for workers and their families. However, trade liberalisation can also entail changes to the economy that undermine the realisation of human rights\u2014at least for some. The effects of structural reform are not evenly spread across society, as some people benefit others may lose out. In cases where domestic firms or producers cannot compete with firms based in larger island states or larger countries outside the region, they are likely to face losses \u2013 such as a fall in profit, a decline in production, or a reduction in staff numbers. Some businesses may close down altogether, as the following examples from the Pacific illustrate. Nexus\ufffdbetween\ufffdhuman\ufffdrights\ufffdand\ufffdstructural\ufffdreform:\ufffdPacific\ufffdexamples Trade liberalisation among Pacific Island Countries has seen more efficient businesses, generally in larger island countries, displace producers in smaller states \u2013 leading to business closures and job losses. Here it is worth considering some recent examples: \u25aa In 2006 a small biscuit manufacturer based on the island of Santo, in Vanuatu, closed down after competition from a larger firm based in Fiji undercut local sales. Vanuatu had committed to reduce tariffs on imports from its island neighbours under both the Melanesian Spearhead Group Free Trade Agreement (MSG-FTA) and under the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). 19 \u25aa More recently, in late 2012, a beverage manufacturer in Vanuatu ceased production of a line of soft drinks citing trade policy changes and increased competition from exports of a subsidiary of a global soft-drink firm based in Fiji. This change", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44dfa128-2128-40be-9658-3f842add49c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "44dfa128-2128-40be-9658-3f842add49c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52cd4973d6d65195760b36058da90ea8da53b5b4b7f8d7d544ef6a73b8ab12af"}}, "hash": "52cd4973d6d65195760b36058da90ea8da53b5b4b7f8d7d544ef6a73b8ab12af", "text": "saw the termination of 42 local staff and furthermore undermined income to bottle-collectors who had recycled the glass bottles of the local soft drink. Trade liberalisation may not be only the reason that these two businesses had to close, as any business closure is subject to a number of factors. Nonetheless, in both of these examples small firms producing for a small domestic market lost out when that market was opened to more efficient foreign firms. While the resulting job losses may seem tiny, they are significant in the context of a very small formal sector in many Pacific Island Countries. For example, in Vanuatu, a country with a population of around 250,000 people, less than 15 percent of the population is in wage employment. Limited structural reform arising from regional trade liberalisation among the Pacific Island Countries has seen the closure of less efficient businesses, generally in the smaller island states. Key beneficiaries of such reform have been firms based in the larger economies of Fiji and Papua New Guinea; however, even these firms are likely to face difficulties competing with more efficient producers from outside the region if trade liberalisation is extended to include larger trading partners such as Australia and New Zealand.42 state responsibilities and policy insights While debate continues about the costs and benefits associated with trade liberalisation all sides agree that there are likely to be some \u2018losers\u2019 in a move to freer trade in the Pacific Island Countries. Furthermore it is understood that the \u2018losers\u2019 may already be poor, or may be pushed into poverty.43 For vulnerable people who lose their source of employment \u2013 even for a short period of time \u2013 trade liberalisation can have significant negative impacts on the right to work, right to an adequate standard of living, the right to health and other related human rights. Furthermore, the redistributive effects of trade liberalisation in the Pacific are realised across borders. Even where trade liberalisation has led to overall economic growth for the region, the primary benefits have tended to accrue to larger firms in more developed island states (though islanders in smaller states also have access to cheaper imports). Policy-makers therefore should take steps to mitigate potential negative impacts of future regional liberalisation for the most vulnerable in smaller island states. As noted above, Pacific governments have obligations under international law to protect, respect and fulfil human rights. Even where the net effects of structural reform may be desirable, Pacific island governments must consider measures to avoid the negative impacts for all workers and communities. Such an approach \u201cshifts the perspective from aggregate values \u2013 from the benefits of trade for the country as a whole \u2013 to the impacts of trade-related structural reform on the most vulnerable and insecure.\u201d44 In wealthy countries, it is often proposed that consideration be given to special support to workers negatively affected by reform \u2013 including temporary subsidies and retraining programs to help access work in new sectors. Such programs may promote the right to work, and the right to education. Furthermore, wealthy countries often have schemes for social security, including unemployment insurance plans, which give effect to the right to social security. Many Pacific Island Countries however lack the resources to provide formal social welfare systems and vocational programs for job re-training, and the unemployed typically fall back on family and subsistence gardening. Policy-makers should give consideration to transitional time periods for the implementation of reform, allowing the possibility for domestic firms to better manage the pace of change or diversify into more competitive enterprise. 20 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS b.\ufffd Tariff\ufffdreform\ufffdand\ufffdgovernment\ufffdrevenue:\ufffdFiscal\ufffdsqueeze? introduction This case study considers the potential human rights impacts of changes to national tax regimes when governments of Pacific Island Countries reduce or remove import taxes. Pursuing trade liberalisation generally involves fiscal reform. Since border taxes are reduced or removed in order to encourage increased trade, governments face the prospect of declining revenues\u2014at least in the short term.45 Compared with other developing countries, Pacific governments remain particularly reliant on trade taxes, with tariffs accounting for more than 10 percent of government revenue in most Pacific Island Countries. This is partly because these countries are uniquely import-dependent and have relied on import taxes as a relatively easy-to-collect source of revenue. For smaller island nations like Kiribati and Tuvalu import duties form more than half of government revenue.46 In recent years, Pacific island governments have been advised to replace trade taxes with domestic excise tax and/or a consumption tax, typically a Value-Added Tax (VAT). However, new domestic taxes offset at least some of the consumer gains arising from", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13cc9ef7-73e3-4c03-adf2-136dd4e782ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "13cc9ef7-73e3-4c03-adf2-136dd4e782ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d6af3d48ee75831bc9b3439b5e87aa71ccccfab09711a579429f38c73946d10"}, "3": {"node_id": "4248e84c-90a0-4dcc-898b-f53669cec22f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5aaaaeed8892a574905ba20d603efcfa5b1a67bb14eceec369e784796bae33fd"}}, "hash": "c7c019062a996dcbb1db8583fb9331604b74dddec68287b7648f067167e7b789", "text": "trade liberalisation. Research indicates that if a small Pacific Island Country with relatively little domestic production replaces a 15 percent tariff on a wide range of goods with a 15 percent VAT, the net effect for consumers is relatively small.47 at the same time, there are also significant administrative costs associated with switching from trade taxes to a greater reliance on domestic taxes. Furthermore some observers posit that pursuing liberalisation is unlikely to encourage market efficiencies in smaller island states, where regulatory factors are not a crucial determinant of pricing or economic activity.48 In these cases \u201ctrade liberalisation simply raises administrative costs as Ministries of Finance search for ways to replace tax revenue.\u201d49 Comparative studies suggest that other developing countries have found it difficult to replace trade taxes with revenue from domestic sources. Around the world, a number of countries have taken decades to recover revenue following trade liberalisation or have not fully recovered at all: \u25aa Guatemala implemented tariff reforms in the late 1970s which precipitated a decline in total tax revenue. It took over 25 years (until 2002) for Guatemala\u2019s tax revenue to recover from these reforms (see graph on following page).50 \u25aa Other developing countries which have struggled to replace lost tariff revenue include Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Egypt, Gambia, Kenya, Morocco, Niger, Sri Lanka and Tunisia.51 A 2012 analysis of the fiscal consequences of trade liberalisation explored 110 \u2018episodes\u2019 of decreases in tariff revenue across 86 countries between 1945 and 2006. It found that decreases in tariff revenue corresponded on average with a 20 percent fall in total tax revenues. The magnitude of revenue decreases ranged between 4 percent of total revenues (Tunisia 1983) and 60 percent (Gambia in 1985). The same study also explored the ability of developing countries to recover lost revenue; it found that 45 percent of all countries did not fully recover lost tariff revenues within a decade.52 \u25aa A 2005 study prepared for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which looked at tariff reform across 111 countries over 25 years, found that: \u201crevenue recovery has been extremely weak in low income countries which are those most dependent on trade tax revenues; they have recovered, at best, no more than about 30 cents of each dollar lost; and, there is not much evidence that the presence of a value-added tax has in itself made it easier to cope with the effects of trade liberalisation.\u201953 21 The economics literature suggests a number of reasons for a poor replacement of tariff revenue in low income developing countries, including weak tax administrations and the presence of a large informal sector. Both of these conditions are prevalent in Pacific Island Countries.54 This is not to suggest that trade liberalisation will automatically lead to revenue losses, especially if reform is accompanied by appropriate reforms to domestic taxation. There may for example be opportunities to generate greater revenue by introducing or increasing so-called \u2018sin taxes\u2019. Levied on harmful products, like tobacco, such measures could be significant for overall revenues.55 Nevertheless the historical experience does suggest Pacific Island governments should exercise caution when implementing trade reform that may undermine their existing revenue base.

During the 2008/09 and 2009/10 financial years tax revenues were \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than they had been in the lead up to 2008 \u2013 by some 20-25 percent in nominal terms.60 Uniquely exposed to the effects of the global financial crisis, the Tongan economy slowed significantly, trade volumes declined and the tax base contracted. As the World Bank explained in 2010: This fall-off in tax revenues was led by import tariffs, the excise tax and the consumption tax. Given the high import component of consumption in Tonga, the tax bases for each of these streams \u2013 not only tariffs \u2013 are determined primarily by imports. With imports, in turn, dependent on remittances, the sharp decline in remittances caused by the global downturn translated into sharp declines in tax revenues. The contribution of Tonga\u2019s newly liberalised tariff regime to stable aggregate tax revenues, however, had been calibrated on the basis of continued increases in imports, which the global downturn has impeded.61 While it had been hoped that joining the WTO would improve Tonga\u2019s economic prospects, accession coincided with the onset of a global economic downturn that hit the Tongan economy hard and undermined the country\u2019s revenue base. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to disaggregate the fiscal implications of Tonga\u2019s trade policy reform from the impacts of the slow-down in the domestic economy more broadly. While it can be said that Tonga has failed to recover government revenue to levels present before implementing tariff cuts associated with joining the WTO, it cannot be said conclusively that this failure to recover revenue was a result of Tonga\u2019s WTO accession process. 23 Nevertheless Tonga\u2019s experience\u2014and the experience of other developing states that have faced difficulties replacing tariff revenue\u2014suggests Pacific Island Countries should exercise caution when committing to trade reform that may have implications for government revenue. state responsibilities and policy implications National governments are key duty bearers with regard to the realisation of human rights, and taxation is important if governments are to protect, respect and fulfil human rights. Indeed, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Article 2) stipulates that States must make use of their maximum available resources to realise economic, social and cultural rights \u2013 including through domestic taxation. Since government revenue is essential for the provision of public goods and services that are essential to the realisation of human rights \u2013 such as the right to health and the right to education \u2013 consideration must be given to managing or mitigating revenue losses associated with tariff reform. Any sudden revenue loss could undermine the ability of Pacific governments to realise human rights and can have severe political, economic and social consequences. For Pacific island governments considering trade liberalisation through regional trade agreements, the fiscal implications of removing tariffs are not negligible. A number of recent studies predict revenue losses associated with trade liberalisation.62 For example, a 2007 report for the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat estimated that after implementing the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA), an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union (EU) and a PACER-Plus agreement with Australia and New Zealand, a number of countries would lose more than 20 percent of their revenue (Vanuatu, Tonga, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands) and others would face significant losses as well, such as Kiribati (19 percent), Samoa (16 percent) and Tuvalu (14 percent).63 It is important that governments consider ways to mitigate these potential revenue losses and/or maintain the policy space needed to levy import taxes for revenue purposes. Pursuing strategic trade liberalisation should help Pacific Island governments to reduce domestic prices, both for inputs for production and for consumer goods. However because many Pacific economies are reliant on trade taxes for revenue, which is in turn important for providing services essential for the realisation of human rights, it is crucial that trade liberalisation is accompanied by fiscal reform intended to maintain government revenue. Because many developing countries require up to a decade (or even longer) to recover revenue losses associated with trade liberalisation, tariff reductions in Pacific Island Countries should be implemented over time and sequenced", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d824c300-e1b6-4483-b8b1-a66724933729": {"__data__": {"id_": "d824c300-e1b6-4483-b8b1-a66724933729", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fdb598e3937b8ff890580978cf45b9a5aa6e4c0cabf15f6f6209d617e861fd0"}, "3": {"node_id": "7e14bd75-24f8-4289-80c6-04307fcefb69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7d1fa48d1a0c99de13115fa723e60682a9f6714379ead62096b978117477f0b"}}, "hash": "7017547046c1a5eb2ceebd529165f935a419836cf6f2e4d7f60f9c6825afb0f7", "text": "appropriately. There is a dearth of information regarding the success (or lack thereof) of fiscal reform associated with recent trade liberalisation in the Pacific Islands region. The experience of Tonga\u2019s WTO accession, explored above, highlights the difficulties involved in drawing definitive conclusions about the fiscal impacts of trade liberalisation in the Pacific. While uncertainty remains about the ability of small island states to efficiently and sufficiently replace tariff revenue with broader domestic sources of taxation, and given that low income countries have in the past faced difficulties replacing trade tax revenue with domestic sources of taxation, Pacific Island governments should exercise a precautionary principle when making liberalisation commitments in trade negotiations. Pursuing strategic liberalisation on a unilateral basis would allow Pacific Island Countries to re-introduce duties for revenue purposes if required. However, in the context of international negotiations, trade officials should consider maintaining the policy space needed to levy import taxes for revenue purposes. This can be done by avoiding onerous commitments altogether or by negotiating safeguard clauses. For example the interim Economic Partnership Agreement negotiated in 2007 between the EU and Fiji and Papua New Guinea, contains a safeguard clause specifying that when one of these Pacific countries is threatened with a serious decline in its fiscal position, it may increase tariffs for a set period to remedy adverse fiscal consequences.64 24 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS Finally, Pacific policymakers searching for a replacement for trade tax revenue should be aware that an across-the-board consumption tax can have regressive effects \u2013 by disproportionately shifting the burden of taxation to those already in poverty. Both the wealthy and the poor need to consume basic goods and services, but consumption taxes on essential items make up a greater proportion of the income of poorer people. Regressive taxation measures have been a recent focus of attention for the UN Independent Expert on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights. A 2011 report highlighted that States should be cognisant of their obligations to implement policies in accordance with principles of non-discrimination and equality: ...in this context, the introduction of or an increase in regressive sales taxes or value added taxes may have a disproportionate impact on those who are already experiencing financial difficulties.65 Where a consumption tax is implemented to replace trade taxes, Pacific policy-makers should consider exempting or \u2018zero-rating\u2019 basic foods and other items that are essential to the realisation of human rights (such as water, electricity, and health and education materials) and/or by providing subsidies and credits for poor and vulnerable individuals. c.\ufffd Trade\ufffdpolicy,\ufffdnutrition\ufffdand\ufffdhealth:\ufffdbans\ufffdand\ufffdtaxes\ufffdon\ufffdsugar\ufffdand\ufffdfat? introduction This case study explores links between trade liberalisation, nutrition and public health in select Pacific Island Countries. Over recent decades, all countries in the region have experienced a \u201cnutrition transition\u201d associated with a shift from consuming local and traditional staples (root crops, select leaves, fish and occasional meat) to increased consumption of imported and processed food and beverages (rice, bleached flour, tinned fish and meats). Changing trends in food production and consumption in low-income countries worldwide have seen national diets become increasingly \u201chigh in fat, sugar and salt, with consequent rises in associated chronic diseases.\u201d66 As a result, Pacific Island Countries have among the highest rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the world. Cheaper but unhealthier imported foods have contributed significantly to this disease burden. Heart disease and diabetes in particular are linked with increased consumption of processed foods high in salt, sugar and fat; such as canned meat products, instant noodles, and sugar sweetened beverages. Pacific Island governments have considered a range of policy measures intended to reduce the uptake of less healthy imported foods, and promote greater consumption of healthier local produce.67 Intersections\ufffdof\ufffdtrade\ufffdliberalisation,\ufffdthe\ufffdright\ufffdto\ufffdhealth\ufffdand\ufffdother\ufffdhealth-related\ufffdrights:\ufffdSelect\ufffdPacific\ufffdexamples International trade in food and beverages has important implications for the health of Pacific islanders.

Two key initiatives are discussed below. 25 Bans on the import and sale of fatty meats in Fiji, Samoa and Tonga Imported high fat content meats, such as corned beef, mutton flaps and turkey tails have had a direct causal impact on rising rates of NCDs in Pacific Island Countries.69 In recent years, with varying degrees of success, bans on fatty meat products have been introduced in Fiji and Samoa, and were considered in Tonga, in an attempt to curb this trend. The compliance of these bans with commitments made in international trade agreements has been called into question. Each case is considered here briefly. Fiji introduced a ban on the sale of mutton flaps70 in 2000, accompanied by a consumer awareness campaign explaining the health risks associated with fatty meat consumption. Technically this was not a ban on imports and did not contravene Fiji\u2019s commitments at the WTO, as the measure was non-discriminatory and applied only at the point of sale. However up to that point in time, Fiji had imported more than 200 tonnes of mutton flaps each year from New Zealand so the measure had an impact for meat exporters in that country.71 A 2007 report from the New Zealand government explained that Fiji\u2019s action \u201ceffectively amounted to an import ban.\u201d72 The New Zealand government \u201cconsidered action against the ban under the WTO,\u201d but this action did not eventuate.73 In Samoa, a ban on the import of turkey tails (an off-cut meat sourced primarily from the United States) was introduced in 2007. The ban was introduced after Samoa\u2019s Ministry of Health raised concerns about the high-fat content of turkey tails (40-45%) and links between fat intake and non-communicable diseases.74 Just before the ban was introduced, turkey tail imports totalled about 4,000 tons (>20kg/person). As part of Samoa\u2019s WTO accession process a United States trade representative questioned the ban.75 Furthermore, concerns were expressed about the \u201cprohibition of a single food item in order to address a large and complex problem of obesity.\u201d76 In 2011, a working party of WTO members adopted Samoa\u2019s accession package with the condition that the ban be removed. The ban would be replaced with an import duty levelled initially at 300 percent, to be phased down to 100 percent or replaced by another tax regulation. Tonga considered measures similar to those used in Fiji in order to reduce consumption of mutton flaps. In 2004, legislation was drafted to apply an import quota for meat products containing a high fat content. This measure was drafted following work by the World Health Organization and other public health experts exploring the link between high-fat meat and obesity in Tonga.77 However the draft act as well as accompanying proposals for policy implementation and monitoring \u2013 were shelved when Tongan trade officials became concerned the measures could have implications for Tonga\u2019s WTO accession process. As Australia and New Zealand are the main sources of mutton flaps into Tonga, officials were concerned they would need to renegotiate their accession package with Australian and New Zealand officials if the proposed measures restricted imports from those two countries. Each of the above examples suggests measures intended to restrict the importation of high-fat meats could conflict with commitments made by Pacific Island Countries at the WTO. Multilateral trade rules require that measures intended to protect human health should be scientifically justified, non-discriminatory (i.e. apply to all like products and to both domestic and external producers), and be the \u2018least trade restrictive\u2019 options available. For Pacific governments, measures intended to reduce the consumption of imported high-fat meats that also fit all criteria are likely to be more complex, expensive and administratively burdensome (and probably less effective) than a simple ban on import or sales.78 Taxation for health in the Pacific? It is well established that the price of food and beverages can be a significant determinant of consumption levels in the Pacific Island region, particularly for low income populations79 . Although as mentioned above, broadening the tax sources is not without challenges; taxation whether through import duties or excise taxes can be used by policymakers to reduce the consumption of less healthy foods as taxes impact significantly on the price of food and drink. By raising taxes on less healthy products Pacific governments can reduce the consumption of those products and collect revenue that can be directed toward preventative health programs. 26 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS Commitments made in international trade agreements can restrict the ability of Pacific governments to increase or levy import duties on unhealthy foods.

However, the countries can introduce excise taxes, which apply to both domestic and imported products, because these taxes do not differentiate between local and traded goods. Over the past decade a number of Pacific Island Countries have introduced taxes unhealthy goods including soft drinks and other high-sugar products, alcohol, tobacco products and even some saturated fats. The negative health effects cigarettes are widely known, as are those associated with excess consumption of alcohol and fatty foods. There is also mounting evidence that increased intake of sugar is linked with a higher incidence of obesity. Five Pacific examples of taxation to improve health are briefly reviewed below.80 \u25aa In 2013 Tonga introduced new duty and excise tax rates \u2018to encourage healthy living\u2019.81 Existing excises on cigarettes and tobacco were introduced, while import duties on soft drinks and lard/dripping were converted to excise rates (levied at $1 per litre and $1 per kg respectively). In addition to increasing tax rates on less healthy foods, Tonga also reduced import duties on foods considered to be healthier than similar alternatives, including fresh fish and vegetable oil. \u25aa In Samoa soft drink taxes have been levied since 1984. These taxes were rationalised in 2007 and raised in 2008 as part of the country\u2019s shift from tariffs to domestic excise taxes and a goods and services tax. \u25aa Nauru introduced a \u2018sugar levy\u2019 in 2007 of 30 percent for the specific purpose of discouraging excessive consumption of sugar. The tax is applied to imported sugar, confectionary, carbonated soft drinks, cordials, flavoured milks and drink mixes.82 \u25aa Fiji introduced a soft drink tax in 2000. Initially charged on both domestic and imported soft drinks, this was soon changed to a tax on imports alone. There are several big soft drink producers in Fiji, so it is not clear what impact an import tax has on domestic soft drink consumption. \u25aa The government of French Polynesia introduced domestic taxes in 2002 on a wide range of products, including soft drinks, alcohol, chocolate and ice cream.83 These taxes were used to pay for obesity prevention measures. A fund, called Establissement pour la prevention (EPAP), was established and used for public health purposes, including health education, preventative training, clinical education and research. A similar arrangement also exists in New Caledonia. The Agence Sanitaire et Sociale de la Nouvelle Caledonie, created in 2001, allocates a share of revenues from domestic taxes on alcohol and tobacco to finance health facilities and programmes84. These five examples highlight that Pacific governments can introduce domestic taxes on less-healthy foods without creating undue complications with regard to commitments made in international trade agreements. state responsibilities and policy considerations The right to health is an important human right, and Pacific island governments are obliged to progressively realise the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Every country in the world has ratified at least one instrument that recognises the right to health. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights specifies explicitly that states should take steps toward the realisation of the right to health, including those necessary for \u201cthe prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases.\u201d This implies governments are obliged to take steps to mitigate the incidence of non-communicable diseases associated with an increased consumption of less healthy food and beverages. 27 With regard to trade, nutrition and public health there are at least three key areas of policy intervention for the realisation of the right to health in Pacific Island Countries. The first relates to the availability of less healthy imported foods, the second relates to the promotion of healthy domestic foods and the third relates to increased revenues for health promotion. Evidence suggests import bans for fatty meats may be effective as a consumer advocacy tool. However, bans may have limited effect with regard to the consumption of high-fat meat if the product can be readily replaced with other cheap high- fat meats.85 Implementing import controls that reduce the availability and consumption of high fat meat and comply with WTO rules is likely to be difficult. However import bans on a range of fatty meats could be implemented by Pacific Island Countries that are not WTO members or members of other bilateral and multilateral agreements.86 Taxation of sugary, fatty and salty products is one way to reduce the intake of less healthy foods and beverages as long as the tax is sufficiently high to effect behaviour change through price disincentive.

As shown by the examples of French Polynesia and New Caledonia, taxes on less healthy products can be directed towards national \u2018preventative\u2019 funds intended to promote healthy eating and active lifestyles. Samoa and Tonga are considering the establishment of \u201cHealth Promotion Foundations\u201d as well. In addition to domestic taxation, Pacific governments might also consider aligning tariff schedules with the healthfulness of foods \u201cto provide a price incentive for importation and consumption of healthier products.\u201d87 To do so would require that Pacific Island governments maintain the policy space needed to levy meaningful import taxes, by avoiding onerous commitments at the WTO and in regional trade negotiations. In 2012 Fiji increased the tariff rates for palm oil and monosodium glutamate (MSG) specifically as part of a strategy intended to reduce the incidence non-communicable diseases.88 At the same time the import duty for fruits and vegetables that cannot be grown in Fiji was reduced. Pacific Island Countries might also consider excise taxes on less healthy foods as an alternative to border tariffs and adjust the level of these taxes to the content of sugar, sodium, fat in the food products under consideration. As well as attempting to limit the import or production of less healthy foods, Pacific governments should consider policy aimed at supporting domestic production of healthy food where possible. In most Pacific Island Countries \u2013 especially the more populous Melanesian countries \u2013 \u201cvillage-level\u201d farmers grow and distribute a large quantity and varied range of fresh vegetables, root crops, nuts and fruits. Access to these foods is essential for food security and an important part of maintaining healthy diets. Ultimately support to domestic production of healthy foods is a key part of realising the right to health. Pacific governments should maintain the policy space needed to provide support to domestic agricultural producers. Production of tropical fruits and vegetables is also an area of comparative advantage for Pacific Island Countries. Trade policy should be oriented to exploiting opportunities for local produce in local and international markets, as this would create new employment and sources of income and improve domestic food production. Typically, \u201ctrade-related investment in technologies and infrastructure that reduce post-harvest losses is also likely to improve food availability in local markets.\u201d89 While increasing exports is an important goal, regional trade agreements (and commitments at the WTO) in general are of limited benefit for promoting Pacific food production.90 Issues such as guaranteeing consistent supply, reducing transport costs, meeting quarantine and labelling requirements, and providing appropriate marketing are far more important than for growing new exports than binding import tariffs at low rates. It is also important that trading partners work actively with Pacific Island governments to ameliorate quarantine issues, and a range of other non-tariff barriers that restrict agricultural exports from the Pacific. 28 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS d.\ufffd Trade\ufffdagreements,\ufffdintellectual\ufffdproperty\ufffdrules\ufffdand\ufffdtraditional\ufffdknowledge\ufffd introduction This case study on Vanuatu highlights the human rights dimension of the connection between trade agreements, intellectual property rights (IPR) and traditional knowledge (TK) in Pacific Island Countries. IPR are linked to the enjoyment of a range of economic, social and cultural rights, the rights to health, education, and food in particular. 91 However, it is often very challenging to get a comprehensive understanding of the exact nature of the relationship between IPR and human rights in a particular country or region, as local contexts have a profound effect on their inter-relationship. The case study addresses the role of IPR in Vanuatu\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2012 in order to illustrate how IPR regimes can impact upon human rights in a Pacific Island Country. We will also see how a lack of knowledge and misunderstandings about IPR and the protection of traditional knowledge can lead to trade negotiators accepting higher IPR standards than are in a nation\u2019s best interest. Finally, this case study shows how adopting a human rights aware approach to IPR requirements in trade agreements can help to ensure that the potential negative impacts of IPR commitments on human rights are minimised. All countries joining the WTO are required to sign up to the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (\u201cTRIPS\u201d), which mandates certain minimum levels of IPR protection that all members of the WTO must both provide and enforce. Many countries are also pressured to make commitments beyond these minimum standards (\u201cTRIPS Plus requirements\u201d) as part of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d174089d-d3f6-49d5-b317-f23eef5179a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d174089d-d3f6-49d5-b317-f23eef5179a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb6bfb89515ba382108251b4d3a201fc17553f27fc69daedda9d1f8c2f346bc4"}}, "hash": "bb6bfb89515ba382108251b4d3a201fc17553f27fc69daedda9d1f8c2f346bc4", "text": "the WTO accession process, or through other trade agreements such as a European Partnership Agreement. Links between human rights and iPr: example of Vanuatu The IPR commitments required in Vanuatu\u2019s accession package for the WTO were very onerous, and indeed were the most burdensome of all the Least Developed Countries and Small Islands Developing States who joined the WTO in the last ten years.92 Vanuatu was unable to take full advantage of any of the flexibilities that were available to it as a Least Developed Country, 93 and committed to several TRIPS Plus provisions. These IPR commitments impact on human rights in a variety of ways, the most significant of which are outlined here. Vanuatu agreed in its accession package to become a member of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV). This is a TRIPS Plus requirement that will require the introduction of a statutory regime that grants proprietary rights to commercial plant breeders, and restricts what farmers may do with seed and plant genetic material. This has potential consequences for food security as it will impact upon the relationship between farmers, genetic resources and sustainable agriculture. 94 UPOV-style plant variety rights protection is criticised on the basis that it encourages genetically uniform crops, affects farmers\u2019 rights with regard to seed and genetic material, does not recognise the contribution of traditional knowledge and participatory plant breeding and concentrates agricultural control within large agro-industrial corporations. 95 For example, it has been argued that \u201cstrong restrictions on access to plant genetic resources may augment the technological divide between those who have reached the technological frontier and latecomers who rely on adaptation of foreign technologies and germplasm for their domestic food needs.\u201d 96 Although it may be argued that plant variety rights will encourage the breeding of new varieties, there are actually no commercial plant breeders in Vanuatu as well as in most Pacific Island Countries and the system is unlikely to be useable by small farmers who do not possess the necessary skills or capital. The Special Rapporteur on The Right to Food observed: \u201cNo State should be forced to establish a regime for the protection of intellectual property rights which goes beyond the minimum requirements of the TRIPS Agreement: free trade agreements obliging countries to join the 1991 UPOV Convention or to adopt UPOV-compliant legislation, therefore, are questionable\u201d.97 29 Under TRIPS, Vanuatu is required to become a signatory to the Berne Convention, meaning that it has to recognise and uphold the copyright of foreign authors over their work. Vanuatu also agreed to ratify the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Conventions (a TRIPS Plus requirement) that mandates certain levels of regulation of access to digital and Internet content.98 Through the doctrine of copyright, all of these Conventions give owners monopoly rights over their works, which can have a dramatically curtailing effect on access to, and availability of, learning materials both in hard and electronic formats. This is therefore likely to impact upon the right to education.99 For example, the practice of copying large sections of imported textbooks for use in schools and university is now illegal, as is circumventing technological protection measures that \u201clock-up\u201d digital content. In a 2002 report the UK Commission on Intellectual Property Rights stated: \u201cit is arguably the case that many poor people in developing countries have only been able to access certain copyrighted works through using unauthorised copies available at a fraction of the price of the genuine original product. We are therefore concerned that an unintended impact of stronger protection and enforcement of international copyright rules as required, inter alia, by TRIPS will be simply to reduce access to knowledge products in developing countries\u201d.100 In many countries these negative effects can be mitigated to an extent by the establishment of statutory license schemes, but these do not currently exist in the region and may be too costly to establish given the smallness of the market.101 Third, the accession package required Vanuatu to introduce patent legislation that applies to pharmaceutical products and medical technology, thus impacting upon the right to health. In the short term this legislation is not likely to have a significant impact as Vanuatu currently has no local pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, relies heavily on older essential medicines that are no longer protected by patent, and on donor funding for new pharmaceuticals that are still protected by patent. However, these circumstances may change and by entering into these IPR commitments, Vanuatu has constrained its future abilities to access new pharmaceuticals.102 For example, such commitments prevent countries from purchasing generic (and therefore much cheaper) anti-malarial and anti-retroviral", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61702623-bd9a-4cf2-a7ed-636375ae7be6": {"__data__": {"id_": "61702623-bd9a-4cf2-a7ed-636375ae7be6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7358a0e8448afb3478d5bfbe6b644ae707835029bb6dc543d50a2ac6b1921817"}}, "hash": "7358a0e8448afb3478d5bfbe6b644ae707835029bb6dc543d50a2ac6b1921817", "text": "medicines from manufacturers in other Least Developed Countries. 103 This problem is heightened by the fact that Vanuatu has not included many of the available public health flexibilities permitted under TRIPS into its patent legislation. For example, Vanuatu is arguably entitled to avoid patent protection on pharmaceuticals altogether for as long as it remains a Least Developed Country,104 due to a waiver agreement negotiated in 2013.105 Finally, Vanuatu\u2019s IPR commitments impact indirectly on a variety of human rights by imposing a significant financial and administrative burden on the country. This necessitates a diversion of funds and human capacity that could be used to support health or education programmes. 106 The World Bank estimated that a comprehensive upgrade of the IPR regime in developing countries could require capital expenditure of USD$1.5 - 2 million,107 and the issue of administrative burden has been highlighted by many LDCs. The reasons for agreeing to such commitments are complex, but most likely include: - pressure from future trade partners, - weak capacity of negotiators to engage with the complexity of global IPR regimes,108 - lack of input from the broad range of sectors potentially affected by a new IPR regime (many of whom simply would not be aware of the dangers due to their lack of previous engagement with the issues involved), and - misunderstanding amongst negotiators and politicians about the supposed advantages of an IPR regime for Vanuatu. In regard to this last point, there was a clear belief on the part of a number of politicians that IPR regimes could protect Vanuatu traditional knowledge and natural resources, such as the Pentecost land dive,109 kava, kastom110 names and local varieties of yams.111 30 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS However, in fact none of these can be protected by IPR, which are limited to new and original creations and inventions, plant variety rights that are new, distinct, uniform and stable, and artificially created state of affairs. Although there is potential for geographical indications of origin to be used to protect certain aspects of traditional knowledge, there is a real concern that establishing such a regime is a very expensive undertaking, requiring technical and administrative capacity that Pacific Island countries currently lack.112 state responsibilities and policy implications The State has a responsibility to take into account human rights implications while negotiating trade agreements. The example of Vanuatu demonstrates the challenges of addressing the human rights issues related to IPRs, especially given the limited capacity of negotiators to engage with the technicalities involved in global IPR regimes, and the organisational constraints in consulting with all the different sectors affected (for example, agriculture, health and education). In light of the above and based on global evidence, the following observations regarding IPR and human rights can help ensure that human rights issues are better considered in future trade negotiations:. iPr potentially impact negatively upon the realisation of a range of human rights, primarily the rights to health, education and food.113 For example, IPR regimes limit access to digital and printed materials, such as textbooks that are essential for ensuring the right to education; they limit access to pharmaceuticals and other new medical technology that are essential for the right to health, and also limit access to plant genetic resources such as seeds, and new agricultural technology that are essential for the right to food. These rights are also interrelated and interdependent. The exact nature of their impact depends a lot upon context, and is likely to vary over time. For example, Pacific Island Countries like any other countries can negotiate with their trade partners for not having intellectual property chapters as requisite, included in trade agreements. A 2005 general comment by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stipulates e.g. that states should ensure that their legal or other regimes for the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from one\u2019s scientific, literary or artistic productions constitute no impediment to their ability to comply with their core obligations in relation to the rights of food, health and education, as well as to take part in cultural life and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications, or any other right enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The private interests of authors should not be unduly favoured and the public interest in enjoying broad access to their productions should be given due consideration. Ultimately intellectual property is a social product and has a social function114.

Given the potential needs for Pacific Island Countries to access new medicines in the future to combat the rapidly increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases in the region,115 as well as communicable diseases such as malaria, TB and HIV, it is crucial that all these flexibilities\ufffdare\ufffdincorporated\ufffdinto\ufffddomestic\ufffdlegislation.116 Many trade agreements contain TRIPS Plus provisions that curtail the use of flexibilities in TRIPS and heighten the likelihood of negative impacts on the range of human rights discussed. For example, this may involve obligations to join other conventions like the Patents Co-operation Treaty,117 the WIPO Copyright Treaties and UPOV, forgoing transition periods, and including provisions for data exclusivity and linkage. Pacific Island Countries should consider seeking independent expert help in trade agreement negotiations to make sure that they do not unduly agree to provisions that go beyond TRIPS requirements and disproportionaely undermine their policy space.118 31 Text Box 3: TRIPS Flexibilities Compulsory licences: These are mechanisms used by public authorities to authorize use of a patent-protected invention by the government or third parties without the consent of the patent-holder. Patent-holders are to receive adequate compensation, usually in the form of a royalty. As clarified by the Doha Declaration, WTO Members are free to determine the grounds upon which compulsory licences may be granted. Practice shows that they may be issued on various grounds of general interest, such as public health, and are a common feature of patent law in both developed and developing countries. A government use order is a specific type of compulsory licence usually issued in the form of an order by a competent administrative or judicial authority, authorizing a government or a party acting on behalf of the government to exploit a patent provided that such exploitation is in the interests of the country in question. Parallel imports: Companies often charge lower prices for a medicine in one country than in another, taking into account a range of market factors. This means that a country with limited resources can sometimes afford more of a patented medicine by purchasing it abroad at a lower price and importing it, rather than buying it directly in its domestic market at the higher price. Many countries\u2019 patent laws determine that once a patent owner sells its goods in any country, it has no right to control the resale of those goods (so called \u201cregime of international exhaustion\u201d). In legal terms, the patent owner has \u201cexhausted\u201d its property rights in the product actually sold \u2013 it maintains the exclusive right to manufacture the product, but it cannot use its intellectual property rights to prevent resale of those units it sells. An intermediary could thus buy a patented medicine in one country at the lower price set by the company and then resell the medicine in another country at a price that is higher but still undercuts what the manufacturer is charging for its patented medicine in that country. This is called \u201cparallel importing\u201d. Bolar provision/regular exception: This permits the use of a patented invention without authorization from the patent owner in order to obtain marketing approval of a generic product before the patent expires. This allows a generic product to enter the market more quickly after patent expiry, which in turn facilitates access to cheaper medicines. Exemptions for least developed countries: In November 2005, before the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, the WTO TRIPS Council extended the transition period for least developed countries from mandatory compliance with the TRIPS Agreement other than the provisions providing for non-discriminatory treatment, until July 2013. With specific reference to pharmaceutical products, Paragraph 7 of the Doha Declaration, as implemented by a TRIPS Council Decision of June 2002, exempts least developed countries from having to grant patents and from providing for the protection of undisclosed information until 1 January 2016. These transition periods are subject to further extension upon duly motivated request, Article 66.1 TRIPS Agreement.

However, TK\ufffdcannot\ufffdbe\ufffdadequately\ufffdprotected\ufffdby\ufffdcurrent\ufffdIPR\ufffdsystems.120 Although there have been treaty negotiations to develop a treaty that would do this for over a decade, there is no current international system for the protection of TK121, or one likely in the immediate future.122 any reference to the protection of TK in a trade agreement is highly likely to be merely aspirational and non-binding, and should not be seen as a worthwhile trade-off for agreeing to high IPR standards. In some situations, IPR systems may prejudice the protection of TK. For example, in 2013 Air Pacific lodged a trademark application in Fiji for 15 marks that were based on traditional masi designs, raising public concern that Fijian\u2019s traditional rights to create such artwork may be in jeopardy.123 To avoid such problems arising, it is essential that any national IPR laws that are agreed to as a result of trade agreements are drafted having regard to the local conditions, including the cultural context, rather than relying only on model laws.124 IPR\ufffdregimes\ufffdare\ufffdexpensive\ufffdand\ufffdrequire\ufffdtechnical\ufffdcapacity\ufffdthat\ufffdare\ufffdcurrently\ufffdnot\ufffdwell\ufffddeveloped\ufffdin\ufffdPacific\ufffdIsland\ufffd countries. These costs, together with their cumulative impact upon a variety of human rights through the rents they render payable to developed countries for access to technology and knowledge, are likely to outweigh any benefits from filing fees. When IPRs are required to be introduced domestically, breaches should ordinarily be treated as civil cases and not as giving rise to criminal offences. The TRIPS Agreement125 only requires countries to provide criminal offences for \u201cwilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale.\u201d126 Pacific Island criminal justice systems are all currently under strain and would likely require extra capacity to effectively enforce IPR violations or run the risk of seeing limited resources diverted to enforce such cases. It is in the interest of developing countries that are making an informed decision to introduce IPRs through trade agreements to at least negotiate for long transition periods. Negotiators should also make sure that there is a commitment by the trade partners to providing technical support to building a locally based IPR system that is deliberately tailored to the local context and equitable to all parties. This will require long-term commitment, and is not the type of support usually provided127. 33 5. concluding observations and recommendations This section presents concluding observations about the human rights issues associated with the negotiation and implementation of trade agreements in Pacific Island Countries and provides six recommendations for consideration by policy makers. Observation\ufffd1:\ufffdTransversal\ufffdhuman\ufffdrights\ufffdissues\ufffd One of the main points to take away from this report is that trade agreements have wide-ranging impacts in different sectors of the economy and thus have the potential to affect a broad spectrum of human rights, including the rights to health and to food. In some cases, the human rights impacts can be positive\u2014for example, where new jobs and economic opportunities assist in the realisation of the right to work and the right to an adequate standard of living. On the other hand, there can be corresponding negative impacts on human rights as structural reforms result in job losses or business closures in less competitive sectors. As is pointed out in the case studies above, the economic benefits brought by trade liberalisation may not be evenly distributed across and within countries; there are likely to be both winners and losers. As those who are the \u201closers\u201d are likely to be the more vulnerable and least able to adapt to structural reforms, the State must take steps to mitigate the negative impacts of trade reform on domestic workers and communities. Its focus on marginalized groups and their empowerment is one of the added value of a human rights based approach. The State should also pay attention to potential negative impacts on its own revenues and capacity. For example, a number of the key measures in trade and investment agreements involve the reduction of tariffs and duties; and other provisions may require the establishment of new government institutions and compliance efforts. These can reduce the government\u2019s ability to provide programmes and services that give effect to human rights. Therefore, the overall impact of trade and investment agreements on government capacity needs to be monitored, and governments need to be careful that they maintain the ability to fund and deliver upon their human rights obligations. This raises a wider concern about how trade and investment agreements can constrain the policy space for the governments of Pacific Island Countries.

Future policy decisions may contravene commitments made in international trade agreements, and be subject to challenge or even lead to trade sanctions being imposed by other parties to those agreements. Pacific Island Countries should carefully weigh the potential benefits and costs of new trade agreements, including regarding their impact on economic, social and cultural rights. In some cases, it may be more advantageous for Pacific Island Countries to pursue trade reforms on a unilateral basis. They should also exercise caution when making new commitments, particularly those that have implications for the realisation of human rights. Government negotiators should be as clear and forceful as possible about their intention to maintain the policy space required to fulfill their human rights obligations, now and in the future. In this regard, this report highlights concerns about the relative capacity and negotiating power of governments in Pacific Island Countries to negotiate appropriate and advantageous terms. Further efforts are needed to strengthen the capacity of governments to determine trade policy priorities and should include efforts intended to help Pacific Island governments use trade policy to protect and realise human rights. 34 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS Observation\ufffd2:\ufffdHuman\ufffdrights\ufffdcan\ufffdimprove\ufffdthe\ufffdoutcomes\ufffdof\ufffdtrade \ufffd liberalisation This report is based on the premise that greater attention to human rights in the negotiation and implementation of trade and investment agreements can improve the substantive outcomes\u2014particularly for the people who are most likely to be affected by them in a negative manner. In other words, the human rights framework provides a people-centered and outcome-oriented focus to trade discussions. Rather than just focusing on aggregate economic outcomes, the human rights framework makes it clear that there are additional issues to consider relating to the potential impacts on the people and governments involved. As illustrated in the case studies above, the potential human rights impacts require taking into account the \u201cripple effects\u201d of trade agreements on more vulnerable segments of the population and non-economic spheres (e.g. health and education) that might not otherwise be considered. Consideration of these broader impacts of trade on human rights entails consultation with a broader range of stakeholders\u2014including individuals, communities, civil society organizations, and other government departments\u2014when developing trade policy and negotiating agreements. In this regard, a human rights focus can strengthen the democratic processes around key economic issues, as well as improving policy coherence between trade, development and human rights commitments. They do so by providing an internationally legitimated platform from which broader social welfare considerations can be articulated. Broadly speaking, the human rights based approach to trade and investment has many benefits for Pacific Island Countries, especially as it: \u25aa Respects the principle of non-discrimination. \u25aa Promotes participation of all, including marginalized groups \u25aa Monitors trade processes and outcomes through human rights impact assessments. \u25aa Ensures that progressive trade liberalisation promotes the progressive realization of human rights. \u25aa Promotes the accountability of State actors. \u25aa Promotes ethical and fair business. \u25aa Encourages international cooperation and assistance to ensure that poorer countries also benefit from trade.128 Recommendations recommendation 1: increase access to information and enhance capacity for trade policy development and negotiation of trade agreements It is widely acknowledged that trade officials and negotiators are \u201coften unaware of the obligations to which human rights give rise to, or feel that the nature of those obligations is vague and unclear.\u201d129 Nonetheless, governments have obligations to ensure that commitments made in trade agreements help to realise and do not undermine human rights. This points to an immediate need to strengthen the capacity for trade officials and negotiators to understand human rights and to integrate rights-based assessments and measures into agreements. Conversely, it is important for human rights officials and national human rights institutions to improve their capacity to engage on trade issues. 35 It is also important for all policy-makers interested in the relationship between trade and human rights to have better information about economic trends and human rights issues. Moreover, given the complex and contested assumptions about trade, human rights assessments of trade measures need to include a detailed causal-chain analysis of the links between the specific measures and their economic effects, followed by an analysis of the human rights impacts of the changes in economic activity on affected stakeholders. Such causal-chain analyses require a better foundation of data to support Informed debate and decision-making than exists at present. Therefore, capacity-building measures should also focus on generating and monitoring appropriate trade and human rights indicators on an on-going basis. There are resources available for capacity-building for government officials and policy-makers in Pacific Island", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "705e28a1-eb83-49f0-8e46-10a5e92ad1cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "705e28a1-eb83-49f0-8e46-10a5e92ad1cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Trade and Human Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6e41043e3624a4b118c2633b833accf0e827ad35ae76809d01e00424e259cf6"}, "3": {"node_id": "acbe55af-92be-46cb-8be7-085fdf1f9286", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-trade-and-human-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1221677a951b9e7efc451996a7ab33348d32cb1db2be665915104a8c46bd4ac"}}, "hash": "137d1a85d379e2f653cb7e79fe169c51c1db48b5c6a9a4477b8195b4a4ce821d", "text": "Countries. Given the similar issues that these countries are facing, capacity-building efforts can likely be organised in a cost-effective manner on a regional basis. recommendation 2: Take into account the impacts before entering into binding trade agreements A considered approach to international trade negotiations -taking into account the impacts both positive and negative, both actual and potential would help Pacific governments maintain policy space that may be useful for the realisation of human rights. This recommendation does not imply that binding trade agreements should not be considered or entered into, but rather urges governments and policy-makers to question all assumptions pertaining to the benefits and detriments of these agreements. Recommendation\ufffd3:\ufffdConduct\ufffdimpact\ufffdassessments\ufffdof\ufffdtrade\ufffdagreements The governments of Pacific Island Countries are strongly encouraged to consider opportunities for conducting Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs) for new trade and investment agreements as a means to fulfill their international human rights obligations while pursuing their trade and development goals. HRIAs are important tools that can help identify the potential and actual human rights impacts through a participatory assessment process, and help guide actions to minimise the negative impacts and to maximise positive impacts. Moreover, human rights principles can be integrated into other assessment processes in Pacific Island Countries\u2014either macro-level assessments related to trade, development, health, etc. or micro-level assessments of the social and environmental impacts of new business operations that are supported by trade and investment measures. International funding and technical assistance is available to assist Pacific Island Countries to undertake HRIAs, governments are encouraged to take advantage of these opportunities to strengthen their policy-making process. Recommendation\ufffd4:\ufffdEnsure\ufffdpublic\ufffdparticipation,\ufffdconsultation\ufffdand\ufffdtransparency\ufffdabout\ufffdtrade\ufffdnegotiations Active, free and meaningful participation is a human rights principle and at the heart of a human rights-based approach to trade. People are entitled to participate in decisions that directly affect them. Participation should be ensured at all stages of trade policy-making, implementation and design. This will require greater consultation and transparency about the process of negotiating and implementing trade agreements. Active, free and meaningful participation, including the empowerment of marginalized groups, will not be possible without adequate and sustainable financial and technical support. Participation, consultation and transparency require time, which should be understood as a good thing\u2014as it reinforces informed decision-making and social acceptance of important policies. Affected stakeholders can help policy-makers anticipate potential impacts and/or adopt effective measures to address actual impacts when they occur. This also helps strengthen the inter-connections with human rights, reinforce the democratic process and enhance trade outcomes. 36 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS recommendation 5: strengthen the adoption and implementation of international human rights treaties relevant to trade agreements In order to provide a stronger legal and institutional foundation for the links between human rights and trade, Pacific Island Countries should ratify and continue to implement the international human rights treaties. In particular, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights provides for the protection, respect and fulfilment of many of the rights that are potentially affected by trade reform. recommendation 6: exercise maximum caution in undertaking intellectual property commitments Given the implications for a number of human rights, the rights to health and to food in particular, policy-makers should exercise extreme caution when considering the inclusion of an intellectual property chapter when entering into new regional free trade agreements, such as a European EPA or Pacer Plus. When entering into existing multilateral free trade agreements, such as joining the WTO, policy-makers should ensure that only the minimum TRIPS standards are agreed to. Further, when implementing any of these intellectual property regimes into domestic law, all the TRIPS flexibilities should be fully incorporated. This recommendation is based on the assessment that the negative human rights impacts of intellectual property regimes may outweigh any potential advantages, in both the short to medium term, given the present state of development of Pacific Island Countries. 37 References Allen, M.

Bertram and Watters suggested these economies can be understood by the effects of migration, remittances, aid and bureaucracy (the so called MIRAB model). Under the MIRAB model, island states receive \u201crents\u201d from the international community in the form of aid and remittances. Some argue that Pacific Island Countries should be unapologetic about receiving these rents, as they can often be seen as a \u201creceipt from an invisible export of geostrategic services.\u201d Indeed, some Pacific Island Countries have formalised arrangements with foreign powers that have geostrategic interests in the region. The Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau all have compacts of free association with the United States. In return for ceding some aspects of national sovereignty (allowing the US military access to their territories) these states receive significant amounts of aid and have access to US domestic services including postal and aviation services, weather forecasting and disaster response and recovery. 23 Bamman 2007 24 Feeny 2010:139 25 Hezel 2012:29 26 Tonga is the only Pacific Island Country that was not at some time a colony of foreign powers. 27 Grynberg 2006 28 UNESCAP 1997:1 29 As then multilateral trade policy advisor at the South Pacific Forum Secretariat, Roman Grynberg, argued: \u201cthe question the region must now pose is how to respond to its increased marginalisation in the global economy ... the most obvious response to globalisation in virtually every region of the world has been regionalism\u201d (Grynberg 1998:15).

More specifically, discrimination is especially strong among women and girls who are affected by HIV. Evidence has emerged over the past few years that the fundamental rights of key HIV-affected women and girls 1 are often violated at health care settings. These violations can be in the form of discriminatory, humiliating, or degrading treatment; breaches of consent and confidentiality; forced or coerced sterilization and abortions; denial of services and care; and misinformation on standards of care. This report looks into existing constitutional provisions, laws, and legal mechanisms in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, and identifies provisions that provide protection or redress for violations of rights at health care settings. While the report focuses specifically on key HIV-affected women, the legal provisions identified also apply to the general population (including marginalized groups, such as disabled and very poor women) whose rights might be violated in health care settings. The report demonstrates that there are serious gaps in laws to provide protection and redress for violation of rights at health care settings in the four countries under discussion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f605e54-927c-4512-9d3b-12eec6af4185": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f605e54-927c-4512-9d3b-12eec6af4185", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63b2c9c026b14f98e9b992591406cdf37e4ee2f93b9e0ea2297d7c08ed6f0893"}, "2": {"node_id": "8fccc37b-3de1-4480-ad6d-3395260089cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49bf8d087b7d5315a590724377a14fc246e585fe3550d97ba8c29ebdc1556365"}}, "hash": "f6c44883bdd02ab4b91c46e7d9295a1d4697b195dcf9e7bb0e48b9cfccbc3ad1", "text": "While the constitutions in all four countries guarantee equality under the law and prohibit discrimination based on sex, there are only a few laws or legal mechanisms that women can use to access justice if these rights have been violated in health care settings. Those that do exist, such as Pakistan\u2019s Reproductive Healthcare and Rights Act, lack effective implementation measures such as penalties for redress in the case of non-adherence to the provisions. Codes of conduct for physicians in these countries, such as the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council Act (2010), also afford some level of protection, but they remain ineffectual given the limited resources allocated for their implementation and monitoring. This effectively means that large numbers of women whose rights have been violated at health care settings do not have any recourse to justice. Despite the dearth of specific laws, the judicial system has sporadically stepped in to protect patients\u2019 rights, especially in India and Nepal, promoting changes in laws or stipulating additional protective guidelines on the basis of constitutional rights as well as those based on international instruments that the countries have signed or ratified, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, and Convention on the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9bff4ef0-660f-40ec-a454-7963ef199ea1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9bff4ef0-660f-40ec-a454-7963ef199ea1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21e934948f1df78dceded7374208f5e200cd3e4c72a09b1ad2405048164d7020"}, "3": {"node_id": "c01ae347-53e0-4597-805e-3b3d3a0cad40", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35457f862857e354d4f92c9621128b51d717510c98b3026c70113fccfcf8169f"}}, "hash": "43c7b689ecc506a1128298839507f183d716e4e403e3f348b30571264ff95e72", "text": "Elimination of Discrimination against Women. This report has reviewed these instances and notes that while these may apply to women and girls affected by HIV, they have not yet been used to provide justice for women who have been forced or coerced into having an abortion or being sterilized because they are HIV positive. This is not to imply that countries are not aware of the issue and are not working towards solutions. For instance, Nepal, India, and Pakistan have drafted national HIV bills that provide such protection, although none of these bills have been passed and put into force. We call on countries to pass pending legislation that provides for rights-based provisions that ensure the protection of all people \u2013 including people living with HIV and HIV-affected women and girls \u2013 in the event that their rights are violated in health care and other institutional settings. 1 Key HIV-affected women and girls include: i) women and girls living with HIV; ii) female sex workers; iii) female spouses of male clients of sex workers; iv) women who use drugs; v) female spouses of men who inject drugs; vi) female spouses of men who have sex with men; and vii) women and girls from households affected by HIV/AIDS. Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 5 Intersectoral partnerships within countries and across South Asia are needed to address these and broader gender issues in the region. It is our hope that this report is a step in that direction, representing an important partnership between the Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV (APN+), South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Law (SAARCLAW) and the United Nations.

In a report submitted to the twenty-second session of the Human Rights Council (February 2013), the Special Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Juan Mendez, noted that some of these practices not only involve violations of human rights such as the right to health, the right to non-discrimination on prohibited grounds, and the right to found a family, but they may constitute torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. Specifically, the Special Rapporteur\u2019s report found evidence of significant levels of rights violations among KAWG in health care settings in each country. Despite the many interventions by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government institutions regarding the practices of health care workers, stigma and discrimination continue in many hospitals and health care centres across South Asia. Key findings Violations of rights of KAWG at health care settings Given the varying nature of the health services sought by women, men, and transgender people, discrimination at health care settings has a gendered aspect. KAWG across the region face a range of specific violations in health care settings. Discriminatory treatment: Discrimination towards women living with HIV, both within the household and family and within society at large, is mirrored in health care settings. Evidence suggests that HIV-related discrimination may be exacerbated for HIV-positive women who are sex workers, transgender, or who use drugs. A Nepalese study among 425 sex workers has shown that lack of confidentiality, discrimination, and negative attitudes by health care providers, as well as fear of being identified to the public or to law 2 See footnote 1. exeCutIVe summARy Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 9 enforcement officials as a sex worker, were the major barriers to their seeking sexual health services. 3 One fifth of the 425 respondents had never visited a health facility, as many female sex workers limit themselves to using private clinics, non-governmental clinics, and pharmacies to avoid the discrimination and poor treatment meted out to them on the basis of their work.4 Consent and confidentiality: A 2007 study in India found that of 884 health care workers interviewed half felt that the need for a patient\u2019s consent prior to testing for HIV was exaggerated, and just 39 percent agreed that a patient\u2019s blood should never be tested without prior consent. In addition, 86 percent of respondents were supportive of mandatory testing of all patients before surgery, and 79 percent said all pregnant women should be mandatorily tested.5 The Stigma Index report for Bangladesh found that approximately half of the 86 women surveyed who had been tested for HIV had consented to the test.6 The Stigma Index report for Nepal found that 7 percent of women respondents reported forceful testing of their HIV status during medical examination.7 Forced and coerced sterilization: Of 228 women surveyed in a six-country study in Asia, more than 70 percent said they had been asked or encouraged to have a sterilization procedure.8 More than 35 percent of the Indian women surveyed said they had been asked to consider sterilization. The same study showed that 15 percent of the Bangladeshi women surveyed were asked to have a sterilization, of whom only 40 percent felt they could decline. Fifteen percent of the 40 women surveyed in Nepal were asked to undergo sterilization, and only one felt she could decline. The Stigma Index report for Nepal showed that 2 percent of the 394 female respondents (women living with HIV) surveyed said that they had been coerced into sterilization.9 The Stigma Index report for Pakistan showed that 4.5 percent of the 228 women surveyed said that they had been coerced into sterilization. Forced and coerced abortions: Studies showed a wide variation in the prevalence of abortion among HIV- positive women (including those that are forced or coerced), with 0.1 percent for India and Bangladesh but 25 percent for Nepal.10 Another study showed that 1.6 percent of HIV-positive women respondents in Nepal reported being coerced into an abortion by health personnel.11 The Stigma Index report for India reveals that 4 percent of the 593 women interviewed reported being coerced into an abortion. Additionally, 7 percent of the 98 female sex workers interviewed reported being coerced into an abortion.12 The PLHIV Stigma Index report for Pakistan shows that 37.3 percent of the 228 female respondents stated that they had been coerced by a health care professional into an abortion.13 Denial of treatment: The Stigma", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d91c993-9253-4509-b8d1-cc7c37299099": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d91c993-9253-4509-b8d1-cc7c37299099", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff7f38ebc4d0e7be990603b7ca7b88396712bd526a482d9c506145df6f794840"}, "3": {"node_id": "e8711c03-6b25-4522-ab60-089aac59dc8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a42a2c468760aab7d83b20f878ff43df912f9e1fd7ac2efefa74d52f9b5940c7"}}, "hash": "aa03fee186b03c5250ea5c5a0ab0b4e826c159cf3c6e8b1c1015050b82ae13d1", "text": "Index results from Pakistan showed that 33 percent of the 883 respondents (male and female) said they had been denied access to health care, including dental care, due to their HIV status.14 A 2012 report of the Nepal Health Research Council found six respondents stating that a health 3 Laxmi Ghimire and Edwin van Teijlingen, \u201cBarriers to Utilisation of Sexual Health Services by Female Sex Workers in Nepal,\u201d Global Journal of Health Science, vol. 1, no. 1 (2009). 4 Ibid. 5 V.

There have also been cases of pregnant HIV-positive women being turned away from hospitals in India at the time of delivery. For instance, in Uttar Pradesh a woman in labour was denied access to the hospital and had to be rushed to another at the last minute to deliver her baby.15 Degrading treatment during delivery: Many HIV-positive women continue to have negative experiences while giving birth. Women have recounted stories of being neglected by staff before, during, and after their delivery; of being abused by staff for getting pregnant while under the extreme stress of labour; and of staff refusing to touch them or their newborn baby. A Nepalese woman described how during her delivery the doctor wanted to put on two sets of gloves and tried to push the baby back in so that he could put the other set on.16 Most women said they were not given the option of having a vaginal delivery if their HIV status was known, and that the cost of a caesarean delivery is prohibitive. Women with HIV also reported severe delays in being attended to as well as being asked to leave the hospital earlier than other patients who had undergone the same procedure.17 Legal frameworks Fundamental rights guarantees All four countries have ratified, signed, or acceded to the core human rights conventions, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR); International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); and United Nations Convention on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). These conventions impose upon each state the legal obligation to ensure fundamental rights relevant to the rights violations experienced by KAWG in health care settings, including the right to life; the right to liberty; the right to the highest attainable standard of health; the right to non-discrimination and equality before the law; the right to found a family; and the right to privacy.

Executive summary Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 11 \u2022 Laws relating to assault \u2022 HIV-specific legislation The report found that many laws contain provisions that can be used by KAWG who face violations in health care settings. Some examples include: \u2022 Reproductive rights laws, such as Pakistan\u2019s Reproductive Health care and Rights Act (2013), are particularly relevant as they contain provisions specifically prohibiting forced abortion or sterilization and emphasize the importance of informed consent. \u2022 Codes of conduct for physicians in all four countries emphasize ensuring informed consent and guaranteeing confidentiality towards patients. They also forbid physicians to deny treatment arbitrarily, as in the Indian Medical Council Regulations. These codes of conduct all contain complaints mechanisms, which in principle can be utilized by a person whose rights have been violated to initiate an enquiry into a specific physician\u2019s actions. \u2022 Anti-discrimination Legislation, such as laws dealing with equal rights for persons with disabilities or prohibiting discrimination based on caste, as in the Caste Based Discrimination Act in Nepal, could be expanded to include PLHIV. \u2022 Some assault laws contain provisions that apply to degrading treatment or humiliating remarks towards KAWG, for instance, the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance (2013). Nepal\u2019s country code also specifically addresses \u201cdecency\u201d in health care settings, but only in the context of prohibiting sexual intercourse with a patient. \u2022 Some HIV-specific legislation, such as Pakistan\u2019s Sindh HIV Act, contains specific provisions such as the mandated training of all health care workers on HIV, discrimination, confidentiality, and consent. This could have a very significant impact on reducing the stigma and discrimination feared and experienced by KAWG in health care settings. The act also provides specific penalties for defined offences by health care providers. Of course, there are many gaps in the laws, not least the fact that none of the four countries has a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that would be applicable nationally in public and private health care settings and that would protect women and girls living with or affected by HIV and AIDS. Laws that do exist need to be properly enforced and bolstered by effective implementation and complaint mechanisms that are easy to access and that make people working within health care accountable for their actions. This includes ensuring the provision of information about complaints mechanisms to patients, and access to legal services for those who need it. Key recommendations General Our research has identified several general recommendations for strengthening protection and ensuring rights for KAWG in health care settings: 1. Meaningful participation of key HIV-affected women and girls must be ensured in order for policy makers to understand and respond to the nature of their experiences in health care settings. Consultations ensuring participation of all stakeholders should be planned and should focus on joint development of recommendations for laws, policies, and programmes to prevent future rights violations in health care settings. 12 2. All pending HIV bills should be passed with the specific stipulation of implementing structures to ensure that provisions are effectively enforced and executed. 3. Enact non-discrimination legislation based on constitutional guarantees and applicable to both public and private actors in health care settings. Ensure that the legislation is aligned with international conventions such as ICESCR and CEDAW. The legislation should contain specific provisions that recognize the gendered experiences of women in health care situations by stipulating additional safeguards related to informed consent in cases concerning the reproductive rights of women, including KAWG. Countries should repeal laws that explicitly discriminate against women. 4.

Decriminalize sex work in order to reduce stigma and discrimination towards sex workers seeking health care and HIV-related testing and treatment. \u2022 Develop and implement a national policy to address HIV-related stigma and discrimination in health care settings, including through stigma and discrimination reduction programmes for health care workers. In accordance with Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) guidance on stigma reduction,18 training in health care settings should be conducted with health care workers, administrators, and health care regulators with the objectives of ensuring that stigmatizing attitudes in health care settings are reduced and health care providers are given the skills and tools necessary to ensure patients\u2019 rights to informed decision-making, informed consent, confidentiality, treatment, and non-discrimination. Recommendations for South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Law (SAARCLAW) chapters 1. Use regular SAARCLAW meetings as forums to disseminate information on the latest findings on violations of women\u2019s rights in health care settings. Raise awareness among SAARCLAW members on specific legal needs of women and encourage legal aid related involvement from constituent members. 2. Disseminate information on legal judgments to all lawyers, judges, and academics who are members of SAARCLAW. This could include: the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the two-finger test in sexual assault cases in India; the UN Special Rapporteur report on re-classifying violations in health care settings as torture; and progress on new laws in each country on discrimination, HIV/AIDS, and violence against women. 18 See UNAIDS Guidance Note, \u201cKey Programmes to Reduce Stigma and Discrimination and Increase Access to Justice in National HIV Responses\u201d (2012). Executive summary Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 13 3. Encourage national chapters to engage more actively with issues related to women\u2019s rights and to implement workshops to address the lack of awareness of legal rights and general knowledge on health- related rights. 4. Support national chapters to formulate and implement training programmes and to carry out workshops on discrimination against women at health care settings, for example, with District Bar Councils. 5. Encourage national chapters to engage affiliated lawyers to provide pro bono legal aid, or lead public interest litigation related to violations of women\u2019s rights in the health care sector. 6. Establish a legal knowledge online archive of the SAARC region with regard to the judgments, case law, and legislation pertaining to women \u2013 including KAWG, disabled women, and other marginalized women. This should be updated on a regular basis and be accessible to researchers and practitioners. There is emerging recognition that some health care institutions are sites of discrimination, violence, and abuse towards individuals who come seeking services, with health care providers withholding care or performing treatment that intentionally or negligently inflicts pain and suffering. Rights violations that key HIV affected women and girls face in health care settings include forced and coerced sterilization, forced and coerced abortions, denial of access to sexual and reproductive health services, and being subjected to discrimination \u2013 such as advice against reproduction despite lack of medical indications of risk to mother or baby. In a report submitted to the twenty-second session of the Human Rights Council (February 2013), the Special Rapporteur on Torture, and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading treatment or Punishment, Juan Mendez, noted that some of these practices not only involve violations of human rights such as the right to health, the right to non-discrimination on prohibited grounds, and the right to found a family, but they may constitute torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. He also stated that \u201cMedical care that causes severe suffering for no justifiable reason can be considered cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; and if there is State involvement and specific intent, it is torture.\u201d19 The Special Rapporteur\u2019s report specifically focused on violations against marginalized groups, including people living with HIV, sex workers, and people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity.

BACkgRouNd 14 Background Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 15 This report, then, may be looked at as a first step, identifying protective laws with the aim of supporting policy development related to protecting the sexual and reproductive health and rights of KAWG in health care settings. Methodology This report was commissioned by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), in partnership with Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV (APN+), South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Law (SAARCLAW) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to conduct a scan on legal protections of the rights of KAWG in health care settings. This report aims to review the legal environment with regard to this issue in four countries in South Asia: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It also aims to assess the legislation with a view to recommending a way forward to improve and strengthen protection of rights of KAWG in health care settings in the four countries. Research was conducted with the assistance of the National SAARCLAW chapters in the four countries, which identified and worked with the national consultants. This regional report is based partially on the findings of the national studies as well as on shared reports provided by partner UN agencies. The majority of research was conducted online. Online databases that were utilised included: \u2022 www.aidsdatahub.org \u2022 PubMed at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed \u2022 www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/Pages/TreatyBodies.aspx \u2022 WomenWatch: Directory of UN Resources on Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women \u2022 Databases of UNAIDS, United Nations Women, and UNDP were also used. Key search words, in various different combinations and with and without specific country names, included but were not limited to: women, HIV, gender, inequality, South Asia, rights violations, human rights, forced sterilization, forced abortion, discrimination, health care, guidelines, stigma, denial of treatment, violence, sex workers, and prevalence. Additional search items were also related to the names of various laws in specific countries. Objectives of the report \u2022 To identify existing protective laws (including constitutional provisions) and legal mechanisms for seeking protection or redress for violations of rights of KAWG in health care settings; \u2022 To document rights violations experienced by KAWG in health care settings; \u2022 To document one or two selected court rulings on violations of rights of KAWG in health care settings; \u2022 To document cases where KAWG have been able to access justice for violations of rights in health care settings through legal mechanisms; Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 16 \u2022 To identify gaps in laws and legal mechanisms that protect KAWG from such violations; \u2022 To develop recommendations for governments, the legal sector, health care institutions, and SAARCLAW for actions to be taken to improve the legal environment in order to protect the rights of KAWG in health care settings.

Women come from diverse backgrounds and face \u201cmultiple and intersecting discriminations on the basis of their class, caste, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors.\u201d39 To put it simply, some women are more vulnerable, marginalized, and discriminated against than others. In the context of HIV, this includes women who face multiple discriminations, often sanctioned by the state, on the basis of their work (sex workers), drug use, gender identity (transgender women), and HIV status (women living with HIV). These women are also at a heightened risk of violence. As mentioned, violence against women is pervasive across South Asia, and it does not exist in isolation. It is connected to attitudes, social mores, and discriminatory beliefs and practices, both within and outside the family, in all the institutions that people interact with, including health care settings. The links between violence and HIV are widely acknowledged, with research showing that \u201cviolence or the fear of violence can restrict the ability of women and girls to seek HIV-prevention services and their ability to refuse sex or negotiate safe sex.

The abovementioned Indian study on rural women living with HIV noted that 70 percent of the respondents reported that health care workers were afraid to touch them.44 At least two-thirds reported that they had been denied medical/hospital care and had been mistreated by hospital workers.45 Respondents also reported fear of disclosing status, even in health care settings, due to insensitive questions asked about their \u201cmorality.\u201d46 Another study noted insensitive treatment by health care professionals in maternity wards.47 A 2012 study from the Nepal Health Research Council found that a majority of respondents reported stigmatizing behaviour by government hospital staff, explaining that \u201cthey do not give priority to us, and look in a different way when we go there.\u201d48 Evidence suggests that HIV-related discrimination may be exacerbated for HIV-positive women who are sex workers, transgender, or who use drugs. For instance, transgender women report various forms of humiliation and verbal harassment by hospital staff, including deliberate use of male pronouns in addressing hijras49 as well as registering them as \u201cmales,\u201d admitting them in male wards, and forcing them to stand in the male queue.50 Similar accounts were given by transgender women during a 2011 regional consultation51 on legal barriers to accessing HIV prevention, treatment, and care services in India. One woman described approaching a hospital with a serious infection that was causing her extreme pain, only to have several doctors gather around her and ask humiliating questions about how she had sex rather than treating her for her condition.52 A Nepalese study among 425 sex workers has shown that lack of confidentiality, discrimination, and negative attitudes by health care providers, as well as fear of being identified to the public or to law enforcement officials as a sex worker, were the major barriers to sex workers seeking sexual health services.53 As one respondent explained, \u201chealth workers judge and recognize us as a sex worker.

One respondent described being sexually harassed by a male doctor when he realized she was a sex worker. One fifth of the 425 respondent sex workers had never visited a health facility, and many female sex workers limited themselves to using private clinics, non-governmental clinics, and pharmacies to avoid the discrimination and poor treatment meted out to them on the basis of their work.59 According to another study, sex workers in India are \u201ctreated callously in hospitals and clinics, made to wait longer periods to be seen\u2026and are refused treatment until they agree to undergo HIV testing.\u201d60 Being forced into having HIV tests and knowing that the results will not be kept private are another serious deterrent to seeking services. This atmosphere of discrimination and moral censure has, understandably, made many sex workers reluctant to approach health care services. Legal activists have pointed out that state health controls, \u201cthrough measures purportedly serving a public health purpose, are a frequent source of violations of sex workers\u2019 rights: mandatory testing for STIs and HIV; routine infringements of confidentiality regarding HIV test results, and other medical information.\u201d61 Sex work is criminalized in all of the four countries in which this study was conducted, although in Nepal it is the client and not the sex worker who is liable for prosecution. Criminalization affects the efficacy of outreach services and HIV-prevention programmes, making sex workers harder to reach and deterring them from approaching health services in fear of legal consequences.

Consent and confidentiality Testing for HIV without the informed consent of the individual and breaches of confidentiality are contraventions of the rights to dignity, privacy, and physical integrity. The International Guidelines on Human Rights and HIV stipulate that the duty of states to protect the right to privacy \u201cincludes the obligation to guarantee that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure that no testing occurs without informed consent, that confidentiality is protected, particularly in health and social welfare settings, and that information on HIV status is not disclosed to third parties without the consent of the individual.\u201d68 Paragraph 35 of the International Guidelines states that that there is no public health rationale for mandatory testing and that respect for the right to physical integrity requires that \u201ctesting be voluntary and that no 63 S.

In India, reports from 2004 indicated that \u201cpregnant women are routinely tested for HIV without their knowledge, much less informed consent to the procedure\u2026. Spouses of all HIV-positive men are advised, and sometimes forced, to undergo HIV testing whether seeking medical care or not (and)\u2026 HIV testing is also administered as a rule to all patients prior to surgery and in cases where a suspicion of HIV arises based on their physical appearance or belonging to a high-risk group, such as sex workers. Generally, such testing is mandatory, no consent is provided, and there is no pre- or post-test counselling.\u201d70 A more recent study conducted in 2007 found that of 884 health care workers interviewed, half felt that the need for consent prior to testing was exaggerated and just 39 percent agreed that patients\u2019 blood should never be tested for HIV without their consent. In addition, 86 percent of respondents were supportive of mandatory testing of all patients before surgery and 79 percent said all pregnant women should be mandatorily tested.71 The stigma index report for Bangladesh found that approximately half of the 86 women surveyed who had been tested for HIV had consented to the test.72 The stigma index report for Nepal73 also found that 7 percent of women respondents reported forceful testing of their HIV status during medical examination. In a multi-country study on access to reproductive and maternal health care for women living with HIV in Asia,74 many women identified lack of pre-test counselling as a crucial issue. According to them, where counselling existed it was mostly to persuade them to take the test rather than providing the necessary information.75 Several women also said that they did not understand what the test was for or what HIV was even when they had been \u2018counselled\u2019.

In addition to being a serious violation of rights, lax enforcement of confidentiality protocols also means that the fear of the negative ramifications of involuntary disclosure will continue to lead women to avoid seeking testing and treatment for HIV as well as for other conditions. Forced and coerced sterilization \u201cForced sterilization is an act of violence, a form of social control, and a violation of the right to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d Forced or coerced sterilization has been well established within the international human rights regime as a violation of women\u2019s human rights. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has considered forced sterilization a violation of a woman\u2019s right to informed consent, infringing on her right to human dignity and physical and mental integrity.80 The United Nations Special Rapporteur on violence against women has asserted that \u201cforced sterilization is a method of medical control\u2026. Essentially involving the battery of a woman \u2013 violating her physical integrity and security \u2013 forced sterilization constitutes violence against women.\u201d81 Human rights instruments, including CEDAW and the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), support the right of all women to choose the number and spacing of their children and to have access to health care that will support them to do this. This includes HIV-positive women, who must also have access to information and services that enable them to minimize the chances of HIV transmission to the foetus. However, all too often women living with HIV express being treated as \u201cvectors of HIV and unfit to have babies, rather than as women with health-care issues in our own right.\u201d82 There have been widespread reports globally about HIV-positive women being \u2018persuaded\u2019 or \u2018forced\u2019 into having sterilizations.83 Coerced sterilization can be said to occur when a woman is offered financial or other incentives or when tactics of intimidation are used to compel someone to agree to undergo a procedure. Failure to obtain free and informed consent can also be seen in situations where a woman is asked to sign a consent form when she is already in labour or when she signs after being given misinformation about HIV risks and transmission.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0403c6ef-0475-43a2-85fc-c93acf00a82e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0403c6ef-0475-43a2-85fc-c93acf00a82e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e406d209b4bcbe8da9e58dc64e159fbf481fe2be8d803cc9aad3ca638fed844b"}, "2": {"node_id": "5653f520-10fd-4cfb-a200-419e4f2cfb11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "712baee87d2bbec482dfa596c24371a8b00e4212bbe925445df28ad7d2a8cb05"}}, "hash": "8269f023ec43f14acade8eb3636b2237e30d368778e84f940682c2a96aed75c3", "text": "Forced sterilization occurs when a person is not given the opportunity to provide her consent at all.84 Of 228 women surveyed in a six-country study in Asia, more than 70 percent said they had been asked or encouraged to have a sterilization procedure.

Fifteen percent of the 40 women surveyed in Nepal were asked to undergo sterilization, and only one felt like she could decline. The Stigma Index report for Nepal showed that 2 percent of the 394 female respondents (women living with HIV) surveyed said that they had been coerced into sterilization.85 The Stigma Index report for Pakistan showed that 4.5 percent of the 228 women surveyed said that they had been coerced into sterilization. Some women interviewed for this study said that they did not understand what sterilization was when they agreed to it, thinking it meant a more sterile mode of delivery. In cases where the choice to be sterilized during delivery was available women did not feel they could consent to it without agreement from husband and in laws and even if they did the hospital required spousal consent. In other cases, incentives such as free formula were offered.86 Other marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as disabled women and very poor rural women, are also at risk of having these critical decisions taken out of their hands. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that women with disabilities have poorer health outcomes, lower education achievements, less economic participation, and higher rates of poverty than women without disabilities. Similarly, poor women may have lower rates of literacy, less access to health care services, and may be pushed into higher-risk behaviours in order to survive. These marginalized groups face layers of stigma that make them more vulnerable to HIV, but also more likely to face violations in health care settings \u2013 including denial of SRH services and coercion into procedures such as sterilization and abortion. A study of 35 women with disabilities in Nepal found that more than 50 percent suffered health problems relating to their disability. Only 20 percent had access to a hospital for medical check-ups, the primary obstacles being financial constraints and a lack of support persons to accompany them to hospital. It also revealed that 4O percent of the women (both married and unmarried) did not have information about contraception. Further, the study found that women with disabilities have inadequate knowledge about sexual and reproductive health and in extreme cases are sterilized.87 Evidence from India suggests that 6 percent of women with disabilities in India have been forcibly sterilized.88 Government-run population-control programmes are also responsible for coerced sterilizations. In a study of 10 reproductive and child health camps (so-called \u201csterilization camps\u201d) in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state, researchers witnessed \u201cunconcealed disregard for standards of informed consent\u2026. Poor, illiterate women were rushed through the consent process. They were asked to put their thumb-print on the consent form without being read its content or having the procedure fully explained. Women were informed only about sterilization and no other possible long-term methods of family planning.\u201d89 In addition to lack of adherence to standards of informed consent, the study found that the standards of medical practice, such as using separate gloves, clean tables, and sterilized instruments were not upheld either.

Hospital staff told her it was nothing major, and that she did not require surgery. But at the private hospital where she was first diagnosed, doctors had told her to get rid of the fibroid. Selvi, who lives with HIV/AIDS, was later diagnosed with a tumour that had spread to her ovaries. She had to undergo a surgery at a private hospital, which set her back by INR 40, 000. \u201cI did not have enough money and could barely afford the treatment.\u201d102 She suffered from excessive bleeding for 18 months before finally getting the surgery she needed.

Women living with HIV bear a higher risk for cervical cancer and must have access to screening services. However, the hostility these women faced from hospital staff as well as the inconvenience and cost of having to go further afield to seek treatment deters them from seeking the care, testing, and/or treatment that they critically needed. For all women, but especially those living with HIV, such denial of treatment can have serious health consequences.103 Testimony \u201cI was detected with HIV before my delivery.

Before my caesarean my doctor was asking other nurses to assist, but they all had excuses like, \u2018I have a cut finger\u2019. Eventually, the doctor got staff to help. When I had the caesarean the bed was covered with hard disposable plastic. Afterwards, I was very cold due to the air conditioning and I asked for a cover, but nobody would give me a blanket. My status was disclosed. My bed was marked as HIV-positive and the clinic staff started to ask questions like, \u2018How did you get infected?\u2019 I was not given any bed sheets, and the day after the delivery I had to leave the hospital.\u201d 110 \u2013 Sharmin, Bangladesh Sexual assault examinations: Although this specific subject is not directly linked to KAWG, sexual assault examinations (particularly the \u2018two finger test\u2019 described below) are key in terms of illustrating not only the general level of violence against women in society but also the discriminatory attitudes of health care workers when they are dealing with sexual violence. The stigmatizing attitude and lack of adherence to protocols that protect women\u2019s rights are directly relevant for KAWG seeking care and treatment related to SRH, including pregnancy or STD and HIV testing. These practices are also a serious deterrent to KAWG seeking assistance in the case of sexual assault, especially female sex workers (including those who are transgender), who already expect that they will be humiliated and treated in a discriminatory way in formal health care settings and who will be particularly discriminated against by a test that is based on a concept of sexual \u2018habituation\u2019 to evaluate the assault experienced. Studies have reported many practices that directly violate the rights of women who are seeking help in rape and sexual assault cases. These include the lack of uniform protocols for seeking consent, establishing history, conducting examinations, or collecting evidence111 \u2013 resulting in a humiliating and degrading experience for many women who are survivors of sexual assault. Of the problematic practices, one that activist groups have raised repeated concerns about is the \u2018two-finger test\u2019 \u2013 an archaic test involving \u201ca doctor inserting fingers in a rape victim\u2019s vagina to determine the presence or absence of the hymen and the so-called \u2018laxity\u2019 of the vagina.\u201d112 This test continues to be prevalent in India and Pakistan. Apart from the fact that the test in outdated and unscientific, it is often very painful, often done without the survivor\u2019s consent, and may be an echo of the assault she has experienced, leaving her feeling further violated and traumatized.

In Pakistan, for the majority of rape cases the primary health facility provider that a rape survivor has access to is the medico-legal officer. Unfortunately, these officers provide neither counselling and referral services nor screening for STIs or HIV. What they do focus on is the two-finger test, as described above. In Pakistan\u2019s social and cultural environment with the inescapable stigma attached to loss of virginity, the findings of the two-finger test invariably result in discrimination and stigmatization by the medical practitioners, law enforcement agencies, and society at large. Fear of such stigma contributes to the low reporting and prosecution rates for rape cases. In fact, statistics show that of 138 medical legal examinations that were conducted during the first six months of 2011, only 41 First Information Reports116 were registered.117 This means that despite the available medical evidence, women and girls were not willing or able to pursue criminal cases against their rapists. Misinformation Misinformation given by health care practitioners compounds the barriers faced by women in enjoying their right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and other rights. Several women from a multi-country study in Asia reported this type of misinformation. For instance, one woman reported that she was informed that the risk of her baby getting HIV was 60 percent, another was told not to have unprotected sex as that might transmit HIV to the baby, another was warned of the virus \u201cswitching\u201d between her and her husband, and yet another was prescribed Paracetamol (a widely used over-the-counter pain reliever) daily for a year. Callous and unprofessional prognoses also seems common, with one woman being told to prepare for death and another told not to save money as she would not have a long life.118 Several women reported the doctors behaving rudely and judgmentally and making unwarranted comments about their sexual behaviour. As mentioned above, improperly trained staff who do not adhere to protocols on confidentiality and disclosure create barriers to women accessing critical HIV-related services. Similarly, misinformation given by staff seriously affects the way that women are treated after disclosure of their status. Health care providers who are advising HIV-positive women need comprehensive training in stigma reduction as well as technical training to enable them to provide holistic counselling, which includes the family, and to provide accurate information on HIV care, treatment, and modes of transmission. 115 See Narayanamma v. State of Karnataka with State of Karnataka v. Muniyappa and others (1994), 5 SCC 728, para. 4(iv). See also, State of Punjab v. Ramdev Singh (2004), 1 SCC 421, para. 5; and State of Uttar Pradesh v.

Bangladesh acceded to the convention in 2000, but has not yet ratified it.119 The ICCPR obligates state parties to respect the civil and political rights of citizens. At the core of the convention is the non-discrimination guarantee. Non-discrimination (article 26): \u201cAll persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status The UN General Assembly\u2019s Human Rights Committee (HRC), which monitors and implements the ICCPR, clarified in General Comment 18 that discrimination should be understood as \u201cany distinction, exclusion, 119 \u201cAccession\u201d is the act whereby a state that has not signed a treaty expresses its consent to become a party to that treaty by depositing an \u201cinstrument of accession.\u201d Accession has the same legal effect as ratification. 34 The legal framework restriction, or preference\u2026which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and freedoms.\u201d120 Relevant also to the rights violation experienced by KAWG in health care settings are: the right to life (article 6); the right to liberty (articles 9 and 12); the right to found a family (article 23), and the right to privacy (article 17). Article 7, the prohibition on torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, is also relevant, particularly in light of the fact that only one of the studied countries \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 has actually ratified the Convention against Torture. Article 17 is relevant, since it has bearing in terms of the protection of confidentiality with regards to HIV status. The article states that \u201cNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence\u201d; and the HRC has stipulated that \u201cCompetent public authorities should only be able to call for such information relating to an individual\u2019s private life the knowledge of which is essential in the interests of society\u2026.\u201d The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), 1976 The ICESCR was ratified by India in 1979, Nepal in 1991, Bangladesh in 1998, and Pakistan in 2008. This convention contains many rights that are pertinent in the context of HIV and AIDS, but in the context of this paper the most pertinent is the right to health. The Right to Health (article 12): \u201cThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\u201d This right has been interpreted as \u201can inclusive right, extending not only to timely and appropriate health care, but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, and access to health-related education and information, including on sexual and reproductive health.\u201d121 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has stipulated that the right to health includes certain freedoms and entitlements some of which are immediately legally enforceable, such as the provision on non-discrimination. This and other issues that have been addressed by the committee are particularly relevant in the context of the violation of women\u2019s rights in health care settings. a.

This is an important point for women and young girls, who may not always have access to the information they need. c. The right to be free from non-consensual medical treatment and the right to have personal medical data remain confidential is also deemed to be a part of the right to health.125 As noted above, forced testing of women, specifically sex workers and pregnant women, and subsequent disclosure of their status is a serious deterrent to women who may need to access health services, and perpetuates stigma and discrimination. The convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (cedaw), 1979 CEDAW was ratified by Bangladesh in 1984, Nepal in 1991, India in 1993, and Pakistan in 1996. Nepal has also ratified the optional protocol to CEDAW in 2001. Non-discrimination, article 3: CEDAW prohibits all forms of discrimination and calls on states parties to take \u201call appropriate measures, including legislation, to ensure the full development and advancement of women, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on a basis of equality with men.\u201d126 Right to Health, article 12: This article is particularly relevant in this context, establishing the obligation for States Parties to \u201ctake all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of health care in order to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, access to health care services, including those related to family planning.\u201d Access to Justice, article 15: This article relates to access to justice, stating that all women must have \u201ca legal capacity identical to that of men and the same opportunities to exercise that capacity.\u201d127 The article refers to equality before the law, equal access to courts, non-discriminatory administration of justice, and equal protection of the law. To achieve substantive equality under the meaning of this article, legal literacy and legal aid must be accessible to women. Equality within the Family, article 16: This article deals with equality and non-discrimination within marriage and family relations, and specifically mentions that men and women must have \u201cthe same rights to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights.\u201d128 Reservations are one way for countries to adhere to a treaty while not being legally bound to specific provisions to which it objects. India entered a reservation under CEDAW on articles 5 and 16, which deal with customary and personal laws. This means that they do not have to take action under articles that specifically deal with \u201cthe social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women,\u201d129 with a view to modifying customary practices that are predicated upon unequal relations between the sexes.

Nepal and Bangladesh acceded132 to the convention in 1991 and 1998, respectively. However, it is important to note that the prohibition of torture, first put forward in the UDHR, is recognized as an absolute and non- derogable norm of international law, binding on all countries regardless of whether they have ratified the CAT. This convention defines torture (article 1), and commits parties to taking effective measures to prevent any act of torture in any territory under their jurisdiction (article 2), including ensuring that torture is a criminal offense (article 4).133 In the context of this report, CAT is significant because of recent global developments recognising violations of rights in health care settings as torture. As mentioned earlier, the report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture has provided examples of several abuses that are tantamount to torture or ill-treatment, some of which are particularly relevant in the context of this report. The report recognizes that \u201cabuse and mistreatment of women seeking reproductive health services can cause tremendous and lasting physical and emotional suffering, inflicted on the basis of gender. Examples of such violations include abusive treatment and humiliation in institutional settings; involuntary sterilization; denial of legally available health services such as abortion and post abortion care; forced abortions and sterilizations\u2026violations of medical secrecy and confidentiality in health care settings\u2026.\u201d134 The Special Rapporteur\u2019s report also addresses discrimination towards and mistreatment of people from marginalized communities in health care settings, including PLHIV, sex workers, and transgender people. Based on an \u201cevolving\u201d definition of torture, the report concluded that torture or ill-treatment in any facility that is meant to provide health care or medical treatment \u2013 whether private or public \u2013 can be considered a violation of the Convention. The significance of reframing the debate around health care violations within the torture convention is related to the above-mentioned non-derogable nature of the prohibition of torture. The Special Rapporteur suggests that by reframing violence and abuses in health care settings as prohibited ill treatment, victims and advocates are afforded stronger legal protection and redress for violations of human rights,135 and the \u201cfocus on the prohibition of torture strengthens the call for accountability.\u201d136 131 Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, General Recommendation No. 24, Women and Health, article 12 (2 February 1999), at www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/77bae3190a903f8d80256785005599ff?Opendocument. 132 Becoming a \u201csignatory\u201d to a treaty indicates that a state is obliged to refrain, in good faith, from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty.

This is a potential avenue for redress for victims of rights violations in health care settings. However, in each case this is contingent upon States Parties also being party to the optional protocols related to the particular convention. In the case of CAT, the individual complaint mechanism is contingent upon states making a declaration under article 22. As noted above, Pakistan has ratified the CAT, but it has not made a declaration under article 22. Of the studied countries, only Bangladesh and Nepal have ratified the Optional Protocol to CEDAW, thereby accepting that individuals under their jurisdictions may approach the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women with individual complaints. None of the countries have ratified the optional protocol to ICESCR, and only Nepal has acceded to the First Optional Protocol for the ICCPR.141 Domestic legislation As we have seen, all the countries studied for this report have ratified the major international human rights conventions. However, with dualist legal frameworks like those in most of South Asia, such international conventions related to rights are not automatically applicable in domestic law upon being ratified.

This is the case in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. In contrast, in Nepal, Section 9 of the Nepal Treaty Act (1990) prescribes a monist approach. This means that once Nepal has ratified an international treaty through its Parliament, if there is a conflict between the treaty and current domestic law, then the latter shall be invalid.142 Significantly, the Supreme Court in India and Nepal have called upon these international obligations while adjudicating cases, have declared the state to be bound to them, and have thereby affected law reform directly upon the basis of international conventions.143 Some of the conventions also specifically obligate the States Parties to enact domestic legislation to give effect to the rights set forth in the treaty. For instance, article 2 of CEDAW states that States Parties must \u201cadopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women\u201d and \u201cestablish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination.\u201d Constitutional provisions Equality provisions Article 27 of the Constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh (1972) declares that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection.

Government of Nepal (2007), at njanepal.org.np/Anex_2.pdf. 144 It should be noted that in 2007 Nepal passed an Interim Constitution, intended to be enforceable only until a new Constitution was framed by the Constituent Assembly. At the time of this writing (August 2013), Nepal has no valid Constitution and is under an interim election government, agreed upon by political parties. While the expired Interim Constitution can no longer be relied upon as the basic law of Nepal, it remains the constituent document most recently in place, and may be a reflection of the provisions that Nepal envisages going forward. Accordingly, this study will consider the relevant provisions of the Interim Constitution. The legal framework Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 39 i on any woman. Together, these provisions establish the foundation of a legal framework to protect women\u2019s equality and right to non-discrimination (on the basis of gender and caste). The additional provisions related to reproductive health rights and domestic violence are not detailed provisions, but are significant inclusions. Each country, in acknowledging that they retain the right to make special provisions for women under their non-discrimination guarantees, technically allow space for the adoption of supplementary provisions or new legislation to deal with women particularly vulnerable to discrimination \u2013 for instance, KAWG. The right to health The right to health is enshrined in the four constitutions in various forms. For instance, Nepal explicitly includes the right to health in its enumeration of fundamental rights. Article 16 sets out \u201cthe right to get basic health service free of cost from the State as provided for in the law.\u201d Similarly, Bangladesh\u2019s Constitution recognizes, in article 15, that \u201cit shall be a fundamental responsibility of the state to attain\u2026a steady improvement in the material and cultural standards of living of the people\u2026with a view to securing for its citizens the basic necessities of life including food, shelter, clothing, education and medical care.\u201d The Indian Constitution, on the other hand, does not contain a fundamental right to health, but article 21 recognizes every individual\u2019s right to life and liberty, which the Supreme Court has held includes the right to health.145 In addition, there are the Directive Principles of State Policy that address issues related to health, such as article 47, which declares that \u201cthe State shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties.\u201d Intervention by the courts: Denial of treatment, India In a notable Delhi case, in January 2011 a poor, pregnant HIV-positive woman from Bihar was in urgent need of a blood transfusion before her caesarean delivery.

Subash Chandra Bose (1991), the Supreme Court relied on international instruments and concluded that the right to health is a fundamental right and that article 21 forms the basis of this right. 146 See hrln.org/hrln/hiv-aids/pils-a-cases/629-hiv-ve-pregnant-woman-denied-treatment.html. 147 Paschim Bengal Khet Mazdoor Society v. State of West Bengal, AIR (1996) SC 242. 148 Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust v. Union of India-Supreme Court of India. See details at www.lawyerscollective.org/hiv-and-law/ current-cases.html. 40 i In the case of Pakistan, the right to health can also be found in the constitutionally-mandated principles of policy, wherein article 38 of the Constitution declares that the state is responsible for providing the basic necessities of life, such as food, clothing, housing, education, and medical relief, for all such citizens \u2013 irrespective of sex, caste, creed, or race \u2013 as are permanently or temporarily unable to earn their livelihood on account of infirmity, sickness, or unemployment. These assurances are very relevant in the context of women living with HIV and other key affected women and girls who often have limited safety nets. The right to privacy Only Nepal specifically recognizes the right to privacy. article 28 of the Interim Constitution states that \u201cexcept in circumstances provided by law, privacy in relation to the person and to their residence, property, documents, records, statistics and correspondence, and their reputation are inviolable.\u201d Intervention by the courts: Right to privacy, Nepal In the case of Sapana Pradhan Malla v. Government of Nepal and Others (2006), the Court issued an order for a law providing for a certain level of privacy to be maintained in sensitive litigation, including where people living with HIV were involved. In this case, it was contended that no legal provisions existed to protect the privacy of people living with HIV who were involved in litigation and that this is inconsistent with the guarantee of privacy at article 28 of the Interim Constitution. Ms. Malla further argued that this was inconsistent with Nepal\u2019s commitments under a number of international human rights instruments. It was asserted that if the privacy of certain petitioners was not protected, then they would be unable to exercise their right of judicial remedy, due to the stigma surrounding HIV. The Court issued a directive order requiring the Prime Minister, the Office of the Council of Ministers, and the Ministry of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Management to draft a law providing for a certain level of privacy to be maintained in sensitive litigation where people living with HIV were involved. The directive order further stipulated the law should set out the rights and duties of the involved parties, noting that privacy had to be maintained from the time of registration of the case in the police office or law court until disposal of the case. The Court also issued guidelines for the interim period (until the law is enacted), which are required to be followed in all proceedings. The guidelines require that in sensitive lawsuits, the \u201cpersonal introductory information\u201d of the person living with HIV is kept confidential throughout the litigation process. Although this judgement does not specifically refer to health care settings, it is certainly relevant in terms of encouraging KAWG to access justice mechanisms with the knowledge that their identity will be protected. Indian Courts have held that \u201cthe right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article 21.\u201d149 149 In 1994, in R. Rajagopal v.

In relation to the disclosure of Mr. X\u2019s HIV status, the Court found that the right to privacy of Mr. X clashed with the right to life of his prospective bride. The Supreme Court held that her right to life \u201cwould positively include the right to be told that a person, with whom she was proposed to be married, was the victim of a deadly disease, which was sexually communicable.\u201d They further stated that \u201cthe Right [to privacy] is not absolute and may be lawfully restricted for the prevention of crime, disorder or protection of health or morals or protection of rights and freedom of others.\u201d Unfortunately, the Court did not use this opportunity to lay down specific protocols to be followed in the case of involuntary disclosure. The International Guidelines on Human rights and HIV do stipulate specific criteria that should be met in this situation. These include ensuring that \u201cthe HIV-positive person in question has been thoroughly counselled; Counselling of the HIV-positive person has failed to achieve appropriate behavioural changes; The HIV-positive person has refused to notify, or consent to the notification of his/her partner(s); A real risk of HIV transmission to the partner(s) exists; The HIV-positive person is given reasonable advance notice; The identity of the HIV-positive person is concealed from the partner(s), if this is possible in practice; and Follow-up is provided to ensure support to those involved.\u201d151 In Pakistan, the right to privacy is linked to the idea of the dignity of man, with article 14 (1) stating the \u201cthe dignity of man and, subject to law, the privacy of home shall be inviolable.\u201d The right to privacy in the context of a person\u2019s home and communication is also mentioned in article 43 of Bangladesh\u2019s Constitution. The right to privacy is relevant in protecting women against disclosure of private medical information, including HIV test results. As we have seen, the lack of confidentiality afforded by health care practitioners in South Asia is a violation of the right to privacy and also undermines the right to the highest attainable standard of health, since fear of disclosure acts as a major deterrent to women seeking HIV testing and care. Mandatory testing also violates the right to privacy.152 Constitutional remedy against violation of fundamental rights Clearly there are common threads in these constitutions in terms of guaranteeing fundamental rights to equality, non-discrimination, and, to some extent, the right to health and privacy. Each of these constitutions also contains provisions allowing citizens the right to claim legal remedies against violation of their fundamental rights. Article 32 of the Interim Constitution of Nepal guarantees the right to 150 Mr. X v Hospital Z (1998) 8 SCC 296, cited in Bhardwaj and Divan, Sexual Health and Human Rights, p. 29. 151 Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights (2006), Guideline 20 (h). 152 Mandatory testing that is not based on informed consent is a violation of the right to privacy has had negative public health consequences and has proven to be detrimental to HIV-prevention efforts. Mandatory testing is not confined to employment contexts. There have been many reports of transgender people as well as sex workers and people who use drugs (PWUD) being routinely subjected to HIV tests without their consent in healthcare settings, communities, and in state custody. 42 claim for the enforcement of these rights under article 107,153 which states that any citizen can file a petition in the Supreme Court to have a law voided on the grounds that it violates or imposes restrictions on the enjoyment of fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution. In this case, as conferred by the Interim Constitution, the Supreme Court has the extraordinary power to issue necessary and appropriate orders to enforce such rights or settle related disputes.154 In Bangladesh, article 44 guarantees the right to move the High Court Division in accordance with Clause 102 for the enforcement of fundamental rights. This provision gives any aggrieved party the right to file a writ challenging the violation of a fundamental right and allowing them to approach the High Court, which as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b49b4f8-d0f5-460d-8298-92c94c947027": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b49b4f8-d0f5-460d-8298-92c94c947027", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "090b1a37714e2630913b183962677c564540e07bb593e5b731d02c31fe1f5cae"}}, "hash": "090b1a37714e2630913b183962677c564540e07bb593e5b731d02c31fe1f5cae", "text": "the designated court for constitutional cases, may recommend a quick remedy. Similarly, in India an aggrieved party may directly move the Supreme Court under article 32 or the High Court under article 226. However, it is important to recognize that the fundamental rights enshrined in the various constitutions are enforceable against the state, not private actors. Therefore, government-run hospitals and health centres in each country would come under the purview of these rights, but discrimination in private health care settings remains largely unregulated as far as constitutional provisions are concerned. In addition, although the directive principles of state policy are technically not enforceable in courts, Indian courts have held that \u201cthe Courts can use the Directive Principles so as to interpret [fundamental] rights as much in consonance with the Directive Principles as is possible\u201d155 and therefore should be considered a tool that can be used legally to some extent. However, these provisions become meaningless in the face of barriers to access to justice for KAWG, including low literacy, lack of awareness of their rights, and the prohibitive cost of seeking legal help \u2013 including costs involved with employing lawyers, filing papers, and traveling to the nearest courts. The constitutions of the studied countries do recognize this and attempt to address these issues. For instance, Article 39 of the Indian Constitution declares that \u201cthe State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.\u201d Legislation There is a significant dearth of domestic legislation dealing with violations that take place in health care settings, with the notable exception of the Reproductive Health care and Rights Act (2013) and Sindh HIV and AIDS Control Treatment and Protection Act (2013) of Pakistan, which have recently been passed into law, and the national HIV bills in Nepal, India, and Pakistan, all of which are currently pending. However, each country does have legislation that could be interpreted and expanded to include protection for KAWG in health care settings, or at least act as a model for different legislation to be framed around the issue. Below, this report examines those legal provisions that are potentially relevant in the case of health care violations. 153 Article 32 states that \u201cthe right to proceed in the manner set forth in article 107 for the enforcement of the rights conferred in this part is guaranteed.\u201d 154 For these purposes, the Supreme Court may, with a view to imparting full justice and providing the appropriate remedy, issue appropriate orders and writs, including the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, and quo warranto. However, except on the ground of absence of jurisdiction, the Supreme Court shall not interfere under this clause with the proceedings of the Legislature-Parliament concerning the violation of privileges and penalties imposed there to. 155 Adv.

The legal framework Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 43 Laws relating to discrimination There is a serious dearth of legislation that deals specifically with discrimination in health care settings in the countries examined. However, there are specific laws that could be used, expanded, or adapted to provide for non-discrimination in health care settings. These are discussed below. India The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights, and Full Participation) Act, 1995 This act attempts to give effect to article 14 of the Constitution in terms of equal opportunity. Globally, activists have been advocating for the inclusion of PLHIV within disability laws on the basis that the stigma and discrimination experienced by PLHIV is similar to that experienced by other people with disabilities. Many countries, including Germany, Norway, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, have now extended their disability laws to include PLHIV.156 Although this is not currently the case in India, one option for protecting the rights of PLHIV in India would be for the Person with Disabilities Act to be expanded to include PLHIV and to be applicable to the private sector. This act provides for special schemes in employment and public facilities, but does not include provisions on disabled women and health care settings. Useful additions would therefore relate specifically to including PLHIV within the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "889d6387-e241-4399-af85-82ffa8a06288": {"__data__": {"id_": "889d6387-e241-4399-af85-82ffa8a06288", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f029992d459fd579cdc2a552ce4d57ab058ff030d71d2350d95674a999f26ec"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae5639b6-4936-471f-82da-7a2604c49f9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d28154458ccb620f9cca5af66e979d5a08cf6255f195d5c1fc0f8fb845c6d80"}}, "hash": "f21a3fecce1b7961e261918ba9d5b7e3546e1a92236f7041f0b7d5391ae3e614", "text": "purview of the act, prohibiting coerced abortions and sterilizations and emphasizing informed consent and confidentiality, all of which are relevant to disabled women as well as women living with HIV. It is worth mentioning that India ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Disability Convention) in October 2007. In response to this, a new bill, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill,157 was drafted by the Ministry of Disability Affairs after several multistakeholder consultations, with the aim of bringing the law in line with India\u2019s obligations under the convention. This bill contains several key provisions that would be useful in terms of protection of WLHIV in health care settings. One example is the stipulation that \u201cNo person with disability shall be subject to any medical procedure which leads to or could lead to infertility without their free and informed consent.\u201d158 The bill also provides for equal access to family planning information; addresses the issue of health under a separate chapter; and provides for state authorities to implement programmes relating to sexual and reproductive health, especially for women with disabilities.159 It also provides for access to justice for people with disabilities, stipulating that they have equal rights before the law and \u201chave the right to move any court; tribunal; authority; commission; or any other body having judicial or quasi-judicial or investigative powers\u201d160 to ensure these rights. State authorities are instructed to make provisions ensuring that schemes, facilities, and services are accessible to facilitate access to justice. Specific penalties are laid out for a range of offences, including wrongful medical procedures that lead or are likely to lead to infertility and forceful termination of pregnancy.161 If PLHIV were to be included into the purview of an act like the one above, it would provide a considerable level of protection for WLHIV in health care settings. 155 For further explanation on this issue please see Interrights Written Submission on Kiyutin v. Russia, Application no. 2700/10. www. interights.org 157 For full text, see Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Department of Disability Affairs, Draft Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill (2012), at socialjustice.nic.in/pdf/draftpwd12.pdf. 158 Ibid., article 17. 159 Ibid., chapter 5, article 30 160 Ibid., article 20 (1). 161 Ibid., article 132 and 134 (imprisonment not exceeding seven years and ten years, respectively). 44 The Equal Remuneration Act (ERA), 1976 This act specifically addresses inequity and discrimination within the workplace, but only in terms of gender-based discrimination in wages. While this is not directly applicable to KAWG or health care, legal activists have pointed out that this law is useful in terms of \u201cdetermining responsibility for discrimination by companies and corporations\u201d162 and \u201cconfirms the commitment and intent of the State to right the wrongs of discrimination.\u201d163 By enacting legislation like this, the state brings private corporations under its purview with regard to constitutionally prohibited discrimination and unequal policies. Similarly, anti-discrimination legislation focusing on health care settings could apply to hospitals at the state, district, and community level, including privately run hospitals and private clinics, and make specific provisions for marginalized groups \u2013 including KAWG. Nepal The Civil Rights Act The Civil Rights Act (1955) states at Article 3(a) that \u201cno citizen shall be denied equality before law and equal protection of law.\u201d164 The act also provides, at article 5, that the Government of Nepal has the power to make special provisions for women, children, and underprivileged class of citizens. The Caste Based Discrimination Act Caste Based Discrimination and Untouchability (Offence and Punishment) Act (2011) makes it an offence to discriminate against a person on the basis of caste.

This act banned prenatal sex determination. In chapter 3 the act stipulates that no person, being a relative or the husband of the pregnant woman, shall seek or encourage the conduct of any prenatal diagnostic techniques on her except for the purpose specified in clause 2. The doctor involved must also ensure that: \u2022 he has explained all known side- and after-effects of the ultrasound on the pregnant woman concerned; \u2022 he has obtained in the prescribed form her written consent to undergo such procedures in the language that she understands; and \u2022 a copy of her written consent obtained under clause (b) is given to the pregnant woman. This act is relevant here in as much as it should have the effect of protecting women from being forced into an abortion by not allowing family members to get information on the sex of the foetus. It also lays out strict protocols in terms of consent of the woman to the procedure, and stipulates that she must understand what she is consenting to. This is a useful model to follow in terms of establishing protocols for KAWG seeking SRH- related procedures. Indian Medical Council Regulations, 2002 The Indian Medical Council Regulations also specifically state that under no circumstance must a sex determination test be done with the intent of terminating a pregnancy unless the termination is in consonance with the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act. \u201cAny act of termination of pregnancy of normal female foetus amounting to female foeticide shall be regarded as professional misconduct on the part of the physician leading to penal erasure besides rendering him liable to criminal proceedings as per the provisions of this Act.\u201d167 Also explicitly prohibited by the regulations are breaching confidentiality and failure to obtain written consent from both husbands and wives for operations that may cause sterility.168 Intervention by the courts: Guidelines for performing Sterilisation: India169 In Ramakant Rai v. Union of India (2003) a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition cited data from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra regarding female sterilization government practices that lacked counselling or informed consent, lacked pre- and post-operative care, and included unhygienic and un-anesthetized operating conditions, sterilization of minors, coercion, and cruelty. The PIL requested the Court to direct the state governments to comply with the Ministry of Health and Welfare\u2019s Guidelines on Standards of Female Sterilization, enacted in October 1999.

Nepal Country Code (Muluki Ain) Chapter 10 of the Country Code deals with homicide, but also abortion and the abandonment of a baby. The Country Code provides that it is an offence to coerce, threaten, or offer abortion to a pregnant women, with specified exceptions.170 Number 28B states: \u2018If an abortion is carried out by a qualified and registered health worker upon fulfilling the procedures as prescribed by the Government of Nepal, it shall not be deemed to be the offence of abortion, in the following circumstances: \u2022 If the abortion of a foetus of up to twelve weeks is carried out with the consent of the pregnant woman. \u2022 If the abortion of a foetus of up to eighteen weeks caused by rape or incest is carried out with the consent of the pregnant woman. \u2022 If the abortion is carried out with the consent of the pregnant woman and on the advice of an expert pursuant to the prevailing law that if abortion is not carried out, the life of such a woman may be in danger or the physical or mental health may be deteriorated or a disabled child may be born.\u201d 170 Number 28, chapter 10, Country Code: \u201cAny person who commits abortion or causes abortion by doing any act with intention or knowingly or with sufficient reasons to believe that such an act is likely to cause an abortion shall be punished.\u201d Number 28A, chapter 10, Country Code: \u201cNo one shall cause abortion upon causing coercion, threat, lure or offer (Pralovan) to a pregnant woman. In cases where a person causes abortion in that manner, the person shall be liable to the following punishment....\u201d The legal framework Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 47 This provision makes it unlawful for anyone but a trained medical professional to carry out an abortion, and further emphasises the requirement of a woman\u2019s consent prior to carrying out a medical termination of a foetus. On the face of it, this provision forms the basis for a charge against any non-qualified person who carries out an abortion as well as a medical professional who carries out a termination without the consent of a woman. The Country Code further specifically provides that a person that discovers the gender of a foetus with the intention of abortion commits an offence.171 The prohibition on coercion, threat, or offering women an abortion could act as a protective provision for pregnant KAWG who are being pressured into an abortion. Chapter 12 of the Country Code covers medical procedures. Chapter 12, number 2, sets out the requirements for surgery (in the best interest of the patient) and stipulates that the consent of the patient is required. Importantly, this provision emphasizes the requirement of consent for surgery. This provision would not be applicable for minor procedures or medical treatment that was not in the category of surgery. However, it should be applicable in the context of, for instance, forced sterilizations. Pakistan Reproductive Health Care and Rights Act, 2013172 This act provides a framework for a rights-based national SRH programme, promoting non-discrimination in access to services and information on the basis of \u201crace, colour sex, creed or any other criteria of discrimination.\u201d Most relevant in terms of the focus of this report is the provision stating that reproductive health care services shall ensure that \u201cno person shall be subjected to forced pregnancy, sterilization, abortion or birth control.\u201d173 Other key provisions include: \u2022 Promotion of the right to gender-neutral information by ensuring access to \u201cinformation related to reproductive rights and responsibilities within a gender perspective, which is free from stereotypes, discriminatory and obscurantist customs.\u201d174 \u2022 Recognition that all couples have the right to information and to ensure reproductive life decisions are made with informed consent.

It simply states that the federal government must oversee the implementation of the act and make rules for this purpose.175 This act is very new, but its focus is relevant to this report and it reflects the type of legislation that could fill some of the gaps in protecting women, including KAWG, in health care settings. The inclusion of \u201cany other criteria\u201d in the non-discrimination provision could form the basis for claims from KAWG in terms of denial of services or information. The provision also avoids imposing restrictions on the basis of marital status and age, and this is relevant for young girls and single women. Nevertheless, the inclusion of provisions dealing specifically with WLHIV, noting their specific vulnerability to violations and establishing protocols related to counselling, testing, confidentiality, and consent, would be very useful. In addition, provisions establishing complaint mechanisms and imposing sanctions for those violating rights need to be included. 171 Number 28C, chapter 10, Country Code: \u201cNo one shall commit or cause to be committed an act to identify (determine) the gender of the fetus for the purpose of committing the offence of abortion.

The Act has been updated in 2010 but the changes largely relate to empowering the council to draw up new rules and regulations and the Act relies on the already established guidelines concerning conduct of physicians. The Council is supposed to ensure adherence to the Code of Medical Ethics that specifically provides that: \u201cIn all dealings with patients the interest and advantage of their health should alone influence his conduct towards them. As their trust to their profession is great, so the obligation to be true to their interest is greater, and any single failure in this respect is wholly discreditable and inexcusable.\u201d176 Guideline 4 specifically prohibits medical or dental practitioners from disclosing confidential information about a patient. Guideline 5 in referring to the disregard of personal responsibility to patient states: \u201cGross negligence in respect of his professional duties to his patient may be regarded as misconduct sufficient to justify the suspension or removal of the name of a medical/dental practitioner from the register.\u201d Guideline 6 stipulates that offences liable to disciplinary action by the council include \u201cindecent behaviour or assault.\u201d Women who were mistreated, denied treatment, or coerced into treatment that they did not want could conceivably use the above guidelines, to initiate proceedings against physicans. The Council has the authority to respond to complaints and to temporarily suspend or permanently remove the practitioner from the register for misconduct. However researchers have noted that due to \u201cinadequate manpower support - both technical and administrative \u2013 inadequate resources, absence of any monitoring mechanism and follow- up action, lack of accountability, and lack of capacity in terms of enforcement of its own mandate,\u201d177 these are largely ineffective provisions. India Indian Medical Council Regulations, 2002 The Indian Medical Council (professional conduct, etiquette, and ethics) Regulations were established under the Indian Medical Council Act (1956).

The provision would be strengthened if it mentioned cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, which could incorporate less severe offences and which is a human rights violation recognized under the UDHR and the ICCPR. The regulations state that specific acts of \u201ccommission or omission\u201d on the part of a physician constitute professional misconduct, rendering him/her liable for disciplinary action. Complaints against physicians accused of violating the code of conduct can be brought to the council, and a disciplinary board has the power to strike the offending doctor off the register. Each case is supposed to be evaluated and decided within a period of six months.181 Research from 2006 to 2007 shows that the Medical Council did receive \u201c732 complaints relating to ethical matters\u2026of which 293 were referred to the relevant state councils/authorities for necessary action, 58 are awaiting clarification or further details from complainants and/or comments from the doctors in question, while 381 complaints have been resolved.\u201d182 An amendment in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, also gives patients the right to sue or file a civil or criminal case against a physician, depending on the nature and severity of the issue. Nepal Medical Council Act, 1964 The Nepal Medical Council Act grants the Medical Council the power to remove a medical practitioner from the Medical Council Register in the event that the practitioner is convicted and sentenced to a criminal offence involving moral turpitude, or on the basis of misconduct related to the profession if decided by two thirds of the members of the Medical Council.183 As in Bangladesh and India, a woman who experiences a rights violation by a medical practitioner can inform the Medical Council of the violation with a view to having the medical practitioner\u2019s name removed from the register. A medical practitioner who is not registered with the Medical Council would face obstacles to practising as a doctor. A similar provision exists in the Nepal Health Professional Council Act (1997) and the Nepal Nursing Council Act (1996) in relation to qualified nurses and allied health professionals.184 Pakistan The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) Code of Ethics, 2001 (revised) The PMDC Code of Ethics, applicable to physicians in Pakistan, contains detailed provisions on consent, confidentiality, and non-discrimination. In a comprehensive non-discrimination provision, the code states that the physician \u201cwill bear in mind the obligation of preserving life and will not discriminate on the basis of age, sex, gender, class, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, health conditions, marital discord, domestic or parental status, criminal record, or any other applicable bias as proscribed by law, and ensure that personal beliefs do not prejudice patient care.\u201d This is a significant provision, which clearly covers many of the grounds 180 Ibid., para. 6.6. 181 Ibid., paras. 8.2 and 8.4. 182 Rand Corporation, International Comparison of Ten Medical Regulatory Systems (UK Medical Council, 2009). 183 Note: After two years a medical practitioner can reapply for registration, but must show reasonable grounds for doing so. 184 For more information on the council composition, see www.nmc.org.np/contents/history-information.html. 50 upon which PLHIV and key HIV-affected women and girls typically experience discrimination in health care settings.185 The Code of Ethics states that \u201cthe physician has a right to and should withhold disclosure of information received in a confidential context, whether this be from a patient, or as a result of being involved in the management of the patient\u2026except in certain specific circumstances where s/he may carefully and selectively disclose information where health, safety and life of other individual/s may be involved.\u201d186 The Code of Ethics also states that all patients have a right to decide on their own treatment or to refuse treatment based upon all available information relevant to their decision.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "460936ea-d97c-4e7b-b7c0-4ddb6c125d31": {"__data__": {"id_": "460936ea-d97c-4e7b-b7c0-4ddb6c125d31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df649033dce740e2bcdd17593502ff2d096822b1167dbd21f15d2cacdb036460"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e412357-9f3e-4ce1-a17f-91af80696a91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b95b86890e20a3f3a1aed5da9e2e22f45dc421fba7e647a1d8932425587f92ce"}}, "hash": "8a78691724b0a34791aaaf7e93f58ce5d0eaf7ed59e439ae390c65c041c22548", "text": "It also requires that \u201cwhen taking consent the physician should consider issues of adequate disclosure, the patient\u2019s capacity, and the degree of voluntariness.\u201d187 As with the Medical Council rules in the other countries, physicians found", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22891179-cd0b-4560-84c4-b4f942ee31ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "22891179-cd0b-4560-84c4-b4f942ee31ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5dcbc2854c67fd917dd220dbd9d573fdd68837b9c79a332f07b83d5486948f2"}}, "hash": "e5dcbc2854c67fd917dd220dbd9d573fdd68837b9c79a332f07b83d5486948f2", "text": "guilty of contravening these rules can be struck off the register. There is also a provision for taking a case to court, if required.188 This would presumably occur in situations where the offence is serious enough to warrant a penalty that the Disciplinary Committee cannot enforce. Thus, it seems that a woman who experiences a rights violation by a medical practitioner can inform the Medical Council with a view to this being the first site of complaint, and may then enlist them to assist her in escalating the complaint to the courts. To initiate an inquiry, the complainant must provide an affidavit attested by a magistrate. Research shows that these complaint provisions are being utilised to some extent. PMDC received complaints against some 2,500 doctors between 2004 and 2008, of whom approximately 500 have been \u2018penalised\u2019 and four have appealed the decision in the courts. However, critics suggest that there is too little transparency when a disciplinary proceeding begins, and that bribery and corruption play some role in the raising and the resolution of complaints.189 Assault provisions in country codes During the research phase for this report, a thorough examination of domestic violence and rape laws was undertaken. However, while there is extensive legislation in all the studied countries, and while the linkages between violence against women and HIV have been noted, a detailed analysis of these laws was deemed to be beyond the scope of this report since very few provisions in the legislation would be applicable to the rights of women in health care settings. This notwithstanding, a limited number of provisions in country penal codes on assault and harm use particular language that may be directly relevant to violations of KAWG rights in health care settings. These are described below. India Indian Penal Code, Sections 354 and 509 Section 354 penalises any person who assaults or uses criminal force towards any woman with the intention or knowledge that it will outrage her modesty. Section 509 penalises any person who uses language, gestures, or objects with the intention of insulting a woman\u2019s modesty by such use. Although this law does not specifically mention health care settings, it applies to \u201cany person,\u201d and therefore there is no reason why a woman who has been humiliated or harassed in a health care setting should not be able to file a case under these provisions. 185 Para. 11.2.2. 186 Para. 12. 187 Para. 18. 188 Para. 27.1.5. 189 Rand Corporation, International Comparison. The legal framework Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 51 i Case law: Outraging modesty \u2013 India In Rupan Deol Bajaj and another v. KPS Gill and another (a case involving sexual harassment at a party), the court concluded that \u201cthe ultimate test for ascertaining whether modesty has been outraged is the action of the offender such as could be perceived by one which is capable of shocking the sense of decency of a woman.\u201d The respondent attempted to use the defence provided by Section 95 of the Penal Code, which provides that an act is not an offence if it causes harm so slight that it would be considered trivial by an ordinary person. The court cited precedent in determining that the \u2018harm\u2019 caused would include mental injury, and its triviality would depend on the nature of the injury, the position of the parties, and the intent or knowledge behind the action, but not merely on the measure of physical or other injury caused. It is worth noting that the very recent Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance (2013) provides for amendment of the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and the Code of Criminal Procedure on laws related to sexual offences. Passed in the wake of the brutal gang rape and subsequent death of a student in Delhi, in December 2012, the law seeks to be a more rigorous mechanism for cases of sexual violence. The law is significant in this context in as much as it now includes a recognition of graded sexual assault with offences such as \u201cmaking of sexually coloured remarks by a man,\u201d now punishable by one year in prison, and \u201cPhysical contact involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures,\u201d punishable by three years.190 The inclusion of these offences has widened the scope of the law and affords protection for certain types of violations in health care settings. For instance, verbally humiliating treatment such as inappropriate and degrading questions or remarks addressed to sex workers or transgender women would presumably be covered by this provision.

Hospital staff are also explicitly mentioned in section 376 (c), in the context of assault by a person in a position of authority, but specifically relating to prohibiting and making punishable sexual intercourse with a patient. Nepal Country Code (Muluki Ain), Chapter 19 This deals specifically with decency and etiquette. Interestingly, chapter 19 of the Country Code provides protection for women against rape in the context of detention, health care, and guardianship relationships. At chapter 19, number 5, the Country Code makes the following punishable offences: \u2022 \u201cany government employee who commits sexual intercourse or arranges for sexual intercourse by other person with a woman who is imprisoned or detained; \u2022 any medical practitioner or health worker who commits sexual intercourse with a woman who has come to avail medical service at time of rendering medical service or in the place of rendering such service; \u2022 any guardian or caretaker who commits sexual intercourse with a women who is under his guardianship or care; 190 See the Criminal Law (AMENDMENT) Ordinance (2013), Section 354 (a), at mha.nic.in/pdfs/criminalLawAmndmt-040213.pdf. 52 \u2022 any official or employee, in any organization where a woman suffering from mental or physical illness is staying for the purpose of treatment or rehabilitation, who commits sexual intercourse with such a woman.\u201d191 Clearly, this provision could be called upon in the event of the rape of a woman in a health care setting. It is limited in its ambit to \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d however, meaning that it would not protect a woman in the event of sexual assault or other rights violations. Muluki Ain, Chapter 14 This provision defines rape as any act of non-consensual sex with a woman whether married or unmarried. Highly significant is the recent amendment to the code, after the Supreme Court ruling192 that has specifically defined rape within marriage \u2013 regardless of the age of the wife \u2013 as rape, attracting the same penalties as rape of a non-spouse, 3\u20135 years imprisonment.193 Nepal is the only country of the four to have a provision that recognises marital rape. Although, as stated above, general laws on rape and violence are not being addressed by this report, we are briefly addressing marital rape as an exception, given the links between intimate partner violence and HIV.194 Laws supporting consensual sexual activity are laws that protect women within the family and are linked to their ability to negotiate condom use and have access to family planning services. These structural changes could therefore have a significant impact on how women interact with the health care system at large. HIV/AIDS bills HIV and AIDS-related bills or draft legislation that addresses some of the primary gaps in the current law exists in Nepal, India, and Pakistan. Unfortunately, this legislation has not been passed into law in any of the countries under discussion, with the exception of an important provincial law in Sindh in Pakistan (where many of the responsibilities of the central government have recently been devolved to the provincial level). It is worth looking at the provisions of the pending bills as examples of the type of legislation that could make giant strides towards protecting the rights of people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS in South Asia, including improved specific protection of HIV-positive women\u2019s rights in health care settings. The Indian HIV/AIDS Bill is a comprehensive piece of legislation, not only highlighting specific vulnerabilities but also providing penalties and mechanisms for redress. This bill could act as a model for other countries, so this will be examined in detail, and common provisions from the other bills will be highlighted as well. India HIV/AIDS Bill, 2007 (Pending)195 In 2007 a unique joint initiative of the government and civil society saw the introduction of the HIV/AIDS Bill into Parliament. This bill seeks to provide for \u201cthe prevention and control of the HIV epidemic in India, the protection and promotion of human rights in relation to HIV/AIDS,\u201d and for the establishment of relevant authorities \u201cto promote such rights and promote prevention, awareness, care, support and treatment programmes to control the spread of HIV.\u201d196 191 A person in violation of this provision is liable to imprisonment for a term ranging from one to three years. \u201cIf such an act is an offence under [the Country Code] or any other prevailing law, the punishment imposed thereunder shall be added to such punishment.\u201d 192 Forum for Women, Law, and Development v.

The legal framework Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 53 Key features of the bill include: 1. Prohibition of discrimination: Chapter II specifically prohibits discrimination related to HIV/AIDS in public and private spheres. Under the bill, no person may be discriminated against in employment, education, health care, travel, housing, insurance, etc. based on their HIV-related status. 2. Informed consent for testing, treatment, and research: In chapter III, the bill lays out the requirements for specific, free, and informed consent for HIV-related testing, treatment, and research. The bill leaves little room for ambiguity, here defining informed consent as \u201cconsent given, specific to a proposed intervention, without any force, undue influence, fraud, threat, mistake or misrepresentation and obtained after disclosing to the person giving consent adequate information, including risks and benefits of, and alternatives to, the proposed intervention in a language and manner understood by such person.\u201d197 3. Disclosure of information: Chapter IV guarantees the confidentiality of HIV-related information (including the HIV status of a person) and outlines the few exceptions for disclosure. Importantly, while dealing with \u2018partner notification\u2019 and the \u2018duty to prevent transmission\u2019, the bill also recognizes the vulnerability of women, and specifies that the duty to notify partners is waived in the case of women who fear violence and loss of their homes in the event of notification. 4. Right to access treatment: Chapter V, within the context of the right to health, provides for access to comprehensive HIV-related \u201ctreatment,, care and support facilities, goods, measures, services and information, including centres providing voluntary testing and counselling services\u2026and free of cost treatment for HIV/AIDS for all persons.\u201d198 5. Risk reduction: Chapter VII specifically addresses harm reduction strategies, such as the provision of clean needles, promotion of safer sex practices, and provision of information and condoms to sex workers, protecting them from civil and criminal liability and law enforcement harassment. 6. Information, education, and communication (IEC): Chapter IX deals with IEC, recognizing that information is the key to any successful prevention programme, and places a duty on the state to promote positive and evidence-based messages that look at prevention as well as care, support, and rights. The information provided should be \u201cage-appropriate, gender-sensitive, non-stigmatising, non- discriminatory\u201d199 and should promote gender equality. It also suggests that IEC should particularly be focused on the specific needs of women and young persons. 7. Implementation and grievance redressal: Chapters XI and XII address and create innovative implementation mechanisms, including institutional grievance redressal machinery. The HIV/AIDS Bill also specifies special court procedures, including quick trials and creative redressal. Thus, a case related to discrimination could see a court awarding damages and directing the offending person to undergo sensitization training and community service. 8. Special provisions: Chapter XIV is a comprehensive overview of special provisions taking into account nuanced needs that may exist for particular groups in particular circumstances. For instance, it specifically recognizes certain rights for women, children, and persons in the care and custody of the state who find themselves more vulnerable to HIV and are disproportionately affected by the epidemic.200 197 Chapter 1, art. 2 (q). 198 Chapter 5, art. 2. 199 HIV/AIDS Bill 2007, chapter IX, article 24 (1). 200 Ibid., chapter XIV, article 75.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dade89e3-5ef8-4c5f-9dce-c7160a946588": {"__data__": {"id_": "dade89e3-5ef8-4c5f-9dce-c7160a946588", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff48848c2ad3c5c3ae46c9db59256deff65ab3823eedef1de9fa8245a8739ea3"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6a05142-ea93-46e6-9884-b4a1af6be5e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d1c2421e0af26c96d023cd56a4715f496011a84261ce63fd42ba0518e52048b"}}, "hash": "223aabd48d805367b8456405fe55c3b2f2ff34133e8f7f613c8f557d5ec3170e", "text": "200 Ibid., chapter XIV, article 75. 54 This chapter also addresses some underlying causes of the vulnerability of women to HIV, providing for the registration of marriages, the provision of maintenance, and the right of residence for HIV-positive women.201 The rights of pregnant women to proper counselling to enable them to decide treatment options as well as a prohibition on forced abortion or sterilization is also laid out.202 Critically, chapter XIV also addresses the link between sexual violence and HIV and directs the state to set up sexual assault crisis centres where survivors of sexual assault may access services such as counselling, treatment, referral, and management of STIs, including HIV and AIDS.203 Nepal HIV and AIDS (Prevention, Control, Treatment, Re-integration, and Protection of Rights), 2012 (pending) (HIV Bill)204 The HIV Bill is currently being amended by the Ministry of Health and Population, after which it will be forwarded to the Ministry of Law and Justice and subsequently tabled before Parliament for endorsement and enactment. 1.

Non-discrimination: The HIV Prevention Bill contains provisions prohibiting discrimination against a person on the basis of his/her HIV status and declares it unlawful to require or coerce a person to be screened for the following purposes: employment, promotion, training, or benefit, either in public or private sectors; membership in any organization; admission to any educational institution; admission to any public or private place of accommodation; marriage; immigration to, emigration from, or citizenship of Pakistan; or visiting another country for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to tourism, studies, or work. The bill also specifically prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, educational institutions, and health facilities, including denying or discontinuing medical treatment on the basis of HIV status. 2. Harm reduction: The providing of any product or any equipment to implement, enforce, plan, deliver, or monitor any of HIV/AIDS prevention harm reduction services shall not in any manner be prohibited, impeded, restricted or prevented and shall not constitute a criminal offence by the persons working in good faith towards HIV harm reduction services. 3. Women and sexual violence: An important provision in this bill is the stipulation that women who have been raped or have experienced sexual violence shall be provided with counselling and clinical services at public and private health care facilities, and services for rape survivors shall include post- exposure prophylaxis. Furthermore, every survivor of sexual assault, whether choosing to report the crime or not, shall have access at a public health care facility to the following services on a confidential basis: counselling; prevention and management of STIs, including testing and prophylactic treatment; prevention, treatment, and management of other medical conditions or injuries associated with the sexual assault; HIV/AIDS related counselling and treatment, if required; and follow up treatment and care. In the case of Pakistan, due to the recent devolution of power in the country, it is necessary to look at subnational laws as well as those at the national level. Sindh HIV and AIDS Control Treatment and Protection Act, 2013 (passed by the Sindh Provincial Assembly on September 21, 2013) The Sindh HIV Law is the first legislation in Pakistan that protects PLHIV from discrimination and provides for strict confidentiality measures as well as legal penalties to health care workers who contravene the law. Key points of the law include: 1. Prohibition of discrimination: No person, whether in the field of health care services, education, employment, provision of general utility, or any other form of services;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4683e8a-3ed3-4f1d-87f4-54ca00c98ffc": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4683e8a-3ed3-4f1d-87f4-54ca00c98ffc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab78254b8ce4231d14db4f8f4a94cd35c77b2873b4a2ff80caf84a3021a83a9e"}, "3": {"node_id": "77a94bc6-4944-4fa5-8b1f-277f86662624", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6007aa3e6c1b6a26dd688df2f21d5c002cfe9402874d1c5bedbbadb5335578a5"}}, "hash": "a9108026fa02f17bd2647068da4170273cbcd5570bb5935a1d4c65761565200d", "text": "or in relation to accommodation whether in respect of lease, rent, to let, hire, or purchase, can discriminate against another person, on the basis of such other person\u2019s HIV status or presumed, suspected, or alleged HIV status.208 2.

It is also unlawful to require or to coerce another person to be screened for HIV for any of the following purposes: employment, promotion, training, or benefit, either in public or private sectors; membership in 208 Section 8 (1). 56 any organization; admission to any educational institution; admission to any public or private place of accommodation; marriage; or immigration to, emigration from, or citizenship of Pakistan.209 3. Confidentiality: All health care facilities, whether public or private, are required to maintain the confidentiality of their patients\u2019 medical and personal records and information, including their HIV/ AIDS status.210 4. Awareness and training: It is the duty of every health worker and every health care facility to make available information regarding the prevention, control, and treatment of HIV/AIDS to the public. Every health care facility is also required to enhance the knowledge and capacity of all its workers with regard to the dissemination of information about HIV/AIDS and the education of the general public about HIV/AIDS and on other HIV-related issues, such as discrimination, confidentiality, and informed consent.211 5. Penalties: A very significant aspect of this law is that it stipulates penalties for specific offences. For instance, it states that the penalty for publicizing the confidential health information of any individual or the health records of any person shall be imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years and not less than two years and a fine not exceeding PKR 200,000 (approximately US$1,900).212 Any contravention of section 8 of the act is punishable by imprisonment and/or a fine of up to PKR 300,000 (US$2,800). In addition, if any contravention of section 8 of the act results in any delay or denial of the provision of health care services to any PLHIV by a health service provider, whether in a health care facility or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever, including but not restricted to the HIV status of the PLHIV, the health care provider shall pay a fine of between PKR 100,000 (US$950) and not more than PKR 2,000,000 (US$19,000). The act also links contravention of the provisions to the Penal Code, stating that in the event that delay or denial of health care services results in the premature acceleration or death of the PLHIV, the health service provider responsible for such acceleration shall be liable for the relevant punishment under the PPC.213 The act also provides for specific functions to be carried out by two independent bodies-the working body and the governing body. All HIV and AIDS related projects including those pertaining to training, treatment provision, awareness raising etc. will be undertaken and implemented the Working Body, which shall report to the Governing Body, which meets every six months. This review of the act\u2019s implementation will be critical in determining how effectively provisions are enacted, especially with regard to activities (such as training) that are mentioned in the law. Adequate funding for these activities will need to be provided by the provincial government. The fact that this law has been passed is a significant step forward in terms of HIV-related legislation in South Asia. Specific provisions such as the mandated training of all health care workers on HIV, discrimination, confidentiality, and consent could have a very significant impact on reducing the stigma and discrimination feared and experienced by KAWG in health care settings. Providing specific penalties for defined offences by health care providers is also critical to giving the act \u2018teeth\u2019 and making health care workers legally accountable. However, it should be noted that this is a provincial law, and therefore not applicable to other areas of Pakistan. 209 Section 8 (2) (5). 210 Section 8 (6). 211 Section 11 (3). 212 Section 23. 213 Section 9.

The health care system is one of the most critical public sites that women need to access in order to maintain health throughout their life cycle. Yet, as this report has documented, there is strong emerging evidence that some health care institutions are sites of discrimination, violence, and abuse towards individuals who come seeking services, with health care providers withholding care or performing treatment that intentionally or negligently inflicts pain and suffering. Rights violations that KAWG face in health care settings include forced and coerced sterilization, forced and coerced abortions, denial of access to sexual and reproductive health services, and subjection to humiliating and degrading treatment and discrimination. Legislation against the sort of discrimination described in this report is urgently required to ensure that the health care systems in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan provide adequate and non-discriminatory treatment and care for KAWG. What is most needed is a comprehensive body of national and local legislations that: \u2022 Provides a detailed definition of discrimination, specifies that this includes health settings, and specifies grounds upon which this is to be prohibited \u2013 including HIV status and work. Example of this is the pending HIV Bill in India, which prohibits discrimination. \u2022 Sets out sanctions and processes for breaches of the law and appropriate penalties for health care practitioners who violate the law, as in the Sindh HIV Act in Pakistan. \u2022 Identifies or establishes a mechanism for patients to lodge complaints against health care workers. For instance, the medical regulatory bodies in each country may be approached by individuals who feel they have a complaint against violations of the code of conduct by physicians. \u2022 Is applicable to private actors including private hospitals and healthcare centres. \u2022 Contains special provision for women and their needs, including ensuring that women receive adequate counselling and information on procedures such as HIV tests and treatment, sterilizations, and abortions. This is addressed in the pending HIV Bill in India in article 373. CoNClusIoN 58 Conclusion \u2022 Specifically lays out protocols relating to confidentiality and consent regarding HIV testing, recognizing that women are often deterred from accessing services due to fear that their status may be disclosed to their families without their permission. Obligations to maintain a patient\u2019s confidentiality and ensure their informed consent for any procedure are specifically addressed in the codes of conduct for physicians in all the studied countries. \u2022 Requires health care facilities to implement training of health care workers on issues including HIV basic facts, HIV-related stigma and discrimination, confidentiality, consent, and other patients\u2019 rights. For instance, the Sindh HIV Act in Pakistan has specifically addressed the issue of enhancing the knowledge and capacity of all health care workers on HIV-related issues. \u2022 Protects the rights of health care workers by providing equipment and materials necessary for universal precautions and ensuring a safe working environment. As noted, laws need to be properly enforced and bolstered by effective implementation and complaint mechanisms that are easy to access and that make people working within health care accountable for their actions. This includes ensuring the provision of information about complaints mechanisms to patients, and access to legal services for those who need it. Even where laws do not exist, we have seen that courts in the countries studied have been able to play a critical role, using fundamental rights guaranteed by a country\u2019s constitution as well as international human rights instruments that the country is party to, to pass progressive judgments that cause eventual changes in the law. An example of this is the Indian Supreme Court\u2019s decision to lay down guidelines for sterilization based on the decision that current sterilization conditions violated patients\u2019 reproductive rights, women\u2019s rights, and health rights as articulated in the Indian Constitution and international instruments ratified by India, including the Alma Alta Declaration, CEDAW, the ICPD Programme of Action, and the Beijing Platform for Action. With regard to HIV, legislation needs to include strict protocols on areas such as informed consent, confidentiality, testing, disclosure, and specific needs of key affected communities. The Sindh HIV Act passed in Pakistan is a significant piece of legislation in this regard, highlighting such critical areas as training of health care workers and providing specific penalties for offences by health care providers under the act. The current pending HIV/AIDS Bill in India is also a good example of such a piece of legislation, not only meeting many of the above requirements but also comprehensively addressing the underlying causes of vulnerability for KAWG and the specific issues faced by them. Needless to say, the passage of these bills should be a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97e38d70-586d-4033-938f-b9c6c17de46d": {"__data__": {"id_": "97e38d70-586d-4033-938f-b9c6c17de46d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79cc9ed87aa7211cc8e42c6a24eb9b2f7a758fc25aa103d8d4dcc5a7a497a2b6"}}, "hash": "79cc9ed87aa7211cc8e42c6a24eb9b2f7a758fc25aa103d8d4dcc5a7a497a2b6", "text": "matter of priority since none of the studied countries currently has HIV-related legislation in place that is nationally applicable. Meanwhile, it is worth considering the argument that HIV-focused protective provisions should be included under public health law, disability law, or anti-discrimination law. As we have seen, many different types of laws exist that could include specific provisions for people living with or affected by HIV. For instance, laws on assault could specifically address assault in health care settings by including \u201ccruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\u201d in the definition, and thereby expanding the range of offences that would be covered, beyond sexual assault. Disability provisions, including those on non-discrimination, can be expanded to include PLHIV with specific provisions for WLHIV. Provisions regarding disabled women in health care settings, such as those in the new Disability Bill currently proposed in India, are particularly relevant to WLHIV, focusing as they do on informed consent and confidentiality and specifically prohibiting forced sterilizations. Ultimately, proponents of this approach argue that distinguishing and separating HIV exacerbates stigma and that \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 the specific needs of PLHIV and specifically key affected women and girls is a more effective approach, utilizing existing laws to address new issues, reinforcing them where necessary, and perhaps ending up with stronger protective mechanisms for all people. Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 59 ReCommeNdAtIoNs We should note that all four countries examined do have legislation that prohibits discrimination. Some of this legislation also relates specifically to healthcare settings. Strengthening provisions within existing laws as well as effective implementation and enforcement is critically needed. In addition, social determinants such as stigma, intolerance, apathy, and general dereliction of duty by both healthcare practitioners and administrators require renewed attention and focus within interventions by the legal, policymaking and healthcare sectors in each country. General recommendations to governments Participation of women in decisions that affect them a. Key HIV-affected women and girls need to be engaged in dialogue in a positive and meaningful way in order for policy makers to better understand the nature of their experiences in health care settings. This would involve including not only HIV-positive women\u2019s networks but also sex workers and young person\u2019s advocacy groups into consultations with policy makers and representatives from the legal and health sectors in each country. The consultations should focus on the joint development of recommendations for laws, policies, and programmes to prevent future rights violations in health care settings. b. Positive Women\u2019s Networks must be strengthened through financial support and capacity-building and training so that WLHIV may be involved in peer-based support services and counselling programmes for KAWG. WLHIV must be capacitated to advocate among peers, family, health care providers, and policy makers on their right to sexual and reproductive health and rights. Legal sector a. All pending HIV bills should be passed with the specific stipulation of implementing structures to make sure that provisions are effectively enforced and executed. b. Non-discrimination legislation needs to be enacted based on constitutional guarantees and applicable to both public and private actors in health care settings. It is necessary to ensure that such legislation is aligned with international conventions, such as the ICESCR and CEDAW. The legislation should contain specific provisions that recognize the gendered experiences of women in health care situations by 60 stipulating additional safeguards related to informed consent in cases concerning the reproductive rights of women. Countries should repeal laws that explicitly discriminate against women c. Sex work must be decriminalized in order to reduce stigma and discrimination towards sex workers seeking health care and HIV-related testing and treatment. d. A review of enforcement and implementation of protective laws needs to be conducted, specifically with regard to how these can work to minimise rights violations in health care settings. e. Conduct a review of complaints and enforcement mechanisms relating to violations of rights in health care settings including the mechanisms available under national human rights institutions and medical council boards. f. In partnership with civil society organizations, governments need to provide interventions and training programmes for trial and appellate court judges on HIV/AIDS and the rights violations of KAWG in health care settings. g. Legal ministries in partnership with national human rights institutions should design programmes to create more awareness of constitutionally guaranteed rights, such as the right to the highest attainable standard of health \u2013 including the right to sexual and reproductive health \u2013 in the form of accurate information and accessible services related to HIV/AIDS, STDs, pregnancy, abortion and contraception amongst KAWG, disabled women, very poor women and other marginalized communities. h.

This would involve training of the judiciary on issues related to KAWG (see above). Other necessary measures would include: \u2022 Training and supporting NGOs, including HIV-positive women\u2019s networks and women\u2019s rights advocates, to implement programmes promoting increased awareness of laws and mechanisms for redress, effective documentation of rights violations, and assistance in approaching available legal aid bodies. \u2022 Ensuring information on rights related to HIV and SRH as well as on complaints and redressal mechanisms, where available, to women in community health centres, district hospitals, and local- level legal aid centres. Health sector recommendations a. Develop and implement a national policy to address HIV-related stigma and discrimination in health care settings, including through stigma and discrimination reduction programmes for health care workers. In accordance with UNAIDS guidance on stigma reduction,214 training in health care settings should be conducted with health care workers, administrators, and health care regulators with the objectives of ensuring that: \u2022 Health care providers know about their own human rights to health (HIV prevention and treatment, universal precautions, access to post-exposure prophylaxis, compensation for work-related infection) and to non-discrimination in the context of HIV. 214 See UNAIDS Guidance Note, \u201cKey Programmes to Reduce Stigma and Discrimination and Increase Access to Justice in National HIV Responses\u201d (2012). Recommendations Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 61 \u2022 Stigmatizing attitudes in health care settings are reduced and health care providers are given the skills and tools necessary to ensure patients\u2019 rights to informed consent, confidentiality, treatment, and non-discrimination. b. Create safeguards against violations of women\u2019s rights. Detailed protocols must be created and followed in all health care institutions, with accompanying penalties for non-observance. On sterilizations, certain standards can be established, including:215 \u2022 Allowing for sufficient time between the explanation of the sterilization procedure to the patient and the time when consent is sought; \u2022 Not seeking consent while a woman is in labour; \u2022 Mandating that informed consent be transmitted both verbally and in writing; \u2022 Translating all forms into relevant languages; \u2022 Stipulating that sterilization cannot be a condition of receiving other treatment or employment, and abolishing spousal consent requirements. On HIV testing, in accordance with the International Guidelines on HIV and Human Rights, public health legislation must ensure: \u2022 That HIV testing of individuals should only be performed with the specific informed consent of that individual and that pre- and post-test counselling be readily available. \u2022 That information related to the HIV status of an individual be protected from unauthorized collection, use, or disclosure in the health-care and other settings. \u2022 That the use of HIV-related information requires informed consent, and that disclosure to a person\u2019s partner can be made only according to specified criteria.216 \u2022 Comprehensive counselling needs to be provided to women before they are tested for HIV. This must apply to all women, including pregnant womoen, transgender persons, sex workers, or wives of HIV-positive men. Counselling needs to be provided at many care points and available to women in a language that she can understand properly. It should also include family members. \u2022 HIV-positive women should be trained and employed as peer counsellors at all government testing centres. c. Create awareness programmes that include information on sexual and reproductive health and rights and legal literacy among the population, especially in rural areas, using government-sponsored mass- media advertising to reach the entire population. 215 Supra note 31, Open Society Foundation Report. 216 Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights (2006).

India 1. Remove reservations under CEDAW217 and enact legislation that provides equal rights for all women, regardless of religion, with regard to family law. The relevance of this is to specifically enact legislation that addresses inequality within the household, which result in differential access to health care. 2. Ratify the Convention against Torture (CAT). 3. Strengthen para. 6.6 (torture) of the Indian Medical Council Regulations by including cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, thereby incorporating and dealing with less severe offences recognized as human rights violations under the UDHR and the ICCPR. 4. Establish and implement laws, programmes, and policies on zero tolerance towards violence against women. Have political and religious leaders publicly speak out and condemn all forms of violence against women and specifically address violations faced by women in health care settings. 5. Provide comprehensive training for lawyers and trial and appellate court judges on binding standards that make clear that finger test results and medical opinions about whether a survivor is \u201chabituated to sexual intercourse\u201d are unscientific, degrading, and legally irrelevant, and should not be presented in court proceedings related to sexual offences.218 Nepal 1. Amend chapter 10 of the Country Code so that abortion is not dealt with under homicide. Enact a separate piece of legislation dealing with abortion with a focus on reproductive rights of all women, retaining paragraph 28 of the current law prohibiting coercion or threat, lure or offer, to a pregnant women, and retaining and strengthening the emphasis on consent. 2. Expand chapter 19, number 10A, of the Country Code, which sets out punishment for discrimination on the basis of caste, religion, colour, class, or work, to include sex, disability, and health status. 217 India entered a reservation under CEDAW on articles 5 and 16, which deal with customary and personal laws. 218 See Human Rights Watch report, Dignity on Trial, for detailed recommendations regarding this test.

Engage law and justice sector peers in partnership with civil society organizations in efforts to advocate for a national anti-discrimination law to support constitutional guarantees to equality.219 Pakistan 1. The Provincial Government should promote the Sindh HIV and AIDS Control, Treatment and Protection Act (2013) as a model for similar laws to be promulgated in all other provinces, and ensure that adequate budget provisions are made for implementation of this law. The governing body should strictly follow the monitoring guidelines stipulated ensuring that the working body procedures on implementation and reporting every six months are being followed. 2. The Reproductive Rights and Health care Act should be strengthened by adding provisions establishing complaint mechanisms and imposing sanctions. Provisions dealing specifically with WLHIV, noting their specific vulnerability to violations, should be added. Country-specific recommendations to governments: Health sector Bangladesh 1. The Ministry of Law and Education along with major human rights institutions in the country (Bangladesh Legal Aid and Service Trust, Bangladesh National Woman Lawyers\u2019 Association and the National Human Rights Commission) should design programmes to create more awareness of the right to health care, including information and services related to HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, abortion, and contraception, among key HIV/AIDS-affected women and girls, disabled women, and other marginalized communities. 2. A medical ombudsman mechanism should be created, wherein complaints can be dealt with in a private environment and not through the court system. 3. NGOs or other public bodies associated with health should be given assistance and encouragement to conduct workshops in private and public medical facilities dealing with discrimination. India 1. Undertake research on the cases that have been dealt with and are pending under medical regulatory boards, focusing on effective redressal of cases, obstacles to access, and duration until remedy is granted. 2. Create safeguards against violations of women\u2019s rights. In addition to protocols mentioned under general recommendations, India needs to implement protocols, with accompanying penalties on Sexual assault examinations.220 This includes: \u2022 The banning of the finger test and its variants from all forensic examinations of female survivors of rape and sexual assault. \u2022 Stipulation of penalties to be imposed on any health care institution that carries it out. 219 Shadow Report on the Fourth and Fifth Periodic Report of the Government of Nepal on CEDAW. 220 Supra note 85. 64 \u2022 Instruction to doctors not to comment on whether they believe any girl or woman is \u201chabituated to sexual intercourse.\u201d \u2022 Instruction to senior police officials to ensure that they do not ask doctors to comment on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3d7c112-cd30-4613-8579-6c2fde60b494": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3d7c112-cd30-4613-8579-6c2fde60b494", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87798934e084515b757c3478d00231813b1a5cb32448e9c5349190e7e06c684a"}, "3": {"node_id": "37f2d8f5-3418-4dcd-a60b-1b916ebd5350", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1e49f62ff7cd8b0fd13e52a1941f40cfcd1762e59d1a0b8ec4de5c5c8091b9f"}}, "hash": "f3ad0a21936f8b5e2b47e5f903ea18ae9af66476e2e06aa8d5e41a262772ba8f", "text": "whether a rape survivor is \u201chabituated to sexual intercourse.\u201d \u2022 Have one centre in at least one government hospital in every district of the country staffed with trained personnel who are equipped to provide integrated, comprehensive, gender-sensitive treatment, forensic examinations, counselling, and rehabilitation for survivors of sexual violence. 3.

Pre-marital counselling programmes focusing on providing information \u2013 in an accessible format and local languages \u2013 on issues related to sexual and reproductive health, including information on contraception, STDs, HIV, and marital rape, should be available at primary health care centres across the country. Nepal 1. Train and sensitize health care professionals and health care workers on legal rights, HIV, disability, stigma, and discrimination.221 2. Train health care professionals and health care workers on privacy and confidentiality. 3. Increase awareness of the rights to health, privacy, physical integrity, autonomy, privacy, and confidentiality among the population of Nepal through mass media campaigns and NGO interventions. 4. Ensure abortions are carried out only in accordance with strict standards of consent after counselling and the signing of an affidavit in a language the woman understands. 5. Ensure that women with disabilities and women living with HIV have access to a full range of reproductive and sexual health services.222 Pakistan 1. Conduct awareness workshops on HIV/AIDS among key affected groups in the identified HIV/AIDS hotspots. Given Pakistan\u2019s sociocultural profile, HIV still remains a taboo topic and is not openly discussed. 2. Conduct a national study examining rights violations of KAWG in health care settings using community- based organizations as partners. 3. Conduct sensitization workshops for health care professionals not directly connected to the HIV/AIDS departments of hospitals. Additionally, the current process of providing treatment to PLHIV should be streamlined in order to ensure that there are no unnecessary difficulties and delays. 4. Introduce a non-invasive method for verifying sexual assault and discontinue the two-finger test. Establish strict protocols in this regard (see India recommendations, above). 5. Introduce optional HIV counselling and testing for all sexual assault cases. Provide medico-legal officers sensitization and HIV-awareness training in order to understand transmission risks. 221 Stigma Index 2011. 222 Stigma Index 2011. Recommendations Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan 65 Recommendations to SAARCLAW 1. Use regular SAARCLAW meetings as forums to disseminate information on the latest findings on violations of women\u2019s rights in health care settings. Raise awareness among SAARCLAW members on the specific legal needs of women and encourage legal aid-related involvement from constituent members. 2. Disseminate information on legal judgments to all lawyers, judges, and academics who are members of SAARCLAW. This could include: the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the two-finger test in sexual assault cases in India; the UN Special Rapporteur report on re-classifying violations in health care settings as torture; and progress on new laws in each country on discrimination, HIV/AIDS, and violence against women. 3. SAARCLAW could advocate for the passing of specific legislation in its member countries. For instance, in India, Pakistan, and Nepal, SAARCLAW chapters could advocate for the passing of the pending HIV bills. In Bangladesh, it could assist in creating partnerships/networks and an advocacy platform to encourage the drafting of HIV-related legislation. 4. Continue involvement in international forums on social justice and rights issues with the aim of building capacity of all SAARCLAW chapters to act as advocates on these issues in their own countries. 5. Support national chapters to submit periodic reports on human rights issues under the universal periodic review process. 6. Encourage national chapters to engage more actively with issues related to women\u2019s rights and to implement workshops to address the lack of awareness of legal rights and general knowledge on health- related rights. 7. Support national chapters to formulate and implement training programmes and to carry out workshops on discrimination against women at health care settings, for example, with District Bar Councils. 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37f2d8f5-3418-4dcd-a60b-1b916ebd5350": {"__data__": {"id_": "37f2d8f5-3418-4dcd-a60b-1b916ebd5350", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting the rights of key HIV-affected women and girls in health care settings: A legal scan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87798934e084515b757c3478d00231813b1a5cb32448e9c5349190e7e06c684a"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3d7c112-cd30-4613-8579-6c2fde60b494", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-rights-key-hiv-affected-women-and-girls-health-care-settings-legal-scan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3ad0a21936f8b5e2b47e5f903ea18ae9af66476e2e06aa8d5e41a262772ba8f"}}, "hash": "f1e49f62ff7cd8b0fd13e52a1941f40cfcd1762e59d1a0b8ec4de5c5c8091b9f", "text": "8.

If countries fail to address the legal context of the epidemic, this already critical situation is likely to become worse. The implementation of effective, human rights-based national HIV responses requires governments to consider the effect of laws and law enforcement practices on the health of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender persons. This warning came as a key finding in the forthcoming report on \u201cLegal environments, human rights and HIV responses among MSM and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific: An agenda for action\u201d. This report and its key findings were reviewed during the \u201cHigh Level Dialogue on Punitive laws, Human rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in the Asia Pacific Region\u201d convened by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM) and the Center for Comparative and Public Law (CCPL) at the Faculty of Law, The University of Hong Kong. This event coincided with the International Day Against Homophobia \u2013 May 17th, 2010. The report\u2019s findings and follow up discussion showed that 19 of 48 countries in the Asia Pacific region criminalize male to male sex, and these laws often taken on the force of vigilantism, often leading to abuse and human rights violations. Even in the absence of criminalization, other provisions of law often violate the rights of MSM and transgender persons along with arbitrary and inappropriate enforcement, thereby obstructing HIV interventions, advocacy and outreach, and service delivery. This very debate was at the heart of the recent landmark ruling by the Delhi High Court that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code unfairly discriminates against men who have sex with men and consenting adults in general. Over the course of the discussion, the panelists contended how legislation and law enforcement often lags behind national HIV policies, with the result that the reach and effectiveness of programmes for MSM and transgender persons are undermined. This indicates the need for greater coordination between health and justice sectors within government. There has been growing awareness among national policy makers of the need to identify MSM as a key population to be addressed by national HIV programmes. The panelist emphasized that developing strategic partnerships and alliances between affected communities, the legal profession, human rights bodies, parliamentarians and policy makers is critical. Finally, the discussion highlighted that there are some recent examples of protective laws, judicial and policy actions to improve the legal environment for MSM and transgender people, including important court judgments in Nepal, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Fiji, South Korea and Hong Kong. However, these are exceptional developments and action is required to improve the legal environment in all countries. This High Level Dialogue concludes the expert and community consultations which have occurred over the past year to inform and guide the content and recommendations of the study. These consultations included the 9th ICAAP Symposium \u2013 Overcoming legal barriers to comprehensive prevention among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific and two community consultations in Suva, Fiji and Bangkok, Thailand last December. The UN teams in Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka also hosted local reviews. The preliminary findings reviewed at the High Level Dialogue are from a study commissioned by UNDP and APCOM. The study considered published research, legislation, legal cases, grey literature, and drew from the regional consultations with community representatives and legal experts. 2 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific Speaker bios The Hon.

It is also my great pleasure to welcome the very distinguished panel of speakers who join us at this High Level Dialogue, and particularly to Mr Justice Michael Kirby, one of the most respected judges and jurists in the world as well as a great friend of the Faculty. On 15 January 1980, Mr. John MacLennan, a senior police inspector, was to be arrested for 8 counts of gross indecency. The arrest was supposed to take place at his offi ce in the police station that morning. When Inspector MacLennan did not show up by 10:30 am, the police started to look for him. His phone was not answered. The police decided to seek for him at his residence. When no one answered the call, the police decided to break forcibly into his residence. Apparently no one was there. A brown envelope was left on the table in the dining room. The bedroom was locked. The police broke inside, and found Inspector MacLennan dead with 5 bullet wounds and a service revolver beside him. The envelope on the table contained a note: \u2018Please tell my parents that it was an accident, and I was a good Police Offi cer\u2019. Did Inspector MacLennan commit suicide, or was he murdered as a cover up of homosexual activities among high ranking police offi cers?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e951f9f-93a1-4685-8535-5ceff45ab70b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e951f9f-93a1-4685-8535-5ceff45ab70b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/punitive-laws-human-rights-and-hiv-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-asia-pacific-high-level-dialogue-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific - High Level Dialogue Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/punitive-laws-human-rights-and-hiv-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-asia-pacific-high-level-dialogue-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d72aae7935be0b91682e81d517292134364c1d430ff0b82a6c619b787ab8ecb2"}, "2": {"node_id": "e32126e0-091b-4917-b6c8-917f450fb117", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/punitive-laws-human-rights-and-hiv-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-asia-pacific-high-level-dialogue-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "caa18a35f97445cb0e26143b6f56f2e2bba3d0671deaaaefcff57ce9bd2ad047"}}, "hash": "b191fb1779661471da46e9037a321161cfbb91b7c7ae61a6068841c0f3a4902c", "text": "The death of Inspector MacLennan has generated widespread public debates in the community, and when the coroner\u2019s inquest left many questions unanswered, the Governor, in response to strong public pressure, set up a Commission of Inquiry led by Sir T L Yang, who subsequently became the Chief Justice, to investigate into the cause of death of Inspector MacLennan.

It found that homosexual activities were not an evil of the West. They existed and were well documented in classical literature in ancient China back to 3,000 years ago. They were indeed quite open and prevalent in the Tang Dynasty, which was about 1,000 years ago.3 There is nothing foreign about homosexual conduct; instead, it exists in all cultures and societies at all times. Yet it still took the Government three attempts and a decade before the law was successfully reformed in the mid- nineties of the last century. Yet decriminalization is only the first step. It does not address prejudice, discrimination, harassment, selective enforcement of law, access to service and justice, protection, and finally, acceptance and recognition. These are complex issues involving law, religion, morality, dignity and culture. Thanks to the very distinguished panelists for agreeing to participate in this event this evening, it provides us with a valuable and timely opportunity to look at these complex and fascinating issues. Each of their contributions is extremely valuable and very much appreciated. Credit must be paid to the organizers including the United Nations Development Programme and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health for supporting the event (specifically, Dr. Mandeep Dhaliwal, Team Leader, Gender, Human Rights and Sexual Diversity Bureau of Development Policy, UNDP, New York), for their thoughtfulness and efforts in putting this conference together. Finally, I would like to thank my colleague Kelley Loper, Simon Young, and our Centre for Comparative and Public Law as a co-organizer. We have recently initiated an inter-disciplinary research on diversity study which is headed by my colleagues Kelley Loper and Puja Kapai. This event forms part of our efforts to develop this Emerging Strategic Research Theme on Diversity Studies at the University of Hong Kong. With these remarks, I look forward to a successful and stimulating evening. 2 Law Reform Commission, Report on Laws Governing Homosexual Conduct (1983). Ch 2 provides a medical perspective on homosexuality, and Ch 3 contains an interesting study on homosexuality in traditional China. 3 The earliest documentation on homosexual conduct could be found in the Book of Shang and the Book of Chou between 1122 \u2013 500 BC, and the most explicit record was found in Han Fei Tzu, written in about 722-481 BC: See Law Reform Commission\u2019s Report on Laws Governing Homosexual Conduct, above, at pp 14-17. 6 High Level Dialogue -

Powerpoint presentation, USCA MSM Institute San Francisco, California. October 29, 2009 Throughout the world, men who have sex with men and transgender people are at higher risk of HIV infection, and continue to lack basic awareness about their potential exposure. In every region of the world, men who have sex with men and transgender people are experiencing: \u2022\ufffd extremely high HIV incidence and prevalence \u2022\ufffd low coverage of targeted HIV activities and services, \u2022\ufffd barriers, to accessing HIV prevention, treatment and care, and other health services, related to homophobia, transphobia, stigma, discrimination and criminalization Comparison of AIDS Expenditures and Resource Needs for programs aimed at / involving Men who have sex with Men (38 countries reporting detailed spending and comparison with resource needs estimates for MSM preventive services) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Resource Needs Expenditures USD (Millions) $3 million spent in these 38 countries for MSM prevention services $29 million spent in these 38 countries for MSM Currently, access to prevention, treatment, care and support services in the most vulnerable populations is limited compared with the share of the burden faced by these populations. This graph shows how little was spent \u2013 as compared to need \u2013 on programmes for men who have sex with men in 38 countries (2008). 15 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific Expenditures for HIV prevention: UNGASS 2008 Country reporting Data. UNGASS reports from 38 countries MSM: 1.2% SW: 1% IDU: 2% Other prevention services: 96% Global estimates indicate that sex between men accounts for between 5 and 10% of HIV infections worldwide, yet only 1.2% of all HIV prevention funding is targeted toward men who have sex with men. Recent policy guidance as noted in the reports of the Commission on AIDS in Asia and in the Pacific, clearly states that more of our resources must be directed to where risk and vulnerability is the greatest. However, there is still a major gap between policy and practice. This is especially striking when one compares this to the recent experience of the response to H1N1 in the US, where the resposne was pretty immediate in terms of allocating resources to those most at risk \u2013 i.e.: pregnant women, children and health workers. Median percentage of MSM reached with HIV prevention services Adapted from UNAIDS 2008 Global Report 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Countries NOT HAVING non-discrimination laws/regulations for MSM Countries HAVING non-discrimination laws/regulations protecting MSM Efficiency and effectiveness of HIV programming depends on people being able to seek essential services and support and live their lives free from stigmatization, discrimination, homophobia, transphobia, blackmail, violence, and criminalisation. The graph shows that where non-discriminatory laws and regulations exist protecting the rights of men have sex with men, a remarkably higher percentage of men who have sex with men can be reached with HIV prevention services. A rights-based approach can ensure that men who have sex with men, transgender people, and their sexual partners can access essential HIV and health services and social support and exercise their right to health.

In one year, from 2007 to 2008, coverage of those in need of treatment went from 33% to 42%. Global infection rates have dropped 17% since 2001. AIDS has demanded the participation of those affected and it has demanded inclusive governance. AIDS has driven down prices of essential medicines and insisted that public health be a consideration in intellectual property law and trade agreements. Success in the AIDS response has been driven by human rights and AIDS has contributed to advancing the human rights agenda. AIDS has made economic, social and cultural rights justiciable before the courts. Despite some remarkable successes in the AIDS , a rising tide of punitive laws, polices, and practices that violate human rights is jeopardizing progress and blocking the achievement of the universal access targets and the MDGs. It is becoming increasingly clear that successes in HIV prevention, treatment and care can only be sustained and scaled up if they are underpinned by legal, regulatory and social environments that advance human rights, gender equality and social justice goals. 17 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific Key Lessons \u2022\ufffd Stigma and discrimination continue to beset people living with HIV and individuals most at risk of infection \u2014 men who have sex with men, injecting drug users and sex workers. \u2022\ufffd Social and legal challenges to human rights create significant barriers to an effective national AIDS responses. \u2022\ufffd A sustainable response must address punitive laws and the social drivers of the disease. During the past year, important advances have been made in the promotion and protection of the human rights of men who have sex with men and transgender people either through legislative and judicial action\u2013 many of the advances have been in the Asia Pacific region \u2013 e.g. India, Nepal, Pakistan, Fiji. However, human rights violations continue to undermine efforts to prevent people from becoming infected. These are experienced most cutely by typically marginalized populations like men who have sex with men and transgender people. Globally, more than 30 countries have enacted HIV-specific laws that criminalize HIV transmission or exposure, and more than 24 countries have used non-HIV-specific laws to prosecute individuals on similar grounds. Even as a growing body of data has documented elevated HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men in all regions, a number of countries have undermined effective HIV prevention for them by either enacting or considering legislation to criminalize same-sex sexual conduct. Such punitive measures, which are underpinned by stigma and homophobia, are both counterproductive from a public health perspective and antithetical to the human rights basis of effective AIDS responses. Conclusions \u201cWe can empower men who have sex with men, sex workers and transgender people to protect themselves from HIV infection and to fully access antiretroviral therapy: by ensuring that men who have sex with men, sex workers and transgender people are empowered to both access and deliver comprehensive and appropriate packages of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services and by ensuring that law enforcement agencies and the judicial system protect their rights.\u201d UNAIDS Joint Action for Results 2009 - 2011 The 2010 progress report of the United Nations Secretary General tells us in no uncertain terms that in the fight to prevent new infections, provide care, treatment and support, we all must commit to leaving behind no one, especially - men who have sex with men, transgender people, sex workers and people who inject drugs. The harms of human rights violations in the AIDS response are clear \u2013 harms to those who are typically marginalized by stigma, discrimination, homophobia, transphobia, violence and criminalization. These human rights violations harm all of us. The benefits of human rights protection and promotion in the HIV response are clear \u2013 protecting and promoting the rights of those most vulnerable - improving their access to essential services - benefits those who are marginalized and excluded and consequently benefits communities and countries \u2013 benefits us all.

Nineteen years ago, on this same say, the General Assembly of the World Health Organization (WHO) approved the 10th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). The 10th Revision recognized that \u201csexual orientation by itself is not to be regarded as a disorder.\u201d Before this date, homosexuality had been classified as a \u201csexual disorder.\u201c It is important for us to reflect on this day. It is the day that science and evidence based policy triumphed over the stigma, prejudice and repression that impede the recognition and realization of human rights and effective HIV, health and develpoment responses. We must never forget that homophobia/transphobia is a severe problem which adversely affects both victims and perpetrators. It damages human relations, fractures families and communities, and inflicts pain and suffering. It is an obstacle to the fulfillment of fundamental freedoms and rights. Stigma, discrimination and violence against homosexual and transgender people will only stop if society works against it. No one country can achieve the health and development goals set out in universal access commitments in the Millennium Development Goals - if all individuals are not treated with the respect and dignity that is due to each and every human being. 19 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific Speaker statements and presentations 20 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacifi c International Day Against Homophobia This day, 17 May, is designated World Anti-Homophobia Day. It is a day set aside to help the global community address the problem of fear and stigma targeted at millions of people because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The day was designated because it was on this day, more than 30 years ago, that the World Health Assembly resolved to remove homosexuality, as such, from the World Health Organisation\u2019s global list of mental disorders. It was on this day that the international community, acting through the relevant specialised agency of the United Nations, recognised the commonality of variations in sexuality, their frequent appearance in the human species (as indeed in other species) and the fact that, as such, it is not something that requires treatment or alteration; nor something to be ashamed of and thus to keep hidden. Of course, it is one thing for informed experts, and the organs of the United Nations, to embrace an enlightened and scientifi c approach to sexual orientation and gender identity. It is quite another to inform and educate the population of the world about the established features of these characteristics of human beings. Because of stigma and fi erce rejection of variations in an unchanging dichotomy between the sexual orientation and gender identify of men and women that a great deal of pain and violence is infl icted on human beings everywhere. Without more, this would be intolerable enough. However, in the context of the rapid spread of the human immuno-defi ciency virus (HIV) throughout the world, problems of homophobia have taken on a new and most urgent characteristic. They impede the global eff orts to help prevent the spread of HIV and the condition of acquired immune defi ciency syndrome (AIDS) to which, untreated, the virus will ordinarily progress. Because there is no safe vaccine yet developed to protect human beings from the risks of acquiring HIV and AIDS, and because there is no cure that rids the body of HIV in those infected, the international community has accepted the urgent need to promote a global strategy of prevention. Only prevention will reduce, and hopefully eliminate, the continuing high levels of infection of people with HIV. Currently, infections occur at about 2.7 million persons each year.

Member of the UNDP Global Commission on HIV and the Law. Member of the UNAIDS Reference Panel on HIV and Human Rights. 21 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific substantially reduced in the past decade, therapy remains a very expensive option. Particularly so in countries of the developing world where there are otherwise extremely low expenditures on public health generally. Especially since the advent of the global financial crisis (GFC), the funds available to ensure that all people living with HIV and AIDS have access to anti-retroviral drugs, have decreased. These developments have presented the risk that patients, initially provided with such beneficial life-saving drugs, may not be guaranteed to receive them indefinitely into the future. A realisation that this is so imposes an extremely urgent obligation upon the global community to step up all available means to reduce the risk of the transmission of HIV. But prevention is a very difficult strategy to secure. It depends upon the adoption of strong and brave measures. Those measures include changes that are painful to adopt in many societies. They include: \u2022\ufffd The promotion of widespread public and child education about the risks of HIV and the most effective means of avoidance; \u2022\ufffd The promotion of the availability of male and female condoms to impede the risk of acquiring the virus during sexual intercourse; \u2022\ufffd The removal of criminal and public order penalties upon sex workers (CSWs) and the confiscation of condoms and their use as proof of their involvement in sex work; \u2022\ufffd The introduction of sterile syringe exchanges for injecting drug users (IDUs); \u2022\ufffd The provision of preventative protection to specially vulnerable groups such as prisoners, refugee applicants etc...; and \u2022\ufffd The removal of criminal penalties against men who have sex with men (MSM), together with the introduction of anti-discrimination legislation to promote equality and dignity in the foregoing communities at special risk. Unfortunately, the foregoing strategies, which country experience demonstrates are necessary for an effective prevention policy, have many opponents. Some of these opponents are religious leaders, politicians, educators, media personnel and other vocal community groups. The challenge before the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Joint United Nations on AIDS (UNAIDS) and other United Nations agencies is to secure progress towards prevention policies in circumstance where the need for progress is at once extremely urgent and critical to the lives of millions who are at risk. This is not a time for nit-picking over of policies. It is a time for broad strokes, administered with a high sense of urgency, in a desperate endeavour to reduce the ongoing and still enormous toll of HIV throughout the world. All of the foregoing strategies are difficult for many communities and particular groups within them. However, because the present dialogue occurs on World Anti-Homophobia Day, it is appropriate to concentrate attention on the causes of homophobia. If those causes can be understood, it may be possible for UNDP, UNAIDS and other agencies of the world community to achieve greater success in securing acceptance of the policies necessary for prevention. Combating homophobia and the violence, stigma, discrimination and ignorance that it generates, is desirable of itself. It is a human rights respecting strategy that does not really need additional justification. It is sustained by many contemporary statements about universal human rights1. However, because of the advent of HIV, there is now an added dynamic that enhances the need for urgent action. This has been recognised by world leaders, including, repeatedly, the Secretary-General of the United Nations (Ban Ki-moon)2. 1 See e.g. Toonen v Australia (1994) 1 Int Hum Rts Reports 97 (No.3). 2 Speech by Secretary-General at the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City, 3 August 2008, quoted UNAIDS, UN Guidance Note on HIV and Speaker statements and presentations 22 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific The chief object of this contribution is to deconstruct homophobia in order to reveal the impediments that exist against persuading countries, groups and individuals to adopt the policies towards MSM that will diminish the spread of HIV in that vulnerable group. What can we do to combat the feelings of animosity, repugnance and fear that lie at the heart of centuries-old attitudes towards people of minority sexual orientation or gender identity? The first step on this path is to understand how and why these attitudes come about.

Specifically, the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) have traditionally shared an acceptance that particular biblical texts should be construed to forbid same-sex relations. Thus, passages appear in the Torah (Old Testament)3; in the Christian Bible4 (although not the Gospels); and in the Holy Koran of Islam5. There are also passages in other holy books, including those of Buddhism. However, there are responses that can be deployed to reliance on such passages: \u2022\ufffd They must be read in the historic and cultural context in which they were written and according to the understandings of human sexuality that existed in their times; \u2022\ufffd They appear with other prohibitions that are not now generally observed (such as on eating crustaceans etc.). Certainly, it is not now acceptable in many societies to impose the punishment of death for their breach (as in the cases of apostasy and adultery); \u2022\ufffd They appear, if taken literally, to be at odds with contemporary scientific research into the causes, features and distribution of variations in sexual orientation revealed both in the human species and other animal species; and \u2022\ufffd They are now contested as to their meanings by many religious scholars within the relevant belief systems or, at least, they are no longer universally regarded as inerrant divine instruction to be literally understood. Legal doctrine: One feature of the appearance of specific criminal sanctions against MSM is its predominance in countries that were formerly part of the British Empire. By legislative amendment or judicial rulings, the older former dominions of the British Crown have, for the most part, terminated the operation of penal code provisions imposing severe punishment on those convicted of \u201cunnatural offences\u201d, \u201ccrimes against the order of nature\u201d, \u201csodomy\u201d etc. (The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, United States of America and South Africa). Yet many other member states of the Commonwealth of Nations (41 of 54) persist with such criminal provisions inherited from colonial times. Efforts to secure the repeal of such provisions have either been fiercely resisted (Jamaica, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Malawi) or ignored in recent times (Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Nauru). Attempts have been made to increase the ambit and punishments for such offences (Uganda). An endeavour in 2009 to persuade the legislature of a country which, exceptionally, was admitted to the Commonwealth of Nations in 2009, although not formerly a British colony (Rwanda), to introduce such a law in comity with other African Commonwealth nations, failed. There was ultimately no foothold of support for such an intrusion into the personal space of citizens. Sex Work (2009), Geneva. See also N.

In Naz Foundation v Union of India6, the Delhi High Court upheld a challenge to the constitutional validity of s377 of the Indian Penal Code on the grounds of its inconsistency with equality and privacy guarantees in the Indian Constitution. The provision was held invalid in so far as it penalised adult, private consensual conduct. An appeal to the Supreme Court of India has been lodged. However, no appeal has been brought by the Government of India, which has accepted the ruling. I pay tribute to the powerful opinion of the Delhi High Court, then led by Chief Justice A.P. Shah. He is a liberator of millions of MSM in the sub-continent. The opinion which he co-signed with Justice S. Muraligjar is a beacon of hope for justice and law reform, especially in the many countries of the Commonwealth of Nations that trace their penal law to Britain and which share this unlovely leftover from colonial domination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "924bb718-6e5c-4b93-a11d-3aca210d0b2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "924bb718-6e5c-4b93-a11d-3aca210d0b2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/punitive-laws-human-rights-and-hiv-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-asia-pacific-high-level-dialogue-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific - High Level Dialogue Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/punitive-laws-human-rights-and-hiv-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-asia-pacific-high-level-dialogue-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a36d0e78375e70ea920f87eeae2ef860262f5baba383b5317b6af1e37b5c16c"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffa7ad32-9410-4cfa-b5ac-dd166c2fdc11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/punitive-laws-human-rights-and-hiv-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-asia-pacific-high-level-dialogue-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d53eb922980217961dace8bcb7165915eca6ac892402ee53de78b37fbb49e969"}}, "hash": "61095b00450f0d884e32ccc44de5e45e4245d6129d2be03d3e51f368272275a6", "text": "Approximately half the nations of the world that impose criminal sanctions on MSM are former British colonies.

Although some defenders of the British penal codes have asserted that they reflect pre-colonial traditions, this is hotly contested. In the case of India, it appears contrary to much historical evidence and many well-known records of pre-British traditional society in India. Obviously, the existence of religious instruction adverse to MSM and of penal provisions that criminalise that conduct (even when consensual, adult and private) help to explain the animosity towards sexual variations that exists in many societies. Such scriptural and criminal injunctions are bound to enter the minds of young people, as well as to affect the culture, civic discourse and doings of the modern media. Inevitably, they have an effect on common opinions and attitudes. They reinforce social norms and convey them seemlessly from generation to generation. Nevertheless, the religious and penal injunctions do not go to the heart of the causes of homophobia. Such attitudes exist even in societies with strong secular traditions or with religions that have not given emphasis to such prohibitions. They exist outside the former British Empire. They are strangely persistent and difficult to eradicate. It is therefore necessary to dig a little more deeply into human affairs in order to deconstruct the causes of homophobia. Only by doing this will the causes be exposed for reparative therapy. The deeper causes of homophobia Infantile similarities: Any observer of small children will soon become aware of their keen anxieties about difference. Such anxieties can arise in respect of differences occasioned by skin colour, the appearance of a disability, eating different food, speaking a different language, etc. The desire for sameness may be connected with fear of \u201cthe other\u201d. Perhaps in primitive times, those outside a community were indeed often a danger to those within. In this sense, the infantile fear of difference in human beings may originally have had a protective value. However, we recognise today that it can lead to very bad consequences \u2013 as in the murderous project against Jews instituted in Nazi Germany. Or the prejudice against blacks taught under apartheid. Or the discrimination against Aboriginals and Asian migrants imposed in the years of White Australia, which lasted in law until 1966. Prejudice against Aboriginals continued even after White Australia had been demolished. It was eventually dealt a blow as a result of important decisions of the High Court of Australia7 by legislation8 and by the provision of a national 6 Sub nom Naz Foundation v Delhi & Ors.

Speaker statements and presentations 24 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific apology9. Nations and individuals can grow out of infantile demands for unyielding similarity on the part of all people living in their society. They can recognise differences and even come to appreciate them. Where they do not appreciate them yet, they can at least recognise what science teaches, namely, that differences between human beings are common in nature. They must be accepted and accommodated if injustice and oppression are to be avoided. Such injustice and oppression diminish all those who live in a society that practises them. Human orifices: A second reason that may lie at the root of homophobia seems connected with notions of nature and natural law. Sometimes it is attributed to the design of human sexual apparatus. The fact that such apparatus is apt for reproductive coitus may be seen by those who insist upon it as a feature forbidding any \u2018misuse\u2019 of that apparatus. Thus, insertion of body parts into non-vaginal orifices is condemned as \u201cunnatural\u201d. This idea lies behind the colonial condemnation of \u201cacts against the order of nature\u201d. In earlier, pre-scientific days, in the absence of knowledge of empirical data, these notions might have been understandable. However, from at least the mid-20th century10, the research into the variations of human sexual conduct demonstrated that (as in other animal species) such conduct is in fact highly varied. It responds to pleasure-seeking and to playful activities which are not specifically motivated by procreation. If conducted between consenting adults in private, such activities can reinforce feelings of affection, love and mutuality. The advent of the contraceptive pill and other protections against conception, as well as the development of in vitro fertilisation reduced the connection between sexual intercourse and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e628c60-06a9-4b7d-9554-fcf00a96e797": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e628c60-06a9-4b7d-9554-fcf00a96e797", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/punitive-laws-human-rights-and-hiv-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-asia-pacific-high-level-dialogue-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific - High Level Dialogue Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/punitive-laws-human-rights-and-hiv-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-asia-pacific-high-level-dialogue-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2efe66b6f94852fbba510a9d6f69991096e9d2feb46ad1b4232edfe4220dc18b"}}, "hash": "2efe66b6f94852fbba510a9d6f69991096e9d2feb46ad1b4232edfe4220dc18b", "text": "procreation. In the face of scientific developments, therefore, the design of human anatomy should not sustain the serious punishments and stigma towards a minority for whom procreation might not be a major (or any) motivation for sexual conduct. Recognising the importance of sexual conduct for the happiness of virtually every human being on the planet, at some stage in their lives, constitutes the beginning of a realisation of the injustice and cruelty not only of seeking to deny such activity to a minority who seek it; but also the futility of attempting to do so. Just as earlier religious prohibitions on masturbation (onanism) and left-handedness are not now generally pressed. And the harmless and universal features of those attributes of human existence are commonly accepted. Aesthetic familiarity: Connected to the foregoing considerations is the community value commonly attached to the normality of majority human sexual relationships. Most human beings are heterosexual, at least predominantly, if not exclusively so. Most human beings continue to be happiest in heterosexual relations, commonly with children. The image of such families is aesthetically pleasing to the majority and indeed to most members of society. Most (including members of sexual minorities) are familiar with such arrangements. Most members of sexual minorities grow up in such families. They see the beauty of them through the generations, including into old age. Such feelings of aesthetic comfort are reinforced by acquaintance which, in turn, is sustained and strengthened by literature, modern media, advertising, and the presentation of the norm as the universal. Nevertheless, it must now be recognised that the norm is not universal. There are other aesthetics with which society today must come to terms. These include the existence in society of homosexuals, bisexuals, transsexuals, intersex and other minorities. Because of the developments of in vitro fertilisation, it has become physically possible for members of such minorities to secure and rear genetically related children. This is becoming less uncommon in many Western societies. In others, it continues to cause affront and fear. The ordinary is demanded 9 On 13 February 2008, the Prime Minister of Australia (Hon. Kevin Rudd MP) presented an apology to indigenous Australians in the form of a statement to the House of Representatives. The apology was endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Brendan Nelson MP) and, later in the same day, by the Australian Senate acting unanimously. 10 Alfred Kinsey et al, Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behaviour in the Human Female (1953).

Yet those who are familiar with other family arrangements will attest (as court decisions do) to the love and support for children that can exist within less common family arrangements. In particular cases, there may be less aesthetic affront in the appearance of children raised by loving same-sex couples than in the case of children raised by a heterosexual parent engaged in serial relationships, especially where these are unstable or abusive. Whilst the aesthetic sense of the norm is perhaps understandable, the changing patterns of marriage in heterosexual and bi-sexual people, presents the realities of families differently composed. In international human rights law, the family is now often defined to exclude relationships outside monogamous heterosexual ones. However, as such relationships become more familiar, the aesthetic affront of their appearance is diminished. The appearance of Asian or Aboriginal neighbours formerly offended the aesthetic sense of some Australians. As they become more familiar with families that look a little different from their own, observers become more comfortable. They look beyond the initial impression of differences into the commonalities of blood, support and affection that underpin the most precious and intimate of human relationships. Minority arrangements are then seen as unthreatening to those of the majority. The test is mutuality and love. It is not conforming to a common arrangement oppressively enforced on all by legal norms confined exclusively to the comfort of the majority. Cultural values: In addition to genetic elements, all human beings are profoundly influenced by their culture and environment. This includes familial, racial, moral and geographic elements. Cultural norms often influence attitudes to sexuality. In some Arab societies, strong feelings about the honour of the family can be reinforced by profound feelings of shame where any family member strays from what is deemed acceptable behaviour11.

Whilst the cultural traditions of different societies should ordinarily be respected, a line can be drawn where the tradition is seriously oppressive to individuals or groups or denies them the full realisation of their own universal human rights. In the current age, the assertion (mostly) by older heterosexual men of what younger people (including women, gays and other minorities) may do with their lives and bodies is less unquestioned than once it was. With MSM, it is not uncommon, even for patriarchal societies to permit a space for their existence, but in accordance with a bargain by which they maintain their existence as a secret; avoid confronting others with their actuality; refrain from demanding change in law and society; and go along with the policy: \u2018Don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019. Whilst safe spaces in society are obviously to be preferred to violence, members of sexual minorities connive in their own denigration and even oppression by accepting life-long invisibility. If there is no challenge to a binary sexual division of the human species and no presentation of the actuality of the spectrum of sexual feelings and experience, the result will often be frustration, unhappiness, hypocrisy, shame and violence. Children and loneliness: Where members of sexual majority come to accept the existence of sexual minorities, they may still prefer to discourage any overt expression of minority identities and feelings in a supposed desire to protect the minorities themselves from the suggested loneliness and emptiness of a childless existence. Knowledge of the great joys that children can bring sometimes lies behind the sense of loss and regret at the discovery of a sexual identity that may effectively deny the possibility of children. Yet, whilst such responses are often understandable, they cannot be allowed to sustain the attempt, by the use of criminal law and punishments, to enforce upon individuals, emotions and actions that they are not able (easily or at all) to manifest with honesty. A heterosexual person has only to ask themselves how they would feel if forced, by law or social pressure, to pretend to a life-long relationship undesired and physically uncongenial to them. Not only would this be alien to the person involved. It is a serious and dangerous affront to their partner. 11 Brian Whitaker, Unspeakable Love: Gay and Lesbian Life in the Middle East, Uni of California Press, Berkeley, 2006, 19-23. Speaker statements and presentations 26 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific There are many answers to the fears of childlessness and loneliness: \u2022\ufffd New birth technologies have overcome their necessity, at least for those who are persistent and able to afford such treatment; \u2022\ufffd Not all people want children. The world is over-populated. The fact that some people will remain childless has certain social benefits. There is no risk that it will become the norm; \u2022\ufffd At least some childless individuals devote energies, that would otherwise be addressed to a nuclear family and children, towards the service of a wider community. Amongst avian and other animal species, sexual variation seems sometimes to be explained by service to the flock or the group. The same may be true in some human beings. In any case, attempts to force people into a binary arrangement that is unnatural to them is cruel, likely to be unsuccessful and prone to cause serious consequences for the individual and others. The unstable compromise: Some contemporary religious teaching and the penal laws described above aim at forcing members of sexual minorities to remain celibate. If there can be no (lawful/moral) sexual activity except within a marriage and if marriage may not be extended to same-sex couples, the solution offered by those of that view is unstable. It is that sexual minorities may exist (as science teaches they do), but that they must be allowed no physical expression for their sexual feelings. Sigmund Freud once observed that celibacy was the only truly unnatural sexual inclination. However it may be adopted in human societies for particular persons with special vocations (and even then imperfectly), it is not a feasible arrangement for the overwhelming majority of ordinary human beings. To try to enforce it upon people, in all of their generality and diversity, is therefore doomed to fail. Yet this is the position now reached by many religious teachers and enforcers of the penal law. Once the existence of sexual minorities was recognised, the logic of that recognition demands appreciation of the inevitability and naturalness of the expression", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a316a6f-0a7e-408b-9bfa-23b52649f1d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a316a6f-0a7e-408b-9bfa-23b52649f1d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/punitive-laws-human-rights-and-hiv-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-asia-pacific-high-level-dialogue-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific - High Level Dialogue Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/punitive-laws-human-rights-and-hiv-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-asia-pacific-high-level-dialogue-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4ca93447d9e8097a5cd553d07b42cf5e6ac6388cf553bdb0a0b0f302040737c"}}, "hash": "c4ca93447d9e8097a5cd553d07b42cf5e6ac6388cf553bdb0a0b0f302040737c", "text": "of sexual feelings, at least so long as those feelings occur between consenting adults in private. That principle not only reflects a proper limitation upon the intrusion of the criminal law and the powers of the state into the lives of individuals. It also recognises a deep psychological need that is conducive to human happiness, social equity and peace. As such, it does not appear to be inimical to the fundamental beliefs of the world\u2019s religious traditions that normally share an acceptance of the Golden Rule: to do as we would be done by. In the context of global human rights, and in the particular circumstances of the GFC and of the HIV epidemic, there is therefore an urgent need to reflect the foregoing considerations in both legal reform and in epidemiological strategies. Change agents Who have been the change agents that have brought about the alteration of attitudes to MSM, notwithstanding the foregoing phenomena that have reinforced homophobia for so long in human history? In my view, they have included at least the following: \u2022\ufffd Codifiers: Those who codified the criminal law in France and exported their more modern ideas through the French, Spanish, Portuguese, Netherlands, German, Swiss and Russian colonial traditions. Their work has also extended wherever those traditions were voluntarily accepted by other countries, as for example, in China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Thus, in Indonesia (the country with the largest Islamic population in the world), because The Netherlands Penal Code was originally derived from that of France, the Penal Code of the East-Indies never contained a sodomy offence. To this day, Indonesia has no such offence, except 27 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific that recently, in parts of southern Sumatra, it has been introduced for the first time as an aspect of Shariah law. For the most part, the enlightenment of the Napoleonic codifiers has been reflected in Indonesia as in the majority of countries of the world. Accidents of colonial history and of the embrace of colonial models, rather than deep well springs of local cultures, explain most of the differences in the legal regimes now applying. \u2022\ufffd Scientists: The introduction of scientific exploration of the features and patterns of human sexual behaviour was a distinctive feature of twentieth century science. Researchers such as Havelock Ellis, Sigmund Freud, Alfred Kinsey, Evelyn Hooker and later sexologists helped by providing an increasingly emprirical foundation for understanding the varieties of human sexual conduct and the normality (or at least the commonality and certainly the frequency) of what had earlier been condemned as \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cagainst the order of nature\u201d. \u2022\ufffd Reformers: In part stimulated by the advances in the understanding of psychology and psychiatry and because of research into human sexuality, legal reformers appeared from the middle of the twentieth century urging removal of the old criminal penalties. The Wolfenden enquiry in Britain12 led to the eventual reform of the criminal law of the United Kingdom, with the repeal of the sodomy offence that had earlier occasioned more hangings in London in the 1830s even than for murder13. The reform of the criminal law in Britain was quickly followed by amending legislation in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and parts of the United States. Ireland also followed, as did other jurisdictions. South Africa14, the United States of America15, and now India16, have been the beneficiaries of enlightened judicial decisions. More recently, the Fiji Islands17 has accepted reform, first by a judicial, and then a legislative, course. \u2022\ufffd Human Rights: In the case of the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland18, the Republic of Ireland19 and Cyprus20, legislative reform was itself stimulated by decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. With increasing insistence in recent years, that European Court has demanded true equality in the treatment of sexual orientation and gender identity throughout the entire area subject to its jurisdiction. In March 2010, the European Council of Ministers adopted a recommendation in the most emphatic terms providing for equal treatment of sexual minorities throughout Europe in a comprehensive range of human activities21. \u2022\ufffd The advance of global human rights has also extended the message of equality of treatment to sexual minorities beyond the borders of Europe and the developed countries of North America and Australasia.

The Church of South India, for example, pronounced itself in favour of the decision of the Delhi High Court in the Naz Foundation Case. So did respected leaders of the Hindu belief. In 2009, a representative of the Holy See urged the United Nations to support the removal of criminal sanctions against homosexual acts. This was the more significant because that church has continued to insist both that, morally, homosexuals must not engage in sexual behaviour outside marriage, and that marriage for them is unacceptable and \u201cevil\u201d. \u2022\ufffd Media and internet: An important element in securing a change in global attitudes to sexual orientation and gender identity has been the operation and outreach of international media. No longer can the actualities of sexual variation be kept a secret. In today\u2019s world, satellites, global media, the internet and social networking have reduced the barriers to awareness and discovery of sexual variations. The inclusion of characters in popular television programmes, both of documentaries and soap operas, has helped to change human perceptions of this issue. The revelation by leading citizens that they are homosexual or bisexual has begun the process, at least in many developed countries, of shattering the reinforcement for the binary illusion that previously prevailed because of veil of silence and shame. \u2022\ufffd Standing up: Finally, as increasing numbers of experts and others have spoken out on the injustice and irrationality of previous prohibitions on sexual minorities (especially because of the global predicament of HIV/AIDS), the ability to hold the line on the present laws has become more tenuous. In due course, this development will affect not only the removal of the criminal laws against MSM. It will also impact the reforms of public order legislation governing the conduct of gays23 and, eventually, legislation on the human relationships of sexual minorities, whether in the form of \u2018marriage\u2019 or of \u2018civil union/partnership\u2019. Whilst the last-mentioned reform was, not so long ago, regarded as unthinkable and even unarguable24, the tide of more recent judicial decisions, in many diverse jurisdictions, has shifted strongly in favour of the provision of civic equality to sexual minorities but within an environment that respects the entitlement of religious groups to be exempt from participation in such relationship recognition if they so wish. That participation may come later when the instability of the present holding compromise is fully appreciated and the need to reach a new plane of rationality and human kindliness is accepted. Moving through the transition The result of this analysis is that, a reflection on the law and sexual minorities demonstrates that we are passing through a transition of the law. As scientific knowledge and evident human actuality come to be known to the societies governed by law and opinion, old laws and practices will be abandoned.

It is in the clash between established laws and remaining religious and social prejudices that the chief challenge for the international community arises on this International Day Against Homophobia. Its involvement is justified by the role played by the agencies of the United Nations in combating the spread of HIV and in funding the response. That response must increasingly recognise and reflect the urgency of prevention. In the case of MSM (one of the groups most vulnerable to HIV infection) prevention strategies will not work (certainly will not work efficiently and quickly) whilst stigma, criminalisation and a code of silence prevail in law and in society. Leadership is urgently needed to remove these impediments in the case of MSM and other vulnerable groups. The GFC means that the crisis in global strategies is most urgent. It will become increasingly so. This is why UNDP and UNAIDS are to be congratulated on the initiatives they have taken. The holding of this high level dialogue in Hong Kong and the creation of the new UNDP Global Commission on HIV and the Law are to be welcomed. They are important initiatives that point in the right direction. The world will eventually follow. But will it follow quickly enough to save the lives of those many most at risk? Speaker statements and presentations 30 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacifi c Hon. Ajit Prakash Shah India and Section 377 Mr. Thomas Abraham, co-panellists and ladies and gentlemen. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code contains anti sodomy law. It speaks of unnatural off ences and punishes them with imprisonment for life or imprisonment which may extend to 10 years and fi ne. On 2nd July, 2009, the Delhi High Court in Naz Foundation v. Government of NCT of Delhi and others declared Section 377 as unconstitutional insofar as it criminalizes consensual sexual acts between consenting adults in private. The judgment triggered a euphoric response from the LGBT community as well as from the wider activist community. The instantaneous social impact of the judgment was to actually begin a national conversation. LGBT persons were out of the closet and literally onto the front pages of all Indian papers and news channels. Union of India has decided not to appeal against this judgment. Some religious bodies and individuals have challenged the verdict in the Supreme Court. Most of the challenges allege that homosexuality is associated with rampant promiscuity of the West, which centres hedonism and pleasure that are not apparently a part of Indian cultural make-up. Even amongst religious groups progressive voices were heard, like Swami Angnivesh, a Hindu rationalist responding to the verdict said, \u201cWe should treat the constitution as our Dharam Shastra today\u201d. Asghar Ali Engineer, Islamic Scholar and rights activist, welcomed the verdict since upholding the basic human rights was central to the judgment. Citing verses from the Koran, Dr.Engineer said it was deemed punishable only when it was practised by an entire community and not in individual cases. K.C. Abraham from the Church of South India said that the fi nal goal of all religions was to move towards an inclusive society and not isolate anyone. The objective of Section 377 has remained unclear and unsubstantiated. The off ence was introduced into British India with a presumption of a shared biblical minority. Historians have speculated that \u201cthere were concerns that not having wives would encourage the Imperial Army to become \u2018replicas of Sodom and Gommorah\u2019 or to pick up \u2018special Oriental vices\u201d.

Homosexuality was an age-old practice and even Mughal 31 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific Speaker statements and presentations king Babar\u2019s diary had references to him being enamoured by young boys in adolescence. In the post-independence period, Section 377 has been hardly invoked against adult homosexuals. Though police harassment and blackmail is common, only few have been actually prosecuted in court. Government of India sought to justify the retention of Section 377 on the ground that it has been generally invoked in cases of allegations of child sexual abuse and for complementing lacunae in the rape laws and not mere homosexuality. The argument was deceptively simple; since no one is arrested or jailed, no one is seriously injured. In Bowers v. Hardwick where the US Supreme Court by 5-4 majority upheld constitutionality of a State sodomy law, Justice Powell explicitly found rationale that the laws were, after all, unenforced. In a number of recent works, notably that of Professors Janet Halley and Christopher Leslie, the authors argued that such consequences are not purely symbolic and these laws have three direct impacts: damage to the psychological well-being of lesbians and gays, encouragement of anti-gay violence and facilitation of police harassment. In their studies of the social effects of sodomy statutes in South Africa Ryan Goodman and Edwin Cameron demonstrated that even in a climate of non-enforcement, considerable harm still exists. Even when these provisions are not enforced, they reduce gay men and women to what one author has referred to as \u2018un-apprehended felons\u2019. What is certain is that Section 377 is wielded as a threat against sexual minorities by the police and others in positions of authority as well as thugs and goons to harass, blackmail, threaten and assault vulnerable men. Section 377 opens opportunities for the abuse of other criminal laws which become excuses for harassment and blackmail by both police and members of the public, and for making arrests. This harassment is all the more effective because most victims have little knowledge of the law and fear the social repercussions of public knowledge about their sexual identity. While the law may not in itself generate homophobia, its very existence moulds beliefs and attitudes, and drives the demeaning and abusive treatment meted out to people of alternative sexualities and those who work with them. There are documented instances of exploitation, violence, rape and torture suffered by LGBT community in India. The incidents cited relate to different parts of the country and include what have come to be known as \u201cLucknow incident-2002\u201d wherein police raided on the premises of an NGO working in the area of HIV / AIDS prevention leading to arrest and incarceration of healthcare workers; \u201cBangalore incident \u2013 2004\u201d wherein a Hijra - eunuch - was initially subjected to forced oral / anal sex by miscreants, later arrested by the police to be grossly abused and tortured in custody because of sexual identity and the case of Jayalakshmi relating to a eunuch who was subjected to torture including oral sex by police personnel in custody leading to suicide by immolation. Recently in a tragic case of a senior professor of Aligarh Muslim University thee persons allegedly from the media barged into his house and took photographs / video of him and his male partner. The university officials arrived at the scene clearly evidencing that they were in the know of the operation and were complicit to the same. The professor was issued a charge sheet for indulging himself into immoral activities and suspended and asked to vacate the quarters. In a writ petition filed by him, the High Court reinstated him by an interim order but on the next day he was found dead in his quarters. Apparently he committed suicide. In Naz Foundation, the principal argument of the State was that law do not run separately from morality and that law in fact has to reflect the wider morality. The State could, therefore, infringe on fundamental rights to protect the larger legitimate interest of \u2018public morality\u2019. The court\u2019s reasoning in the Naz was that the government may only infringe on core fundamental rights if doing so is necessary to serve a compelling state interest. For example, the state may criminalize private sex between adults and minors because there is a compelling state interest in protecting children against sexual exploitation.

Popular morality or public disapproval of certain acts is not a valid justification for restriction of the fundamental rights under Article 21. The Court said: \u201cThe Constitution of India recognizes, protects and celebrates diversity. To stigmatize or to criminalize homosexuals only on account of their sexual orientation would be against the constitutional morality.\u201d A peculiar feature of the case of Naz was that two wings of the Union of India took completely contradictory positions. While Ministry of Health and Family Welfare insisted that its continuance has hampered HIV/AIDS prevention efforts, the Ministry of Home Affairs justified the retention of Section 377 on the statute book. Health Ministry\u2019s stand was that the stigma attached to sex workers and men who have sex with men by Section 377 presented a serious obstacle to HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. Repeated studies have also shown that the countries that have been most successful in the contentment of HIV and reduction of transmission of HIV have been those that have adopted responses that include the defence of the human rights of those most at risk. Toeing the line of the Home Ministry, the Additional Solicitor General, however, argued that repeal of Section 377 would lead to a increase in the spread of HIV, which arguments were rejected for the reason that there exist no scientific study or research work by any recognized scientific or medical body, or for that matter any other material, to show any causal connection existing between de-criminalization of homosexuality and the spread of HIV/AIDS. Safeguarding public health may indeed be a compelling state interest that can justify reasonable limitation on the right to privacy. Compelling state interest, however, the judgment says, \u201cdemands that public health measures are strengthened by de-criminalization of such activities, so that they can be identified and better focused upon\u201d. One more facet of the decision in Naz Foundation is that it closely examines \u201cgender entity\u201d and gender based discrimination. It is necessary to highlight this aspect because the terms \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity\u201d are often conflated. Since transgender and transsexual people can have any sexual orientation, it is important to distinguish their gender from their sexual activity. During the colonial period in India, hijras (eunuchs) were criminalized by virtue of their identity. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was enacted by the British in an effort to police those tribes and communities who \u2018were addicted to the systematic commission of non-bailable offences\u2019. In 1897, this Act was amended to include eunuchs. According to the amendment, the local government was required to keep a register of the names and residences of all eunuchs who are \u2018reasonably suspected of kidnapping or castrating children or of committing offences under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code\u2019. Commenting on the Criminal Tribes Act in a speech made in 1936, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru said: \u201cI am aware of the monstrous provisions of the Criminal Tribes Act which constitute a negation of civil liberty... an attempt should be made to have the Act removed from the statute book. No tribe can be classed as criminal as such and the whole principle as such is out of consonance with civilized principles of criminal justice and treatment of offenders...\u201d While this Act has been repealed, the attachment of criminality to the hijra community still continues. After specifically making a reference to Yogyakarta Principles, a set of international human rights relating to sexual orientation and gender identity, the Court in Naz said: \u201cThe purpose underlying the fundamental right against sex discrimination is to prevent behaviour that treats people differently for reason of not being in conformity with generalizations concerning \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018natural\u2019 gender roles. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is itself grounded in stereotypical judgments and generalization about the conduct of either sex.\u201d The decision of the Nepal Supreme Court in Sunil Babu Pant and others v.

In 2009, the Supreme Court of Pakistan issued a series of directions to ensure that eunuch citizens should have equal rights and access to Government benefits. Islamic Jurist Dr.Mohammad Aslam Khaki who researched their conditions discovered them to be the most oppressed and deprived segment of the society and subject it to humiliation and molestation. During the proceedings two transgenders appeared before the court to narrate harrowing details of abuse they receive from society police and gangsters. The Supreme Court directed police to provide protection to transgenders, add their names in electoral rolls and national database. Since the judgment in Naz has provided horizontal protection i.e. discrimination by private individuals and against indirect harassment and discrimination, this decision has far-reaching impact on those facing discrimination based on gender identity. Persons who are not admitted in hospitals, or who are denied entry into public toilets, denied jobs or admissions in schools and colleges based on their gender identity- whether hijra, kothi, FTM, MTF, intersexed, or transsexual, all have a remedy under the law. The notion of equality in the Indian Constitution flows from the \u2018Objectives Resolution\u2019 moved by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on December 13, 1946. Nehru, in his speech, wished that the Constituent Assembly should consider the Resolution not in a spirit of narrow legal wording, but rather look at the spirit behind it. He said,\u201dWords are magic things often enough, but even the magic of words sometimes cannot convey the magic of the human spirit and of a Nation\u2019s passion\u2026\u2026.. (The Resolution) seeks very feebly to tell the world of what we have thought or dreamt of so long, and what we now hope to achieve in the near future.\u201d If there is one constitutional tenet that can be said to be underlying theme of the Indian Constitution, it is that of \u2018inclusiveness\u2019. Indian Constitution reflects this value deeply ingrained in Indian society, nurtured over several generations. The inclusiveness that Indian society traditionally displayed, literally in every aspect of life, is manifest in recognising a role in society for everyone. Those perceived by the majority as \u201cdeviants\u2019 or \u2018different\u2019 are not on that score excluded or ostracised. Where society can display inclusiveness and understanding, such persons can be assured of a life of dignity and non-discrimination. Indian Constitutional law does not permit the statutory criminal law to be held captive by the popular misconceptions of who the LGBTs are. Discrimination is anti-thesis of equality and it is the recognition of equality which only can foster the dignity of every individual. 34 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacifi c Parliamentarian eff orts to address punitive laws / regulations that criminalize male to male sex, and its potential impacts on rights based responses to HIV in PNG and the Pacifi c It is a privilege to participate in this dialogue to mark the 2010 International Day Against Homophobia because dialoguing with experts from our region has re-energised me with a revised resolve in my Parliamentary work seeking the repeal of punitive laws that criminalise sexual behaviour between consenting adults. This particular legal reform agenda has been a roller-coaster ride for several years with some highs, many lows and a rock bottom low last week that initially tempted me to abandon the journey. It is inspiring to come together briefl y with fellow travellers who have been the trail blazers for human rights and justice in the world of sexual diversity.

The search for justice through a Parliamentary journey becomes very complex in these circumstances and the desired destination may have to be compromised to make small gains. If the gains are too small, the route may need to change from a Parliamentary journey to a journey through the Judiciary. Papua New Guinea will need to face this choice within the next year. I will talk more about the PNG Parliamentary journey after summarising the legal status for the pacifi c region. Ten (10) Nations or Territories in the Pacifi c do not have punitive laws against men who have sex with men and there are eleven (11) nations in which homosexuality is illegal. Only one (1) Pacifi c nation, namely Fiji, has a Constitutional prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orientation. (ILGA Report 2008 et al). I have not had time to research the historical background regionally but I do note that the former French colonies do not have Hon. Dame Carol Kidu, DBE MP 35 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific punitive laws. For the situation in Papua New Guinea, our Criminal Code 1974 was inherited verbatim from the Queensland Criminal Code on Independence in 1975. At that time, the Queensland Criminal Code was based on 19th Century British law. Whereas the Queensland Criminal Code has since undergone complete reform, the Papua New Guinea Criminal Code has had minimal review and maintains some archaic, draconian laws that are rarely used directly but quite often abused by rogue law enforcers to intimidate, blackmail or brutalise indigenous gay men and sex workers. This situation has improved as the result of intensive work on police sensitisation under the HIV response strategy. The reality of abuse has improved somewhat but the criminality of homosexuality has remained in spite of the fact that the technical \u201ccriminals\u201d have been major players in Papua New Guinea\u2019s HIV response strategy. The hypocrisy of the situation is not acknowledged. Papua New Guinea faces an increasing burden of HIV infection with its associated economic, social and human costs. It is estimated that more than 60, 000 people are currently living with the virus and the epidemic is spreading in both urban and rural areas but with indications of a levelling off in some urban centres. The HIV and AIDS Management and Prevention Act 2003, together with the rights and principles set out in the National Constitution, have established a sound legal framework for Papua New Guinea\u2019s response to the HIV epidemic. However the existence of the outdated laws on sex work and male to male sex are in conflict with this framework and are obstructing effective HIV policies and programs. For the information of participants, the laws of the PNG Criminal Code 1974 relevant to homosexuality are: Section 210. UNNATURAL OFFENCES. (1) A person who\u2013 (a) sexually penetrates any person against the order of nature; or (b) sexually penetrates an animal; or (c) permits a male person to sexually penetrate him or her against the order of nature, is guilty of a crime. Penalty: Imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years. (2) A person who attempts to commit an offence against Subsection (1) is guilty of a crime. Penalty: imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. Section 212. INDECENT PRACTICES BETWEEN MALES. (1) A male person who, whether in public or private\u2013 (a) commits an act of gross indecency with another male person; or (b) procures another male person to commit an act of gross indecency with him; or (c) attempts to procure the commission of any such act by a male person with himself or with another male person, is guilty of a misdemeanour. Penalty: Imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years It was with the intention of repealing these sections of the Criminal Code that I recently submitted a National Executive Council (NEC or Cabinet) submission to get Government Executive endorsement for the on-going work. Speaker statements and presentations 36 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific The Criminal Code comes under the Attorney General\u2019s Portfolio so technically a Joint submission would be required. However, the then Attorney General had strong moral views on both homo-sexuality and prostitution.

Among other things, the submission argued that: There is increasing evidence that sex between men occurs in Papua New Guinea in a range of contexts, including traditional practices in some communities, as well as in urban settings and within the trans-gender community. (This evidence, based on anthropological studies and simple reality, contradicts and challenges the constructed myth that same sex intimacy is not Melanesian but has resulted from sinful foreign influence). It was a breakthrough when the Samoan Prime Minister, knowing that it would draw criticism, publicly accepted to be the Patron of the Fafafine Association thus acknowledging that sexual diversity was accepted as part of their traditional society. The submission points out that without effective measures to ensure safer sexual practices, there is the potential for a rapidly increasing burden of HIV among men who have sex with men as well as their female sexual partners. Given the imperatives of the HIV epidemic, the submission argues that the law requires urgent review. The submission also points out that existing law on male to male sex is obstructing Papua New Guinea\u2019s efforts to reduce the impact of the HIV epidemic because: \u2022\ufffd making consensual male to male sex a criminal offence does not stop it from occurring, but means it take place furtively without being publicly acknowledged; \u2022\ufffd as a result, men who choose to have sex with men are often hidden; it is difficult to reach out to them and engage them in effective HIV prevention and care programs; \u2022\ufffd the criminal law increases their marginalisation and discrimination, making it less likely that they will have the knowledge and power to protect their own health and the health of their sexual partners, both male and female; \u2022\ufffd it makes them vulnerable to police brutality, blackmail and harassment, even though criminal charges are rarely laid. The submission also argued that the review of the criminal law on male to male sex is a necessary part of Papua New Guinea\u2019s compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was ratified by Papua New Guinea in 2008. The submission acknowledged that many people within Papua New Guinea have strong moral objections to male to male sex, even where it takes place between consenting adults. The submission did not seek to challenge these moral views, nor to undermine the position that Church leaders and others may wish to adopt in relation to male to male sex. The submission did however point out that removing criminal penalties for both sex work and male to male sex is recognised internationally as an important platform of an effective HIV/AIDS response, and is considered by UNAIDS and other United Nations agencies to represent \u201cbest practice\u201d in this area and quoted various references to validate this fact. The submission also informed that the Vatican has supported the repeal of these criminal laws in the statement of the Holy See Delegation at the 63rd session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (18 December 2008). It also gave examples of the ruling of 37 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific the High Court of India and the Crime Decree in Fiji which decriminalised consensual male to male sex to replace the Criminal Penal Code which was considered archaic and not in tune with changing times in Fiji. I felt comfortable with the submission which was prepared by a consulting legal expert provided to me by the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations (AFAO) and endorsed by the Technical Working Group that have been advising me on this area of legal reform for several years. The background to the submission was also explained covering the fact that I was approached by members of the medical profession over 10 years ago to bring legislative reform in several areas of sexual and reproductive health from both a public health and a human rights perspective. A multi-sectoral and stakeholder working group was put in place to begin consultation on the issues. Research work for the submission began during the last term of Parliament and considerable consultation with a wide variety of in-country stakeholders has already been undertaken in addition to comparative research and advice from international experience. The consultations have included the Attorney General and his senior officers, the First Legislative Counsel\u2019s office, National AIDS Council Secretariat, Police, CIS, relevant NGOs, some church leaders, sex workers and MSM representatives.

The submission also recommended for Cabinet endorsement of this Reference Group and the preparation of a Terms of Reference to continue the work. So where are we now? I was feeling comfortable with the submission but was aware that a lot more Parliamentary sensitisation sessions would be needed to clarify areas of discomfort for my fellow legislators. But I was somewhat shocked last week when the submission appeared in our NEC agenda with the notation from the bureaucratic and Ministerial sub- committee meeting that the Committee \u201cstrongly rejected the submission but agreed for the submission to go to NEC for its deliberation\u201d. I was shocked because the submission was not asking for repeal of the laws or decriminalisation. It simply seeks Government endorsement that these archaic and punitive laws should be reviewed. I am optimistic that, when I have the opportunity to present the submission in our next NEC meeting, I will succeed in convincing Cabinet in general that reviewing laws is one of the mandated roles of a Parliamentarian \u2013 no matter how uncomfortable or publicly contentious it may be. The Way Forward? The first challenge is to get the review work endorsed as a Government agenda if possible. If not, it could become a Backbencher\u2019s Private Member\u2019s Bill because there is support for the reform amongst some Ministers as well as some Backbenchers. However with an election in 18 months time, MPs who intend to stand again may shy away from such contentious issues as homosexuality and prostitution. If the Parliamentary route becomes too difficult, other possibilities include the appointment of a Commissioner for Laws to do a comprehensive clean up the archaic provisions in the PNG Criminal Code 1974. The need for this has been discussed by Government but not yet actioned. The newly appointed Attorney General may take this discussion forward. Failing that the Reference Group has discussed the possibility of taking the matter to the Supreme Court for a Constitutional interpretation knowing that there are regional precedents of judicial review. Speaker statements and presentations 38 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific The journey for justice has not reached a dead-end yet but it certainly needs more fuel to keep the engines rolling. I am particularly looking forward to the planned visit of the Hon Michael Kirby in the near future to dialogue with our Parliamentarians, our Judiciary and other relevant stakeholders, including church leaders. In general, people have been forced by the reality of the HIV epidemic out of their comfort zone of denial of sexual diversity but a lot more work needs to be done to make them comfortable in accepting reality. I have assured some concerned Pastors who went to the media about \u201cthe immoral Bill\u201d that I have no intention of changing the Marriage Act to accommodate same sex marriages; I have assured other critics that I have already passed major reforms of the Criminal Code in 2002 in the areas of rape, sexual assault and child sexual exploitation. These reforms cover the areas of non-consent and the sexual protection of children under 18 years of age. But when people revert to perceptions of sin and Christian doctrine, I can only agree to disagree and suggest that it is time for some Christians to become more Christ-like in their behaviour and thinking. My best wishes for the International Day Against Homophobia 2010 and I look forward to the time when this day can be celebrated openly in Papua New Guinea. My thanks to UNDP for funding my participation and to all the organisations involved for inspiring me to keep travelling this roller coaster journey for justice for all regardless of their sexual preferences. The HIV epidemic has become a catalyst for action but this must not overshadow the fact that fundamentally homophobia is a human rights issue.

Perhaps I can even call this an auspicious day, this International Day Against Homophobia, and the High Level Dialogue we are now engaged with, even though countless thousands of fellow MSM and transgenders are living with HIV, if not dying \u2013 or died \u2013 from HIV related illnesses. In the Independent Commission on AIDS in Asia 2008 report, a warning was issued that by 2020, about 50% of all those living with HIV by then would be MSM (of whatever identity they claim) and transgender people. This is a shocking statistic, and \u2013 if I may say so - a pointed indictment of the countries in which these human beings are citizens. But why should this alarming fi gure exist at all, when we have the knowledge, the understanding, and the expertise, to ensure that such growth need not happen? We know how to prevent the spread of HIV. We have known a long time. The Commission\u2019s report also highlighted why such a situation exists. MSM and transgender people in most countries in the Asia Pacifi c region are highly stigmatised, discriminated against, and socially excluded, where acts of random violence and abuse are constant threats to their lives. Underlying the vast majority of cases of such abuse, are a range of punitive laws and policies that do not see MSM and transgender people as citizens of their countries and therefore have no legitimate basis to seek health education and services that would reduce their risks and vulnerability to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. In fact many of these laws and policies actually increase their risks and vulnerabilities to this virus, and because they exist, such individuals cannot access health care services when they are infected, thus leading to their deaths. Is not such a scenario a form of genocide? But this does not have to be the situation. There is a way forward towards ensuring that all citizens of a country, irrespective of their sexual orientation or gender identity, can access health services to prevent this unnecessary infection. And that is to review, amend and/or repeal existing laws and policies that punish and criminalise people for who they are and impede their access to health education. 41 High Level Dialogue - Punitive Laws, Human Rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in Asia Pacific India, Nepal, and even Pakistan, have all demonstrated that, despite very high levels of stigma, discrimination and abuse in these countries, concerted action can bring about effective change. In India, the Delhi High Court ruled in reading down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which had criminalised non-vaginal sex. In Nepal, the Supreme Court ruled on the citizenship rights of sexual minorities, while in Pakistan, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the rights of transgenders. These were landmark judgements in these countries, but they did not spring out of nowhere in a form of immaculate conception. These rulings had emerged after a considerable amount of engagement with a process that brought a range of stakeholders together. Key to these successful outcomes was the essential engagement of MSM and transgender networks, groups and organisations in the process, along with a partnership engagement of a number of key stakeholders that included the the judiciary, advocates and lawyers, Human Rights Commissions, parliamentarians, government ministries, the media, along with a range of civil society organisations. Champions were sought from all these institutions, who could strongly articulate the need for social justice of MSM and transgenders, including health and citizenship rights. Workshops were conducted to sensitise these differing stakeholders. Meetings with media were held to advocate for sensitive coverage. Discussions with health ministries and their colleagues were held to address a country\u2019s public health needs. A road much more travelled in these past few years. What a change from 1991, when I first started working on HIV and MSM and transgender people. I call upon you all here, on behalf of the millions of MSM and transgender people in Asia Pacific to enable compassion and understanding to rule your hearts and minds, not hatred and fear. I ask that we all walk along this road towards social justice for all, together in partnership and mutual concern that we must not reach that 50% figure I mentioned earlier, but rather ensure universal access to health. I humbly ask for your support and encouragement that we work together to avoid a regional genocide arising from ignorance, fear, and misunderstanding. Thank you.

As such, protecting and expanding access to generic ARV medicines is a vital priority for countries in the region. In this period of rapid economic development in the Asia Pacific, the need to strike the right balance between securing intellectual property protection to foster genuine innovation to protect the public health of the 4.9 million people living with HIV in the region becomes more urgent. On the 29-31th of May, 81 delegates including 20 international resource persons and 61 representatives from 9 countries in the region met in the Imperial Queen Park Hotel in Bangkok, Thailand. Delegates met to share their experiences, achievements and challenges in their collect objective in securing access to affordable medicines under the World Trade Organisation\u2019s Agreement on Trade-Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and other trade-related agreements. The three-day workshop was structured as follows: Day 1 focused on the implications of the Doha Declaration on public health interests and the use of various flexibilities under the TRIPS Agreement to ensure access to affordable drugs. Day 2 focused on the risks and challenges posed by the inclusion of TRIPS+ provisions in on-going free trade negotiations between countries in the region and high-income countries and on experiences in dealing with these risks and challenges. Day 3 focused on opportunities for countries in the region to strengthen collaboration to ensure access to affordable ARVs across the region. This was followed by presentations of country action plans. The following is a summary report of the proceedings. Maximising TRIPS Flexibilities. The opening remarks by Shiba Phurailatpam (Regional Coordinator, Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV) and Steve Kraus (Director, Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific, UNAIDS) highlighted the importance of maintaining access to generic medication for national HIV responses and the lives of PLHIV in the region. Also highlighted, was the fact that mechanisms for increasing access to affordable ARVs can also be used to secure access to other essential medicines, creating the potential for further significant development gains in this area. Speakers also remarked on the need to strike the right balance between fostering real pharmaceutical innovation through intellectual property protection and ensuring the right for all to access lifesaving medications. In the opening day of the workshop, international experts briefed participants on the importance of the 1995 TRIPS Agreement and the 2001 Doha declaration on access TRIPS Regional Workshop | 2 to medicines and on the use of public health related TRIPS flexibilities. Country delegations in turn, shared their experiences in utilising various TRIPS flexibilities such as compulsory licenses and stricter patentability criteria to improve access to generic drugs. Over the past decade, the annual cost of a first line antiretroviral regimen for low- income countries has dropped significantly. Treatment costing more than US$10,000 per person in 2000 is now below US$100 per person per year in a number of low- income countries in the region by 2010. During this period, the number of people on treatment in Asia-Pacific has more than tripled to reach nearly one million by the end of 2010. Yet currently more than 60 per cent of those in need of treatment in the region have no access. Such scale ups in ARV coverage both in the past and into the future would only be possible due to the existence of competition among suppliers of generic drugs, principally from India where the drugs were not patented as the country used transitional period flexibilities allowed under TRIPS and maintained a strong public health friendly patent law after 2006. The TRIPS Agreement is one of three primary agreements of the WTO since its establishment in 1995, imposing minimum standards of intellectual property protection while allowing countries to make use of certain flexibilities, including some relating to public health. As per the Agreement, all WTO Members must provide patent protection for medicines unless they adopt and make use of those flexibilities to secure access to affordable drugs. An exemption period is given to least developed countries. The Doha Declaration adopted in 2001, forms an authoritative interpretive guide for the use of TRIPS flexibilities, clarifying that the TRIPS Agreement does not prevent WTO Members from taking measures to protect public health. There is a variety of ways in which TRIPS flexibilities can be utilised:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4fb8205-144a-4568-900b-2e0df47f96be": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4fb8205-144a-4568-900b-2e0df47f96be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-consultation-and-planning-workshop-use-trips-flexibilities-access-affordable-arvs-asia-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Consultation and Planning Workshop on 'Use of TRIPS Flexibilities to Access Affordable ARVs in Asia' - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-consultation-and-planning-workshop-use-trips-flexibilities-access-affordable-arvs-asia-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f7060f3bb5e253c8843f6c650cd9e182d4c3b1af5a169140d550969b73504e7"}, "3": {"node_id": "79f6059a-1fb5-4e8a-9e49-e7fa3bda5a3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-consultation-and-planning-workshop-use-trips-flexibilities-access-affordable-arvs-asia-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ca2635364f2367e0fb67a8101689cc44a10684aa4a8d06a7734888d812395fd"}}, "hash": "0217324ca4d9bda4b6bb2974eea4085c419365918390d9ff2ed4949d863f60a9", "text": "PREVENTATIVE MEASURES: \u2018Ever-greening\u2019 is the practice whereby a drug\u2019s patent duration is extended by the reapplication of patents for essentially the same drug with slightly modified formulations, presentations or compositions. This was identified as a major issue in most participant countries. In Thailand, more than 96% of patent applications have one or more characteristics of ever-greening patents. Countries such as India, China and the Philippines have laws in place that limit the pool of patentable drug formulations. In China, provisions prevent the granting of patents that may \u2018harm the public interest\u2019, while India and the Philippines have strict patentability criteria that mitigate frivolous patents and \u2018ever-greening\u2019. Specifically, these laws clearly outline the definition and set rigorous standards for \u2018the Inventive Step\u2019. These preventative measures can reduce the number of successful patent applications by allowing only truly innovative drugs to receive patent protection rights. Having transparent patent application and pre-grant opposition process whereby the public may contest the granting of patents are also preventative measures, which ensure that public health needs are met through community engagement. 3 | Summary Report These preventatives mechanisms are an effective and often less politically sensitive first-line defence to limit the granting of patents on medicines. REMEDIAL: States can also enact remedial measures to reduce the impact of pharmaceutical patents on public health interests once granted. Chief among such flexibilities discussed, were the granting of compulsory licenses and government use orders, as well as the use of parallel importing and national completion laws. In particular, the compulsory licence (CL) or non- voluntary licences as referred in the TRIPS Agreement was discussed in depth. With the exception of least developed countries Cambodia and Myanmar to whom the 2016 exemption period for pharmaceutical products still applies, all countries in the region have in place legislative frameworks that allow them to issue compulsory licenses on drugs in at least one on the following conditions: government use, public health interest or emergencies. However, each country faces its own challenges to realise full and effective utilisation of this vital flexibility: \uf0b7 In some countries such as Thailand, intellectual property laws are not explicitly supporting the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities, while others such as India are having their compulsory licencing laws challenged. \uf0b7 Other challenges are procedural and organisational, as some country lack of capacity and experience with CLs within departments and patent offices as China Malaysia and Vietnam have cited or a lack of inter-departmental coordination mechanisms to oversee the process of issuing CLs. All states can ensure they use CLs to full effect by: Social mobilization and the Role of Civil Society. As civil society, activists and People Living with HIV cannot be out of the responses to these challenges, governments and the UN must actively seek their support, consultation and guidance. It was noted when academia, government and civil society maintain a cooperative yet independent relationship with each other, significant progress in reaching positive outcomes for access can be reached with countries like Thailand and India as model examples. In both countries, civil society were instrumental in mobilising public support and input for the issuing of compulsory licences. Their presence and voice during FTA negotiations also give impetus for Thai and Indian negotiators to reach more access-friendly positions in bargaining with high income countries. TRIPS Regional Workshop | 4 \uf0b7 Strengthening legal frameworks, ensuring national legislation explicitly supports and provides for TRIPS flexibilities, \uf0b7 Cooperating with Patent Offices of other countries to obtain up-to-date and accurate relevant patent information, \uf0b7 Ensure a multi- sectorial response between government agencies with different mandates; e.g., public health, trade and commerce, foreign affairs. A point raised by international experts as well as various country delegates, was the need of having clear, easy-to- apply and transparent guidelines for negotiating with patent holders. Also, having clear remuneration or royalty rates for CLs will incentivise the granting of voluntary license by patent holders. Results of Regional Mapping Exercise. ART Coverage: Results from the regional mapping survey conducted in the run-up to the workshop showed a general increase in ART coverage. However, some countries have not updated their estimates of the number of people in need of treatment or are not using a WHO/UNAIDS accepted methodology. This may lead to misrepresentation of actual ART coverage.

ART Funding and Expenditure: While Indonesia, Malaysia , the Philippines and Thailand fund the majority of their ART programmes from domestic sources, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia remain heavily dependent on international (bilateral or Global Fund) funding. India is planning a rapid increase ARV Sources: India (exporter), Thailand and China have achieved majority domestic production with some imported patented ARVs, mostly for 2nd line drugs. Malaysia and Vietnam have some domestic production capacity while Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines have no domestic production and import both generic and patented ARVs. ARV patent Status: In general, patents on the most recommended first-line ARVs either have expired or are about to in most countries. However, patent applications on newer generation first-line ARVs, in particularly, TDF and related formulations, have already been filed or granted in China, India, Philippines and Thailand. Although there were no patents on TDF in Vietnam prior to 2011, it was subsequently included in the Voluntary Licensing Agreement between Gilead Sciences and the Medicine Patent Pool as one of the few countries in the region where generic TDF can be supplies. No TDF-related application was found in Malaysia. Legal environment: Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have either created or amended their IPR to be in line with the WTO TRIPS Agreement. With the exception of Cambodia, national patent laws in the other seven countries also create legal space for the use of TRIPS flexibilities. Cambodia\u2019s IPR Law specifies that no patents will be granted on pharmaceutical products before 2016. Myanmar is currently in the process of developing its IPR Law, including laws on patents. 5 | Summary Report The Challenges of TRIPS+ Provisions. On the second day, delegates discussed the current state of free trade negotiations in the region and their potential effects on access to affordable drugs. International experts identified and explained specific TRIPS+ provisions that states are being pressured to agree to as part of on-going FTA negotiations. The following session had country delegates sharing experiences in dealing with such provisions. TRADE AGREEMENTS AND TRIPS+ PROVISONS While the region have acknowledged the need to utilise TRIPS flexibilities in the ASEAN 2011 Declaration of Commitment to Get to Zero, some countries negotiating bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with high income countries are being asked to increase intellectual property protections beyond the agreed standards under the TRIPS Agreement. These provisions are known as \u2018TRIPS+ provisions\u2019. Dr. Jiraporn Limpananont of University of Chulalongkorn conducted a study on the economic and public health impacts of potential TRIPS+ provisions in Thailand. The study found that should TRIPS+ provisions be enacted, Thailand would experience significant increases of average drug prices leading to a large increase in domestic drug expenditure; moreover, there would be a significant decrease in the market share of locally produced ARVS, leading to a decrease in ARV affordability and accessibility. While other countries in the region should conduct their own impact assessment, there is no reason to believe that TRIPS+ measures would affect other countries differently. While countries in the region are in different stages of negotiations for FTAs with different parties, similar TRIPS+ provisions are being advocated by the USA, the EU and Japan (the main proponents of such agreements). TRIPS+ Provisions comes in many forms, they may: \uf0b7 Increase the number of patents that must be granted across the region by Patent Cooperation Treaties or region wide patents, \uf0b7 Increase the ease of new patents being granted and ever-greening old ones by lowering patentability criteria (standards) or allowing \u2018new uses\u2019 for old patents, \uf0b7 Limit the ways civil society or the general public may challenge the patenting process by prohibition of pre-grant patent opposition, \uf0b7 Extend patent rights beyond the 20 year period agreed under the TRIPS Agreement (\u2018Patent Term Extensions\u2019), \uf0b7 Keep clinical trial data held in exclusive rights of the patent holder, thereby delaying the production of generics and/or requiring unethical repeated drug trials (\u2018Data Exclusivity\u2019) \uf0b7 Link medicine registration in drug and food authorities on the drug\u2019s patent status in patent offices, thereby blocking or delaying marketability of generics.

Unilateral measures - Some high-income countries such as the United States have established watch-lists for countries which they determine as non-compliant with IP protection provisions. These countries are threatened with trade sanctions or withdrawal of trade preferences.

By the TRIPS Agreement definition, \u201ccounterfeit trademark goods (drugs)\" are goods (drugs), including packaging, which are bearing, without authorization, a trademark which is identical to the trademark validly already registered\u201d. While counterfeit trademark and copyright violations are rather easily established through visual inspection by customs and IP enforcement officials on the ground, determining whether goods infringe a product/process patent is far more difficult and requires significant technical and legal expertise and testing that are beyond practicality for most customs and IP enforcement agencies. Seizure of goods in transit - Article 51 of TRIPS requires Members to control imported goods protected by trademarks and copyrights. In 2008, the European Commission argued that Article 51 can be extended to include goods in transit and adopted policies that authorize seizure of generic medicines in transit. This resulted in 17 incidents of detention of medicines at various EU ports in France, UK, Holland and Germany including AZT and Abacavir from India destined to Africa and South America. Instead, countries should develop adequate measures showing zero tolerance for all substandard medicines, regardless of whether they are brand or generic. Enabling South-South Collaboration The morning of the third day focused on ways and opportunities in which countries can collaborate on securing access to generic drugs. 7 | Summary Report The World Health Assembly\u2019s Consultative Expert Working Group (CEWG) reported in April 2012 that the 10/90 gap well and truly exists. The current modality of intellectual property rights and sales do not provide enough incentive for innovators in high- income countries to invest in research in diseases that affect people in developing countries. If the ARV needs of countries in the region are to be met, there is a need to uncouple the cost of research from the price of the product and to develop mechanisms in addition to intellectual property rights to effectively incentivize research investment. As most states present at the meeting were ASEAN member states, the ASEAN Strategic Framework on Health Development was identified as a regional mechanism to facilitate coordination and dialogue on this issue at the senior political and policy level. The following areas where identified as key opportunities for collaboration: Regulatory Cooperation Having a common, region-wide regulatory environment that encourages generic competition would incentivise global generic companies to start producing locally in each country. To do so, countries in the region must: \uf0b7 Fully realize TRIPS flexibilities in national legislation with common definitions and patentability standards. \uf0b7 Have a harmonized negotiating position at WTO TRIPS Council e.g. for least developed countries extension. \uf0b7 Share global best practice in using flexibilities, e.g. Competition policy in South Africa, India\u2019s Section 3(d) or Argentina\u2019s patentability criteria. Research Gap It was highlighted that the Global Research and Development Treaty was one of the potential avenues of collaboration on innovation to reduce the region\u2019s dependence on traditional sources of technological innovation. \uf0b7 It was recommended that all countries should allocate specified levels of public funding (at least 0.01% of GDP) on health R&D relevant to the needs of developing countries including the promotion of domestic capacity. \uf0b7 In this framework, the WHO was recommended to play a stronger central role in improving coordination for R&D directed at health needs of developing countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e491096b-a502-4615-bf05-8efbb1f7ac67": {"__data__": {"id_": "e491096b-a502-4615-bf05-8efbb1f7ac67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-consultation-and-planning-workshop-use-trips-flexibilities-access-affordable-arvs-asia-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Consultation and Planning Workshop on 'Use of TRIPS Flexibilities to Access Affordable ARVs in Asia' - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-consultation-and-planning-workshop-use-trips-flexibilities-access-affordable-arvs-asia-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "592093b40e2a8b546eb2b8aca8408732c87ca8cb1056b8788acb936eb9f32cad"}, "2": {"node_id": "5315f8b8-19a6-435e-aa81-a589e83eb18c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-consultation-and-planning-workshop-use-trips-flexibilities-access-affordable-arvs-asia-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "932e2125a1d9591ec53fe09aaeb9fe367bc6e784badce095d342306565bceecb"}}, "hash": "621156ad6661bc7e618fb64c0387c74c4f76839b3b310ae9f764f0f35c74787e", "text": "\uf0b7 The promotion of technology transfers in developing economies by other economies in the region was also a key recommendation in the report findings.

TRIPS Regional Workshop | 8 The following were highlighted as priority areas for capacity building especially least developed countries Cambodia and Myanmar: Human resource capacity building, in legal knowledge and patent assessment; technical assistance in drug regulatory policy and procedures and basic infrastructure and technology transfers. As the key producer and supplier of generic medication to the region, India\u2019s role in reducing the regional capacity gap cannot be overstated. Generic companies from India are already beginning to expand offshore with manufacturing facilities overseas, providing for vital technology transfers. China, holding 80% of global market share on producing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for ARVs, is a vital player in the region as well. A key underlying message throughout the day was the need for strong cooperation between these two countries. The BRICS health cooperation framework was identified as a possible mechanism through which this can be achieved. Furthermore it was identified current local producers, China, India and Thailand need to be a more positive force to bring about technology transfers and capacity building the rest of the region. While India and China both have partnerships in overseas capacity building, technology transfers or technical assistance, much of it is centred on Africa and South America and not it the Asia Pacific. On the other side, it was noted that other countries should at the same time proactively seek out possible regional partnerships and produce enabling environments to encourage investments from generic companies to set up locally. Country Action Plans The final session of the workshop involved country delegations taking stock of their newly acquired understanding of TRIPS related issues and with assistance from international experts and resource persons, draft a tentative country action plan including support request/needs. The following is a brief summary of key actions proposed from each country: Cambodia Cambodia plans to establish a country coordination-working group that will seek to revise patent laws to dismantle various TRIPS+ measures already in place, including criminalization of patent infringement and weak patentability criteria. Cambodia will also seek to pass a law on compulsory licenses. The training of patent examiners on health related intellectual property is also being planned. Cambodia identified a need for assistance with legal expertise, support for training of patent examiners, developing civil society capacity and to explore technology transfer opportunities. China China plans to strengthen quality control and management of current generic ARVs to meet WHO prequalification standards in preparation for export. This has significant potential in changing the availability of generic ARVs in the future. China also plans to start political advocacy measures, using the BRIC Health Cooperation Framework as an entry point for political advocacy. China is also planning study tours to improve the understanding of various government sectors. In parallel, China also plans to revisit its patent laws to ensure it can fully utilize CLs and other TRIPS flexibilities, using the Doha delectation as the key interpretive guide. 9 | Summary Report China requires technical support in training of officials and hosts for the study tours. They will also look towards the WHO on the requirements on prequalification standards. India As the main global producer of generics, Indian has seen significant pressure from high-income countries to dilute Section 3d of its Patent Act as well as its compulsory licencing provisions. As such, it plans to strengthen capacities of stakeholders including patent officers, examiners, civil society, media etc. It also plans to raise awareness through workshops for judiciary and parliamentarians on the issue and to sensitize them on the continual need to protect access. Furthermore, India plans to increase its capacity building efforts in the region and is calling for expressions of interest by regional states that require assistance for building local production capacity. From the UN family, India is requesting information about global best practices and facilitation of dialogue at international/multi-country fora. Malaysia Current pre-grant opposition provisions place an administrative burden on the IP office with limited technical capacity. Malaysia is exploring possible amendments to its Patent Act to enable an avenue for interested parties to formally submit information to the IP office on patent application. Malaysia is also exploring the possibilities of pursuing generic export opportunities in the future. Malaysia has also identified the need for region wide reference pricing of imported drugs for common reference and would support an inter-governmental mechanism for sharing such information.

The working group will facilitate inputs on Myanmar\u2019s draft IP law to ensure that policy space for utilisation of flexibilities is protected. Myanmar will also actively seek regional cooperation and collaboration in technology transfer and local production, including through the ASEAN framework. While needs that are more specific will be identified by the core-working group, capacity building, technical and financial assistance were identified as potential areas that support was needed. The Philippines Currently there are wide varieties of challenges that hinder implementation of CLs to the fullest in the Cheaper Medicines Act. The Philippines plans to start with gathering experiences on using TRIPS flexibilities to maximum effect. Currently, The Philippines have no TRIPS+ provisions, but will carefully monitor the implementation of the existing Partnership & Cooperation Agreement with the EU for any impacts on access to medicines. Thailand Protecting the Thai Patent Act against any dilution of its TRIPS flexibilities is a priority for Thailand. It also is looking to amend its IP law to further support the use of TRIPS Flexibilities. Thailand is also planning to streamline patent information by developing a pharmaceutical database and a manual for registration. TRIPS Regional Workshop | 10 The Thailand delegation has identified the need for all levels of government and civil society to be sensitized and unified under a single country strategy and requests UN support for this. Thailand also requests the UN or WHO to advocate to high income countries not to push for TRIPS-Plus provisions during free trade agreement negotiations. Viet Nam Training of patents examiners, industry awareness raising and social mobilization, stake holder consultation as well as inter-ministerial coordination are key priorities for Viet Nam in protecting and enhancing their TRIPs Flexibilities. As such Vietnam requests assistance in technical expertise to organize workshops training and facilitate south-south dialogue. Key Themes and Messages Legislative strengthening at the country level. In order to maximize the utilities of flexibilities under TRIPS, countries must take measures to ensure these TRIPS-Flexibilities are enshrined in national legislation. Specifically provisions for high patentability criteria, compulsory licenses should explicitly be stated in national laws. Least developed countries, should take full advantage of the exemption period and ensure inclusion of \u2018sunrise clauses\u2019 in their patent laws so that provisions take effect only after the exemption period expires, with room for possible extensions. At the same time, countries in the region should look to revising legislative and procedural elements containing TRIPS+ provisions that may harm access. For example, provisions such as criminalization of patent infringements can prove to be a significant deterrent for generic companies to invest in local markets, while in least developed countries, implementing a mailbox system where patent applications are accepted and filed before the 2016 exemption period expires can mean large amounts of patents to be in force retroactively. Stronger and more coordinated national response, with PLHIV and MARPS civil society voices. Navigating the implications of TRIPS to ensure optimum access to medicines is a complex and intricate process that requires input and participation from various parts of government, academia, business and civil society. It is crucial for all countries in the region to establish a multisectoral task-force to work on the issue. Such task force should include relevant ministries and government departments and ministries. (National AIDS Authorities, Health, Commerce, Foreign Affairs, Patent Office, etc.) Learning from the successes from India and Thailand, civil society organisations must take on a proactive leadership role in shaping the public agenda and debate around the issue, locally and regionally. Furthermore, governments must include the voice of civil society in national and regional dialogues on issues that affect to the medicines that they themselves receive. 11 | Summary Report PLHIV networks and their partners must continue joint action to advocate for continued access on all levels. The need for stronger south-south collaboration at the regional level. Countries in the region need to strengthen regional collaboration and partnerships to meet current and future challenges to low cost access and to the make full use of TRIP-flexibilities. Cooperation in regional diplomacy leading to a common negotiating position around intellectual property and trade negotiations with high income countries is a vital step. States need to make sure ASEAN mechanisms for dialogue and coordination are being utilized effectively. Having a common, region-wide regulatory environment that encourages generic competition would reduce barriers of entry for global generic companies to increase exports or start producing locally. Providing technical legal assistance, human resource capacity building, basic infrastructure and technology transfers are all areas that countries in the region can cooperate on.

MEETING RECORDS MEETING RECORDS 8 Regional Consultation on Improving Access to Prevention, Care and Treatment of HIV among Men who Have Sex with Men and Transgender People Midnight Poonkasetwattana, Executive Director of the Asia-Paci\ufffdc Coalition for Male Sexual Health (APCOM) noted that HIV has a\ufffdected MSM and transgender people in much greater proportions than the general population. New or just recognized epidemics amongst MSM and transgender people are identi\ufffded in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and South America, with high and rapidly rising rates of HIV transmission reported in Asia and the Paci\ufffdc. A coalition of MSM and transgender community organizations has been working on addressing HIV issues and ICAAP 11 in November 2013 is a good chance to showcase this work and to discuss what needs to be done next. APCOM will ensure MSM and transgender voices are heard at ICAAP through a pre-conference on 17 November that they will host to better prepare delegates for the main conference. Dr. Yonas Tegegn, WHO representative to Thailand noted that projections of the Asian epidemic indicate that close to 50 percent of all new HIV infections occurring annually in Asia will be identi\ufffded among MSM by 2020 unless intensi\ufffded HIV prevention measures are scaled-up; an increase from 13 percent in 2008. Sex between men accounts for approximately a third of known HIV transmissions in Asia and the Paci\ufffdc, although this is likely to be underreported. Amongst MSM in Asia, the odds of being infected with HIV are 18.7 times higher than that of the general population. According to Gautam Yadav, YVC board member and member of the UNAIDS Youth Advisory Forum, many of these infections are occurring and will continue to occur among young men, hijras\u00b9\ufffd, and young transgender people, with most clustering in urban areas of the region. Recent HIV prevalence rates among MSM are reported in South and South-East Asia at 14.7 percent; East Asia at 5.2 percent; Oceania at 4.4 percent; however, in speci\ufffdc urban areas these rates are much higher, e.g., in Bangkok at 30.8 percent. HIV incidence rates among MSM in Thailand and China also reveal rapidly rising rates of HIV infection. Experts now recognize that in order to halt the ongoing transmission of HIV in MSM and transgender people, the blocking of access to health care and prevention services, and the failure to fully recognize other basic individual rights, must stop.

Yet stigma in health care settings, including homophobia, sexism and transphobic policies and practices, prevent open and welcoming access for MSM and transgender people. The cause is often the negative attitudes of clinicians and support sta\ufffd together with incomplete or inaccurate knowledge about sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2011, WHO issued guidelines identifying that signi\ufffdcant barriers to the uptake of services included insensitive communication and counselling with MSM and transgender clients and insu\ufffdcient skills related to male sexual health (particularly lack of knowledge about pharyngeal and ano-rectal conditions). WHO and UNDP, in partnership with USAID, UNAIDS and the Asia Paci\ufffdc Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM), have been working together to better understand the legal and human rights aspects and other social determinants of the HIV epidemic, identify priority health sector interventions and propose approaches to address stigma and discrimination issues.

With enhanced legal and policy environments, this can be brought down to approximately 1.2 million new infections. Ashok Row Kavi of the Humsafar Trust in India made a presentation (see Figure 1) on how target population size estimations have been conducted in Mumbai and what lessons have been learned. MEETING REPORT | 11 Humsafar Trust saw the need to demonstrate that MSM were an at-risk population for HIV just like FSWs and IDUs. Given the social invisibility of this population, the government was deeply reluctant to identify even a small percentage of male population as MSM as that would have budgetary implications \ufffd they would have to set aside more funds to address HIV in MSM and were unwilling and/or unable to do so. After a long process of lobbying and hard work, only 235,000 MSM engaging in the most high risk sexual behaviour were \ufffdnally accepted as MSM by the government and provided with HIV prevention and treatment support through a Humsafar pilot project. The HIV infection rates among MSM in Mumbai are exponentially higher than the general population, so e\ufffdorts need to be scaled up substantially. India is one of the few countries in the region with an actual number of MSM identi\ufffded; notwithstanding all the \ufffdaws in the identi\ufffdcation process. It has provided speci\ufffdc HIV interventions with funding in the national budget for this population. It would be useful for other countries in the region to replicate this. SESSION 3 GUIDANCE FROM GLOBAL AND REGIONAL GUIDELINES WHO presented the \"Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV and STIs among MSM and TG People.\" This is a clinical and programmatic guidance developed because of the high vulnerability of MSM and transgender people to HIV; MSM are at 19 times higher risk for HIV than the general population and transgender people are at about 49 times higher risk. This is true in both concentrated and generalized epidemics. Stigma, discrimination and violence impede access to health services for these communities, particularly in the 75 countries that criminalize consensual same sex behaviour between adults. The WHO guidelines include recommendations on technical issues and good practices as well as prevention of sexual transmission. In instances where there is insu\ufffdcient evidence, such as male circumcision, the WHO recommends that countries should adopt the guidelines to enable inclusive service provision, to provide evidence based, community-accepted recommendations and to protect human rights and create inclusive environments. For anti-retroviral therapy, it is recommended that initiation occur earlier at CD4 count less than or equal to 500 for all PLHIV, irrespective of CD4 count for all serodiscordant couples, all pregnant women, all HIV- HBV co-infection with chronic active hepatitis and all HIV TB co-infected. Regarding PrEP, WHO has conditional recommendations. UNDP APRC gave a detailed overview of \ufffdThe Time Has Come\ufffd training manual, which is designed to train health care providers to be sensitive to the needs of MSM and transgender patients and to reduce stigma in health settings. Over 200 health care providers were engaged in pilot trainings to improve the manual and assure its relevancy to the region. Primary bene\ufffdciaries of the training package will be national and provincial o\ufffdcials overseeing HIV programmes for MSM and transgender people and central health bureaucrats making HIV policy. Next steps for the training package are to implement it in South Asia and Insular Southeast Asia through national trainings.

Doctors and health workers in Bhutan reported little to no levels of interaction with MSM and transgender people; the assumption among them is that homosexuality is a Western thing that is non-existent in traditional societies. Disclosure of non-heterosexual status is often not an option due to the risk of discrimination, ostracism, and even physical harm, in Timor-Leste. The WHO-UNDP health care training package has already been integrated into the national health care plan of Indonesia. The training has been given to health care and non-health care stakeholders such as police and local authorities involved in taking legal and penal action against MSM and transgender people. This has been achieved despite the fact that Indonesia is a generally conservative Muslim majority country although it does have a secular government. SESSION 4 SUPPORTIVE NATIONAL STRATEGIES AND URBAN RESPONSES A panel discussed national strategies and health landscapes of the HIV epidemic among MSM and transgender people in selected Asia-Paci\ufffdc countries. In Indonesia, HIV prevalence amongst MSM went from 5.3 percent to 8.4 percent between 2007 and 2011. The national response has been signi\ufffdcantly scaled up in response but issues such as condoms generally being available but not appropriate lubricants continue to be common and impede a more e\ufffdective response. In India, the government has claimed a reduction of HIV infected MSM from 12 percent to 4 percent but this is likely to be inaccurate based on community-reported new HIV testing results. The current national strategy seeks to reconcile community-based e\ufffdorts with government e\ufffdorts, something that has not proven successful in the past. The \ufffdrst situation analysis of HIV among MSM and transgender people was done in 2006 in the Maldives and the \ufffdrst IBBS with MSM as a key population in 2008. In the last national strategic plan, MSM were identi\ufffded as a key population but the HIV response among them is di\ufffdcult as there are no CBO working with MSM and transgender people. Key populations surveillance in Myanmar among MSM and transgender people, identi\ufffded HIV prevalence at a shocking 22.3 percent. Stigma and discrimination, religion, and tradition are major obstacles to providing better public health care services for these communities. Panelists and participants pointed out that the GFATM did include Community Systems Strengthening/human rights strategy with Round 9 funding and urged thinking about how to build on the gains made. For instance, it might be best to integrate services for young MSM into government and community adolescent programmes. The WHO guidance has so far lumped adolescents and adults together but increasingly new guidance is being developed speci\ufffdc to adolescents and youth. Meeting Records MEETING REPORT | 13 The second panel in this session dealt with \"Innovative implementation in urban responses.\" The HIV Foundation of Thailand noted that encouraging sustainable urban exchanges is important by assisting cities in \ufffdnding funding. Often, self-help groups are the only ones providing HIV services to positive MSM and transgender people, who are often treated poorly or discriminated against in public health facilities. A common challenge in providing HIV services to MSM and transgender people across countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are that stigma and discrimination are normal, limited VCT is available, providing services to hidden populations is di\ufffdcult, and widespread homophobia complicates the task of reaching those who need services. Media coverage of MSM and transgender people is overwhelmingly negative because of state- sponsored discrimination including legal prohibition of same sex behaviour, regardless of gender. Some countries recognize MSM and transgender people as a key population in the national HIV strategy, such as Nepal where the legal environment since a Supreme Court verdict in favour of LGBT people in December 2007 that recognized the rights of those community members. SESSION 5 HIV SITUATION IN THE PHILIPPINES The HIV epidemic in the Philippines is concentrated in cities such as Manila, Cebu and Davao. MSM and transgender people have been included in the 2011-2016 national strategic plan on HIV and the government has been directly involved in the response in these populations since 2008. Despite 30 years of the epidemic, the level of awareness about HIV is low. Stigma and discrimination is widespread and a\ufffdects the ability to provide services.

SESSION 6 ISSUES AND ACCESS FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AND HIJRAS The WHO noted that global guidelines on HIV for sexual minority communities focus very much on MSM. Grouping MSM and transgender people into one category is no longer su\ufffdcient for e\ufffdective response to the current HIV epidemic. The WHO Civil Society Reference Group on HIV has persuaded the WHO Secretariat to conduct a scoping exercise to document the current state of HIV risk factors and prevalence, including examining the literature on health services and needs, transphobia, and drug use. They will also look at existing guidelines on ART, potential interactions with things such as hormones, PreP, and current guidelines related to sex work and MSM. A \ufffdnal decision on whether to issue global guidelines about transgender people is pending. 14 Regional Consultation on Improving Access to Prevention, Care and Treatment of HIV among Men who Have Sex with Men and Transgender People After this, a presentation was made on the joint technical brief prepared by WHO, UNAIDS, UNDP, and APTN. Transgender HIV infection rates in the region, where known. are often much higher than that for MSM, such as in Indonesia (41 percent). Having disaggregated data on transgender people\ufffds risk factors and HIV trends would be useful for designing better responses. STIs also need to be addressed as they often get ignored and the focus is usually only on HIV. Transgender people are a\ufffdected by the poor reach of prevention programmes and low condom usage, which varies from 24.5 percent to 85.7 percent in the region. Hormones and breast implant studies among transgender people are mostly focused on medical processes and less on health e\ufffdects. Hormone use usually uses contraceptive pills and injections of over the counter drugs with no proper medical support or counselling. Information on hormones is generally obtained from the Internet. Usage starts in transgender people as young as 11 years old, but most start in their early 20s. While hormones can have positive psychological e\ufffdects such as feeling good with the physical changes underway, they can also have negative e\ufffdects such as decreased libido, mood changes, hot \ufffdushes, depression, dizziness or migraine headaches. The long-term side e\ufffdects are unclear and could likely include increased cancer risk. Access to transgender speci\ufffdc health care is very limited and usually delivered by unfriendly service providers. Because of these risks, comprehensive guidance on health care standards for transgender people is needed, especially on hormones usage and surgical procedures intended to modify the body including but not limited to complete gender reassignment. The challenges faced by transgender people across the region have many similarities. Sexual relationships are often stigmatized and even criminalized by same sex behaviour restrictions when their gender change is not allowed, laws against cross-dressing and by religious practices, such as sharia law in Iran and Malaysia. Transgender people often avoid health care settings because they are often forced to use incorrect hospital wards or clinics, due to lack of understanding of gender issues. A large number of transgender people must resort to sex work in order to make a living. However, equating transgender status to sex work is neither appropriate nor accurate. The International Classi\ufffdcation of Diseases 10 (ICD-10) is under revision and the classi\ufffdcation of transgender status as a mental condition is being reviewed. It was noted that transgender status is a medical issue, however, and should be treated as such. Strategic information on transgender people is sorely lacking. There is a need to empower regional networks to increase national capacity of transgender community organizations and, with support from UNAIDS, a process of recruiting a coordinator for the Asia Paci\ufffdc Transgender Network is underway. SESSION 7 2013 WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HIV GUIDELINES The WHO presented on the evolution of their ART guidelines and how they are moving towards viral load measurement as diagnostics become more available and accessible. The Guidelines are unique as it is the \ufffdrst WHO guidance on when, what and how \ufffdto do it\ufffd.

This also results in huge cost savings over time from reducing the number of people needing treatment. There is scepticism over TasP because of concerns about accessibility, e\ufffdectiveness, and toxicity of the drugs, and on whether the model is scalable. There are also concerns over coercion. To implement TasP e\ufffdectively, we need high rates of testing, strong linkages to care, early ART initiation, adherence and retention. Leaky cascades are a major barrier to the success and e\ufffdectiveness of TasP and include di\ufffdculty in \ufffdnding HIV positive MSM and transgender people, getting them into treatment and assuring adherence to optimal regimens. The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has made treatment available to all HIV infected individuals belonging to key populations regardless of CD4 count and has accepted the merits of TasP for key populations. Nevertheless, there remain challenges as few who need testing are actually coming forth. Many of the a\ufffdected are poor and the cost and logistics are obstacles, such as taking time from work or family obligations and travelling great distances for testing and/or for care. What is needed for KP is convenience \ufffd timings suitable to the community, minimize waiting times and same day results and package of interventions that will reduce the number of visits. At the CHAI MSM clinic in Bali, Indonesia, within an hour of an HIV test being done, a CD4 exam, STI exams, and physical exam are conducted and necessary referrals made. It may be better if public health centres were able to serve MSM and transgender populations instead of just having speci\ufffdc facilities for these people. Community responses by themselves will not su\ufffdce. TasP is potentially problematic but more studies may help. A delegate from Nepal stated that his country is an ideal place to undertake TasP as it will address the gaps in provision for testing facilities for MSM, who are mainly served by NGO and CBOs. The national AIDS control authority needs to improve coordination, work more closely with NGO by providing training, and assure better diagnostics. As of May 2013, 12,400 PLHIV on ART and 50 percent of PLHIV in the country needed ART. With the new 2013 WHO guidelines, the number of PLHIV in need of ART increases more than 31 percent (to 18,000). It was noted that learning across subregions would be useful, particularly in places with similar issues such as Islamic societies. On TasP, WHO said it empathizes with concerns such as those of the Indian government about how adopting TasP now may undermine achievements on treatment provisions for 2015 goals as achievements already made could look less signi\ufffdcant if additional goals were set. Concern was also expressed that adopting TasP might shift attention to those capable to manage the cost and logistics of getting treatment away from the poor and vulnerable. WHO does not recommend raising the threshold and adopting TasP unless bene\ufffdts are clearly demonstrated, such as in serodiscordant couples. WHO reiterated that TasP is not their recommendation yet although some countries are implementing it and they do not discourage it. It was noted that a lot of countries are revising strategic plans to include TasP, especially with regards to key populations. \u00b9\u00b2 For a description of community viral load, see this entry from the Lancet (2013): http://www.thelancet.com/ journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(12)70314-6/abstract; This concept is also explained in Slide 4 of a presentation made by Aaron Schubert, Regional Team Lead on HIV and TB, USAID RDMA. 16 Regional Consultation on Improving Access to Prevention, Care and Treatment of HIV among Men who Have Sex with Men and Transgender People \u00b9\u00b3 This is explained in Slide 9 of the presentation by Aaron Schubert, Regional Team Lead on HIV and TB, USAID RDMA.

SESSION 9 WORKING GROUP DISCUSSIONS FROM WORLD CAF\u00c9S Participants in the World Caf\u00e9 activity discussed various health services and prevention barriers. They highlighted that stigma around sexual practices among men and around HIV are often a huge barrier to accessing services. Cultural and occupational fears frequently interrupt the delivery of services with institutionalized religion posing a major barrier to promotion of HIV services. For below age of consent patients, we need to \ufffdnd a solution through legal measures or other alternative arrangements. Others discussed strategic information and programming and challenges and concerns such as stigma and discrimination that can a\ufffdect HIV programme design and management. And some discussed enabling environments including policies, laws, human rights, social justice frameworks and engaging faith leaders. Regarding the modalities of prevention coverage, peer education and outreach were recognized as best practices and therefore need to be expanded and given more resources including ICT tools such as mobile and web-based applications. Legal barriers need to be addressed. If the environment is hostile, adopting measures such as building coalitions and enlisting allies including international organizations may be necessary. SESSION 10 PROGRAMMING FOR RESULTS (M&E) WHO presented on the technical guidance for countries to set targets for HIV prevention, treatment and care in key populations at country level. This includes normative guidance for MSM (2011) to set targets and measure progress. Meeting Records MEETING REPORT | 17 The MSM package includes strategies to strengthen enabling environments and improve health sector programmes. It will provide harmonized guidance on setting targets, references to further reading, and guidance on monitoring the enabling environments. Enabling environments include supportive legislative, policy environments and community empowerment. Overall, the guidance is a simple framework for communities to plan and programme the HIV response in a manner that is evidence- based. An expert from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill presented on the MEASURE Evaluation\u00b9\ufffd which provides operational guidelines at the national, sub-national, and service delivery levels for M&E of HIV programmes for sex workers, MSM and transgender people. The condoms cascade, which includes regular use, use of appropriate lubricants, and availability/a\ufffdordability were discussed along with country experiences such as that of the Philippines where they have undertaken size estimates and key informant interviews of providers and customer satisfaction surveys. Critical enablers for good programming include media campaigns to reduce stigma and discrimination and programming that addresses the HIV challenges among MSM and transgender populations. UNDP discussed how using MEASURE and the UNDP-WHO training toolkit will help with the implementation of Global Fund grants in the Asia-Paci\ufffdc region. The toolkit will allow for e\ufffdective monitoring of grant implementation to help illustrate success of intended results. SESSION 11 INNOVATIVE AND SUSTAINABLE FINANCING UNAIDS presented on \"Investment on AIDS: The Logic.\" The 2011 UN Political Declaration set concrete targets for 2015 such as reducing sexual transmission of HIV by one-half. Another goal is to include closing the global resource gap by 2015 (amounting to $24 billion). Low and middle-income countries are on track to reach 15 million people on ART by 2015; 54 percent of eligible PLHIV in these countries, including 44 percent in Asia, are currently on ART. However, prevention e\ufffdorts are not going as well.

It takes 54,000 tests to detect one case of HIV \u00b9\ufffd Operational Guidelines for Monitoring and Evaluation of HIV Programmes for Sex Workers, Men who have Sex with Men, and Transgender People (USAID 2012). 18 Regional Consultation on Improving Access to Prevention, Care and Treatment of HIV among Men who Have Sex with Men and Transgender People infection in the general population; however, in key a\ufffdected populations, it takes only 2,800 tests to \ufffdnd one HIV case. Treating people independent of CD4 counts will save 11,000 lives in Thailand in the next decade, compared to 6,000 lives saved for treating only those with CD4 levels below 350. Questions arise whether countries can pay for this. The workload for health care providers would increase dramatically from about 2,500 patients on ART per year to 25,000 in the \ufffdrst year. TasP would lead to lower future investments although it will be costly in the short term. Behaviour change interventions need to be combined with TasP to control and end the HIV epidemic. Alternative service delivery models are also needed. It is clear that more money is needed urgently, especially to respond to the urgent need for transgender interventions. HIV prevalence might actually be increasing, as evidenced by the fact that there is no major Indian metropolitan area with an infection rate under 10 percent among MSM and transgender populations, despite the fact that interventions have been focused in urban areas. Myanmar\ufffds HIV rate among MSM and transgender people has been reduced. The Philippines faces a signi\ufffdcant gap in funding for its HIV response. Faith-based groups can contribute to the response despite their stated hostility to non-heteronormative sexual behaviour and communities a\ufffdected are working with Caritas Philippines. As an example, a text message programme has been implemented which helps respondents examine self risk and get directions to the nearest test centre. This scheme has been piloted in Manila. The U.S. Government has been the largest funder of HIV responses in the world to date. USAID said that any national strategy or pilot programme has to be informed by national experiences and have national ownership. SESSION 12 CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS This regional consultation was held keeping in mind the commitment of senior United Nations leaders to address historical grievances against LGBT people, especially with regards to access to health services on HIV. Participants discussed how homophobia and transphobia in health care settings impedes access to critical care and the negative attitudes of health workers can cost lives. The goal of universal health care is not achievable unless MSM and transgender people are included. The WHO and UNDP outlined the measures taken to ensure that MSM and transgender people are not denied care and can access timely and well designed medical care, treatment, and prevention services. WHO presented on the MSM Global Guidelines 2012 and the work they are doing for a possible guidelines for transgender women. The consultation successfully helped participants understand HIV and STIs in the context of the Asia- Paci\ufffdc region, to share country experiences, and identify opportunities for implementation at the country level of global and regional guidelines and of the training package developed by UNDP with WHO as part of the ISEAN-HIVOS grant. Finally, participants discussed the USAID MEASURE guidelines and how it can be used appropriately.

[v] EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The countries of South and South East Asia collectively constitute the world\u2019s major labour-sending region. On 13-14 July 2010 in Bangkok, representatives of 13 countries in this region, , met for the first time to discuss the health challenges facing the region\u2019s 55 million migrant workers. The Regional Dialogue on the Health Challenges for Asian Labour Migrants was organized by UNDP, in cooperation with IOM and UNAIDS, and supported by WHO, ILO and the Joint UN Initiative on Mobility & HIV/AIDS in South East Asia (JUNIMA). The event was held in preparation for the upcoming Colombo Process Ministerial Consultations (October 2010, Dhaka), where migrants\u2019 health issues are expected to be discussed for the first time. The major outcome of this Dialogue was the adoption of Joint Recommendation on key actions to improve the health and well-being of labour migrants. These were discussed and adopted during the two day event by representatives from the ministries of health and labour/overseas employment, as well as foreign affairs. Key recommendations included a call for greater coordination and policy coherence among relevant existing national policies, laws and practices related to labour migration and health; strengthened bilateral agreements between countries of origin and destination; and stronger advocacy efforts towards the ratification of relevant international instruments. Broadly speaking, the Regional Dialogue succeeded both in identifying the key challenges relating to the health issues confronted by South and South East Asian countries, and also looking at clear measures to address these issues. A major accomplishment of the meeting was the arrival at a broad based consensus to mainstream migration health issues in broader migration and health policy and related programmatic interventions. The presence of representatives from the ministries of health, migration/labour and foreign affairs was critical in ensuring not only better policy coherence, but also sustainability of migration and health related policy and planning at the national level. Participants found the sharing of good practices and experiences from across the region especially useful in providing practical ideas on developing sound migration health programmes. The presence of non-governmental and civil society organizations working in the field of migration and health also enriched the discussions by bringing the perspective of practitioners to the table. Participants and the organizing agencies felt strongly that the momentum generated at the meeting to synergize efforts and collaborate on migrants\u2019 health issues needs to be sustained and further promoted at future related meetings, including but not limited to the upcoming Ministerial Consultations of the Colombo Process (October 2010), ASEAN and SAARC forum.

In Asia Pacific, we are very aware of the economic benefits of labour migration and to some extent of the difficult and unsupportive working conditions and violations of rights faced by migrant workers. These are issues which have been discussed in previous meetings of the Colombo Process. However there is much to learn about the procedures, policies and practices that create social and economic environments that are detrimental to the health and welfare of migrant workers. As we know, the Colombo Process is a forum where Government officials from Asian and Middle Eastern countries address issues affecting migrant workers. We are meeting today to prepare for the next Colombo Process meeting in October 2010 where the health of labour migrants will be on the agenda for the first time. Preparation for the October meeting has provided the impetus for this dialogue about the health challenges facing labour migrants, and includes other countries sending migrants in the Region. The health of migrants is determined in part by the policies, practices and procedures that surround and are integral to migration. These policies vary widely across countries. We will exchange information about practices that demonstrate that where countries have a strong tradition of public health care, access to vital health services is open to all, including undocumented and legal migrants. In other countries, access to health care is restricted and health insurance requirements, especially costs, often make it impossible for migrants, either regular or irregular, to access to these services. Migration has historically led to some receiving states screening newcomers for disease in the interests of protecting the citizens of host countries from health risks. Tuberculosis has traditionally been the disease that has been screened across the world. However, in Asia, some countries have a policy of HIV screening, sometimes without the knowledge of the migrant, which is a violation of INAUGURAL SESSION [2] their rights as well as being contrary to effective HIV prevention programmes. HIV diagnosis leads to denial of work and in cases to summary deportation for migrants who test positive in host countries. JUNIMA is strongly advocating for a change in policy and practice in these kinds of health-related practices related to HIV. We hope that as you engage in the broad dialogue on health including the many types of work performed by labour migrants that you consider the impact of the working environment, housing conditions and the absence of family plays in the development of health and psycho-social challenges faced by male and female migrant workers and the nexus between isolation, loneliness and vulnerability and risk of HIV infection. We encourage you to consider the contexts in which access to health services are provided, such as specialized services ex obstetrics for women labour migrants, and keep in mind issues of language and cultural that can become barriers to accessing health care if not taken into account. These factors also apply to the provision of HIV prevention information so that labour migrants are protected from engaging in risky behaviours. And as you deliberate on changes in policy and practices, we strongly support your advocacy for the shift from the policies of mandatory HIV testing of migrant workers, towards the provision of pre and post test counselling, and against the deportation of positive migrants without universal access to prevention, support care and treatment. UNAIDS and the JUNIMA wish you a productive meeting and successful outcomes in the preparatory build up to the Colombo Process. MS RABAB FATIMA, REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR SOUTH ASIA, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION Distinguished Guests, Excellencies, Dear Colleagues and Friends. A very good morning to you all. On behalf of the co-organizers, it is my pleasure to welcome you to this two day Regional Dialogue on Health Challenges for Asian Labour Migrants. IOM is indeed very pleased to organize this event in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Allow me to begin by extending a very warm welcome to the distinguished participants from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. We are grateful to you for joining us for this timely meeting to discuss an issue which is of increasing concern and importance to this region. International mobility has become an increasingly important feature of the Asian landscape over the past three decades and without doubt, it will remain so in the years to come.

INAUGURAL SESSION [3] It is estimated that around 2.5 million Asian labour migrants leave their countries for work abroad, and the stock of emigrants from Asia is approximately 41.4 million or 1.2 per cent of the total population of the region [Migration and Remittances Fact Book 2008, WB]. And importantly this region also represents both immigration and emigration countries, with significant intra-regional mobility as well. The leading labour sending countries and those topping the global remittance league table are represented in this room today. India and China respectively, are the 3rd and 4th top emigration countries in the world; while Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam are all in the list of the top 20. Commensurate to that is the trend in the remittance inflow to this region \u2013 according to World Bank figures, in 2008 remittance flow to South and Southeast Asia went over 77.8 billion USD [and this would be 103.5 billion USD if China is included]. India and China top the list of highest remittance receiving countries, while Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia and Vietnam hold positions in the list of top 20. Apart from enhancing monetary capital both at the macro and micro levels through remittances, migration also offers benefits that include reduction in unemployment, skills transfer and knowledge economies to the countries of the region. However, in spite of all the contributions made by labour migrants, migrants\u2019 health needs are very often overlooked and marginalized in the global migration discourse. A large majority of migrant workers face challenges in accessing health facilities and services \u2013 and this is particularly true for the temporary contractual workers, who are often excluded from all forms of support and facilities. Labour migrants, due to their nature of work are often more vulnerable to a wide range of health concerns. This is particularly the case for the large majority of Asian labour migrants who are usually involved in less skilled, labour intensive, temporary or seasonal work which often pose significant occupational hazards. These jobs are often in the informal or unregulated sectors of the economy, and as a result these workers have limited access to health services or other protection measures. Besides their physical vulnerabilities, social isolation and long period of separation from family, compounded by difficult working and living conditions also tend to have immense effects on their mental health. Migration itself is not a risk factor for communicable diseases, [including HIV and STI,] but many studies indicate that the factors associated with migration increases the vulnerability of the migrants to such health risks. A large majority of the labour migrants going from this region are poorly educated and are concentrated in unskilled and less skilled sectors which are characterized by high occupational risks. Because of their lack of awareness and poor perception of health risks they often engage in high risk behaviour and practices that increases their vulnerability to certain communicable diseases. But due to cultural and linguistic barriers and their overall socio-economic status, they often do not have access to, nor can afford health services. Health insurance for labour migrants is yet to become the norm; it is still limited to certain sectors and only a handful of labour sending or destination countries have made health insurance mandatory for migrant workers or mainstreamed this in their policies and health systems. It goes without saying that the relationship between international migration and health is a complex one and requires greater understanding and commitment from all of us. A number of countries in the region have adopted certain policies and measures which could serve as a good model and INAUGURAL SESSION [4] example for the others. We would be hearing about some of the existing programmes on migration health from the different countries in the upcoming sessions; and would also engage in group work to exchange ideas, experiences and good practices that we hope, will produce a set of realistic and achievable recommendations. As a cross-cutting issue, migration health should be incorporated in a wide spectrum of activities undertaken by a wide range of stakeholders. And we are indeed very pleased to have been able to bring together not only government representatives from the key ministries involved in labour migration and health issues at the national level, but also representatives of civil society organizations who have a critical role to play in this regard. We hope that this meeting would build a continuous process of dialogue, collaboration and partnership amongst all key stakeholders on the health challenges of Asian labour migrants, and lead to the development", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bde21355-8c11-4e3b-9dd2-9293f1841a0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bde21355-8c11-4e3b-9dd2-9293f1841a0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-dialogue-health-challenges-asian-labour-migrants-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Dialogue on the Health Challenges for Asian Labour Migrants - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-dialogue-health-challenges-asian-labour-migrants-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6dea8ce72248f3f233dd7f9a792ca72cc0264b3f3c782db5140f640618f0d14f"}}, "hash": "6dea8ce72248f3f233dd7f9a792ca72cc0264b3f3c782db5140f640618f0d14f", "text": "of easily accessible and migrant-sensitive health care that would reduce the impact on public health systems in source and destination countries. In the ultimate analysis this would benefit the host communities, the migrants and their families alike.

This dialogue is timely on another count \u2013 it is taking place 3 months before the 4th Ministerial Consultations of the Colombo Process [all members of that regional consultative process are present in this room] \u2013 and the theme of this year\u2019s gathering of the Colombo Process countries is: Migration in dignity\u201d. As you will all agree that the health of migrants is central to ensuring their overall wellbeing and dignity; and the recommendations that are expected to come out from this meeting, we hope can be taken forward to the Colombo Process Ministerial Meeting in October in Dhaka when the full course of the migration process is taken up. [We are indeed pleased that the Secretary, Ministry of Expatriates\u2019 Welfare and Overseas Employment of Bangladesh, the nodal ministry for the Colombo Process is present here, which we see as the reiteration of the strong commitment of the Chair of the Colombo Process to this important issue.] We see in your presence here, a strong reiteration of your commitment to ensure safe and orderly migration for the benefit of all. We are hopeful of emerging from this dialogue with clearer understanding and directions to address the health challenges of labour migrants, and a clear resolve to work together to address them; and to initiate collaborative and coordinated efforts to ensure health care services for labour migrants through effective migrants\u2019 health policies and necessary interventions and programmes. I thank you all once again for being with us today and for supporting our efforts to make migration humane and orderly for the benefit of all; and to mainstream migrants\u2019 health in the larger discourse on labour migration. INAUGURAL SESSION [5] DR CHANVIT THARATHEP, MD. FRCST. FAM MED. PREV MED, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH ADMINISTRATION BUREAU, MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HEALTH, THAILAND It\u2019s with great pleasure that I welcome you all on behalf of the Royal Thai Government to our Kingdom, and to this Regional Dialogue on the Health Challenges for Asian Labour Migrants. Labour migration is a phenomenon that affects our Asian region in many ways. Both countries of origin and destination benefit from economic gains generated by labour migrants. Labour migrants supply much needed labour to a host country. When they return, they can bring with them knowledge and skills that can benefit their countries of origin. Yet, there is significant gap between the economic contribution of labour migrants and the poor working conditions and social support that they experience throughout the migration cycle. In particular, we are here today to focus on the many health challenges that they face and how as governments, we can address those. Thailand is not only a country of origin for labour migrants, but we are also a major country of destination of this region. We have made many advancements in improving access to health for the migrants coming into Thailand However, there is still much to be done. We know from experience that addressing the health challenges of labour migrants is not something that can be done by one ministry alone, or by one country alone. It requires a combination of efforts, across ministries, across borders and across regions. I would like to express our sincere thanks to the organizers for this Dialogue for bringing us together, to develop partnerships and deepen our understanding of the issues. I look forward to working with and learning from all of you over the next 2 days, to make this meeting a fruitful one. Thank you.
