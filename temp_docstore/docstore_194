Bhutan and Kiribati send a lower share of their exports to Canada, goods with a higher portion of zero MFN duties, so graduation may not change their export preference terms (Table 3.4).11 AP LDCs do not rely heavily on LDC tariff abatement schemes for exports to the United States, because of the high proportion of exports traded at MFN zero-duty rates (Table 3.5) or MFN tariff bases. More than 70 percent exports from Afghanistan, Bhutan and Kiribati ship to the United States under MFN zero-duty rates. The share of such exports is volatile for Afghanistan, due to its low export base and export instability. Its low preference utilization is evident from its ten major export items (Table 3.6). Bhutan can use 100 percent preference for ferro-alloys (HS 720299) and 74 percent for other food preparations (HS 210690), two of its most important export products.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3bda967-476f-4d83-9094-bcdd1bf4aa46": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3bda967-476f-4d83-9094-bcdd1bf4aa46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f9ca5e0a4aa8d89592cced7814ad3c85e77028bd84fe082711c6209595cf1c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3ba6cc6-07d6-4f43-9165-10b7c9b5b053", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ef15a2ae8f37ca988c74e7f75a87ccb100c3d039e0fd3b9106ee803ef94cd4e"}}, "hash": "dbc8d86d1541ed6e9c7bf960e866874b6ce62ebe7c4c45d1c3a674a3a97c2f2e", "text": "Bangladesh has no preferential access to the United States market since 2013, when GSP preference was suspended over concerns about labour standards. Prior to that, the significance of United States GSP was extremely limited for Bangladesh since textiles and apparel are excluded from the scheme. Similarly, because clothing products are not included in the United States GSP for LDCs, Cambodia, too, ends up paying MFN tariff rates for its textile and clothing exports: only one-third of preferences are being materialised for its GSP-eligible exports. Myanmar also pays the MFN duty for clothing items and thus its share of MFN zero-duty- rate exports is only around 20 percent. In addition to LDC scheme, Nepal enjoys preferential access for several items under the United States Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (US- Nepal Trade Preferences Act) (US Government, 2015).

Although the significance of the United States in Solomon Islands\u2019 exports is low, its preference utilization rate is the highest among AP LDCs. Around one-third of Solomon Islands\u2019 exports are shipped into the United States market under the MFN zero-duty rate, and more than 95 percent of its GSP- eligible exports can utilize LDC preferential tariffs. Like other GSP preference-granting countries, Japan offers AP LDCs varying degrees of MFN zero- and low- duty tariffs, and the countries have various preference utilization rates (Table 3.7). Afghanistan has the highest share of MFN zero-duty rate exports to the Japanese market: five of its top ten items fall into the category. Afghanistan also has the lowest preference utilization rate for other GSP-eligible products, perhaps due to an inability to meet rules of origin requirements. Bangladesh and Bhutan have more than 90 percent preference utilization rates in this market, with high rates for major export", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7257af45-b705-40ac-9d70-75b2d9b8735e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7257af45-b705-40ac-9d70-75b2d9b8735e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ccf3e964838cf64f4fbd05b2b6631fd821d5f4dc660c4f5c7bc28783cc77d99"}, "3": {"node_id": "458cfc07-c0af-47ff-822a-2e8fd2184877", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37eb55170fc9a822c2084733f5c3d1a51e64339c95088a319da3203da6eb3b03"}}, "hash": "cebd62ca480009a6d6e6a8f10e31f856506e9de679dc2f04408de0501d210272", "text": "items at the 6-digit level (Table 3.8). In the case of Japan, as with the other preference- granting countries, post-graduation impacts on AP LDC exports will depend on any non-LDC preferential tariffs available to graduating AP LDCs. For example, since Bangladesh exports mostly clothing, and many apparel items are not included under Japan\u2019s GSP for developing countries, graduation will cause significant preference erosion for its Japan-bound exports while the low significance of the Japanese market for Bhutan means preference erosion may not have major consequences for its Japan-bound exports. Slightly more than 10 percent of Cambodia\u2019s and Myanmar\u2019s exports to Japan come under MFN zero- duty rates. The preference utilization rates of these two countries range from 80 percent to 90 percent. As shown in Table 3.8, Cambodia and Myanmar can make the most of preference utilization for major exports at the HS 6-digit level. Graduation may not impose major preference erosion or changes to trade terms because these countries have regional trade agreements (RTAs) in place with Japan. Post-graduation, the same RTA benefits will also apply to Lao PDR, which has much lower preference utilization rates of less than 70 percent, and more than 40 percent of its exports are under MFN zero-duty rates. The Pacific Island States of Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu have very low preference utilization rates for their exports to Japan, from zero to 50 percent (Table 3.7). In most cases, they would end up paying MFN tariffs because of their low share of MFN duty- zero-exports and their inability to comply with rules of origin requirements. Relevant data on preference utilization in the Chinese market are not available.

Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 30 and EIF (2020) provides information on LDC exports to China by duty type. Bhutan, Kiribati, Lao PDR, the Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu are currently ineligible for LDC-specific preferences; therefore, LDC graduation will not affect their tariffs. Cambodia, Myanmar, and Lao PDR enjoy tariff preferences under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-China FTA, which will continue after these countries\u2019 LDC graduation. In 2020, China expanded LDC duty-free coverage for Bangladesh to 97 percent of its tariff lines.12 Nepal and Timor-Leste cannot make use of Chinese LDC preferences due to their inability to satisfy RoO requirements (WTO and EIF, 2020). 3.2 PREFERENTIAL TRADE REGIMES AFTER LDC GRADUATION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PREFERENCE EROSION After graduation, AP LDCs will no longer benefit from LDC-specific trade preferences. The likely impact will depend on destination-country market access provisions for non-LDC developing countries. Several issues need to be taken into consideration prior to graduation. \u2022 Graduation from LDC status will have no implications if the AP LDC export products are not covered by an LDC-specific treatment. \u2022 Similarly, graduation will have no effect if the importing countries do not allow preferential access for LDCs a priori. \u2022 Where graduating countries have made use of LDC- specific preferences, the major impact of graduation will be from changes in tariff preferences and rules of origin requirements. \u2022 In some cases, AP LDCs have other bilateral and regional trade agreements that give them preferential market access. These preferences will continue irrespective of LDC status. \u2022 Importing countries have different LDC-specific preferential schemes, and they provide different preferential market-access conditions for non-LDC developing countries. Since Afghanistan did not qualify for graduation, it will continue to access LDC benefits in all preference-granting countries. The other ten AP LDCs, in different stages of graduation, have met the graduation criteria in at least one UNCDP triennial review. They will face the likely changes in market-access conditions as summarized above. In this context, all major importing nations\u2019 preferential market-access schemes available to non-LDC developing countries are relevant to assessing graduation implications. THE EUROPEAN UNION As discussed earlier, the European Union is a major destination for textile and clothing exports from Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Myanmar. It provides extremely generous market access to all LDCs in the Everything But Arms (EBA) preferential mechanism under its GSP, which also offers two types of trade preferences to various non-LDC developing countries: the Special Incentive Arrangement for Sustainable Development and Good Governance (popularly known as GSP+) and the Standard GSP. The LDC-specific EBA is the most generous scheme providing duty-free access for all items \u2013 except arms and ammunition, followed by the GSP+ and the Standard GSP. The GSP+ scheme provides duty-free access for 66 percent of all tariff line products, including textile and clothing items, imported into the European Union. The Standard GSP provides fewer tariff concessions. While the European Union relaxes rules of origin requirements for LDC EBA beneficiaries, they remain more stringent for GSP+ and Standard GSP countries. The current European Union Standard GSP regime will end in December 2023, and will be replaced by another regime for 2024-2034, which will set out market access conditions for graduating LDCs (Table 3.9). Proposed provisions will continue allowing newly graduated LDCs to access EBA benefits for a three-year transition period.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4574dc35-8295-46b9-850e-7ab053e0d413": {"__data__": {"id_": "4574dc35-8295-46b9-850e-7ab053e0d413", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a44088e81051a148b5c2e16745c8bdca5c438366a60052188374fde89b4b3843"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc094a47-1cf5-45a1-b05c-3f02452ac52c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1bb67126e096ec27eff966c9e5f5a133c79a1f656af5ea02feb9eba5cbe93bf"}}, "hash": "24c8f4eee580e9c0cd7e51a6634e9ab06d3c28ea12309252432424c440181567", "text": "They will also allow newly graduated AP LDCs to qualify for GSP+ trade preferences contingent on two criteria: (1) Vulnerability: The country has a non-diversified economy, defined when the seven largest GSP sections of its imports into the European Union represent more than 75 percent in value of its total GSP-covered imports during the last three-consecutive years (European Commission, 2021).

Graduation also involves stricter rules of origin (RoO) for graduating LDCs if they are to benefit from preferential treatment. The minimum local value-added for exports to the European Union, other than textiles and clothing, will rise from 30 percent to 50 percent. Because AP LDCs generally have limited productive capacity, fulfilling stricter RoO could significantly weaken their preference utilization capacity. Consequently, even with GSP+ or Standard GSP preferences, graduating AP LDCs could end up paying MFN tariffs for a larger portion of their exports. Clothing and textile exports from LDCs have benefited the most from a 2011 European Union RoO simplification: They were reclassified from \u2018double\u2019 to \u2018single\u2018 transformation, reinvigorating the supply response from Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Myanmar.15 Regardless of whether the graduating AP LDCs can access the Standard GSP or GSP+, apparel makers are required to comply with double-transformation. AP LDC textile and clothing exporters are chiefly specialized in apparel cut, make and trim (CMT) activities. While Bangladesh has developed some domestic backward-linkage manufacturing activities, such as yarn and fabric production, the other graduating AP LDCs have not, which may pose problems. Woven garment production is likely to encounter more severe issues, since graduating AP LDC capacity to produce textiles domestically is extremely limited. Therefore, even if graduating AP LDCs qualify for GSP+, they will find it difficult to comply with European Union RoO provisions, which could limit their preference utilization. THE UNITED KINGDOM The United Kingdom, having withdrawn from the European Union in 2020, launched a new GSP in early 2021; it features LDC privileges similar to those of the European Union GSP.16 In early 2023, the United Kingdom\u2019s current GSP will be replaced by the Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS). It appears that the DCTS will be more liberal and generous than schemes offered by the European Union, developed countries like Canada and Japan, and relatively advanced developing countries like China and India. Forty-six LDCs and nearly 18 other economically vulnerable low-income and lower middle-income countries (LMICs) and territories will benefit from the United Kingdom\u2019s new 2023 preference scheme, the DCTS. 15 The double transformation rule would require a garment manufacturer to use locally produced fabrics in garment making to claim European Union duty-free access. Local manufacture of fabric from yarn and transformation from fabric to garment items is known as \u2018double transformation\u2019. For knitwear exports, it means domestically producing yarn and transforming yarn into knitted fabric or items. In 2011, the European Union relaxed its RoO requirements by offering a derogation of the double transformation requirement to single-stage processing. After AP LDCs graduate, however, their access to GSP+ and Standard GSP benefits will be conditional upon fulfilling the double transformation rule. 16 Three regulations govern the United Kingdom\u2019s current GSP: i) the Trade Preference Scheme regulations (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, ii) the Customs (Origin of Chargeable Goods: Trade Preference Scheme) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, and iii) the Customs Tariff (Preferential Trade Arrangements and Tariff Quotas) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 35 The 2023 DCTS will be comprised of three different levels of privilege: 1.) DCTS Comprehensive Preferences\u2014previously known as the LDC Framework\u2014is the most generous scheme and reserved for LDCs. As under the European Union GSP, LDCs will benefit from zero tariffs for all items except arms and ammunition. 2.) DCTS Enhanced Preferences will benefit economically vulnerable low-income countries and LMICs, and will likely cover most of the graduated AP LDCs.17 The scheme will provide duty-free market access to the same 66 percent of tariff lines as under the European Union GSP regime. In addition, it extends tariff preferences to an additional set of 156 products and removes seasonal tariffs. Compared to current rates, beneficiaries will likely see a gain from zero or reduced tariffs for around 85 percent of all tariff lines. 3.)

THE UNITED STATES The United States is an important destination for exports from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, Nepal and Timor-Leste. Apparel represents more than 80 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s exports, followed by home textiles, headgear and parts (HS 65), and footwear. Cambodia and Myanmar export clothing, leather products, furniture, bedding, footwear, plastic and electric machinery and other items to this market. Nepal primarily exports carpets to the United States, while Timor-Leste ships coffee, tea, mat\u00e9 and spices. The United States does not have a comprehensive preference scheme such as duty-free, quota-free all- product market access for LDCs. Instead, under its GSP for least developed beneficiary developing countries (LDBDCs), the United States provides preferential duty-free entry for more than 5,100 products out of around 12,000 tariff lines at the HS 8-digit level. There are 131 designated GSP beneficiary countries and territories, including 44 least-developed BDCs (LDBDCs) (USTR, 2020). Bangladesh, not included in the LDBDC list, is subject to MFN tariffs. Therefore, graduation should pose no major concerns to AP LDCs, because, apart from Bangladesh, graduates will be able to access preferential treatment as beneficiary developing countries (BDCs). Furthermore, most textile and clothing products are excluded from the United States GSP schemes and products such as coffee, leather products, furniture, and plastics attract LDBC tariffs, which are nearly the same as GSP rates. Thus, AP LDC graduation is not expected to impact these export products. Notably, Cambodia\u2019s GSP in the United States expired in December 2020, so the impact of its graduation in the United States market will depend on a pending decision for its GSP restoration. However, Cambodia\u2019s low LDC-preference utilization rates of one-third of GSP-eligible exports remains an issue. Lao PDR\u2019s major exports, electrical machinery and equipment (HS85), optical, photographic, cinematographic items (HS90), footwear (HS64), and natural or cultured pearls (HS71) have almost identical tariff rates under the United States\u2019 GSP as for LDBDCs and BDCs (Table 3.11). Graduation from LDC-specific benefit to GSP for developing countries should thus have a negligible impact on Lao exports to the United States. Post-graduation preference erosion will be minimal for Myanmar\u2019s leading exports to the United States, including leather articles (HS42), knitted or not knitted apparel and clothing (HS62 and 61), footwear (HS64), electrical machinery and equipment (HS85), and fish and crustaceans (HS03). In addition to the LDBDC scheme, the United States provides duty-free preferential treatment to Nepal under the US-Nepal Trade Preferences Act, which was enacted after Nepal\u2019s devastating 2015 earthquake. 20 Group 1 comprises Indonesia, Philippines, Viet Nam and LDCs Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar; Group 2 comprises India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and LDCs Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 37 Under this Act, the United States allows duty-free preferential treatment for 66 products at the HS 8-digit level until December 2025 (Razzaque, 2020b). Nepal exports approximately 600 8-digit level products to the United States: around two-thirds under MFN zero-duty and 18 under the GSP for LDBDCs duty suspension provision. In addition, 46 products receive preferential treatment under the US-Nepal Trade Preferences Act.

Lao PDR also ships wood products, coffee and tea to the Japanese market. Kiribati and Tuvalu mainly export fish and crustaceans to Japan, and Timor-Leste ships minerals, coffee and tea. Graduating AP LDCs from Southeast Asia, ASEAN members Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar, will continue to enjoy preferential duty-free access under the ASEAN- Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) for more than 90 percent of tariff lines. They will also receive duty-free market access to Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Thus, the graduation of these three countries will have limited impact in the Japanese market. Non-ASEAN AP LDCs without bilateral or regional preferential trade agreements with Japan will be eligible after graduation for Japan\u2019s GSP scheme for developing countries. It allows tariff reductions of up to 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 percent of MFN rates across products, except for most clothing and footwear items (UNDESA, 2020). Thus, Bangladesh\u2019s clothing exports to Japan will face a greater than 8 percent tariff, home textiles will see 3.2 percent, footwear will attract a steep 19 percent tariff, and leather products will see 10.5 percent. Kiribati and Tuvalu are unlikely to be impacted by graduation because the countries\u2019 preference utilization rates are close to zero\u2014implying that they must already pay MFN duties for their exports. Graduation\u2019s impact on Timor-Leste\u2019s exports to Japan are also likely to be low because GSP tariffs for minerals and coffee from developing countries are very low. The Japanese GSP scheme for developing countries makes provisions for partial and complete graduation for beneficiary countries. Any product of a beneficiary country will graduate from the GSP for two reasons: (i) the country is classified as a high-income economy, as per the World Bank classification of global economies; (ii) the country or territory is classified as an upper middle-income economy, as per the same World Bank classification, and the value of the beneficiary exports exceeds 1 percent of the total value of world exports in the WTO. After fulfilling these criteria, a product will graduate from the GSP scheme if the value of Japan\u2019s imports of the product originating from the beneficiary country exceeds 1 billion yen and 25 percent of the total value of Japan\u2019s global imports of the product. Japan will consider a beneficiary country for complete graduation if the country has been classified as a high-income country for three consecutive years or the country has been classified as an upper middle-income economy and holds a greater than 1 percent share of world exports for three consecutive years. In the medium to long term after LDC graduation, these thresholds for partial and complete graduation could be relevant for AP LDCs. Since the RoO for LDCs and developing countries are similar and benefit from the preferential treatment in Japan, graduation will not have any impact on their requirements.", "start_char_idx": null,

Source: WITS, n.d. Table 3.11: Tariff rates under relevant schemes in Canada, China, European Union, India, Japan and the United States, continued Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 41 CHINA China provides duty-free quota-free (DFQF) market access to 40 LDCs for at least 95 percent of its tariff lines (UNCTAD, 2016). China does not have a preferential scheme for developing countries. After graduation, preferential access to this market will be determined by RTA/PTA membership with China, otherwise countries will have to pay MFN tariffs. Therefore, graduating ASEAN-member AP LDCs, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar, will enjoy almost unchanged duty rates in the Chinese market through the ASEAN-China RECEP and the ASEAN-China FTA; the former provides duty-free access after the phase-out period and the latter provides mostly zero rates except for some sensitive items. Other AP LDCs will face significant preference erosion in China after graduation. Bangladesh may be entitled to Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA) tariff concessions, which are far from comprehensive in terms of product coverage and tariff concession amounts. This would imply that Bangladesh, for example, will see significant tariff preference erosion in its main exports: textiles and clothing, other textile fibres and yarn (HS53), raw hides and skins (HS 41), fish and crustaceans (HS 42), articles of leather (HS 42), and footwear. However, given Bangladesh\u2019s low preference utilization under China\u2019s current LDC scheme, post-graduation impacts on exports should not be exaggerated. Bhutan is not listed as a GSP beneficiary in the Chinese market. Consequently, its graduation will not have any significant impact on its market access terms (Razzaque, 2020a).

China is the single largest export destination for the Solomon Islands\u2019 merchandise, accounting for almost two-thirds of its exports, primarily composed of wood and wood products (HS 44) and ores, slag and ash (HS 26). Currently, the Solomon Islands is not included in the Chinese GSP beneficiary list, so its graduation will not have any tariff implications. Similarly, Kiribati and Tuvalu are not included in the Chinese LDC scheme and export 100 percent of their products to China on an MFN basis. Timor-Leste does not currently benefit from any tariff preference in China, so graduation is unlikely to have a major impact on its exports. INDIA Approximately 98.2 percent of India\u2019s tariff lines at the HS 6-digit level of its Duty-Free Tariff Preference (DFTP) Scheme for LDCs provides preferential concessional tariffs, with 85 percent of all tariff lines entirely duty- free. Because India does not have a GSP for developing countries, graduating AP LDCs will rely on bilateral and/ or regional trade agreements to favourably access India\u2019s market. India is the largest export destination for Bhutan and Nepal, at around 94 percent and 68 percent respectively. Bilateral trade agreements govern their exports: : the Agreement on the Trade, Commerce and Transit between the Government of the Republic of India and the Royal Government of Bhutan, and the Indo-Nepal Treaty of Trade.

Asia-Pacific LDCs enjoy duty-free access for the entire Australian tariff schedule. AP LDCs can use the GSP for developing countries after graduation. ASEAN-member AP LDCs receive preference under RCEP and the ASEAN\u2013Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA). Pacific Island AP LDCs will use the GSP for Forum Island Countries, which provides similar preferences as the GSP for LDCs. Canada LDCs enjoy duty free access under least developed country tariff (LDCT) scheme in the Canadian market; the scheme provides DFQF market access for 98.9 percent of tariff lines AP LDCs will be entitled to Canada\u2019s generalized preferential tariff (GPT), for developing countries and selected agricultural and industrial products. Most textiles and clothing, footwear, and chemical products are not included. China China provides DFQF market access to 40 LDCs. China\u2019s GSP for LDCs is available for 95 percent-98 percent of tariff lines. China has no preferential scheme for developing countries. ASEAN-member AP LDCs will receive preference under the ASEAN-China FTA and RCEP. Bangladesh may access the APTA concessional duty rates for greatly limited product coverage. Bhutan, Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu are not beneficiaries of China\u2019s GSP. Nepal will be subject to MFN tariffs. European Union LDCs receive duty free preference under the European Union\u2019s Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme, which provides DFQF preference for all products from LDCs except arms and ammunitions. Upon complying with 32 pre-specified international conventions, AP LDCs can access the GSP+ preference, which provides tariff suspensions for 66 percent of European Union tariff lines. Otherwise, countries will be automatically included in the Standard GSP scheme, which provides duty reductions for 66 percent of tariff lines.

After graduation, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar will continue to receive preferential access to Indian markets under the ASEAN-India FTA. It allows for close to zero duty on their major exports to India, which are unlikely to be affected after graduation. India\u2019s LDC-specific RoO requires a change in tariff sub-heading and 30 percent local value-added, while the ASEAN-India FTA also requires a change in tariff sub-heading and 35 percent local value-added. Unlike the other AP LDCs, Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu, will face MFN tariffs in India after graduation. However, given their low share of exports to India, the impact of graduation will be limited. After graduation Bangladesh will have some preferential access to India as part of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), but many items of export interest will be on India\u2019s sensitive list and have no preferential access. Bangladesh\u2019s market access, for garments for example, will be significantly impacted by LDC graduation. Under SAFTA provisions, local value-added content requirements for Bangladesh to access the Indian market will increase from 30 percent for LDCs to 40 percent for non-LDCs. AUSTRALIA Australia grants trade preference under the Australian System of Tariff Preferences (ASTP) to five types of exporters: LDCs, Forum Island Countries, developing countries (DC), developing countries subject to Developing Country Status (DCS) duty rates, and developing countries subject to Developing Country T (DCT) duty rates (UNCTAD, 2018). AP LDCs receive DFQF market access for 100 percent of their exports under the ASTP LDC scheme (Part 2 of schedule 1) (Figure 3.6). Graduating AP LDCs will no longer benefit from Australia\u2019s LDC-specific preferences, but may qualify for its GSP for developing countries, which provides tariff- free preferences for 98 percent of tariff lines. Australia generally has low MFN duty rates, and, in most cases, the maximum is 5 percent. As mentioned above, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar will receive tariff preference in Australia under RCEP.

Bangladesh can access 100-percent tariff concessions for 139 items at the 10-digit level through APTA.

Therefore, these three AP LDCs should see no major impact on exports to the Republic of Korea after graduation. Other AP LDCs have no preferential trading arrangements with the Republic of Korea, but it is not a major market for them, so their exports under MFN tariffs will likely have little impact. For AP LDCs to meet the Republic of Korea\u2019s RoO requirement for duty-free access, the total cost of non- local (non-originating) materials must not exceed 60 percent of the end product\u2019s free-on-board (FOB) price (Table 3.13); graduation will have no impact on RoO requirements. Because the Republic of Korea has no GSP scheme for developing countries, AP LDCs will face MFN tariffs unless they have an RTA/FTA with the Republic of Korea. However, the RTA/FRA may have different RoO requirements than those for LDCs. For example, under the APTA, items from Bangladesh and Lao PDR are eligible for preferential tariffs if the value of non-local materials is less than 65 percent of the final value.

South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka Under the first phase of the SAFTA Tariff Liberalization Program (TLP), non-LDCs lowered their tariffs to 20 percent, while LDCs lowered them to 30 percent by 2007. In the second phase, non-LDCs lowered tariffs from 20 percent to 0.5 percent by 2012 and LDCs achieved the same by 1 January 2016. SAFTA has very elaborate sensitive-item lists of products exempted from tariff liberalization. Under the GSP, for any single-country items, the value-added requirement is CTH+30 percent for LDCs, CTH+40 percent for non-LDCs; and in the case of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) cumulation, along with CTH regional content requirement of 40 percent for LDCs or 50 percent for non-LDCs, 20 percent extra value added is required from the exporting country.

Under SAFTA provisions, the local value-added content will increase from 30 percent for LDCs to 40 percent for non-LDCs.

Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 51 3.3 TARIFF IMPLICATIONS OF LDC GRADUATION As discussed earlier, AP LDCs export very different products in vastly different volumes under different LDC schemes. For example, Bangladesh uses LDC-specific preferences for around 70 percent of its exports, in sharp contrast to the 5 percent realized by Kiribati, Timor-Leste and Tuvalu. Consequently, tariff increases and potential adverse implications for exports arising from graduation will differ widely among graduating AP LDCs. A 2020 WTO and EIF study of prospective graduates found that graduation might result in an average weighted-tariff rise of 4.2 percentage points.21 However, Bangladesh and Nepal were estimated to see substantially greater tariff hikes of 8.9 and 8.1 percentage points respectively due to their reliance on high-tariff textile and clothing products.

Table 3.15 provides post-graduation estimations of effective tariff-rate changes in important export- destination markets. For example, Bangladesh will see tariffs rise by 14.5 percentage points in Canada, 11.3 percentage points in the European Union, nearly 9 percentage points in Japan, and 8 percentage points in the Republic of Korea.22 For Bhutan, the estimated effective tariff-rate change in India is almost zero because of its bilateral trade agreement with India, while the European Union and the Republic of Korea rates increase about 9 percentage points. However, under the proposed 2024-2034 European Union GSP, Bhutan might have access to GSP+ and a tariff change close to zero. For the same reason, other graduating AP LDCs\u2019 exports to the European Union, except for Bangladesh\u2019s, may see minimal effective duty-rate changes, although the changes will likely be much higher than announced in the 2020 WTO-EIF study because the best alternative scheme was considered to be the Standard GSP. If Kiribati does not comply with GSP+ requirements, it will see a steep 14.5 percentage point rise in European Union tariffs, nearly 9 percentage points in Canada, 8 percentage points in the Republic of Korea, and 3 percentage points in the United States. Post-graduation, Lao PDR will not face any tariff changes in China or India given the ASEAN FTAs, but will see an increase of 2.7 percentage points in Canada, 8.4 percentage points in the European Union (if not eligible for GSP+), 1.5 percentage points in Japan, and less than 1 percentage points in the Republic of Korea. Similarly, Cambodia and Myanmar will not experience any major effective tariff-rate changes in China, India, Japan and the Republic of Korea thanks to ASEAN FTAs. Myanmar will face a 7.7-percentage-point tariff increase in Canada and 8.5 percentage points in the European Union. Graduation will not have much impact on Nepal\u2019s exports to India because of their bilateral trade agreement, but its post-graduation effective tariff-rate increase will be 5 percentage points in Canada and China, 3.4 percentage points in Japan, and 2.5 percentage points in the Republic of Korea. If Nepal qualifies for GSP+ like Bhutan, it will Figure 3.7: Average tariff increase faced by graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs (percentage point) Source: WTO and EIF, 2020 21 Cambodia was not included in the study. 22 The author estimated Bangladesh\u2019s weighted tariff hike in the European Union market based on apparel exports receiving MFN tariffs due to safeguard measures. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 52 see no tariff changes for European Union exports, but disqualification will result in a 6-percentage points increase. The WTO-EIF study estimates that the Solomon Islands will see a 12.9 percentage point increase in the European Union based on the Standard GSP tariff rates. However, as it stands, the Solomon Islands will receive duty-free access for almost all its exports under the EPA. Post-graduation tariff changes for Timor-Leste and Tuvalu in their major markets will be minimal (WTO-EIF, 2020), mostly due to their current export structures and low preference utilization rates. Tariff hikes translate into a loss of competitiveness. The WTO-EIF (2020) ex-ante analysis employs a partial equilibrium model that shows graduating AP LDCs losing various magnitudes of exports. Bangladesh is forecast to see the greatest impact, estimated as a more than 14 percent decline on average (Table 3.16). Furthermore, model simulations show Bangladesh\u2019s exports to Canada fall by as much as 42 percent, 26 percent in the European Union,23 30.5 percent in Japan, 27.5 percent in the Republic of Korea, and 8.3 percent in China (Table 3.17).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a860e560-ba5d-47a0-b9d0-4e7e8d62e4d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a860e560-ba5d-47a0-b9d0-4e7e8d62e4d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c52252e6451a68ea9e8f3ff73d3e798bf3a15dbace4cc049851060e96a0c9fa"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5170a7a-7af7-4da0-b2f2-9840536e6a70", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d47241fd31a37f48bbad86b15374aca9226b88acf3f530ff8855001430ffc025"}}, "hash": "0152de5b7d3d0d1379b17a89958e8d03ae8b206c306509f771bba72810088a82", "text": "In terms of export shocks to specific product categories, the WTO-EIF study projects Bangladesh\u2019s exports of clothing to decline by $4.8 billion (equivalent to 15.3 percent of the country\u2019s merchandise exports); textile exports by 7.6 percent; leather and footwear by 14 percent; fish and fish products by 19.7 percent; transport equipment by 17.2 percent; beverages by 9.1 percent; chemicals by 2.5 percent; and cereals by 5.78 percent (Table 3.18).

The potential export volume loss for Nepal is estimated at $20 million, equivalent to 2.5 percent of its pre- graduation exports (Table 3.16). As a textiles and apparel exporter, the largest shock to Nepal emanates from the European Union market due to the loss of EBA preferential access, leading to a decline of 19.1 percent overall (Table 3.17), led by a 13.28 percent drop in clothing exports (Table 3.18), unless Nepal can secure its place on a GSP+ listing. However, exports to its largest destination market, India, will see no change. Among the Pacific Island AP LDCs, only the Solomon Islands is expected to see a decline of export volumes; the model forecasts minimal impacts on graduates Kiribati, Timor-Leste and Tuvalu.25 The Solomon Island\u2019s loss, estimated at $34 million or 4.2 percent of exports (Table 3.16), stems from the loss of preferential access to European Union markets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12d56b1f-2a2c-49d7-a3f1-2b9329ac5a45": {"__data__": {"id_": "12d56b1f-2a2c-49d7-a3f1-2b9329ac5a45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcd88c28630dc9bcf0345463b5f33820ea709481eec26f4f456cc6cbef9ed48d"}, "2": {"node_id": "847f90a5-7cde-49a4-86f6-2500fe6bc056", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1422943cd077dbf8fde288bf0fa591c24f19c689161be1c76278c3e94329a270"}}, "hash": "93d07a3afb8d4e6cef354c104e8344b3aa432ad7cbdf7cf648088074ac7ca4fd", "text": "However, the Solomon Island\u2019s 2020 accession to the Cotonou Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) and the European Union via the EU-Pacific States Interim Economic Partnership Agreement means much of the pre-accession estimated export loss will be avoided (European Commission, n.d.).

For example, these projections do not account for the impact of RoO requirements on graduated countries. Regardless of such limitations, the findings seem to suggest that preference erosion due to graduation could exert competitiveness pressure on AP LDCs that made use of LDC-specific trade preference. As indicated earlier, apart from Bangladesh, any potential adverse implications for other AP LDCs are quite small. 3.4 THE LDC SERVICES WAIVER The WTO\u2019s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) provides a framework for global services trade liberalization (WTO, 1994). It focuses on enhancing the participation of developing members in trade in services through \u2018negotiated specific commitments\u2019. It also states that LDCs will be given special consideration in the execution of this provision, notably in the context of market access liberalization in export-oriented sectors and modes of supply (Table 3.19).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d048a37-51fb-47b5-b857-8fa5406bcbb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d048a37-51fb-47b5-b857-8fa5406bcbb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90d63ba85f148fb50fa8954966106d36b247f62e32b7d4ba8c5247eec515d4af"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa06cf00-833f-4d43-955a-6d44e3d12bd8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55aba408a2ab167d352c10bdd7932f470c5b69d5bf798d44940a4a4352b69e19"}}, "hash": "340cd997af144191a68dd0d921788ba9dd4a9ca25dbc3509875271da2f88ba36", "text": "This means that LDCs\u2019 market access concerns should be prioritized during services trade negotiations.

However, the GATS did not spell out options for preferential treatment to services for LDCs and developing countries, as it did for trade in goods. At the 2011 WTO Ministerial Conference , members agreed to allow LDC-specific preferential treatment for services and service suppliers in the \u2018Enabling Clause for Services\u2019. The resulting LDC services waiver allows interested developed and developing country WTO members to offer preferential treatment to services and services suppliers originating in LDCs. In other words, the waiver relieves WTO members of their legal obligation to give non-discriminatory MFN treatment to all trading partners while granting trade preferences to LDCs, as per GATS Article II. In 2014, LDCs submitted a collective request to ensure preferential commitments in services modalities from members. Despite confusion over implementation, 24 WTO members (counting the European Union as one and including developed and several developing countries) submitted notifications to grant specific preferences to LDCs. Members also indicated sectors and modes of supply where they intended to provide preferential treatment to LDC services and service suppliers. The 2015 WTO Ministerial Conference extended the LDC services waiver until 2030, and directed the Council for Trade in Services to examine how notified preferences work and to explore technical assistance measures targeted at promoting LDC participation in the services trade. In addition to receiving preferential market access for goods exports, under the WTO services waivers, LDCs may benefit from special treatment for services exports, such as facilitated or longer entry visas for services suppliers. Post-graduation AP LDCs will not be entitled to make new GATS commitments; instead, they will maintain the level of commitments undertaken during the 1986-1994 Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. Preferential treatment under the LDC services waiver will be terminated when the AP LDC graduation becomes effective. Despite the LDC services waiver, the WTO members\u2019 notified preferences have not been operationalized, leaving AP LDCs unable to benefit from it. Consequently, graduation will not lose them services exports unless the waiver is operationalized prior to a graduation and an AP LDC makes use of it. Furthermore, an analysis of the services-preference measures notified under the waiver indicates that the end of preferential treatment will have little impact on graduating AP LDCs because most measures only apply to members\u2019 MFN regimes. The LDCs\u2019 primary focus has been on the Mode 4 \u2018Presence of Natural Persons\u2019; in response, some WTO members have made waiver offers (Table 3.20). However, actual liberalization of LDC-specific preferential terms has not occurred because of shallow offers and a lack of concrete operational plans. Table 3.19: Definition of services trade and modes of supply according to GATS Mode 1: Cross border trade From the territory of one WTO member into the territory of any other member Mode 2: Consumption abroad In the territory of one WTO member to the service consumer of any other member Mode 3: Commercial presence Service supplier of one WTO member, through commercial presence, in the territory of any other member Mode 4: Presence of natural persons By a service supplier of one WTO member, through the presence of natural persons of a member in the territory of any other member Source: WTO, 1994. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 56 All major services exports, including transport, travel- tourism, telecommunications and information-technology (IT)-enabled services, construction and financial services from the AP LDCs are currently governed through bilateral arrangements and/or on a competitive basis. This implies that graduation should not result in any loss of services-export opportunities. However, AP LDC that could supply labourer services, such as Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal, might face a post-graduation disadvantage and missed opportunities if the LDC services waiver comes into operation in the future and WTO members offer labourer market openings to LDC workers and service providers. 3.5 LDC GRADUATION INTERACTION WITH OTHER DYNAMIC TRADE-RELATED CHALLENGES Graduation could potentially interact with other dynamic and unfolding issues, with unfavourable consequences for graduating AP LDCs.

This GVC under-participation despite the availability of LDC-specific trade preferences, raises a concern that forgone trade preferences due to graduation could even further minimize AP LDC participation in GVCs.

Even so, participation by, for example, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Myanmar in the textile and apparel value chain has been limited to CMT operations, where the least value is created. The most value-adding operations at pre- and post- production stages, such as design, marketing, retailing, and post-retail consumer services, remain largely out of reach for AP LDCs and are performed by developed- country brands and retailers. Returning to the example of Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Myanmar: while performing CMT activities alone is not a desirable and sustainable option, losing any trade preferences could further restrict their export and business potential. LOSS OF COMPETITIVENESS DUE TO OTHER COUNTRIES\u2019 TRADE AGREEMENTS Graduating AP LDCs face preference erosion or stand to lose the most liberal export market access and various RTAs and FTAs involving other large developing countries exert further competitive pressure. Recently, countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam have secured preferential market access terms through the RCEP that are more favourable than those Bangladesh and Nepal will receive after graduation in the major Chinese, Japanese and Korean markets. Similarly, the 2020 European Union- Viet Nam FTA will gradually lower tariffs on Viet Nam\u2019s clothing exports from 9 percent to zero by 2027; during approximately the same time, Bangladesh, after graduation and a three-year transition period, could see tariff rates on its clothing exports rise from zero to about 11 percent.26 This drastic shift in market access conditions could cause a trade diversion by making Bangladesh less price competitive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11a3cc74-b824-4007-a0e6-128bc565308c": {"__data__": {"id_": "11a3cc74-b824-4007-a0e6-128bc565308c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7f68d670011f3e72640d005b8b17b3012a68d582a083beca86280862a134aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "89de3103-7f6f-414c-9f68-6e006b82a3a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d42d066442aeff009d48b005b18367ba817b8a85876c715eb9b0b7ebcbc06eb"}}, "hash": "0a20ebb1448ea0773316814793239c338c72ca8bfdc9893d1b1e04cbafddcdb9", "text": "Even if graduating AP LDCs qualify for GSP+, the European Union-Viet Nam FTA will cause significant erosion in their competitiveness.

Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 58 INVESTMENT DIVERSION The loss of trade preferences, such as duty-free market access and liberal RoO requirements, and the erosion of competitiveness arising from trade agreements between other countries, could make it more challenging for graduating AP LDCs to attract FDI, particularly the textile and clothing exporters. Interviews with Chinese FDI strategists for the textile and clothing sector show that losing LDC-specific market access to the world\u2019s leading apparel import market could hurt the attractiveness of Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Nepal as FDI destinations for Chinese textile and apparel companies (Razzaque, 2022). During 2017-2018, Bangladesh, Lao PDR, and Nepal were not among the top FDI destinations for China\u2019s textile and apparel companies, while Cambodia accounted for less than 2 percent of China\u2019s total FDI outflows (Razzaque, 2022). Furthermore, COVID-19-induced supply disruptions and increased shipping costs have given rise to major importers\u2019 \u2018near-sourcing\u2019 and \u2018reshoring\u2019 campaigns in a bid to reallocate supply chains away from China; this could potentially hurt the trade and investment prospects of graduating AP LDCs. For example, European Union-based retailers are interested expanding sourcing from eastern European countries and Turkey while United States investors increase sourcing from Mexico and Central American countries (European Parliament, 2021; Lu, 2021). Under these circumstances, loss of any trade preference could exacerbate AP LDC graduation impacts. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES IN THE FACE OF PREFERENCE EROSION The so-called environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues of workplace safety, working conditions, and environmental compliance have become increasingly prominent concerns for international trade sourcing and business activities as consumers\u2019 concerns about climate change and working conditions affect supply-chain management decisions. This trend might shift competitive advantage to more ESG-compliant sources that have greater supply- side capacity. Because AP LDCs rely more on tariff preferences for their competitive strength, and have less financial support and compliance capacity, graduation and the associated loss of LDC-specific preferential tariffs and financing could pose challenges for their firms\u2019 ability to invest in ESG-related issues. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 59 4.1 STATE OF DEVELOPMENT FINANCE IN ASIA- PACIFIC LDCS A lack of financial resources is one of the most significant obstacles facing AP LDCs in achieving sustained growth because general government spending is critical for development. The ongoing development transition of AP LDCs requires meeting an ever-rising demand for enhanced infrastructure for energy generation and to improve health and education quality. However, domestic resource mobilization capacity is limited in graduating AP LDCs. This highlights the significance of external development financing. PUBLIC SPENDING Amid LDC graduation prospects, the role of public investment has become more prominent than ever. The level of general government spending varies widely across AP LDCs. Bangladesh, the largest country, with a population of about 170 million, spends about 15 percent of GDP on public expenditure. Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar spend in the range is 20-25 percent; and Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Nepal spend 25-30 percent. AP island LDCs have much higher levels of government spending, ranging from close to 40 percent of GDP (during 2017-2019) in the Solomon Islands, more than 80 percent in Timor-Leste, and exceeding 100 percent in Kiribati and Tuvalu (Figure 4.1). Generally, Pacific LDCs have high government spending as a proportion of GDP; the structural limitations of their economic activities means that government spending is a main driver of economic growth. Despite the huge need for financing to fund development, most AP LDCs can mobilize very few domestic resources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23f3f35b-6c71-40c9-8c35-4a7ad9ff4023": {"__data__": {"id_": "23f3f35b-6c71-40c9-8c35-4a7ad9ff4023", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10cda4776401e73f30cf93f8c9e4eab0c2cd47d340db9ef4b837e7c8c3f8c82a"}, "2": {"node_id": "d54a0cec-795d-4d5e-aad3-909e4198aa33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6572e5c5a7a1dba2a7b8b30ebea531028e1aebd5e68cfaff1476f004cded9b9"}}, "hash": "f75146c34360c10de4b19e6d95cc3e36910c6e5fe51ab9bd4e8d2523076cece2", "text": "Bangladesh generates the least revenue from domestic sources \u2013 less than 10 percent of GDP.

Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 60 and Timor-Leste are most dependent on external financing, followed by Bhutan, Kiribati, and the Solomon Islands (Figure 4.2). EXTERNAL FINANCING The investment required for future growth is an important dimension of government expenditures. Investment may come from domestic sources, such as savings, and from external sources, such as remittances, FDI and ODA. Figure 4.3 illustrates the composition of these elements for AP LDCs. The gross domestic savings in Kiribati and Timor- Leste are negative. FDI inflows are negligible for most AP LDCs: Cambodia has the highest level as percentage of GDP (12.3 percent), followed by Lao PDR (7 percent), and Myanmar (5 percent). Migrant workers remittances constitute the most important element of overall resource outlays in Nepal (25 percent of GDP) followed by in Kiribati (9.5 percent), Bangladesh (6.2 percent), Cambodia (6 percent), and Timor-Leste (5 percent). External financial flows\u2014mostly, ODA \u2013 have aided the growth and development process of AP LDCs. Over the past two decades, total official finance, composed of ODA, non-export credit, and private-sector development finance, to all 11 AP LDCs from the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors, non- DAC donors, and multilateral organisations increased more than five-fold, from less than $3 billion in 2002 to $17.6 billion in 2019 (Table 4.1).27 Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal and Tuvalu in particular have seen a steady rise in external financial flows (Table A12). ODA constitutes more than 85 percent of the official finance flowing to AP LDCs (Figure 4.4). During the past ten years (2010-2019), war-torn Afghanistan attracted the highest amount of ODA, over $50 billion, followed by Bangladesh ($35.4 billion), Myanmar ($19.3 billion), Nepal ($12.2 billion), Cambodia ($8.7 billion), and Lao PDR ($5.3 billion). During this period, combined ODA flows to the four Pacific Island AP LDCs was about $6 billion. When computed as percentage of GNI, net ODA inflows in Tuvalu comprised more than 45 percent (2017-2019 average), followed by Afghanistan (20.7 percent), and Kiribati (19 percent). Bangladesh received the least ODA as a percentage of GNI.28 Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste had net ODA inflows as percentage of GNI higher than the global LDC average (Figure 4.5).

Grants make up more than 90 percent of ODA to Afghanistan, the Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste, and more than 50 percent to Nepal and the other countries. Bangladesh receives concessional loans for more than two-thirds of its ODA, deploying the financing for large-scale infrastructures projects and various social development projects. Despite fluctuations, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Nepal have recently shown a strong rising trend (in absolute terms) in concessional loans even as grants remain the main source of support for Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu (Figure 4.7). EXTERNAL DEBT Loans and credits from foreign sources, often made in foreign currencies, can create external debt burdens for a borrower when it encounters difficulties in servicing the debt, that is, making principle and/or interest payments on time. Sound financial management calls for a borrower to not take on more debt than it can service. In 2020, external debt stocks as a percentage of GNI stood at less than 10 percent for Timor-Leste and Tuvalu; 15-20 percent for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Kiribati, and Myanmar; and 21-30 percent for Nepal and the Solomon Islands. However, high external debt levels were recorded for Bhutan, around 130 percent of GNI; 95 percent for Lao PDR and 71 percent for Cambodia (Figure 4.8). Afghanistan and the four island AP LDCs escaped high levels of external debt because a very high proportion of their external financing draws on ODA grants. AP LDCs\u2019 income requirements for debt service widely vary, from as low as 0.25 percent of GNI in Timor-Leste to as high as 5.8 percent in Cambodia (Figure 4.8). Kiribati, Lao PDR, and Tuvalu have a high risk of external-debt distress and Bhutan, the Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste have a moderate risk according to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (World Bank, 2022a). 4.2 LDC GRADUATION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT FINANCE There is some concern about ODA availability to AP LDCs declining after graduation, but this concern may be misplaced. First, LDCs are usually not the leading recipients of ODA: only two rank in the top 10 (UNCTAD, 2018) and LDCs account for less than a quarter of all ODA resources (Wheat, 2022).29 Aid allocation patterns and trends imply that country-specific conditions, such as civil wars and unrest, natural catastrophes, health epidemics, refugee crises, recipient nations\u2019 historical and bilateral connections with donors and regional proximity, and donors\u2019 strategic priorities override recipients\u2019 development status as key decision factors. Second, only a few UN organizations and development partners have annual ODA or other financial aid 29 Among the top ten recipients of foreign aid from OECD-DAC countries in 2017, only Bangladesh and Ethiopia were LDCs.

BILATERAL DONORS AND THE USE OF LDC AS A CRITERION FOR AID ALLOCATION Both bilateral and multilateral donors provide ODA to all low- and middle-income countries, including lower and upper middle-income countries, but bilateral ODA provided to most AP LDCs. Japan is an important source of ODA across all AP LDCs, and the United States is a strong supporter of many (Figure 4.9). Australia is a major ODA provider to Pacific Island AP LDCs. The United Kingdom and European Union member states are also important sources of assistance to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Nepal. A UNCDP (2021) graduation-impact assessment found that graduation may not have a significant impact on most bilateral donors\u2019 loan and grant conditions for LDCs, not least because bilateral donors often do not consider LDC status a precondition for development assistance (Table A13).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b4d8c61-3660-49e1-b35d-3bf028882b2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b4d8c61-3660-49e1-b35d-3bf028882b2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce0fc5dafedd2605ea098678715a3c13fe082d6fa17e4b6f3552469ae894f23f"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d706114-ac2c-4998-99a0-8ba606582502", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc52b0292f4fcfdb35816e75fa9820524341669c78c5d6d011600d0fd495ff38"}}, "hash": "50afbfe70f7c0703db9be4f2f4eb872f02f82a078a0d8522ba6ecbed1a3671a0", "text": "Only Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Germany use LDC as a decision factor; this implies that AP LDC graduation might influence their ODA recipient priorities and aid conditions. Germany: The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) provides grants and concessional loans to LDCs and developing countries (Figure A1). LDCs typically receive grants, whereas non-LDC developing nations mostly receive loans, with certain exceptions. In June 2020, the BMZ adopted a new bilateral cooperation strategy, BMZ 2030 (BMZ, n.d.). It focuses on several areas, including climate, health and family policy, sustainable supply chains, digital technology, technology transfer, private investment, and hunger and poverty, and introduces new recipient categories: (i) bilateral partners, (ii) global partners, and (iii) nexus and peace partners (BMZ, n.d.). Currently, 25 of the 60 partner nations listed in BZM 2030 are LDCs. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Cambodia are bilateral partners with which Germany maintains long-term cooperation toward shared development goals. Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Nepal are multilateral countries where Germany will continue providing support. Other AP LDCs are not listed as priority countries for German development cooperation. Graduation would imply a change from grants to Over time, development partners have undertaken certain commitments in relation to ODA for LDCs: l How much ODA to provide to LDCs: There is a longstanding commitment by developed countries, reiterated in numerous international development agendas, to provide the equivalent of 0.15 to 0.20 percent of their GNI in the form of ODA to LDCs. This is in parallel to a commitment to provide the equivalent of 0.7 percent of GNI in ODA to developing countries. These commitments, which are fulfilled by only a few countries, refer to their aggregate flows to LDCs, and not to flows to individual countries. l Modalities of bilateral ODA and the grant element: The OECD-DAC recommends that the average grant element in ODA to LDCs should be either 90 percent of a given donor's annual commitment to all LDCs, or at least 86 percent of the donor's commitments to each individual LDC over a period of three years. Most ODA to LDCs by DAC members is, in fact, in the form of grants. Moreover, since 2019, the LDC status of the recipient affects the extent to which concessional loans are counted as ODA by the OECD. In the grant-equivalent approach adopted by DAC members to measure ODA, grants and the grant portion of concessional loans count as ODA. Loans to LDCs and other low-income countries require a higher grant equivalent component to be considered ODA and differentiated discount rates are applied. l Untied aid: OECD-DAC members have committed to \u2018untying\u2019 ODA, that is, not making aid conditional on the procurement of goods and services from the donor. There has been some progress in this regard. Many donors that do not tie ODA in LDCs also do not tie them in other developing countries.

Republic of Korea: Korea\u2019s Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) operates under the aegis of the Export-Import Bank of Korea and the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. It provides concessional loans to developing nations, including LDCs, classifying partner countries into five recipient categories. In the first category, LDCs receive the most favourable terms: lowest interest rates and longest repayment and grace periods. The other four categories are based on GNI per capita.31 Post-graduation, AP LDCs will have access to concessional EDCF loans, although with higher interest rates and shorter repayment periods. The Republic of Korea also offers grants through the Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (OECD, 2021).

Other AP LDCs receive only grants from KOICA. Australia: The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) allocates Australia\u2019s ODA to developing countries: LDC status has no effect on bilateral development assistance prioritization. DFAT considers LDC graduation among a range of factors for bilateral aid investment plans and associated funding allocations (UNDESA, 2020a); graduation is unlikely to affect regional aid allocations. United Kingdom: The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides ODA to LDCs and developing countries, although LDC status is not a determining factor for aid allocation (UNDESA, 2020b; UK Government, n.d.).

Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 71 AP LDC receives. The ADB provides three types of concessional financing: concessional assistance only (Group A); ordinary capital resource (OCR) blend loans (Group B); and regular market-based ORC loans (Group C). Country group categories are defined based on (i) gross national income (GNI) per capita and (ii) creditworthiness for regular OCR loans. Graduation from the LDC category may result in reclassification, depending on the country\u2019s creditworthiness, whether it is \u2018lacking,\u2019 \u2018limited,\u2019 or \u2019adequate\u2019 (Table 4.4). Unless graduating AP LDCs have a substantial or high risk of debt distress or lack creditworthiness, they will move from concessional-only support to blended credit schemes. AP LDCs with \u2018limited\u2019 creditworthiness will be unaffected by graduation. ADB uses the World Bank\u2019s GNI per capita classification of economies and the IDA\u2019s operational cut-off. Except for Group B countries Bangladesh and Timor- Leste, graduating AP LDCs currently belong to Group A. Except for Nepal, these countries exceed the GNI per capita threshold and will be reclassified to Group B after graduation. When Nepal\u2019s GNI per capita exceeds the IDA threshold, it will also be reclassified to Group B. Graduation from Group A to Group B will not affect the allocation of concessional loans. It will only result in minor changes in maturity periods and interest rates (Table 4.5). It will also create opportunities for AP LDC graduates to apply for additional, semi-concessional, or regular OCR loans, as long as indebtedness is not too high. Under the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries, if the World Bank and the IMF (with ADB participation where possible) jointly assess an AP LDC to have a moderate or high risk of debt distress, the ADB will classify the country into Group A even after graduation.33 The ADB determines reclassifications on a case-by-case basis; such assessments are approved by its governing board. United Nations organizations: Assistance from UN agencies to AP LDCs should not see significant impacts from graduation alone since many UN-system organizations dedicate a significant portion of their technical and financial resources based on individual country needs. For example, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) deploys a portion of its core resources only to LDCs, and uses three thresholds to determine recipients: the lowest GNI per capita, highest child mortality rate below the age of five, and the largest child population. These criteria allow LDCs to become the largest beneficiaries of UNICEF\u2019s assistance. However, this also implies that AP LDC graduation will have only limited effects on the resources allocated to a country. Although assistance may not be greatly affected, the post-graduation period could be associated with changes in the nature of support provided. It will vary across graduating AP LDCs according to their characteristics. For example, many assistance programmes in Bangladesh are already shifting from direct grant or loan interventions to emphasize national capacity building and technical assistance. These shifts partly stem from the country\u2019s development advancements and public sector capacity, and partly from agency-wide policies, rather than projections related to LDC graduation. Other graduation-related changes in UN assistance are expected to be minor, and may include the following: Table 4.5: Asian Development Bank lending windows and terms Group A Concessional lending Group B Concessional lending Group B and Group C Regular Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) - Maturity of 32 years, including 8-year grace period. - Interest rate of 1 percent during grace period and 1.5 percent during amortization.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2f6fa2c-68e0-4a60-83dc-7a641d785a51": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2f6fa2c-68e0-4a60-83dc-7a641d785a51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2b2ce37d00806ae5365eccb7541eac0b9cee92ccc3762a72c1d398f926428b8"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d535a87-14c9-436d-90e3-5e51983f69dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a5a4d8bdfc631d0b37992fc8828ef6e5cb0ce7908ed23b34831b26a6ee3f3be"}}, "hash": "921f1d520f802ca3c1d5c8c14c3410152ad41483c3e068413114ea2372a33f45", "text": "- Interest rate of 1 percent during grace period and 1.5 percent during amortization. - Maturity of 25 years, including 5-year grace period - Interest rate of 2 percent throughout the loan period - Greater flexibility to borrow - Floating base rate a + spread of 50bp (basis points) + maturity premium of 0-20bp + funding cost margin b - Commitment charge of 0.15 percent on undisbursed balance - Flexible options for maturity, interest rate and currency Note: a.

Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 72 l United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): UNDP allocates a portion of its regular budget (core) programmatic resources to LDCs. Graduation may impact the share of core resources committed to an AP LDC in subsequent UNDP budgets; although, any change would take other factors into account, in addition to LDC status, such as country-specific requirements and UNDP\u2019s overall funding (Table 4.6). l Universal Postal Union (UPU): After graduation, an AP LDC would no longer be eligible to access UPU funds for procurement of equipment or technical assistance for postal agents. Specialised country-specific technical support may no longer be available for graduates, but they would still be included in regional activities and capacity- building initiatives. The UPU advises all developing countries on resource mobilization and donor relations. l International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): After graduation, AP LDCs may not face any changes in terms of IAEA resource support, capacity-building, and training opportunities. The agency will continue to support graduates through its technical cooperation programmes; graduates may incur a fee for a small portion of IAEA biannual project budgets through the Technical Cooperation Fund (TCF). l United Nations Volunteers (UNV): UNV support is not related to a country\u2019s LDC status. Both LDCs and non-LDC developing countries are eligible for UNV assistance, based on country-specific demands. UNV\u2019s government cost-sharing general management support charge (GMS) for LDCs and others is set at 3 percent and 8 percent, respectively, so graduates\u2019 cost-share may rise. However, the actual rate is determined by several other factors that are negotiated with the country in question. European Union institutions: The European Union establishes terms of its assistance in multi-year frameworks, and eligibility and allocation criteria have varied over time. In general, the European Union has taken a differentiated approach to aid allocation and partnership formation (UNCDP, 2021). The Neighbourhood Development and International Cooperation Instrument \u2013 Global Europe, established by Regulation 2021/947 of the European Parliament and Council (9 June 2021), plans to allocate between 0.15 and 0.20 percent of the European Union\u2019s GNI to ODA for LDCs (and achieving 0.20 percent by 2030). It also mentions LDCs along with fragile or conflict-affected countries, small island developing states, landlocked developing countries, and heavily indebted poor countries that require \u2018special attention\u2019 and prioritization in the implementations and allocations of the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+). The fulfilment of 0.2 percent of GNI as foreign assistance to LDCs would increase European Union ODA resources for LDCs. In the future, this might be a missed opportunity for graduating LDCs. However, non-LDC developing countries are major recipients of European Union ODA resources, and AP LDC graduation will not result in a significant shift of assistance (UNCDP, 2021). In some cases, AP LDCs approaching graduation may meet other criteria that trigger changes, such as making them ineligible for certain types of grants. Global Environment Facility (GEF): All developing countries are eligible for funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for practical programs and policy reform of global benefit in five focal areas: biodiversity loss, chemicals and waste, climate change, international waters, and land degradation. GEF funding is allocated through its \u2018System for Transparent Allocation of Resources\u2019 (STAR) methodology based on country performance, country potential to achieve global environmental benefits and a social and economic index based on the gross domestic product (GDP-based index, or GDPI) (GEF, 2018a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0524412a-5b3c-452f-9e5a-a0e410f6cdfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "0524412a-5b3c-452f-9e5a-a0e410f6cdfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba0c7be53e444e415641283b5351d0e90727a10a5c0790ccb9b41e36503dc8ff"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3542f82-a15b-42b8-982c-016bf2af66d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1dde5f995bd0021f1c0461e8473c81cd631c47169e1f14188151c200893fbf7"}}, "hash": "1d6bc04a78cf16c29cf45a5bda4106261cf7f0141f1c6e4fbe7992892e4e1e5c", "text": "GEF funding adjusts after distribution based on these factors to ensure that countries receive a minimum allocation in each priority area.34 Currently, the minimum allocation levels for LDCs are greater than that for non-LDCs (the Table 4.6: UNDP development activities: Asia-Pacific LDC regular resources, cost-sharing and trust fund contributions to programme expenses, 2020 ($ thousand) Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan Lao PDR Myanmar Nepal Cambodia Solomon Islands Timor-Leste Trust funds 99,749 12,096 3,961 2,349 1,495 6,517 3,721 87 2,383 Cost-sharing 313,571 42,922 3,746 5,086 20,753 9,108 12,840 4,265 8,716 Regular resources 7,410 6,291 554 1,325 6,517 6,912 3,947 583 479 Note: Information for Kiribati and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe307a02-1b02-455f-86f2-1c8784e17940": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe307a02-1b02-455f-86f2-1c8784e17940", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4526aef7d804f07bb899f1a1543810a9f2b8d6ee0ccde949acb2b71936ee7897"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a957c73-4ffd-491b-986a-257ef9ee096e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "531ef8da896aa7f48464bd59a1414ce45775427780ab726522e18800d2629465"}}, "hash": "ea5e9bd5a8dce741ad68a519571c587452345fb449f5617d338441f479c0de86", "text": "Tuvalu is unavailable.

GAVI: Officially Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is a public\u2013 private global health partnership created in 2000 to increase immunization in poor countries.

Countries are eligible for Gavi support when their per capita GNI averages up to $1,580 over the previous three years. Global Fund: The Global Fund is an international financing facility and partnership that invests $4 billion annually to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Eligibility criteria depend on GNI per capita and an official Disease Burden Index, but not on LDC status. ACCESS TO LDC-SPECIFIC FUNDS There are several funds that support LDCs exclusively, which graduated AP LDCs would no longer be able to access except in cases where the financing facility offers a temporary post-graduation transition period. Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF): The LDCF is managed by the GEF; it was established in 2001 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to address the needs of LDCs whose economic and geophysical characteristics make them especially vulnerable to the impact of global warming and climate change. It supports the preparation and implementation of National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and national adaptation plans (NAPs). The use of LDCF resources by AP LDCs is provided in Table 4.8 (GEF, 2022). Each LDC is eligible for a $10 million \u2018access cap\u2019 during the current GEF replenishment cycle (until 2022), and a $50 million cumulative ceiling to implement urgent adaptation measures highlighted in their NAPA and to formulate an NAP that identifies medium- and long-term adaptation needs (GEF, 2022). AP LDCs will lose access to new funding from the LDCF once they graduate, but projects already approved by the LDCF Council prior to a country\u2019s graduation will continue to be supported with agreed LDCF resources until completion. Green Climate Fund (GCF): The GCF assists developing nations in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting climate change. It gives special consideration to LDCs and small island developing states (SIDS) through \u2018minimum adaptation floors\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a957c73-4ffd-491b-986a-257ef9ee096e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a957c73-4ffd-491b-986a-257ef9ee096e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4526aef7d804f07bb899f1a1543810a9f2b8d6ee0ccde949acb2b71936ee7897"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe307a02-1b02-455f-86f2-1c8784e17940", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea5e9bd5a8dce741ad68a519571c587452345fb449f5617d338441f479c0de86"}}, "hash": "531ef8da896aa7f48464bd59a1414ce45775427780ab726522e18800d2629465", "text": "Graduated AP LDCs will continue to have access to the GCF; the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), which helps all vulnerable developing countries develop and implement national adaptation strategies (NAPs); and the Adaptation Fund.

Bangladesh is especially vulnerable because of its dependence on preference-dependent apparel products. Since most countries are unable to utilize available trade preference, graduation would be a missed opportunity for boosting exports. The same premise, however, implies that their exports would be relatively unaffected by graduating out of the LDC group. Graduation will likely also have limited impact on concessional development financing because most donors\u2014both bilateral and multilateral\u2014do not give much consideration to LDC status in terms of allocating aid. The level of GNI per capita is often a more important aid determinant and many potential graduate AP LDCs have already exceeded the GNI per capita threshold for most concessional loans. LDC-specific funds will be discontinued, but the significance of this assistance is relatively small. In some cases, graduation would alter the terms and conditions of assistance, mainly with concessional loans replacing grants. However, despite the limited impact on aid, graduating AP LDCs should not become complacent about their development prospects. To prepare for additional challenges, these countries should consolidate the graduation process gains; build further development capacities, such as working toward the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); and mobilize external support, both technical and financial. It is also important to bear in mind that individual country contexts vary significantly, which requires specific 5. WAY FORWARD AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ASIA-PACIFIC LDCS adjustment efforts on the producer side and the public administration side. In particular, some export sectors will be subject to increased competitive pressure because they no longer qualify for preferences that automatically lowered purchasers\u2019 costs relative to non-LDC products. In the most extreme case, tariff preferences for nearly all of Bangladesh\u2019s exports will vanish over the next four-to- seven years. Additionally, the discontinuation of certain aid-financed projects and moving from grants to loans could affect the finances of some countries more than others. Therefore, developing detailed country-specific preparatory measures is incredibly important. AP LDCs have several options to consider while preparing for graduation-led regime changes. These should include, among others, continuing to access any market access preferences; improved terms for existing preferential schemes for non-LDC and/or graduated developing countries; more concessional financing backed by improved absorption capacity; and external support and internal actions to confront development challenges that persist beyond graduation. 5.1 TRADE-RELATED MEASURES FOR SMOOTH LDC GRADUATION Most Asia-Pacific LDCs will not graduate for several years, which gives them time to prepare the transition. Bhutan has about a year before its graduation, and the Solomon Islands has about two; Bangladesh and Nepal have close to five years. In the European Union and United Kingdom markets, any graduating LDCs can access the same LDC preferences for an additional three-year grace period after their graduation. This time period can be used to tackle any supply-side bottlenecks to boost competitiveness. These three years are a critical transition period when countries can overhaul their trade and industrial development strategies to boost their export sectors in preparation for LDC graduation. LDC graduation does not mean an end to preferences, and Asia-Pacific LDC graduates should strive to enhance supply-side response to any preferential schemes that remain available to them. As discussed above, several AP LDCs\u2019 preferential market access is not dependent on LDC status. For instance, Bhutan and Nepal\u2019s exports have comprehensive, duty-free market access coverage in India. ASEAN LDCs will have similar market access in India and RCEP countries. Pacific Island LDCs have preferential market access in Australia under various regional trade agreements. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 80 All graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs should secure preferential market access in the European Union\u2019s second-best preferential trade regime, GSP+, which allows duty-free access in 66 percent of tariff lines. Accessing the GSP+ scheme requires AP LDCs to ratify and implement 32 prespecified international conventions. Graduating countries should prepare to comply with these requirements. If necessary, graduating countries can seek assistance from various international organizations in terms of legal and institutional frameworks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0094bebe-7e97-4a60-a0a5-185d91264f79": {"__data__": {"id_": "0094bebe-7e97-4a60-a0a5-185d91264f79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d175a657edbd655409e02602e36bad2f0041c5b5b23813970646a40cc052095c"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f662829-3217-4837-af56-57debfd49a7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de6f10cab18543ed3432e20928c9665d42983d58c713fbc0cdb20b539e86b758"}}, "hash": "7472d0eba4a06c2032203436c8a4e0ef544b172e880e37f4743ecc45cf4eb226", "text": "Graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs must engage with their trading partners for favourable terms for post- graduation preferential trade regimes and, where possible, negotiate LDC-like treatment.

China also provided a similar transitional arrangement to Samoa. Additionally, under a specific SAFTA provision, India allowed the Maldives to maintain LDC-specific conditions. After graduation, Bangladesh should negotiate with India to receive the same treatment. l Many LDCs continue to experience a high level of economic vulnerability, especially small island developing states. Landlocked AP LDCs and waterlocked Pacific SIDS LDCs have structural disadvantages and excessively high trading costs. These factors have led to delayed LDC graduation. Under these circumstances, GSP donor countries can be approached to grant extended transition periods for LDC-specific preferences for small island and landlocked LDCs. l Graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs, along with other LDCs, should engage with the European Union for relaxed terms in its proposed 2024-2034 GSP, specifically in terms of its demanding rules of origin requirements for GSP+ countries. Given the limited productive capacities of the graduating LDCs, complying with double-stage transformation RoO provisions in textile and clothing and a 50 percent value addition for other items will be a major challenge, restricting graduated LDCs\u2019 ability to utilise GSP preferences. Therefore, graduating countries should collectively request that the European Union apply EBA-type liberal RoO terms for a longer transition period. l Rules of origin requirements are more stringent for non-LDC developing countries under almost every GSP arrangement; domestic value-added requirements have been as high as 50 percent. Graduating LDCs should approach preference granting countries to lower RoO thresholds. This is especially important under global value chain-driven international trade flows, which have considerably diminished the scope of adding domestic value to exports. l According to the proposed European Union GSP for 2024-2034, Bangladesh\u2019s apparel exports will be subject to safeguard measures and lose preferential access in the European Union. This provision could put Bangladesh in a unique situation where it can qualify for GSP+, yet its most important export item will be outside of any preferences. Bangladesh should therefore engage with the European Union to obtain a waiver to safeguard its preferences. Any European Union safeguard measure would greatly assist Bangladesh in making a smooth graduation. l Asia-Pacific LDCs should also petition the United Kingdom government, which is developing its own GSP regime, for a longer transition period, a generous post-graduation preferential scheme, and simplified RoO requirements. Graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs must consider their options for bilateral and regional free trade agreements to maintain duty-free market access for their exports. Irrespective of their LDC status, some AP LDCs can access preferential market conditions through bilateral and regional free trade agreements. For example, Pacific Island LDCs will benefit from duty free access in Australia and New Zealand under PACER Plus. Furthermore, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar will remain eligible for duty-free access for most exports in Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea through the regional trading arrangements with ASEAN (such as the ASEAN-India FTA and RCEP). Other graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs should consider accessing the RCEP to secure LDC-like preferences in major markets, such as Australia, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. After graduation, Bangladesh, under SAFTA, can only access the limited non-LDC preference in India. However, a bilateral FTA with India can help secure LDC-like export market access. Graduating LDCs can explore further options for Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 81 negotiating and signing bilateral FTAs with their most important export partners to maintain favourable market access after graduation. The recently implemented European Union-Viet Nam FTA can serve as an example of securing improved access in important markets. For graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs, the significance of building trade policy and negotiation capacity is more prominent than ever. Many AP LDCs have mainstreamed trade in their development strategies. Nevertheless, huge capacity gaps continue to exist. Graduation could imply more rigorous trade negotiations at various regional and multilateral forums, including the WTO. In addition, moving from unilateral LDC preference schemes to reciprocity- based bilateral, regional, and multilateral negotiations means graduating AP LDCs must assess the implications of their commitments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "395cd74a-3b91-402e-91e9-c65949cff0ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "395cd74a-3b91-402e-91e9-c65949cff0ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c23f3559ec1ae111d6d78f8ef5371bc42af6f670b457bc7e7de1ca9bf108142a"}, "2": {"node_id": "7164d884-f4b9-4718-892e-8a1475e45b34", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1102252327efd4808be69a0c05f40abc52ecbcbffeb47fe94a7ad47c0d429785"}}, "hash": "b32715e8e81dcf19553e757c6a333d79d41f78a8f3e168d19622365ee7ff5f69", "text": "Undertaking required domestic reform measures to comply with trade agreements will also depend on enhanced capacity at various levels.

Graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs should collectively endeavour to retain the WTO\u2019s LDC Services Waiver preferences for a longer transition period. Graduates will lose preferences under the Waiver, which is not effectively operationalized. This is a missed opportunity, as several AP LDCs are scheduled to graduate before the effective implementation of services preferences. Therefore, access to the LDC Services Waiver should be extended for graduating countries for ten years or more after graduation. 5.2 MEASURES FOR GREATER ACCESS AND UTILIZATION OF CONCESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE In the transition period leading to LDC graduation and beyond, the need for concessional development finance is critical. Although no drastic changes in aid allocation and conditionalities are anticipated, each country should consider its own context and realities in terms of any transition from grants to concessional finance; countries should also examine the likely implications of changes to interest rates, years to maturity, and grace periods. Several other general recommendations for graduating AP LDCs to consider are included below. Asia-Pacific LDCs should improve their absorptive capacity to use of all available ODA and concessional finance. In some countries, sustained economic growth has somewhat reduced the relative significance of ODA (as a proportion of GNI). But given the socioeconomic challenges, vulnerabilities, and limited domestic revenue mobilization capacity of AP LDCs, ODA remains an important source of development finance, particularly for Pacific Island LDCs. Because of a lack of absorptive capacities for resource utilization, aid disbursements are often slower than commitments. Most AP LDCs should improve their administrative and project management efficiency to speed up the funds release process and its effective utilization. Delayed procedures and unutilized resources mean AP LDCs are not making the most of available international support measures before graduation. Development partners can also help build absorptive capacity in AP LDCs through technical assistance. Graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs should look for opportunities to use LDC-related development financing mechanisms more extensively to aid firm-level preparedness and overall economic competitiveness. These financing mechanisms include assistance received from the EIF for institutional and capacity building support, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) for supplemental capital assistance through grants and loans, the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) for climate change adaptations, and the United Nations Technology Bank for LDCs. The extended transition periods offered under these schemes mean upcoming graduates like Bhutan, the Solomon Islands, Bangladesh, Lao PDR, and Nepal still have five to ten years to benefit from available funding. These countries should plan to utilize these schemes to the fullest. These funds\u2019 resources bases are limited, and, in most cases, there is a cap or maximum resource allocation for any individual country. Given graduating AP LDCs\u2019 imminent development challenges, development partners and UN system agencies should allocate more resources to graduating LDCs. New instruments to support graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs should be explored at the international level. The UNCDP proposed a graduation support facility to provide technical assistance for graduating LDCs. This would help prepare AP LDCs for graduation and facilitate South\u2013South knowledge sharing on graduation (WTO and EIF, 2020) by providing important technical and capacity building support to graduating and Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 82 graduated countries. Furthermore, under the global Aid for Trade initiative, trade-related adjustment support is an important pillar of assistance. Graduating AP LDCs can collectively ask for a larger allocation from this source to support their graduation process and focus such support on trade-related capacity building. Graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs should approach ODA donor countries for increased aid allocations. AP LDCs should negotiate with bilateral and multilateral donors to keep ODA terms and conditions unchanged for a transition period after graduation. Development partners should also prioritise graduating and newly graduated countries in their aid allocations. This can be an effective way to support development transitions in some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries. Debt management should be a priority consideration for all graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs. Debt distress could hamper development gains after LDC graduation. Several AP LDCs are at moderate to high risk of external debt distress.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "350af959-8a48-4e9b-8938-1e6598fbd693": {"__data__": {"id_": "350af959-8a48-4e9b-8938-1e6598fbd693", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "150cca9aabd33d9ae203710f97d2ac66b7271fabcdaa022df351e0842a5e4054"}, "2": {"node_id": "cfbfbdb5-3f15-4edf-8e98-684800f55514", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8716934a94161742aad4a7004b0f4053d162899b6b01f0b94865f11919e4a3e2"}}, "hash": "e58bd1ab37d889c45a2965f6ff444386838d2cc2e0c4255a398f12fa76acff66", "text": "Several AP LDCs are at moderate to high risk of external debt distress.

Foreign direct investment is a powerful tool for domestic investment efforts and attracting it crucial for export success in Asia-Pacific LDCs. Many Asian emerging countries, such as China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam, provide evidence of the importance of FDI for boosting exports and promoting export diversification. The direct impacts of FDI include skill upgrading, productivity increases, positive knowledge and technology spillover effects, and improved management practices. Spillover effects can also benefit local businesses, allowing them to upgrade their operations and facilitate enhanced participation in GVCs. FDI also can accelerate AP LDCs\u2019 development efforts and support SDG achievement. Landlocked AP and Pacific Island LDCs that have small domestic markets and are subject to remoteness and high trade costs can find it difficult to attract FDI; improving their investment climate can mitigate this problem. Therefore, development partners should also consider providing additional support to improve AP LDC\u2019s ability to attract FDI. Many graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs need to improve their domestic resource mobilization capacities. Inadequate resource mobilization, both domestically and internationally, severely inhibits AP LDCs\u2019 ability to invest in a wide range of areas that affect SDG achievement. Limited tax revenue is an issue that particularly affects AP LDCs, because their governments lack the budgetary space needed to fund large-scale physical infrastructure projects, improve health care, and increase social protection spending. Ideally, domestically mobilized resources should play a bigger role in development financing as countries make socioeconomic progress. In many AP LDCs, this would require tax and fiscal sector reforms along with tax-collection system modernization. Graduating AP LDCs should use graduation as an opportunity to boost domestic resource mobilization efforts by strengthening relevant institutional capacity and broadening tax nets. 5.3 DEALING WITH GENERAL DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES LDC graduation is \u2018the first milestone in the marathon of development\u2019 (UNCTAD, 2016). Therefore, AP LDCs must continue to focus on their development priorities and stride toward many more challenging milestones ahead. Productive capacity development will remain central to development objectives in graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs. Despite improvements already made, productive capacity in AP LDCs requires further policy attention and support measures to ameliorate low or stagnating investment, infrastructure deficits, skilled labour shortages, inefficient institutions, and other deficiencies. Most AP LDC economies badly need productive jobs for their populations, especially young people. Their structural transformation and moves away from primary activities to manufacturing and modern services have been far from encouraging. Capacity development is critical for successful structural transformation and long-term growth, therefore graduating AP LDCs require significant investment for skills training, supply-side and trade capacity building, infrastructure development, and technological adaption. Graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs should consider strategies for moving up the global value chain. In most AP LDCS, the primary sectors dominate economic activities, including exports. Basic primary products and services cannot generate adequate value, and countries have ample room to develop domestic backward Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 83 and forward linkages. Graduating AP LDCs need to upgrade their production and processing capabilities to improve efficiency and competitiveness; they also need to produce more diversified and complex products. For example, certain AP LDCs, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Myanmar, have already somewhat developed their domestic manufacturing capacities in textiles and clothing. However, textile and clothing exporters from this region are largely focused on cut, make, and trim activities, which are at the lowest end of textile and apparel GVCs (Razzaque, 2022).Therefore, industrial upgradation in these countries remains important to increase the amount of domestic value- added in their apparel and other exports, thus improving competitiveness and complying with RoO requirements. These and other graduating AP LDCs should move up and to different GVC stages through backward and forward linkages, which will require government support, firm-level adaptation initiatives, and international support for technological upgradation and knowledge transfer. As ESG issues are becoming increasingly prominent in global commerce and investment, graduating Asia-Pacific LDCs should not compromise on their medium- to long-term growth and development prospects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbbc0651-4e03-4185-b3fa-47579c378ae4": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbbc0651-4e03-4185-b3fa-47579c378ae4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0d263fc4d151efe0298a199da05aa72ec4b69f6abbad539b66c1a8609e7e1a3"}, "2": {"node_id": "4aede525-79c6-4413-bf52-9e43cdd65628", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3672d4e52dc35e2e42f82699184b5f2807751429d6ac81c42aaa272ed63d5e6"}}, "hash": "d437849bba4a0899ffa86a0a708c4514b41fa46c169edd5bbc993f61a799f8f8", "text": "Promoting a country as a legitimate and responsible sourcing destination is critical for importers to increase compliance with environmental norms, improve resource efficiency, and move toward more circular production processes.

Tel: +1 212 906-5000 Fax: +1 212 906-5898 Introduction Why this report? UNDP\u2019s Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific (RBAP) seeks to build the foundations for more forward-looking and inclusive policy-making by gathering alternative perspectives for policy and programme ideation. Its explorations of links between anticipation, imagination and policy builds off the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s report on \u201cOur Common Agenda\u201d (2021), which looks ahead to the next 25 years of the UN and presents a vision for inclusive, networked and effective multilateralism that serves both present and future generations.1 The report asks us to think big, for time is of the essence, and the choices in front of us all \u2013 if we are to protect our planet and the future of human life \u2013 are stark. Our work as UNDP RBAP builds on these exhortations, and honours the Secretary-General\u2019s commitment to listen to youth, to leave no one behind and to invest in strategic foresight. This synthesis report brings together insights from foresight research and imagination processes to invite reflection on what is emerging in a world of uncertainty. It intentionally places traditionally siloed forms of knowledge and expertise in conversation to elicit thinking on possible development trajectories and emergent risks and opportunities for the region. Specifically, it offers visions and hopes from youth and civil society across the Asia-Pacific region, interwoven with analyses and recommendations from leading academic global experts on human rights, decolonization, risks, long-term thinking and equity in digital cooperation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d451a30d-3bb1-4f4a-b735-73325d19fccd": {"__data__": {"id_": "d451a30d-3bb1-4f4a-b735-73325d19fccd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-synthesis-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reimagining Development in Asia and the Pacific: A Synthesis Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-synthesis-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df17c0ee82a5eadbbfb68c72fad366038179506336726f50a52268c66ccc0254"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd6b8149-b450-4b40-8250-3c114927c4aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-synthesis-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54932027c65bb4afd6486cb730905e82dbd71c29c7a5cc3cd7b97ad4732dbf14"}}, "hash": "ed4118eb63d0aeb6c4bb10dd6ff6332b42f37bacaf38c0f8883e13ade2285c07", "text": "REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC A SYNTHESIS REPORT INTRODUCTION 4 Building blocks to anticipate and reimagine development futures The aspirations and provocations are the culmination of an \u201cInclusive Imaginaries\u201d initiative that UNDP RBAP conducted with UNDP Accelerator Labs and Youth Co-Labs in late 2021, as well as four \u201cforesight briefs\u201d prepared by multi-disciplinary subject experts.

These forward-looking research papers offer perspectives on several emerging development trends or inflection points of significance to development pathways in the region. The briefs take a long-term perspective to identify the uncertainties and possibilities that might transform the social paradigms and planetary realities of futures in Asia and the Pacific, as well as the implications of the assumptions, choices and values that societies prioritize today. The topics and key questions for each brief are summarized below. \u2022 New Categories of Rights, by Sushma Raman, Executive Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University: The complex changes in our world are calling for an expansion of traditional notions of rights. Increased focus on our planetary obligations, on digital futures, on greater equity and on future generations \u2013 how then must these evolve for the challenges of our futures? What are new forms of rights that we must pay attention to and what policy implications does this lead to for their future? Full brief here. \u2022 Indigenous Futures, by Michelle Lee Brown, PhD, Assistant Professor, Indigenous Knowledge, Data Sovereignty and Decolonization at Washington State University: How can future development paradigms learn from and be informed by Indigenous concepts of sustainable development? How might Indigenous futures inform and transform how sustainable development is considered, contrived and implemented? What are different measures of \u201csustainable development\u201d or \u201cflourishing\u201d that are grounded in different lenses of Indigenous knowledge and practice from across the Asia-Pacific region? Full brief here. INTRODUCTION 5 \u2022 Polycrisis and long-term thinking by Caroline Baylon, Risk Management and Foresight Consultant, and Sophia Robele, Consultant, UNDP: The increased pace of globalization has brought with it a slew of new, complex and often interconnected risks, some of which threaten society\u2019s very existence. Solving these complex problems and the heightened uncertainty they bring will require new modes of long-term and cross-disciplinary thinking. What types of risk assessment, policy measures, governance and development programmes are needed to put long-term thinking into practice in the face of increasingly uncertain futures? Full brief here. \u2022 Can Digital Public Goods Deliver More Equitable Futures? by Urvashi Aneja, PhD, Founding Director of the Digital Futures Lab: What are equitable digital public goods and how can they enable sustainable development that does not reinforce existing inequities? While it is important to build a digital infrastructure that can accelerate development gains, how can this be done without locking in a particular vision of our digital development futures, one that is deeply contested and raises complex issues around governance and accountability? How can \u201copen\u201d digital systems support positive developmental outcomes and not reproduce social inequities and create new unintended harms? Full brief here. INCLUSIVE IMAGINARIES While futures thinking and academic research of possible development trajectories can help to extend the timeframes and systemic lens through which policy actors make decisions, the work of shaping more just and equitable futures calls for more than anticipating what might happen, to expanding the spaces within which diverse change agents can imagine, articulate and build consensus around their desired collective futures, as a compass for orienting action. The sources of knowledge we generally use to build on policy and programmes emerges from a small group of stakeholders that have either historically been in positions of power or are considered \u201cexperts\u201d owing to their academic knowledge. To work towards building more locally driven and culturally contextual visions of our futures, there is a need to prioritise collaborations that make space for diverse citizens to voice their aspirations and surface inherent knowledge within development processes, in order to help shift the status quo. It is with this intention that UNDP RBAP, supported by Poppy Seed Labs, developed the \u201cInclusive Imaginaries\u201d initiative. The process and toolkit combines ethnographic research, design approaches, storytelling and role-playing to support development actors and communities in elevating the role of imagination and futures-oriented thinking within participatory planning processes. INTRODUCTION 6 With the UNDP Accelerator Labs and Youth Co-Labs, RBAP piloted the process with country offices in Fiji, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines and Samoa between October- December 2021, with an initial focus on youth and civil society.

The Case for Reimagining A global polycrisis Since the mid 20th century, the accelerating pace of industrialization and globalization has ushered in a range of new, cascading, interconnected and even existential risks for humans and for our planet. These risks include but are not limited to biotechnology advances that can lead to manmade pandemics, to superintelligent AI that transcends human\u2019s ability to direct it and to climate emergencies. The impact of cascading, interconnected risks are leading to what is known as a global polycrisis \u2013 defined as \u201cany combination of three or more interacting systemic risks with the potential to cause a cascading, runaway failure of Earth\u2019s natural and social systems that irreversibly and catastrophically degrades humanity\u2019s prospects.\u201d2 The climate emergency is the most defining crisis of our time and a pressing issue. Despite the talk of political will and the need for swift action, its risks continue to accelerate in severity. \u201cFour thousand generations could live and die before the carbon dioxide released from the Industrial Revolution to today is scrubbed from our atmosphere, and yet decision-makers continue to subsidize fossil fuels, prolonging our carbon habit like a drug running through the economy\u2019s veins,\u201d wrote UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner in the foreword of the 2020 UNDP Human Development Report, which offers an antidote to paralysis in the face of rising inequalities alongside alarming planetary change caused by the Anthropocene.3 REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC A SYNTHESIS REPORT THE CASE FOR REIMAGINING 8 Most recognize, however, that we are not doing enough fast enough. In the closing plenary of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, Asad Rehman, climate justice leader and executive director of War on Want, eviscerated world leaders: \u201cThe richest have ignored every moral and political call to do their fair share. Their broken promises are littered across 26 COPs,\u201d he said, decrying \u201cempty press releases drafted by polluting companies [that] no longer fool anyone.\u201d4 Beyond the threat of individual risks, we now face new scales of uncertainty from the convergence of multiple existential crises. The interconnected nature of these risks means that failure in one arena can trigger a series of cascading shocks and failures \u2013 and where the results are unpredictable and possibly disastrous. As noted in the 2020 Human Development Report, \u201cIn the natural sciences \u2013 and more recently in the social sciences \u2013 people have realized that patterns that seem random on the surface may have a complex structure, resulting in surprising, abrupt shifts and cascades of change that are not easily recognizable or fully predictable, posing challenges for governance.\u201d5 Climate change has cascading effects on other risks such as pandemics, poverty and inequality and armed conflict. Extreme weather events can cause a decline in crop yields, harming farmers\u2019 livelihoods and impacting food supply, causing malnutrition and poor health. This affects labour productivity and economic growth. Poverty results in social unrest; in some cases this can unseat a government. Conflict, if protracted, causes more poverty which then perpetuates the cycle of conflict. The risks exist not just at a macro, planetary scale, but in our quotidian daily interactions as well, in large part due to the nature of our increasingly digital lives and the infrastructure they run on. THE CASE FOR REIMAGINING 9 Technological advances \u2013 opportunities or risk amplifiers? The choices at hand and new modes of governance called for to mitigate the effects of increasingly interconnected, volatile and uncertain risks is illustrated in particular by the widely varied digital futures that might unfold.

One key factor is that, in many cases, those who are developing and/or operating civic infrastructure for digital technologies may not be oriented to the public good. This raises new and complex questions for governance and accountability regarding the use of market-driven solutions and the public-private partnerships around them. Market- driven solutions are shaped by market incentives and may not prioritize equity and public well-being. There are as yet limited mechanisms to ensure and enforce their allegiance to the public good. The issue of equity in digital governance is an emerging risk in Asia where nearly 52 percent of Asia\u2019s 4.3 billion people are offline and denied access to the promises of the digital age and new technological innovations. Tiziana Bonapace, Director of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, warned that the digital divide in the Asia-Pacific region could become the \u201cnew face of inequality\u201d in the region.6 Many current digital harms, such as privacy violations or monopolistic market practices, stem from the market incentives driving technology companies and from the lack of adequate safeguards and accountability mechanisms. THE CASE FOR REIMAGINING 10 Implications for risk analysis and governance Given the rate at which interconnected risks can become compounded and trigger new tipping points for existential risks and a global polycrisis, timely and bold action is needed. This includes the need for more anticipatory policy measures that can harness and equalize the future benefits and mitigate the future harm of socio-technological innovation, as illustrated by the risks associated with continued digital evolution in the absence of necessary governance evolutions to establish new principles and standards. It is important to ensure all people have access to safe, reliable essential infrastructure \u2013 digital and civic \u2013 so as to not compound the risks of existing vulnerabilities and carry forward past systems of harm into our futures. Despite widespread acknowledgement of the need for urgent action, we lack proven practices and extensive experience in addressing interconnected and systemic risks. Conventional risk management practices have evolved based on learning from past disasters. When new risks emerge, experts generally analyse the new risk, find ways to limit its damage, then incorporate the lessons learned from the experience for next time. With existential risks, however, there may not be a next time. It is not just that we need new technical approaches and assessment frameworks for understanding and managing risk, but equally new paradigms through which to make decisions that balance current and future needs, particularly when dealing with complex and uncertain trade-offs. We can reimagine development to be more future-fit by calling into question the frameworks undergirding how we think and act, and propose new approaches that enable inclusive, sustainable thriving. Making space for \u201cnew\u201d ways of thinking and working The responsibility to reimagine development is shared across history and actors \u2013 many development approaches have been shaped by a paradigm that does not serve much of humanity or the planet, as is becoming increasingly clear. As we explore new orientations to realize the development futures we seek, it is important to proceed with humility, and recognize that traditional experts cannot be the only ones to forge a new path. New possibilities for change can come from their broad-based and radical collaboration with voices across disciplines, cultures and generations. Part of this \u201creimagining\u201d is also a returning: a recognition that inclusive development paradigms of the future must also mine the wisdom of the past and present. This includes returning to the aspirations and guidance of traditional development thinkers like THE CASE FOR REIMAGINING 11 Amartya Sen and Mahbub ul-Haqi, whose philosophies not only reman relevant today, but increasingly urgent for confronting the underlying drivers of risks and challenges to come. The resonance between the priorities and concerns of youth across Asia and the Pacific spotlighted in this report, and the pathways for sustainable development offered by such thought leaders call us to consider: Have we lost our way from original development philosophies? Where should our reorientation focus not only on imagining some of our paths anew, but more deeply examining the barriers that have impeded the translation of long-held values and development traditions into policy decisions and implementation?

Globalization has yielded extreme inequality, and the profits from industrialization have been concentrated in the Global North. A study from Global Financial Integrity and the Centre for Applied Research at the Norwegian School of Economics found that the flow of money from rich countries to poor countries pales in comparison to the flow that runs in the other direction. In 2012, the last year of recorded data, developing countries received a total of $1.3 tn, including all aid, investment and income from abroad. But that same year some $3.3 tn flowed out of them.7 As anthropologist Jason Hickel has observed, \u201cWhat this means is that the usual development narrative has it backwards. Aid is effectively flowing in reverse. Rich countries aren\u2019t developing poor countries; poor countries are developing rich ones.\u201d8 Poor countries have paid for the extravagance of rich countries, and now the costs threaten human and planetary life as we know it. Global disasters, from climate change to pandemics, thrive in the cracks in society, exploiting and exacerbating myriad inequalities in development. As the costs compound and the landscape of risks evolve, so too must the ways we conceive of the values that underpin mainstream development models. For example, freedom, as the development philosopher Dr. A.K. Shiva Kumar has said, \u201cmeans protection from the risks that people experience every day.\u201d9 Yet, freedom will also mean protection from the risks that people will experience in the future. How might we better orient our decision-making frames and prioritization processes to navigate the needs and desires of both present and future generations? Development norms that prioritize the immediate at the expense of the future, including through processes that fail to give voice to many visions for the future, serve to perpetuate the inequity and exclusion we seek to address. Strategies only based on technical, sector- and issue-based knowledge have proven insufficient in the face of the polycrisis. New approaches are called for so that we can reimagine what development means, and how it can be achieved. i Consider the seminal human development publications Development as Freedom (1999) by Amartya Sen, Reflections on Human Development (1995) by Mahbub ul-Haq, or the Handbook of Human Development (2009) edited by A.K. Shiva Kumar and Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, among others. Imperatives for Reimagining Development Principles for reimagined paradigms As the intersections among new risks, old patterns of inequity and outdated ideologies driving innovation underscore, the governance shifts needed to realize more sustainable, inclusive and resilient futures in the Asia-Pacific region require broader examination of the principles and values that determine many development decisions and investments. This section offers some pathways for this re-examination, to help advance how development actors conceive of, prioritize, resource and enact development policy in the Asia-Pacific region. Many of the \u201creimagined paradigms\u201d presented here are not new, but rather inspired by philosophies and development practices that already exist among many communities and epistemologies in Asia and the Pacific, as well as in the paradigms of development philosophers like Amartya Sen and Mahbub ul-Haq. This includes, for example, the basic tenants of the human development approach, as anchored in Amartya Sen\u2019s work on human capabilities, which conceptualizes development as namely concerned with \u201cadvancing the richness of human life, rather than the richness of the economy in which human beings live,\u201d and measures the success of a society \u201cprimarily by the substantive freedoms that the members of that society enjoy.\u201d 10\u201411 REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC A SYNTHESIS REPORT IMPERATIvES FOR REIMAGINING DEvELOPMENT 13 Likewise, many Indigenous traditions are important sources of knowledge on what reimagined development practice rooted in concepts of both agency and interconnectedness might look like.

These pathways were developed for the Asia-Pacific region, directly drawn from insights identified by both the youth-led Inclusive Imaginaries and the subject expert-led foresight briefs, but their lessons also apply to other political and development contexts. UPDATING DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORKS 1. Reconsider traditional definitions of development and expand them to include the role of people\u2019s and nature\u2019s well-being in advancing collective progress. For over a half century, the most widely accepted measure of a country\u2019s economic condition has been gross domestic product (GDP). In 1942, annual estimates of gross national product were introduced in the United States to complement the estimates of national income and to facilitate wartime planning. After the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, GDP became the main tool for measuring a country\u2019s economy.

The United Nations has long championed the notion of human rights being an integral part of human development and central to governments\u2019 commitment to inclusive development. Since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, much has changed in the world. Recent years have seen countries across Asia passing restrictive legislation or using internet shutdowns to restrict existing rights, such as freedom of assembly, association and expression. Rights focus on the needs of the most vulnerable and dispossessed; they are a universal language; and concentrate on a range of capabilities, freedom and opportunities required for all of us to thrive. In light of new and emerging challenges, we need to renew our commitment to rights and to develop our conceptions of them. New, urgent debates around reframing and evolving rights are happening as a result of the digitization of our private lives and of our public infrastructure. Robust discourses on advancing the protection of rights in the digital spheres are called for as technologies are rapidly evolving and also being misused. This push is important for a larger rethinking of human rights, but should expand beyond the topic of rights in the digital sphere to account for other new risks to the planet and to global citizens. To address the emerging challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region, Sushma Raman (2022) offers three areas of rights that merit more substantive consideration: 1) Rights for Creating More Just Economic Futures: The right for all citizens to live free from corruption is a new right that can play a transformative role in advancing economic rights and equity. 2) Rights for Respecting Our Planetary Obligations and the Rights of Future Generations: Establishing the rights of Nature, as a counterweight to our societies\u2019 incentives to tax our planet past its boundaries, and the rights of future generations can be transformative in ensuring equitable and sustainable development. 3) Rights for Building Digitally Inclusive and Deliberative Societies: Winners and losers in the digital era

Among these were visions of a unique, locally sustainable model of tourism that prioritizes the needs of local communities, culture and the environment, even at the expense of popular (and profitable) models of mass tourism.

We are facing unprecedented environmental challenges, yet we still have the time and capability to prevent the most devastating outcomes and to forestall interconnected systemic and existential risk. It is imperative that we address these perils and uncertainties before they snowball to a point where they will be impossible to deal with. If we do not sufficiently curb greenhouse gas emissions, for example, we will reach a point after which it will no longer be able to stop runaway climate change. If we do not establish new protections for people\u2019s digital access and security, we open the door for governments to surveil and oppress their people. The COvID-19 pandemic, for example, has served as a pretext for increased mass surveillance in many countries. Reversing these programmes is much more difficult than preventing them. What can we do? One path forward is to develop and test new assessment frameworks and risk mitigation mechanisms that enable a better understanding of the downstream impacts of systemic and existential risks, where there is high degree of uncertainty, unknowns and unknown unknowns.

In Wales, the role was enshrined in law to ensure its permanency. \u2022 Think Tanks for Lawmakers: Some countries have established think tanks within their legislative bodies (Finland\u2019s Parliamentary Committee for the Future and Scotland\u2019s Futures Forum) to provide critical input into policymaking. \u2022 Constitutional Amendments: In recent years, several countries have incorporated anticipatory, long-term thinking into law, by updating their constitutions to reflect their responsibility to future generations.

Colonialism has erased manifold generations of familiarity with specific territories that prioritized localized, site- specific knowledge critical to flourishing. \u201cIndigenous futures work connects past to present and potential futures, defined here as cyclical processes of balanced flourishing that are deeply place-based, and include human and nonhuman well-being \u2013 especially native flora and fauna, lands and waters.

This continues processes of extraction and erasure that Indigenous communities, and many scholars in the Global South, have long experienced. Thus, as development institutions continue to draw upon different knowledge traditions, it is important to acknowledge the sources they build upon and to halt the patterns of co-option and dilution that the development sector has long perpetuated. ii This body of work recognizes that Indigenous communities are not monolithic, and yet when we refer to Indigenous philosophies and practices, we acknowledge that there are common elements of their worldviews, as articulated by Dr. Michelle Lee Brown. Namely, that they are ontologically relational, that they have cyclical or fluid views of time, and that while they embrace epistemological pluralism, core values of reciprocity and collective stewardship lie at their core.

Insights from the Inclusive Imaginaries process suggest an ardent aspiration among youth to explore and re-imagine traditional Filipino culture to uncover traditions that can inform approaches to sustainable development and governance accountability. Spanish and American colonization had a profound influence on Filipino culture \u2014and young people are eager to call outside influences into question and to reclaim traditions from precolonial times. \u201cYoung Filipinos want to assert identities beyond the melting pot of \u2018Imperial Manila\u2019, which has brought forth a yearning and a need to look further back into Indigenous sources of knowledge and cultural artifacts,\u201d noted an observer of the process. Beyond ongoing efforts to reduce emissions and promote renewable energy, there is an increasing desire to honour Indigenous knowledge of the environment and ensure climate justice for the most vulnerable populations. As one young person said, \u201cWe want to root all actions (for healthy communities) in cultural heritages, like that of the Badjaos [an Indigenous ethnic group from the southern part of the Philippines that practices a sea-based nomadic lifestyle]. They have so much knowledge that we can use.\u201d 6. Embrace a framework of relational ethics, which builds on Asian and Pacific Islander collectivist values. Constructs borne from individualism (which sees humans as rational equals, divorced from their social context and in pursuit of maximizing their interests) have become the basis for many policy frameworks that reinforce inequities, such as the centrality of capitalism as an orienting framework for dominant economic systems. This has privileged the profit of a few at the expense of the majority, and without regard to environmental damage. Another example is the notion of property rights: \u201ca construct which says I am an individual, my home is my castle and the value of that land is mine.\u201d20 This ownership-driven model undermines stewardship-driven relationships to land, or incentives to invest in shared public goods.

This can begin by \u201cre-rooting\u201d our thinking in Asian and Pacific philosophical lineages that emphasize collectivism above individualism and that centre relational ethics.

In Laos, reflections spoke to the hope for \u201csolidarity within the community and the willingness of the government to preserve [local] traditions.\u201d Insights also underscored the untapped potential of many value systems to reshape conceptions of governance and development policy. In the Philippines, for example, the Filipino concept of Bayanihan, or the spirit of civic unity and cooperation, is an important organizing principle for redefining rights and setting development policy. Yet it is also important to guard against the flattening of cultural values, and of blind celebration and adoption of tradition. Recommendations called for a critical assessment of how governments can draw upon historical, existing and place-based knowledge to build a robust, context-appropriate development policy. IMPERATIvES FOR REIMAGINING DEvELOPMENT 26 JUSTICE-ORIENTED ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS 7. Prevent injustices from being encoded into and compounded by digital infrastructure. The COvID-19 pandemic put the spotlight back on global public goods, but the politics of globalization and ethical murkiness around the governance of public-private partnerships have yielded great disparities in their accessibility, raising important questions about just how global and how public these goods actually are. This is particularly true of digital public goods. Due to the comparatively limited capacity to effectively absorb and deploy technology talent in the public sector, and the much lower pay scale, in many countries, much of the top tech capacity sits within the private sector. As a result, there is limited technical capacity for interrogating the ethics, managing the risks and providing strong oversight of technology companies. Many governments also have limited ability to counter the \u201cethics- washing\u201d of technology companies, since most elected officials and civil servants lack technical knowledge on how technology platforms operate. Thus they struggle to identify gaps between rhetoric and reality when it comes to protecting citizens\u2019 rights online. It is imperative to implement regulatory structures and oversight mechanisms to ensure innovations in digital technologies truly serve all people, thereby ensuring the promise of the digital age is equally accessible to all. Doing so takes careful investment and input from a range of stakeholders, such as ethicists, social workers, care workers and those representing the most marginalized communities. Yet it is precisely these perspectives that are largely absent from existing conversations, because of the speed of technological innovation and the incentives of larger corporations. More voices, especially of those advocating for the needs of those with the least purchasing power, can only slow down the process and possibly threaten the potential of increased earnings quarter-on-quarter. \u201cWe need to develop alternative ethical frameworks grounded in values of relationality and interconnectedness to steer innovation trajectories toward the public good. [...] As we chart our digital development futures, it is vital that we unpack the ethical frameworks driving dominant innovation trajectories and explore alternative value paradigms. The conversation around digital public goods must start at this question of ethics and values. Technical standards and software principles are only a means to realize the public good \u2013they should not be a way to lock-in or foreclose value- based contestations around what constitutes the public good.\u201d 21 Urvashi Aneja, PhD Director, Digital Futures Lab IMPERATIvES FOR REIMAGINING DEvELOPMENT 27 INCLUSIVE IMAGINARIES: \u201cLEAVE NO ONE BEHIND\u201d There is much anxiety about the impact of the \u201cMeta world\u201d in exacerbating social inequities.

Correct the unjust distribution of negative externalities and risks Cross-country income inequality is estimated to be 25 percent higher because of climate change.22 When new shocks are overlaid atop existing, intersecting horizontal inequalities, they reinforce and broaden patterns of disempowerment among already marginalized groups. This convergence between new uncertainties triggered by increasingly systemic risks with pre-existing inequalities risks widens socio-economic disparities. It suggests a blind spot and the exigency, within current risk accounting methods and development strategies, to integrate justice as a lens through which to understand and rectify the imbalanced distribution of the negative externalities of development across countries and populations. One aspect of this justice-led lens includes re-examination of the ahistorical lens through which many risk frameworks are currently constructed, which fail to identify the actors or countries most responsible for harm or risks borne from processes of globalization, and the groups or geographies who bear the primary burden of their downstream impacts. This in part calls for new conceptualizations of \u201cresponsibility\u201d that take a more intergenerational perspective. It also demands a greater willingness to examine the intentions and assumptions that drive decision-making for development, and the ways that decisions are shaped by larger structures of power that are often reinforced by perceptions of policy frameworks or of choices being neutral or objective, or of socio-economic-environmental inequities being random phenomena. As global public health giant Paul Farmer once wrote, \u201cIf assaults on dignity are anything but random in distribution or course, whose interests are served by the suggestion that they are haphazard?\u201d23 The universalized \u201cwe\u201d has often erased the greater harms and burdens of institutionalized injustice faced by historically oppressed communities. Recognizing the structural violence that has been inflicted in many parts of the Global South in the name of globalization and \u201cdevelopment,\u201d development agencies can advocate for new approaches, such as transitional justice, to provide redress to victims and to create pathways to transform the political, sociocultural and economic structures that have enabled and sustained the injustices. Conclusion These priorities arising from the outcomes of both academic expert research and imagination- driven consultations speak to the overarching significance of creating safe spaces for imagining development implementation pathways anew\u2014and for finding meaningful ways to integrate them into policymaking. Against an evolving development landscape \u2013 with greater uncertainty, new risks and new threats to justice and equity on the horizon \u2013 the continuation of old processes driving decision-making and action have pointed to the strong bias towards what exists, and the power structures that protect the status quo. Part of the work deconstructing these power structures and making room for more inclusive, sustainable and flourishing futures in Asia and the Pacific is re-examining the sources of wisdom that inform mainstream development thinking. While this report has profiled a limited set of insights that can offer starting points for further discourse, research and policy directions, its approach to deriving insights \u2013 e.g. examining emergent signals of change that may create tipping points for drastically different futures, making space for imagination and for the voices of youth, blending academic knowledge with lived experience, among others \u2013 is equally important. It suggests that moving towards more future-oriented development paradigms calls for delving more extensively into the values, epistemologies, desires and experiences of the region\u2019s diverse communities in the present as well as philosophies of the past.

Endorsed by the United Nations Secretary-General and incubated by the Government of Norway and UNICEF, a new multi-stakeholder initiative, entitled the Digital Public Goods Alliance, has been set up to facilitate the discovery, development, use of and investment in digital public goods.2 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently announced that CoWIN, India\u2019s technological platform for vaccinations, will be available as a digital public good for other countries to use.3 A number of global philanthropies have also begun investing in research and innovation around digital public goods. But what is a digital public good? In economics, a public good is typically one that is both non- excludable and non-rivalrous. The term public good also has a looser definition, one that serves the common good. Digital public good is still an emergent concept, whose current use seems to borrow and combine both these definitions \u2013 as free and open software that is intended to serve the common good.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04cd29dc-b271-468c-b8b5-99ab9fc95b40": {"__data__": {"id_": "04cd29dc-b271-468c-b8b5-99ab9fc95b40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "CAN DIGITAL PUBLIC GOODS DELIVER MORE EQUITABLE FUTURES? | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2ba9e7320e50371f625cf4aec1f45e10e69c9e81f294b6392ce46c608a8868c"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c65a753-36b9-47f4-afd1-f0b65881a3f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4bc4194ad442c09338f482fb156dcb727be862a04dfa794bb8964a6a3f5dc33"}}, "hash": "976eea7a2a029bb5c6144c5ec60a0357e2eae1ca875eaf17b1a878c8025c2b63", "text": "The United Nations Secretary-General, for example, defines digital public goods as \u201copen-source software, open data, open artificial intelligence (AI) models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable international and domestic laws, standards and best practices and do no harm.\u201d4 Another recent essay defines digital public goods as \u201copen source digital infrastructure that aims to serve as building blocks for modern digital society.\u201d5 Regularly cited examples of digital public goods include Mojaloop, an \u201copen source software for creating payment platforms that will help unbanked people access digital services\u201d6 and MOSIP, \u201can open source, open standards-based foundational identity platform.\u201d7 A common attribute of these examples of digital public goods \u2013 they are \u2018open\u2019 and they are \u2018platforms\u2019. Such articulations of digital public goods seem to be shaped by two prior beliefs. First, digital technologies are necessary for achieving development gains, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; and, secondly, the control of essential digital infrastructures by a handful of technology companies is undesirable because their business practices are often antithetical to the public welfare. Achieving development gains thus requires the creation of \u2018open\u2019 digital infrastructures that enable participation by a wide range of public and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "207806ef-b6fc-4c8b-a634-c6e41f9beb4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "207806ef-b6fc-4c8b-a634-c6e41f9beb4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "CAN DIGITAL PUBLIC GOODS DELIVER MORE EQUITABLE FUTURES? | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2cd557bd4d6e0ddfc101b2cbcba8cdc19d15cd912ccaa20d73c1ab6b1794d76a"}}, "hash": "2cd557bd4d6e0ddfc101b2cbcba8cdc19d15cd912ccaa20d73c1ab6b1794d76a", "text": "private actors to collaboratively build development solutions. This foresight brief examines this emergent concept of digital public goods. Building on the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s report on digital cooperation, Roadmap for Digital Cooperation,8 this brief recognizes the critical importance of building a digital infrastructure that can accelerate development gains and the SDGs. But it cautions that this vision of digital public goods promotes and risks locking-in a particular vision of our digital development futures, one that is deeply contested and raises complex issues around governance and accountability. Openness in itself is not enough to realize positive development outcomes; on the contrary, without appropriate governance frameworks and capacities, \u2018open\u2019 systems may reproduce social inequities and create new unintended harms. 4 Open systems could lead to decentralized development solutions that are better attuned to local needs and enable local ownership, but only when accompanied by significant and sustained investments in building civic capacity. Emerging proposals for empowering communities, such as data trusts, are also no panacea, for their success will similarly rest on developing both adequate governance systems and civic capacity. Realizing the social or common good in our digital development futures is ultimately a question of ethics, not an issue of technical software standards. We need to develop alternative ethical frameworks grounded in values of relationality and interconnectedness to steer innovation trajectories toward the public good. Creating open digital infrastructures may address the problems that arise with the concentration of power with a select few technology companies, but openness does not in itself resolve older and persistent challenges around competing values, accountability, governance and institutional and civic capacity. On the contrary, it risks relegating these issues to secondary status with priority assigned to questions of technical standards and competencies, thus reproducing a form of market- led techno-solutionism. Platforms for Development Defining digital public goods in terms of open-source platforms that can promote sustainable development encourages a particular vision of our digital development futures. In this conceptualization, platforms backed by open data and open application programming interfaces (APIs) allow multiple actors to build new solutions for development and for the public good. Such platforms for development can enable innovative new development solutions, but also risk transforming other societal or common goods, such as education, health care and judicial services, into \u2018services\u2019 that are overwhelmingly provided by the market. Open government data programmes, for example, work to create new markets for the delivery of public services. In many developing countries, weak state and institutional capacity may necessitate the need for greater collaboration with the private sector in delivering development solutions. But it is critical that we recognize how this emerging vision of digital public goods may transform state-society relationships and the new and complex questions this raises for accountability and governance. Within this vision, the role of the state is no longer to provide essential development goods, but to enable a competitive market for development as a service. Citizens become \u2018users\u2019 of a commodity, or a commodity themselves, as their data is mined to create new product offerings. Citizen rights and entitlements risk being reduced to a series of terms of service with private vendors. Platforms for development could also have exclusionary outcomes. Market-based solutions are shaped by market pressures, and thus may not always serve the needs of people with the least purchasing power.9 This vision also risks reducing complex development challenges to issues of access, affordability and market penetration, thereby blocking out the complex socio-economic and cultural contexts that determine how people actually engage with and are shaped by these \u2018services.\u2019 Embracing market-based solutions requires us to pay close attention to business models, accountability and governance frameworks \u2013 these are more important than technical standards. Openness is envisioned as a set of technical standards rather than principles of governance. But it is this second view of openness that is critical, in particular because of the type of digital developmental vision that is being promoted through this definition of digital public goods. 5 As Srinivas Kodali, a researcher with the Free Software Movement of India, asks, \u201cWhat does openness signal? Does it signal that we are open for business or does it signal transparency?\u201d 10 The report of the United Nations Secretary-General, Roadmap for Digital Cooperation,11 for example, cites the Digital Public Goods Alliance as a \u00abgo to platform\u00bb for digital public goods, but there is no discussion of business models, accountability mechanisms or institutional frameworks needed to govern them. Digital identity platforms, for example, may improve the delivery of public services, but without adequate institutional safeguards, they can lead to unwarranted profiling of citizens, exclusion from public services, privacy violations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c548e30-8373-4fbc-819d-cf30e693d28b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c548e30-8373-4fbc-819d-cf30e693d28b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "CAN DIGITAL PUBLIC GOODS DELIVER MORE EQUITABLE FUTURES? | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "911442d6291e39d094d150c8ba1d721994fba51a6718ad8c06b0d4d62a20f64f"}, "3": {"node_id": "8a208b0d-66b5-4552-8b79-b6e4589e2499", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cb5d59952b043ff2a99c55791624be19185aa70e30bae69b5db508dd520b66a"}}, "hash": "5f130875bd17b723f58d56cf97349f67dac6d626a9d09077ef59300733c53db1", "text": "and security breaches, often to the benefit of commercial interests and at the expense of citizens\u2019 rights. In this sense, emerging narratives around digital public goods reproduce the idea of techno- solutionism, privileging a set of technical standards and technological solutions as necessary for addressing the SDGs, but without consideration of the social institutions and regulatory frameworks that need to also be in place. Many of the digital harms of today, such as privacy violations or monopolistic market practices, are not due to a failure in technical standards or in technological affordances, but because of the incentives driving technology companies and the lack of adequate safeguards and accountability mechanisms. We must therefore pay close attention to the vision of our digital development futures that is being espoused through the emergent paradigm of digital public goods \u2013 how benefits and harms are distributed and how the new challenges for accountability and governance and the alternative developmental visions may be foreclosed as a result. As Evgeny Morozov argues, as techno- solutionism becomes the default response to many political problems, \u201cit disarms, disables and discards any political alternatives.\u201d 12 THE POLITICS OF \u2018OPEN\u2019 Open Data It has become increasingly common to talk about data as a public good, a common, or a shared community resource, which must be leveraged for public benefit and development gains, not just narrow commercial interests. This is often meant in two ways \u2013 either that in principle data should be defined as a public good, or that more data should be available to development agencies and governments to promote the public good.13 However, both these framings are problematic. The first suggestion that data is in principle a public good rests on an erroneous conflation between \u2018knowledge\u2019 or \u2018information\u2019 and data. Information or knowledge is considered a public good because it is non-rivalrous (there is no extra cost incurred when others use it) and non-excludable (it is impossible to keep others from using it.) But as Nadezhda Purtova (2015) argues, data is in fact both rivalrous and excludable. Data-intensive businesses compete to harvest personal data and seek to exclude other competitors from accessing that data. The current data economy effectively excludes people from decisions about how their data is collected and used. The \u2018over-extraction\u2019 of data also has a direct impact on people\u2019s privacy and agency.14 6 The idea that data is, in principle, a public good also rests on the assumption that data is a naturally occurring phenomena \u2013 that it necessarily exists in the world and should therefore be available for the public good. But data is always manufactured \u2013 what constitutes data is a direct product of what we deemed relevant or important, which in turn is shaped by a broader set of values and interests. Data, as Anja Kovak and Nayantara Rangathan (2019), argue, \u201cis not an inevitable factor of development in technology\u201d but the \u201cresult of a market where there is both demand for more data and a promise of development through more data.\u201d15 Open data acquire more value when they are linked compared to when they are not linked. Digital identity systems provide one such way of linking open data sets. Linking up open databases through digital identity systems can lead to privacy harms and enable unwarranted profiling and surveillance. In India, for example, critics of the national biometric identity system \u2013 Aadhar \u2013 have argued that having a unique identifier allows government agencies to integrate data about individuals from multiple sources. This allows them to create a full 360-degree profile of individuals without their knowledge, which in turn enables unwarranted profiling. This can have deleterious consequences leading to egregious privacy violations, to self-censorship, to an accentuation of power asymmetries between the state and citizens and to the creation of opportunities for misuse.16 Recent research also shows that databases can never be perfectly anonymous, and an increase in the utility of data analytics is met with a decrease in privacy.17 Research from Belgium\u2019s Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain and Imperial College London, for example, has shown that a dataset with just 15 demographic attributes is enough to identify almost an entire population.18 Many developing countries also do not have the regulatory capacity to effectively protect people from such harms.

But there is very little systematic evidence on the actual outcomes of open data. In one of the few empirical studies on this question, Bright et. al (2019) found that the use of profit-making data sets far exceeds those which could be used to enhance government transparency or service delivery.20 Open data also poses serious security risks. Recent cyber-attacks show how even advanced economies are struggling to build secure data infrastructures. Estonia is often cited as the emblematic example of a digital republic, but what is sometimes neglected in these accounts is that Estonia\u2019s data architecture prioritizes data security over open data. Data is not open by default \u2013 people have clear ownership rights over their data and are able to see which organizations have access to their data and for what purpose.21 There is therefore no necessary connection between open data and the public good. Open data can bring many benefits, from government transparency to innovative new development solutions. But we should resist claims that open data is, in principle, a public good. Data can be used to promote the public good, but this depends more on the broader systems that govern its use rather than whether the data is open or not. 7 Open AI The United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s report, Road Map for Digital Cooperation, also argues for \u201copen AI models\u201d as part of its definition of digital public goods. This is assumedly intended to address the concentration of power in the hands of a select few technology companies. However, the current dominance of machine-learning and deep-learning systems require huge quantities of data and computing power, and this presents structural barriers to \u2018democratizing AI\u2019 systems. Relaxing patent regimes may also only work to democratize AI adoption, but not its development or production. Moreover, even if open AI models help to democratize AI, this does not change the fact that algorithmic systems are not neutral. What data points are considered relevant, how they are weighted and correlated are value-laden processes. A growing body of scholarship also shows how algorithmic systems embed and perpetuate societal and historical biases and injustices. For example, studies of the use of algorithmic decision-making systems in the judicial system in the US have found that they unfairly discriminate against people of colour. Another study on Google\u2019s search algorithm found that it showed lower paying jobs to women.22 Open models do not address this fundamental problem, and may even exacerbate the spread of these discriminatory impacts. GPT-3, a text generation model, released by Open AI, is an instructive example. GPT-3 was trained off of 175 billion parameters from across the internet (including Google Books, Wikipedia and coding tutorials); its code necessarily contains bias. A tweet generator based on GPT-3, when prompted to write tweets from the words \u2018Jews\u2019, \u2018black\u2019, \u2018women\u2019 and \u2018holocaust\u2019 came up with inappropriate suggestions.23 Open models also increase the chances of misuse. Taking the GPT-3 example again, the developers of the model have themselves raised concerns about how the model could be a bad actor creating an endless amount of fake news, spreading misinformation amid COVID-19 and carrying out phishing scams. Renowned AI scholar Nick Bostrom, taking a long-term view, asks a pertinent question: \u2018\u00abSupposing openness would speed-up technical process and roll-out, would that be socially beneficial ?\u201d 24 In the short run, open AI models may speed up innovation, but in the medium-long term, it could mean that governments have less time to develop the adequate institutional and social capacities to navigate the challenges of AI. This may become even more worrying if open AI speeds up the race for developing Artificial General Intelligence. AI production and deployment also has significant environmental costs \u2013 speeding up AI development may thus also end up privileging the needs of current generations over future generations. Creating open AI models may democratize AI use and allow for a wider range of actors, particularly in the Global South, to use AI tools to solve localized development challenges.

Moreover, as researchers at the Electronic Frontier Foundation have long argued, \u201cinteroperability should be the floor, not the ceiling.\u201d25 \u2018Cooperative interoperability\u2019 can end up reinforcing the power of companies building the original products, as they have to give permission for how and where data on their platforms can be used. For example, a study on Facebook\u2019s Open API policy found that it primarily worked to encourage the proliferation of social applications that redirected traffic to Facebook\u2019s servers. The open API policy established conditions for online sharing that undermined privacy, data security, transparency and user autonomy.26 In contrast, \u2018adversarial interoperability\u2019 allows products and services to plug into existing ones, without the permission of the companies that made them. This form of interoperability could be an important instrument to create a more competitive and participatory digital ecosystem. It could create enabling conditions for more localized and community-owned development solutions. Unless civic institutions have the knowledge and resources to leverage open standards to build such solutions, however, there is a high risk of capture by a select few. Large, well-resourced enterprises, for example, are likely to get the most out of open data as they will be able to apply the full range of big data capabilities. There is thus nothing intrinsic about these principles of openness which guard against monopolies of unfair value capture unless a wider range of actors have the capacity for meaningful participation. Wikipedia is an instructive example \u2013 often regarded as a provider of knowledge as a public good, it employs 450+ people worldwide and required significant capital investments in ICT infrastructure and for developing the digital capacities of its communities members, particularly to ensure a diverse community. WHEN CENTERING COMMUNITY IS NOT ENOUGH A core actor in such open systems is the \u2018community.\u2019 Enabling and empowering community is critical to be able to reframe development from within this vision itself, to make more meaningful and transformative use of this open and modular vision of development. Within the current \u2018data for development\u2019 paradigm, therefore, an essential starting point is to enable people to have control over their data. Data stewardship models are increasingly proposed as one such mechanism that can enable people to have greater voice and control over how their data is used, while still leveraging data for broader societal benefit. Numerous data stewardship experiments are already underway. Digi.me is a personal data store that aggregates individual data from multiple sources and allows subjects to share it with the companies they choose.27 This model aims to empower individuals and help them extract value from the data they produce. Data cooperatives, such as the MiData platform, which shares medical data 9 for research, allow members to collectively govern the use of their data.28 Driver\u2019s Seat, a driver- owned cooperative, collects and sells mobility data from drivers to city governments and research institutes.29 Such cooperative models seek to develop participative governance mechanisms that give communities the ability to negotiate their data rights while generating positive societal value. Even more radical solutions can be imagined. For example, Baradaran et. al (2020) have recently made a case for leveraging new advances in edge-computing and cloudlet storage systems to develop personalized AI systems. They argue for a world of open and standardized APIs built on existing social networks and commercial databases through which people can build their own personal AI. This personal AI can serve the role of a personalized data fiduciary that helps people manage how their data is collected, used and shared.30 Such solutions that seek to shift power to communities are certainly important. But just as openness is no panacea, neither is data stewardship. We will need to make sure that these new social institutions do not replicate the same problems they are seeking to solve. Sean McDonald (2019), for example, notes the emergence of a consulting and software market for data trusts. Rather than protecting data rights, much of the public dialogue on data trusts, he argues, is being shaped by \u201clarge well-financed interests trying to maximize data sharing.\u201d31 McDonald also highlights that there are far more use cases of pooling data for open-ended purposes; purpose-driven uses, in contrast, such as for advocacy movements, are struggling to be able to use data to advance their cause. The extent to which data stewardship models can protect peoples\u2019 community rights is also dependent on the broader institutional contexts into which they are introduced. In many developing countries, people lack the capacities to negotiate their data rights, and there may be low levels of trust", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d1e85b0-362f-47ce-bdd3-6e6220a24b37": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d1e85b0-362f-47ce-bdd3-6e6220a24b37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "CAN DIGITAL PUBLIC GOODS DELIVER MORE EQUITABLE FUTURES? | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "024de0f33024013fbaf19ef6eaa0d98c509e0cb2abb8981d0c0c7908aae9272b"}, "3": {"node_id": "c8d0ff7d-6f07-481f-aa9f-e3076895d366", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d2ff657a71b10ce10aa5a1a4c239a6145935c43e2506541a61e7e7cad4fa6da"}}, "hash": "51763c1fff4117ac89af4db669feb419f81b4e820a8cb2fba21cc050efbe46bd", "text": "in existing public institutions. Many current conversations about data stewardship models are being led by civil society organizations in the industrialized economies, where democratic institutions are more mature and civil society is better resourced. Simply creating data trusts without addressing broader socio-economic inequities and governance structures can easily lead to the private capture of these new social institutions. Creating more decentralized models will require investing in civic capacity to be able to access, use and build such solutions. It will require investing in knowledge institutions that are able to understand and anticipate emerging needs and harms, and that have the capacities to interrogate dominant power structures. Building these capacities takes time and investment, which is often thought not to exist in our current digital ecosystems because of the dizzying speed of technological innovation. But there is nothing natural or determined about this speed \u2013 it is enabled by an absence of regulatory structures, the prioritization of efficiency and individualism, and a broader Silicon Valley ideology of \u201cpermission-less\u201d innovation.32 Instead, technological innovation needs to be steered by a different set of values, particularly where we are expecting digital technologies to help secure equitable development futures. 10 WHAT WE NEED: TO RESCUE ETHICS FROM ETHICS-WASHING In response to a growing tech-lash, technology companies have increasingly begun to employ the language of ethics and responsibility. But this can be seen as a mere exercise by technology companies to regain their social licence to operate, and as a strategy of \u2018ethics-washing\u2019 to avoid stronger government regulation. The non-binding nature of ethical frameworks means that companies can deflect criticism by appearing to do something, even while continuing business as usual. Such ethics-washing can result in the hollowing out of conversations about ethics: of ethical deliberations losing much of their moral and social force. But questions of ethics must be central to deliberations on our digital development futures. Many of the challenges we confront with regard to the use of digital technologies and their societal impacts cannot be resolved with more or better evidence, but are ultimately a question of competing values. As we chart our digital development futures, it is vital that we unpack the ethical frameworks driving dominant innovation trajectories and explore alternative value paradigms. The conversation around digital public goods must start with this question of ethics and values. Technical standards and software principles are only a means to realize the public good \u2013 they should not be a way to lock-in or prevent value-based contestations around what constitutes the public good. Dominant innovation trajectories rest on a particular set of ontological and epistemological assumptions. Man is viewed as an atomistic being, detached from broader social and political contexts; as a free and rational agent working towards maximizing his or her individual desires through exercising the faculty of reason. As Birhane argues, data science \u201creincarnates rationalism in many forms, including in the manner in which messiness, ambiguity and uncertainty are not tolerated\u2026and the manner in which the dominant view is taken as the \u2018God\u2019s eye view\u2019.\u201d33 Dominant technological innovation trajectories are deeply embedded in values of enlightenment individualism, in which individuals, through their own faculties of rationality and reason, are able to arrive at an already determined vision of the \u2018good life.\u2019 This view perceives individuals as rational equals, divorced from their social context and pursuing the maximization of their interests. Relational ethics offers an alternative framework, as it involves a change in focus from the individual self to one embedded in a social context. It emphasizes values of interdependence and connectedness. Such relational ethics are a core tenet in many cultural traditions across the world, emphasizing a communal duty of care toward people and the environment. The Ubuntu tradition, for example, is encapsulated in the phrase, \u2018I am because we are, and since we are, therefore I am.\u2019 Ethical traditions in Asian countries, sometimes referred to as Kampong ethics, highlight the \u2018communal self\u2019, emphasizing values of empathy and compassion. Relational paradigms, based on social and environmental sustainability, have also long informed technology development in indigenous cultures. Many indigenous epistemologies refuse to centre or elevate the human above the natural environment. Indigenous value systems also prioritize a temporal dimension, asking about the impact of today\u2019s actions on future generations. In practical terms, relational ethics force us to centre the experiences of those most impacted by such systems, who tend to be the already vulnerable and marginalized members of society.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8d0ff7d-6f07-481f-aa9f-e3076895d366": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8d0ff7d-6f07-481f-aa9f-e3076895d366", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "CAN DIGITAL PUBLIC GOODS DELIVER MORE EQUITABLE FUTURES? | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "024de0f33024013fbaf19ef6eaa0d98c509e0cb2abb8981d0c0c7908aae9272b"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d1e85b0-362f-47ce-bdd3-6e6220a24b37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51763c1fff4117ac89af4db669feb419f81b4e820a8cb2fba21cc050efbe46bd"}}, "hash": "1d2ff657a71b10ce10aa5a1a4c239a6145935c43e2506541a61e7e7cad4fa6da", "text": "11 Emerging platforms for development must thus play close attention to their possible exclusionary effects, and ensure the availability of alternative and equally effective pathways for people to access digital development gains.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "225dcf48-7773-46a9-9d41-d16d59c02d3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "225dcf48-7773-46a9-9d41-d16d59c02d3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "CAN DIGITAL PUBLIC GOODS DELIVER MORE EQUITABLE FUTURES? | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "845884a65992ffc72d6a2f9576f75948261f07398f5ef6ae34ad7608e9842069"}}, "hash": "845884a65992ffc72d6a2f9576f75948261f07398f5ef6ae34ad7608e9842069", "text": "Beyond individual gains, we must consider the broader societal impacts, including for future generations. A relational ethics lens can also be applied to designing new social institutions for data. A relational view draws attention to the vast asymmetries in power that characterize our modern data economy, and how that renders the principle of consent inadequate in protecting people from harm. Rather than procedural rules that can be circumvented by the most powerful, a relational lens could help articulate \u201cduties of loyalty, confidentiality and care on tech companies\u201d in which people are protected despite their capacities, or regardless of the individual decisions they make when navigating digital spaces.34 Scholars studying indigenous traditions have made similar arguments. They have argued that traditional open data principles \u2013 findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) \u2013 primarily focus on the characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities, while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. Instead of focusing on the qualities of data, we should focus on people and purpose-oriented principles, emphasizing principles such as Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility and Ethics (CARE).35 Beyond those impacted by particular technological systems, a relational view forces us to consider the entire process of technology production. This includes the materials involved in the building of current technology systems and their environmental impacts. The cloud, for example, is already one of the largest emitters of CO2. A recent study quoted in the Harvard Business Review shows that the last 0.08 percent incremental increase in the accuracy of an AI model took nearly 400 percent more energy than the first stage.36 This is not an inevitable outcome of technology development processes, but the result of specific types of business models and technological decisions. Relational ethics should also turn our attention to the \u2018invisible labour\u2019 that is enabling the production of AI systems. The main training data sets for machine learning originated in corporations, universities and military agencies, but the laborious work of data labelling and annotation is done by populations in the Global South via crowd work platforms. ImageNet, for example, which has become the de facto benchmark for image recognition algorithms, was built by outsourcing the work of labelling millions of images via Amazon Mechanical Turk to workers around the world.37 Global supply chains of technology production are marked by exploitative working conditions that represent a starkly unequal distribution of technology gains. These exploitative work conditions undergird much of our current digital \u2018progress\u2019. Seeing the world through this prism of interconnectedness and relationality can help better guide our innovation trajectories and reorient the dizzying pace of technological innovation. Ethics must lead the way in defining our digital development futures, not technical software standards. 12 CONCLUSION Economists and other scholars have long argued that few things are pure public goods. For example, in the context of growing atmospheric pollution and how its harms are unevenly distributed across the globe, even access to clean air can be exclusionary and rivalrous. The question we thus need to ask is, what are the values, interests, institutional arrangements that are enabled or legitimized through defining digital public goods as open platforms. Lawrence Lessing (2020) argued that code \u2013 the language in which computational logic is expressed \u2013 could act as an enforcer for the law, and might even become the law. By defining digital public goods in terms of open source platforms that are necessary for development, we are also inadvertently locking-in a particular vision of our digital development futures. Instead of focusing on the technical features of this vision, we should examine the interests and values it privileges, how gains and harms are likely to be distributed, how it transforms state-society relations and the new governance arrangements that are needed. In the looser sense, whether an open platform can enable the public good is dependent on governance structures, incentives and business models. Open systems can help shift power away from large corporations and enable more decentralized solutions, but this will require investments in civic capacity and appropriate social institutions. Ultimately, these investments must be ethically moored, for what constitutes a public good is ultimately a question of values and ethics, not technical standards. Many governments in the Global South are seeking to build open platforms as digital public goods, often supported by international organizations and global development agencies. Estonia and India are often cited as examples. Many African countries are even looking to learn lessons from India\u2019s digital transformations, particularly its platforms for digital identity and financial services. As global development agencies support these efforts, it is critical that adequate attention is paid to the institutional capacities", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2fa4d32-00ae-49c8-a7d9-1ad7804aea1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2fa4d32-00ae-49c8-a7d9-1ad7804aea1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "CAN DIGITAL PUBLIC GOODS DELIVER MORE EQUITABLE FUTURES? | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2439faf205697f860d385295f2d9960bf517d739cba984b2d09146cf5b049206"}, "3": {"node_id": "e174159c-c855-48f3-bdea-d46259bd67c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-digital-public-goods-deliver-more-equitable-futures-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f1a3055b127e4af3561dd3f492cb357fdfc2d050c0869ce827592af5411cfa8"}}, "hash": "c2df8f6e74e2df573ba6fd61cd8c324cc841586a96963a2f1dbac29469921f87", "text": "and governance frameworks for governing such platforms. These new technology architectures are believed to be easier to develop in developing countries because of the absence of legacy systems, and can allow developing countries to leapfrog progress on persistent socio-economic challenges. The corollary to the absence of such legacy systems, however, is weak institutional capacities in countries of varied stages of democratic maturity. The new institutional systems that are being built are not drawing on the wisdom and experience of earlier systems. Instead, they are starting on shaky or weak grounds, which makes it even more important not to create harmful technological and policy lock-ins. As global development agencies increasingly support the development of digital infrastructures now and into the future, it is vital that our interventions in digital futures are in equal traction to our focus on equality. They are not siloed issues but closely interlinked and have to be programmed accordingly. It is vital that we pay equal, if not more, attention to questions of ethics, power and institutional and social capacity, as these are far more essential than software standards in aligning digital innovation trajectories with the public good. 13 ENDNOTES 1 Report of the United Nations Secretary-General, The Age of Digital Interdependence: High-Level Panel on Digital - Cooperation, United Nations, 2020. 2 https://digitalpublicgoods.net/ 3 \u201cIndia to make CoWIN available to all countries as \u2018digital public good\u2019 PM Modi\u201d, The Week, 5 July 2021, <https://www.theweek.in/wire-updates/national/2021/07/05/del56-pm-ld-cowin- conclave.html> 4 The Age of Digital Interdependence. 5 Richard Pope, \u201cExploring Digital Public Goods\u201d, Medium (24 May 2021), <https://medium.com/ digital-public-infrastructure/exploring-digital-public-goods-introduction-d33493cebdd> 6 https://mojaloop.io/ 7 https://www.mosip.io/ 8 Report of the United Nations Secretary-General, Roadmap for Digital Cooperation: implementation of the recommendations of the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation, United Nations, May 2020. 9 UNDP, Human Development Report: Making Technologies work for human development (New York, Oxford University Press, 2001), <http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/262/ hdr_2001_en.pdf> 10 Author\u2019s interview with Srinivas Kodali, May 2021. 11 Roadmap for Digital Cooperation. 12 Evgeny Morozov, \u201cThe tech-solutions for coronavirus take the surveillance state to the next level\u201d, The Guardian, London, 15 April 2020, <https://www.theguardian.com/ commentisfree/2020/apr/15/tech-coronavirus-surveilance-state-digital-disrupt> 13 Linnet Taylor, \u201cThe ethics of big data as a public good: which public?

The first question informs and shapes the other two points, articulating what is meant by Indigenous futures and futurity, and how the past guides and shapes iterative Indigenous futures and futures thinking through Indigenous protocols. These protocols can be thought of as flexible and adaptive governance models, noted in further detail in the \u201cProtocols for (Re)generative Development\u201d and \u201cLearning Through Doing: Practices as Policy\u201d sections. The second half of this brief offers tangible policy implications that are guided by and expand on the UNDP 2020 Human Development Report\u2019s (HDR) four dimensions. This brief does not offer concrete answers to the last two questions, rather it offers points for further development in decision-making and metrics for measuring policy outcomes. \u201cWe always have our ancestors at our back. That certainty gives us a wider possibility of movement, a more supple way to navigate through the world. Standing on our mountain of connections, our foundation of history and stories and love, we can see both where the path behind us has come from and where the path ahead leads. This connection assures us that when we move forward, we can never be lost because we always know how to get back home. The future is a realm we have inhabited for thousands of years. You cannot do otherwise when you rely on the land and sea to survive\u2026 This ensures that the land is productive into the future, that the sea will still be abundant into the future, and that our people will still thrive into the future. This is the future we are leading the way to, the future we are going to live in, the future our ancestors fought for, the future we still fight for.

Indigeneity: Some Layered Meanings Indigenous communities span the globe, and while the term Indigenous and Indigeneity are used broadly to signify these groups, these terms are not intended to universalize Indigenous peoples and nations. They are engaged here \u201cto collectively secure the distinctiveness and singularity of individual Indigenous nations, cultures and communities.\u201d4 While it is imperative to note here that Indigenous peoples are not a monolithic category, there are some commonalities of these worldviews that are relevant: \u2022 \u2022 Ontologically relational5 \u2013 there is a fundamental understanding that humans are connected to place-based networks of plants, animals and elements. This understanding guides their individual and collective actions and decision-making processes \u2022 \u2022 Cyclical or fluid views of time (past/present/future) \u2022 \u2022 Epistemological pluralism \u2013 learning from Western science and technology and from traditional forms of knowledge and experiences; core values of reciprocity and collective stewardship6 To offer some specific examples connecting these three commonalities: Kanaka Maoli scholar, Noelani Arista, writes of the Native Hawaiian concept of pono as \u201cbalanced flourishing\u201d \u2013 inherent in her articulation of this concept is each individual\u2019s ongoing assessment of their positional responsibility [kuleana] within larger local networks of human and non-human communities.7 This example illustrates the specificity meant by \u201cplace-based\u201d and how personal genealogies and past histories impact present and future decisions. Examples from a different region are buen vivir, translated as \u201cgood life\u201d or \u201cgood living\u201d as a \u201cpluralistic concept, namely \u2018buenos convivires\u2019: different ways of \u2018living well together\u2019.\u201d8 This concept emerges from the Indigenous and colonial languages of Ecuador and Bolivia: \u2018Buen Vivir\u2019 (Spanish) or \u2018Sumak Kawsay\u2019 (Kichwa); \u2018Vivir Bien\u2019 (Spanish) or \u2018Suma Qama\u00f1a\u2019 (Aymara), \u2018Sumak Kawsay\u2019 (Quechua), \u2018\u00d1ande Reko\u2019 or \u2018Tek\u00f3 Por\u00e3\u2019 (Guarani).9 This \u201cgood life\u201d is an ongoing and fluid 5 goal of balance among species and communities, assessing past practices to understand current impacts and shapes, inclusive yet Indigenous-led futures. Another is m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori, encompassing health and well-being through interconnectedness.10 On a very basic level of interpretation, this is \u201cknowledge accumulated in a M\u0101ori way\u201d. However, it differs from Western understandings in that it draws from generational place-based sources of knowledges, and includes extended futures planning, accepting and working within complexity and change.11 M\u0101ori scholar, Mason Durie, frames m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori with two primary knowledge- creating pricinciples: whanaungatanga, connections through kinship and linkages, that illustrate interdependency between people and their external world, and t\u0101whiowhio, learning and thinking from looking outside of and beyond ourselves.12 The examples above are brief definitions of nuanced Indigenous scientific concepts. They are offered here as a common thread for our approach: how Indigenous communites engage in sustainable development through place-based and interconnected futures thinking on extended timescales, guided by past generations and histories.

By looking to their communities\u2019 past histories and examples as models, Indigenous peoples test, assess and apply these ongoing processes and protocols to work for future human and non-human health and well-being. This brief employs the term non-human throughout this work, rather than other-than-human or beyond-human. The latter two phrases are currently used in social sciences and humanities fields to indicate that humans are not above or superior to other entities. Drawing on specific Indigenous writings, non- is not perceived as lesser, but as powerful, honourific and generative \u2013 thus it is used here.19 Past as Future This section title refers to the second point of commonality: Indigenous conceptions of past and future being cyclical and connected. \u201cPast as future\u201d is also engaged here to emphasize the ways that mainstream development and sustainability projects have marginalized or compartmentalized Indigenous participation. These patterns must be traced in order to note how they were (and are) repeated and replicated in different settings, so that they can be changed. Indigenous peoples\u2019 inclusion in development has been delineated by mainstream metrics. The following goals are from Indigenous Peoples and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and exemplify perceptions that appear in other United Nations and international development organization work.2021 \u2022 \u2022 Education: Education for all \u25cb Critique: Not considering opportunities that numerous Indigenous communities have created by launching their own Indigenous language and culture-based schools. \u2022 \u2022 Empowerment: Ending poverty and hunger \u25cb Critique: This goal is important, but must not ignore the decades and in some cases centuries-long impacts of non-native crops and imported supplies on ecosystems and watersheds. \u2022 \u2022 Engagement and Inclusion: Indigenous peoples are to be engaged in implementing programmes and policies \u25cb Critique: Indigenous peoples are engaged when implementing programmes, but not centred or included substantially in the processes of policy-making and revision. \u2022 \u2022 The planning process includes Indigenous peoples and intends that they should \u201ccontribute to reviews on progress at a country level.\u201d22 \u25cb Critique: This excludes the localized place-based understandings that Indigenous communities have and creates significant tensions around processes of selecting Indigenous members to speak for the entire nation or a larger region. 7 A Transformation Dialogues Series, led by the Presencing Institute and UNDP SDG Integration, took up issues around the marginalization of Indigenous sources of knowledge and experiences that happened during the negotiations around the Indigenous Peoples and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, working with Melanie Goodchild (Moose Clan, Biigtigong Nishnaabeg First Nation) and Danika Billie Littlechild (Ermineskin Cree Nation). In the second session, two points were noted in the recap that are relevant to this work: first, a profound gap exists between knowing and doing, \u201cThe HDR says we have much to learn from indigenous peoples \u2014 but are we listening and learning?\u201d; secondly, \u201cfinding balance requires listening to the margins to shift power.\u201d23 Sophia Robele wrote a reflection on one of these online meetings, where Goodchild performed a tea ceremony as part of the gathering. Robele notes: \u201cWhen we are consistently called on to respond to the systemic challenges that are \u2018urgent,\u2019 and base our investments and attention on that which poses the most pressing existential threat to humans and the planet, our understanding of the concept of \u2018urgency\u2019 is significant.

In many of these briefs, documents and agendas, Indigenous peoples are mentioned alongside a lack of education, environmental issues and crises, and/or poverty. Yet these communities have much to offer around technology, innovation and long-term sustainable development. They are not centred (or substantively included) in decision-making about development. These are missed opportunities for organizations and governance bodies to move from resilience-thinking into flourishing in times of crisis through Indigenous futures approaches. As noted by this section heading, applying Indigenous futures as active policy implementation starts with understanding Indigenous communities\u2019 valuation of the past \u2013 not only remembering it, but actively guided by past models and teachings for making future decisions. Indigenous governance models are cyclical processes, based on past examples and \u2018living\u2019 structures of human-non-human relations. Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg scholar and artist, Leanne Betasamoke Simpson, describes how her Indigenous communities are made through cyclical processes of build-breakdown-assess- rebuild: these processes and protocols are how her community has/is/and will be made stronger and enacts sovereignty within their human and nonhuman nations.25 8 Understanding these processes as ongoing, cyclical and localized is key. While they draw from centuries of past models and teachings, they are active practices of Indigenous knowledge as futures-thinking that extend across generations, yet remain deeply place-based. Place here includes lands, waters, air and wind patterns and the interconnected ecosystems of a particular region. Each area or region is specific, thus these practices are not interchangeable. While they \u201ccontemplate multiple knowledge systems that exist within the many languages, cultural landscapes and worldviews of Indigenous peoples,\u201d26 these practices are deeply rooted understandings of patterns, change, and how to apply historically-tested processes for future decision-making. As Kanaka Maoli scholar and writer Bryan Kamaoli Kuwada notes about progress and Indigenous futures-thinking on centuries-long timescales, \u201cwhen you see the possibility of \u2018progress\u2019 in this more connected way, you see that we are actually the ones looking to the future. We are trying to get people back to the right timescale, so that they can understand how they are connected to what is to come.\u201d27 While this quote may appear to relate only to past and future timescales, Kuwada\u2019s writing and the concepts within them, which opens this brief, are inexorably entwined with Hawai\u2019i. The past and future referred to here are those of a specific interconnected set of lands, waters and the ecosystems that are supported by those lands and waters. Any measure of futures thinking or sustainable development must be operating on these timescales, and must also be rooted to specific lands, waters and communities. To ignore the interconnections between past, future and place (such as futures and foresight development from a few mainstream groups who look only at the near past) means continuing practices that have caused and will continue to cause impacts we are witnessing today: declines in native species, polluted airways and waterways, supply chain disruptions, health and wellness issues, and more. To provide another example: naturacultura is an articulation of Indigenous futures drawn from Mayan, Andean and Garifuna worldviews. The term is used to denote a commonality among Indigenous communities around the world and has strong resonances across the Asia-Pacific region: \u201cinsistences that the people cannot be conceived of separately from the land and that development should be culturally defined.\u201d28 Naturacultura is described as highly path-dependent, \u201calways embedded in a history that structures the possibility of its form. . . Any change in it must be iterative\u2014built onto the past, not in denial of it.\u201d29 This statement that Indigenous peoples build onto the past is not inaccurate, but for the purpose of this brief, it is important to emphasize how Indigenous sources of knowledge offer powerful tools for futures-oriented development through localized and circular processes, not a linear construction from past, to present, into the future. These cyclical processes are iterative in that they are assessed and measured as to how they are restricting or encouraging balanced flourishing.

The concepts of Indigenous protocols and inclusive assessments outlined in this brief draw from The Value of Hawai\u2019i 2 and 3, the \u2018\u0100ina Aloha Economic Futures Declaration, the Indigneous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Position Paper, a discussion with an Aboriginal Gadigal and Dunghutti community member for the Gender, (In)security and Temporalities of Violence Global Symposium, the Orang Asli/Asal Communities: Building Back Better UNDP Webinar for Indigenous Malaysian communities and Marshallese educator, artist and United Nations Climate Summit opening speaker Kathy Jet\u00f1il- Kijiner\u2019s writings and performance pieces.31 Angelina Hurley describes protocols \u201cas a set of rules, regulations, processes, procedures, strategies, or guidelines\u2026 the ways in which you work with people and communicate and collaborate with them appropriately\u2026..Protocols are the standards of behaviour, respect and knowledge that need to be adopted.\u201d32 Indigenous communities have kept and expanded their languages and protocols for non-human and human connections throughout the centuries, thus these protocols both guide human relations and how specific communities relate with all that share their lands and waters. Indigenous protocols include guiding principles and a methodology for conducting oneself in any activity, \u201cthe customs, lore and codes of behaviour of a particular cultural group and a way of conducting business. It also refers to the protocols and procedures used to guide the observance of traditional knowledge and practices, including how traditional knowledge is used, recorded and disseminated.\u201d33 These protocols are expanded, adapted, improved and adjusted depending on the contexts: formal settings versus informal ones, Indigenous community members versus participants from other backgrounds, whether one is visiting or away, among other factors.34 Often even the processes to evaluate and reflect on protocols have their own sets of guidelines for how people come together to assess them. Indigenous futures through applied protocols are key to understanding the message of this brief. Models such as \u201cinclusive growth\u201d cannot sustain balanced flourishing, nor are externally developed models of inclusive growth, regenerative growth, or circular economies enough; (re)generative development is required. (Re)generative development here means balanced flourishing through cyclical, reciprocal protocols for assessment with flexible/fluid structures, led by Indigenous communities from the areas in question. This is done through ongoing and place-based applied Indigenous protocols. The next section looks at examples of inclusive growth and circular economies that resonate with this work but lack these protocols; then moves into what (re)generative development is and how it is applied. Why and how (re)generative differs from regenerative is detailed in the \u201cProtocols for (re)generative development\u201d section. The parenthetical shift is introduced here to denote that (re)generative development through Indigenous futures is markedly different than normative regenerative development concepts and models. For those familiar with calculations or computational symbols, think of (re-) here as being a multiplier that must be understood within Indigenous contexts first, before connecting to generative development. 10 TIDAL SHIFTS: DEVELOPMENT POLICIES, SIGNS AND SIGNALS There are important political and cultural signs within the last decade that suggest national and international approaches to inclusive development are shifting, alongside growing recognition that Indigenous worldviews and sciences have much to offer to sustainability and energy development debates.35 These models and programmes recognize the interconnectedness of environmental and social/mental/economic development, yet centre mainstream and universalized approaches by \u201cdrawing from\u201d Indigenous views or offering \u201cplace-based\u201d approaches without noting Indigenous peoples.36 The language of \u201cdrawing from\u201d and \u201clearning from\u201d Indigenous communities without centring their knowledge keepers and decision-making bodies repeats what Patrick Wolfe famously termed the structures of settler colonialism: repeating patterns of behaviour and decision-making that continue processes of extraction and erasure.37 To expand this further: reciprocity and responsibility are important parts of Indigenous conceptions of balanced flourishing, noted earlier in Noelani Arista\u2019s definition of pono. Not reciprocating Indigenous communities for their knowledge (which has been taken and written about by non-Indigenous programmes internationally), and not assessing the positionality of those involved in development projects and their responsibilities (here meaning obligations), are forms of extraction and erasure.

A citation from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation home page states: \u201cWe must transform every element of our take-make-waste system: how we manage resources, how we make and use products and what we do with the materials afterwards. Only then can we create a thriving circular economy that can benefit everyone within the limits of our planet.\u201d38 Critique: When referring to \u201ceconomies of care\u201d and \u201ccircular economies,\u201d organizations should name the sources of Indigenous knowledge that have influenced their thinking and establish ongoing reciprocity with that community. The accompanying video notes how \u201cwe\u201d revolutionized the world and consumed without limits, but now \u201cwe\u201d are designing out waste and pollution. This universalized \u201cwe\u201d erases centuries of colonization and extraction while positioning those who have caused these harms as now able to \u201cdesign\u201d them out. 11 EXAMPLE 2: REGENERATIVE FUTURES The Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce \u201cRegenerative Futures\u201d programme states: \u201cA \u2018regenerative\u2019 mindset is one that sees the world as built around reciprocal and co-evolutionary relationships, where humans, other living beings and ecosystems rely on one another for health, and shape (and are shaped by) their connections with one another.\u201d39 Critique: This RSA model has some parallels to this brief, such as reciprocity and human-non- human community-based approaches. However, as with the first example, the universal \u201cwe\u201d is never decentred or examined. This wording borrows heavily from Indigenous worldviews (reciprocity, interconnected ecosystems) without mentioning them \u2013 illustrating how contemporary development frameworks continue these erasures.

International organizations may be new to include them, and popular environmental and technology scholars (such as Haraway, quoted in this section) may be new to include them \u2013 but the Indigenous peoples and knowledge systems cited here have existed for millennia. It continues, \u201cAnd were we to think that these are outdated notions of the past, look at how people in so-called modern industrial societies relate to their pets, accuse particular dogs of viciousness or attacks, engage with their garden plants and the animal life in cities and seek to protect particular, individual trees from road developments.\u201d41 Critique: this section universalizes Indigenous concepts, positing \u201chow people in so-called modern industrial societies\u201d care for pets and particular plants and trees as examples of this human-non-human well-being. This brings to the fore two points of concern: one, citing Indigenous worldviews, then trying to universalize them illustrates missed insights that Indigenous communities can offer. In this case, a lack of understanding of how domestic pet populations decimate native wildlife, or how invasive tree and plant species impact native endangered ones. The second point: Indigenous views are again relegated to the environment and caring for non-human species, rather than being understood as powerful development modes for balanced flourishing. Each of these examples does not account for community members\u2019 positionality, experience or histories with the human and non-human communities they live in. This brief splits apart the universalized \u201cwe\u201d and \u201chumans\u201d to illustrate how processes of place-based interconnectivity are imperative, and how assessment models must be guided by the human community members who know these interspecies networks, lands and waters best. 12 Returning to my earlier definitions of Indigenous, here is where their epistemological pluralism \u2013 that is, learning from Western science and technology and from traditional forms of knowledge and experiences \u2013 indicates Indigenous groups are well suited to design and innovate in many areas of development, not only in land and water conservation programmes.

Each of these examples demonstrates advanced futures thinking across human and non-human communities: illustrating generations-long understandings of water, land and non-human systems\u2019 health as essential for present and future flourishing. By contrast, military, government and business development projects that measure impacts for only the next 30, 40, or 80 years seem markedly short-sighted by comparison.2 As climate change and related economic and social support fractures increase, a shift to other ways of being with each other is necessary. It is imperative to move from merely being resilient to balanced flourishing in the face of increasing natural and socio-economic fluctuations. Utilizing a resilience framework is not adequate; a balanced flourishing framework is required: as one community is impacted or requires aid, ample local resources will be available to support those in need. This brief proposes working within local systems that are connected to larger regional, national and international networks allows for different growth cycles. As Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities vary widely across the Asia and Pacific regions, one universalized model will not suffice. The next sections propose centring place-based local Indigenous-led models within current systems to support and expand (re)generative development processes. 2 A current example [as of 10 January 2022] of this short-sighted development: Rachel Treisman, \u201cThousands displaced from Oahu military base due to contamination in Navy water system,\u201d NPR, WNYC, 15 December 2021, https://www. npr.org/2021/12/15/1064514935/water-contamination-hawaii 13 The keys to this approach are protocols that can include people from many backgrounds, but are guided by those who know specific lands, waters and communities best. PROTOCOLS FOR (RE)GENERATIVE DEVELOPMENT In this Indigenous Futures brief, crafting paths to place-based, Indigenous-led cyclical processes is the goal. It offers ways Indigenous protocols can be centred to accommodate Indigenous worldviews, while mitigating frictions with contemporary expectations for development and growth. To do this, we begin with the phrases regrowth and regenerative \u2013 connecting them with definitions of (re-) and emergences from Indigenous scholars, to describe (re)generative development. (Re)generative development is a term offered here to define the futures of development from Indigenous perspectives: generative and cyclical assessments that centre Indigenous protocols and community members, guided by a goal of balanced flourishing. The (re) in parenthesis assists in visually marking how this concept differs both from regenerative development and circular growth models and from previous United Nations positions on Indigenous inclusion. The use of (re) in this brief also models what (re)generative growth embodies by citing and rooting the usage to an Indigenous scholar and community. Earlier in the brief (re-) was noted as operating as a multiplier with a specific sequential order: Indigenous contexts first, which then shape the resulting development models.

(This was noted in Example 3, the UNDP HDR 2020 quote.) 14 Space + Time When Indigenous groups gather for the overarching goal of balanced flourishing, they must make decisions among themselves about expectations, outcomes, and who among them is most suited for a particular project and location, among other concerns. Outside participants, developers and officials must remember that space and time must be allowed for processes and protocols. Connecting back to Goeman and Silva, decisions around technology, development and other \u2018modern\u2019 development areas may seem like new iterations or ideas, but they have much deeper roots and are connected to much older protocols, genealogies and histories. To outside observers, it may seem that too much time is spent on ceremony and other Indigenous protocols, yet these are integral parts of larger Indigenous governance structures and function on many levels: recognizing human and non-human connections, assessing positionality and responsibility, centring focus and purpose on balanced flourishing for all those gathered, methods of formalized relational processes between Indigenous communities or between Indigenous and non- Indigenous communities, and more. People external to these communities, but who are part of their development groups, must allow space and time for various emergences to appear. Much like with plant growth, not all emergences are going to be productive or contribute to balanced flourishing. Some may appear in unexpected places or times; some may need to be restrained or culled \u2013 these are parts of the process. This section of the brief is not calling for \u201cspace to fail,\u201d but for space and time to reorder and adjust expectations in each setting. These processes for balanced flourishing are an outcome in and of themselves: protocols of how communities come together, what is decided and when \u2013 all of these become models for future protocols, assessments and iterations. Thus, space must be given for these (re)newed emergences to appear and for those tending to them to decide which protocols are best suited to a particular urgent issue, which ways of encouraging balanced flourishing are working and what pressing issue needs to be dealt with first. Example: \u2018Awa Diplomacy This section illustrates how a traditional formal \u2018awa ceremony acted as a form of governance and diplomacy for an organization of Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants from several countries, all of whom were gathered to discuss and plan technology and development futures. This is detailed to show how formal Indigenous protocols are relevant for decision-making (who holds power in deciding what happens within specific locations), but also for resolving tensions and conflicts that can occur in larger-scale projects. It also illustrates that traditional Indigenous ceremonies have an important place in \u2018modern\u2019 development projects, such as computational systems and AI. An example of space and time for (re)generative development is the traditional Native Hawaiian \u2018awa [kava] ceremony that opened the first 2019 Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence workshop.49 For this workshop, Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants were arriving to Honolulu from several countries and from three continents. There were multiple funding agencies involved, representing academic and economic interests, and many of the participants had not worked with each other before. Tensions were developing, and the Native Hawaiian organizer and local organizing assistant were cognizant of these pressures as they planned particular logistics. 15 They worked with a practitioner they trusted, who was qualified to perform a traditional \u2018awa ceremony, thinking through how to arrange seating according to status (which is customary) and trying to plan how the ceremony could include at least 35 people (many of whom were being flown in), while remaining within the time constraints imposed by travel and funding. The most complicated was the question of status \u2013 who should be introduced first? Who should come last? How would different types of leadership roles within different Indigenous communities from different parts of the world be recognized and respectfully evaluated? The answer to these questions and the issue of timing became clear once a place-based protocol emerged: \u2022 \u2022 The Hawaiian island and specific region of that island where the ceremony took place would be the centre. \u2022 \u2022 The organizers who were most connected to that specific region would be seated in the leading positions, others would follow according to their connections to the place and the organizers most connected to it. \u2022 \u2022 Thus, each of the five main organizers would sit in the centre in a semi-circle, according to each one\u2019s connection to that specific place.3 \u25cb Everyone associated with one of those five organizers would be seated behind them in the larger second semi-circle.

This ceremony structure provided clarity and helped resolve conflicts and tensions. The act of observing and supporting for each of the participants, no matter what their background, allowed them to feel included without having additional rounds of speaking. The main organizers were reminded of their larger purpose, focusing on it and committing to it for the duration of the event. As noted, this was a technology-based gathering; yet because it was Indigenous-led, the receiving and hosting protocols, as well as making time and space for those coming from other communities to share their visiting protocols (songs, dances and gifts) were not merely included as an opening, but functioned as core structural components. 3 If this ceremony had been held on another area of O\u2019ahu, or on another island - Hilo, Hawai\u2019i, for example - the seating chart may have differed as the Native Hawaiians most connected to that specific place would be seated first. 16 LEARNING THROUGH DOING: PRACTICES AS POLICY As noted, Indigenous Futures are cyclical processes based on past examples and \u2018living\u2019 structures of human-non-human communities. As such, they offer powerful governance and futures-planning models. Indigenous communities are made and remade through cyclical processes of build- breakdown-assess-rebuild: these processes and protocols are how communities are made stronger and how their human and non-human members enact sovereignty as they address crises and developmental issues. This section concludes with tangible policy shifts, coalescing earlier ideas and concepts into applied decision-making examples. However, before the contraction comes an expansion. This section begins with launch points for cyclical collective processes that reimagine and act for balanced flourishing, interventions and models that: \u2022 \u2022 Remain inclusive, yet centre local/place-based Indigenous expertise and knowledge \u2022 \u2022 Are processes that understand growth and restriction of growth as important and necessary parts of balanced flourishing \u2022 \u2022 Are ongoing and reflexive on every level \u2013 from individuals and small groups, up through larger scale organizations \u2022 \u2022 Are iterative: each process includes feedback, assessments and looking to past examples as future guides to (re)generate, then act accordingly Indigenous Futures interventions into current development paradigms might include: 1. Indigenous pasts are understood to be important models for building inclusive future plans and paths, with non-linear expectations of success and other quantitative metrics required by funding organizations built into the development plans. 2. Indigenous worldviews deepen articulations of multilateralism (per the United Nations common agenda) through balanced development within planetary limitations AND shifting local ecosystem parameters. 3. Indigenous growth, development and progress are valued as \u2018past-guided, but futures- oriented\u2019 models: Reinterpreting past models for future health through processes of testing, observations, assessment and reflection. 4. Age and gender norms are challenged in terms of development leadership: qualifications for particular positions are based on localized human and non-human community roles and an individual\u2019s life experiences. Models for Indigenous Futures-led development might include: 1. Definitions of, and markers for, balanced flourishing are decided by Indigenous and decolonial place-based community members; these organizations and governance models will themselves be reflexive and iterative. 2. Space for testing and reflection in each gathering is understood as necessary parts of processes of (re)generation and community flourishing. 17 3. Human community members, who are strongly connected to specific non-human communities (for example, elk, fish, specific forest groves), act as negotiators and diplomats. These representative roles are decided by the local communities. 4. Not only looking to future human generations or to children, but observing how the elders of many species are behaving and communicating for guidance and inspiration. 5.

This does not mean all current work has to be scrapped or pushed aside, nor does it mean that this brief concludes with somewhat-intangible policy steps. Now that the expansion of Indigenous Futures potentials has been described, it is time for the contraction noted earlier: coalescing the core elements of this Indigenous Futures brief into concrete steps. This section articulates how current UNDP HDR frameworks and indicators might be recalibrated with (re)generative growth models for balanced flourishing. To do this requires Indigenous-led decisions and protocols, applying them as flexible yet place-based inclusive governance guides. It also requires those involved in development decision-making to understand how these protocols and the people in charge of them will shift depending on location, as noted in the \u2018awa ceremony example. The following collective processes of action and imagination are extensions of the 2020 HDR four dimensions. Each box below shows a dimension of the 2020 HDR and its respective indicators, followed by some proposed interventions and considerations to bring an Indigenous Futures lens to that dimension. 18 HDR DIMENSION I: STATUS OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT Within this dimension, there are six stated indicators that reflect the health of people and the planet in different ways and the interaction between them. \u25cb Human Development Index (HDI): long and healthy life, knowledge, decent standard of living \u25cb Number of deaths and missing persons attributed to disasters \u25cb Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution \u25cb Forest area, change: Percentage change in area under forest cover \u25cb Red List Index: Measure of the aggregate extinction risk across groups of species \u25cb Fresh water withdrawals: Total fresh water withdrawn, expressed as a percentage of total renewable water resources INDIGENOUS FUTURES INTERVENTIONS FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT \u25cb Significant portions of Asia and the Pacific are ocean-connected.50 Impacts from ocean toxicity and climate-change need to be addressed and understood as being formative for these human communities development, as they are deeply connected to the ocean and salt water flows, as noted by Albert Wendt (Samoa), Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner (Marshallese), Noe Goodyear-Ka\u02bb\u014dpua (Kanaka Maoli) and Aiko Yamashiro (Uchinanchu (Okinawan), Kanaka Maoli) and many others. \u25cb Several of these assessments are exclusive to humans \u2013 yet impacts of pollution extend through and to many interconnected species, and many Indigenous communities consider particular non-human relations as elders and extended family members. \u25b6 Applying a relational and reciprocal approach, metrics should be developed to measure native species and ecosystems\u2019 health/mortality. \u25b6 Applying an interconnected approach, carefully monitoring the well-being of these non- human kin could map and forecast regional human mortality/illness issues. 19 HDR DIMENSION II: ENERGY SYSTEMS This dimension includes four indicators. Two relate to countries\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions; two indicate countries\u2019 response to reduce emissions. \u25cb Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions per capita \u25cb Carbon dioxide emissions, consumption emissions per capita \u25cb Carbon dioxide emissions, per unit of GDP: provides information on the extent of \u201ccarbon decoupling\u201d from the economy \u25cb Renewable energy consumption: direct\u2013 and forward looking \u2013measure of adoption of alternatives to fossil fuels INDIGENOUS FUTURES INTERVENTIONS FOR ENERGY SYSTEMS Understanding food sovereignty and food imports/exports as interconnected with energy systems: \u25cb Shipping disruptions, levels of trash produced, and food deserts will escalate if not reimagined quickly.

HDR DIMENSION IV: TRANSFORMING OUR FUTURE As discussed in the 2020 HDR, to steer actions towards transformational change, it is important to empower people in three ways: by enhancing equity, by pursuing innovation and by instilling a sense of stewardship of nature. \u25cb Prevalence of severe food insecurity in the adult population, female \u25cb Gender Inequality Index (GII): A composite measure reflecting inequality in achievement between women and men in three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market \u25cb Increase in vulnerable people in coastal zones, by 2100: Additional ranks of vulnerable people due to permanent rises in sea levels by 2100 (under conditions of no mitigation) \u25cb Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI): HDI value adjusted for inequalities in the three basic dimensions of human development \u25cb Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI): Percentage of the population that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations \u25cb Solar photovoltaic, electricity capacity: Solar photovoltaic refers to electricity capacity from solar photovoltaic measured in megawatts \u25cb Terrestrial protected areas: Totally or partially protected areas of at least 1,000 hectares that are designated by national authorities as scientific reserves with limited public access, national parks, natural monuments, nature reserves or wildlife sanctuaries, protected landscapes and areas managed mainly for sustainable use 21 INDIGENOUS FUTURES INTERVENTIONS FOR TRANSFORMING OUR FUTURE \u25cb Gender and food security \u2013 Many Many Indigenous communities and nations have more than two genders/gender roles. The well-being and health of those community members must be measured as this would offer additional insights into inclusive futures and overall community health. \u25cb Sea levels and health \u2013 Centring how interconnected coastal human and non-human communities respond to climate change and rising waters. \u25cb For terrestrial and oceanic protected areas \u2013 Structuring organizations and development systems to understand, monitor and protect core members of non-human species groups that ensure the health and flourishing of their groups, such as mother trees, matriarch whales and orca, among others. \u25b6 For communities deeply connected to freshwater or ocean areas: recognizing their (re) generative development protocols and metrics differ from those that are more inland, noting how different water-affiliated communities might have similar patterns/processes. \u25cb Reciprocity over stewardship \u2013 shifting stewardship ideas to create processes of active care and reciprocity. Stewardship must be place-based and hyper-local, with interconnected networks to support larger-scale well-being and responses to crises as they emerge. \u25cb (Re)generating reserves and areas \u2013 Understanding and centring how Indigenous land and water practices are different from national and international articulations of preserves and sanctuaries. \u25cb Shifting to local, place-based Indigenous protocols and rules around sacred or protected areas and ancient practices of harvesting/culling, which offer protection against climate and disease. CONCLUSION The same patterns and structures of Indigenous erasure or \u02bbrepackaging\u02bb Indigenous concepts and relationalities \u2013 without having Indigenous people at the centre of place-based development \u2013 will repeat the same failures, only with more devastating consequences as climate change escalates in both intensity and scale. This is a call to insist that local, place-based Indigenous-led groups are established and supported to build and maintain these processes \u2013 starting with the \u2018think tanks\u2019 and those in the early planning stages, through to the funding agencies and managers. Steps must also be taken to ensure that unexpected developments or outcomes are not seen as failures (not meeting some linear timeline). Rather, these moments of breakdown/stalling/crisis are crucial parts of these processes. They are necessary for the next stages of (re)growth and community building. They are part of the metrics and outcomes. Instead of making space to fail or \u2018fail forward,\u2019 we frame these Indigenous futures-oriented iterations and processes as both central and measurable. The spaces and opportunities created are to test, iterate and assess (re)generative development, but always from place-based and past-as-future standpoints. 22 When Indigenous governance protocols are centred, there is a place for everyone.

Whether we call the current global tipping points the Anthropocene, Cthulucene, or pre-apocalypse, Indigenous communities are here and remind us that this chain of large-scale global crises is neither the first nor only one that humanity has encountered. To frame current events as such continues patterns of Indigenous erasure and centres the current mainstream way of life as the only possible way. There are, have been and will be other ways \u2013 we just have to centre them, listen to them, and join them. To close, I return to Kuwada\u2019s opening piece: \u201cAll of these things done in the name of rootless progress show (un) surprisingly little care for trying to truly progress and create a future that we all want for the coming generations. And when you see the possibility of \u2018progress\u2019 in this more connected way, you see that we are actually the ones looking to the future. We are trying to get people back to the right timescale, so that they can understand how they are connected to what is to come\u2026 Protecting the \u02bb\u0101ina, carrying on our traditions, speaking our language, and acting as kahu for our sacred places are not things measured in days, or weeks, or even years. This work spans generations and eras and epochs. The future is a realm we have inhabited for thousands of years. You cannot do otherwise when you rely on the land and sea to survive. All of our gathering practices and agricultural techniques, the patterned mat of lo\u02bbi kalo, the breath passing in and out of the loko i\u02bba, the K\u016b and Hina of picking plants are predicated on looking ahead. This ensures that the land is productive into the future, that the sea will still be abundant into the future, and that our people will still thrive into the future. This is the future we are leading the way to, the future we are going to live in, the future our ancestors fought for, the future we still fight for.

An increased focus on our planetary obligations, on digital futures, on greater equity and on future generations behooves us to renew our commitment to rights and to broaden our conceptions of rights to build more just, equitable and sustainable futures. It captures the relevance of rights to enhancing development and capabilities, particularly in the context of the threats and challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region, and hones in on three areas for future focus: \u2022 \u2022 Creating more just economic futures \u2022 \u2022 Respecting our planetary obligations and the rights of future generations \u2022 \u2022 Building digitally inclusive and deliberative societies It addresses the role of business and the information ecosystem in strengthening rights, and concludes with a call to address the perception of rights by diverse stakeholders and the need for greater commitment to policies that respect rights, while highlighting the connection between rights, individual capabilities and agency, societal norms and values and development.

Human rights are essential to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Two key capabilities that are tied to human development \u2013 to live healthy lives and to have access to education \u2013 are also intrinsic to human rights. In the words of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \u201cdevelopment can be a powerful tool, but it can also be a tool of the powerful unless fundamental rights are part of its design.\u201d3 Rights, however, are not static and permanently etched in stone. In the last century alone, we have seen the changes in norms and perspectives that have enabled women, ethnic and sexual minorities, people with disabilities and indigenous communities to advocate for and realize rights that had long been denied to them. Today, although rights are under attack and their legitimacy questioned by some, movements to shape notions of rights and expand claimants\u2019 rights must be taken seriously for human rights to remain relevant and impactful.4 5 FIGURE 2: Dimensions of Rights1 CHALLENGES AND THREATS: THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION Significant progress has been made in the Asia-Pacific region in recent decades, in areas ranging from extreme poverty reduction5 to the expansion of social protection programmes to greater access to education for women.6 However, the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme inequality and climate change threaten to unravel such progress and to entrench inequity. As United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, stated, \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic raced across pre-existing fault-lines in every society, exploiting and enlarging human rights gaps.\u201d7 Recent surveys show that a vast majority of households in developing countries in Asia experienced declines in household income during the pandemic, due to lost jobs or underemployment, restrictions on mobility and business slowdown, with an estimated 75 to 80 million being pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic.8 Increased economic insecurity for millions of vulnerable households was accompanied by increased food insecurity, gender-based violence, widening wage and labour market gaps for women, learning losses for children and a range of health disruptions.9 In addition to such socio-economic fallouts that disproportionately affect vulnerable people, government responses to the pandemic exacerbated the human rights challenges they experience. Failures to acknowledge the severity of the pandemic and to provide for adequate public health 1 Czech jurist Karel Vasak described three generations of human rights in 1979: the first generation includes civil and political rights, the second generation includes economic social cultural rights and the third generation includes collective rights. I have adapted this to frame it as dimensions of rights, not generations, to imply that they are com- plementary and concurrent, as opposed to sequential. Dimensions of Rights ECONOMIC SOCIAL CULTURAL RIGHTS CIVIL POLITICAL RIGHTS COLLECTIVE RIGHTS INCLUDING THE RIGHTS OF NATURE 6 protections, combined with increased restrictions on journalists, civil society activists and human rights defenders, have deeply impacted the civic space and social protections for the poor and marginalized. These immediate economic, political and social repercussions of the pandemic compounded the long-term disruption and displacement due to climate change, which is resulting in rising heat and humidity, rising sea levels, water stress or extreme precipitation. Research shows that the countries in Asia most affected by climate change disruption are those with lower levels of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and that \u201cAsian GDP that is at risk from this warming accounts for more than two thirds of the total annual global GDP impacted.\u201d10 Dramatic advancements in technology in recent times have the potential to uplift millions from poverty, open access to education and information and democratize civic participation and engagement. Yet human rights violations are increasingly permeating the digital space, with concerns about surveillance, censorship and government control of citizens. Countries throughout Asia have passed restrictive legislation or implemented internet shutdowns \u2013 often using the pandemic as a pretext \u2013 and have cracked down on freedom of assembly, association and expression online and in the analogue world.11 LOOKING AHEAD: RE-ENVISIONING RIGHTS How best to meet the challenges of economic inequality, climate change and technology\u2019s impact on society?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e5d3d08-778b-4356-8017-45b0d623b2c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e5d3d08-778b-4356-8017-45b0d623b2c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "NEW CATEGORIES OF RIGHTS | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c74e89e5187ed28bd9b8759f72dfa3d1cb43f04896a1b9eafdecdb412dc6f4d8"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a97a6d4-19b9-44f1-a9ee-7d56ed7aac0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0fc326503d37c88dfb76033b428da733bd584a01ea89a0ad75d5a7b3091420b"}}, "hash": "d82ade06c0035107c2d99d56554ce8f3d9b3d239d973912023229ee1f8d3c032", "text": "Rights are one clear path: they centre the needs of the most vulnerable and dispossessed, they are a universal language and they focus on a range of capabilities, freedoms and opportunities required for us to thrive: \u201cRights comprise at the very least the minimal requirements of a good society.

It also proposes cross-cutting themes that will affect the adoption, realization and impact of rights and the nurturing of societies that respect rights in the Asia-Pacific region. 7 Creating More Just Economic Futures Building more just economic futures will require tackling institutional arrangements and structures that perpetuate inequity and poverty. It also requires us to respond nimbly in instances where war, conflict, natural disasters, genocide or other cataclysmic events cause severe human suffering: for example, it is estimated that 97 percent of Afghanistan could plunge into universal poverty in 2022.13 Finding a balance between responding to such immediate crises and longer-term future priorities is an imperative for governments, international institutions and civil society. The realization that economic growth as measured by GDP does not sufficiently account for the measure of a society\u2019s well-being led the international community to broaden its understanding of and approach to development to include individual capabilities and equity. Rights, in particular economic rights, also play an integral role in this regard. \u201cEconomic, social and cultural rights,\u201d according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \u201care those human rights relating to the workplace, social security, family life, participation in cultural life, and access to housing, food, water, health care and education.\u201d14 These rights and freedoms, like other rights and freedoms, include both freedom from the state and freedom through the state.15 Bringing a gender lens to such efforts continues to be an imperative for more just and equitable economic futures: according to UN Women, two out three people who are poor in Asia are women.16 Gender budgeting \u2013 a tool to ensure gender justice and fiscal equity \u2013 can help with empowering women, reducing inequality and improving development outcomes. According to Philip Alston, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, \u201cPoverty is a political choice and its elimination requires the following actions: (i) reconceptualizing the relationship between growth and poverty elimination; (ii) tackling inequality and embracing redistribution; (iii) promoting tax justice; (iv) implementing universal social protection; (v) centring the role of government; (vi) embracing participatory governance; and (vii) adapting international poverty measurement.\u201d17 Tackling poverty and inequality, therefore, requires addressing the duties and obligations of states in garnering revenues in a progressive manner, providing public services and centring participation and accountability. One important new right that can play a transformative role in advancing economic rights and equity is a right to live free from corruption. Corruption is a pervasive problem across Asia, irrespective of the nature of government. For example, the Philippines loses 20 percent of annual GDP to corruption, while one in two individuals in India had to pay a bribe in 2019.18 Eight in ten Indonesians say bribes are commonplace in dealing with both public and private sector institutions.19 Countries like Afghanistan, Cambodia and North Korea rank the lowest in Asia Pacific on the Corruption Perception Index.20 Corruption was often thought of as an economic loss or financial crime, or even as the \u201ccost of doing business.\u201d Neither the Universal Declaration of Human Rights nor the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights mention the word, \u201ccorruption\u201d. The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) \u2013 the only legally binding anti- corruption instrument \u2013 was adopted in 2003 and ratified by all countries in the Asia- Pacific region. It includes five main areas: preventive measures, criminalization and law enforcement, international cooperation, asset recovery and technical assistance and information exchange.21 8 It is only in recent times that corruption has begun to be thought of in the context of human rights. \u201cCorruption kills,\u201d said United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, in 2013.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f920229-d6c0-4614-8063-095c170e28c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f920229-d6c0-4614-8063-095c170e28c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "NEW CATEGORIES OF RIGHTS | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43808ad356ddbc66930439d408e5dc7744efd587ea10ed969e3fa7efe1732165"}, "2": {"node_id": "71a41797-94dc-4d52-995e-f070f5ad8cea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13c17cc7fa231baf63e72f8188e03d57d90c70e3ea73263db504d11226d888f9"}}, "hash": "9fee34b929cb50bb37e47b262bedcc0d5ea68519dbc74fa76b13f7a0972359e9", "text": "\u201cThe money stolen through corruption every year is enough to feed the world\u2019s hungry 80 times over.\u201d22 Corruption is linked to human rights in at least four ways: it limits the ability of the poor to exercise their rights as the impact of corruption is felt more by the poor; it limits the ability of governments to gather revenues, to spend on public programmes thereby meeting the economic, social and cultural rights of citizens; illicit money is often connected to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9933ad1e-a113-4c39-9709-c6e174eee3ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "9933ad1e-a113-4c39-9709-c6e174eee3ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "NEW CATEGORIES OF RIGHTS | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "458648d64089831fa9e244cc55c7c1ab789a0b6188f77c526452a259098482fe"}}, "hash": "458648d64089831fa9e244cc55c7c1ab789a0b6188f77c526452a259098482fe", "text": "illegal activities, such as trafficking; and corrupt institutional and policy design benefits the powerful.23 This entrenched problem has taken on a new urgency in the wake of the pandemic. An article in the Boston Globe notes, \u201cthe response to the pandemic will be a bonanza for kleptocrats\u2019\u2019 and \u201c[g] overnments are poised to provide trillions of dollars to counter the pandemic, without even the usual, often ineffective, safeguards to assure that the funds are properly spent.\u201d24 As we look to the future, tackling corruption as both a human rights violation and as a development and policy imperative can have significant upsides. Viewing corruption through a human rights lens, and even establishing a right to live free from corruption, can help with ensuring that the programmes and services targeting the poor reach the intended beneficiaries. Article 35 of the UNCAC requires states to provide a remedy for victims of corruption, which could serve as a basis for such a right.25 A treaty-based right to a legal remedy for victims of corruption can help civil society organizations, anti-corruption advocates and lawyers build such an enforceable right.26 Although the Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not mention a right to a basic income, such a right can help ensure that the millions of vulnerable individuals and families in the Asia- Pacific region, who live at or below the poverty level, are able to build opportunities for not only survival, but also for a flourishing future. Universal Basic Income (UBI), defined as \u201ca transfer that is provided universally, unconditionally, and in cash\u201d, 27 can be a powerful tool in ensuring economic rights for all peoples. With two thirds of the Asia-Pacific labour force in the informal sector28 and with large-scale migration within and across borders, UBI can be a positive force in strengthening financial sustainability, resilience and opportunity for the poor. There are currently no national, universal UBI programmes, although there has been one large- scale UBI experiment in a region in the Republic of Korea and small-scale experiments or targeted interventions in other countries. Any wide-scale adoption of UBI must ensure, however, that such programmes do not replicate patterns of exclusion, or inadvertently result in state abdication of responsibility for welfare programmes. For example, Amartya Sen argues that India is not ready for UBI, as it would result in cash transfers in a privatizing economy, instead of grain and food that help meet the basic nutritional needs of the poor.29 A right to a basic income can ensure that a basic income is guaranteed across countries in the Asia- Pacific region, while allowing for each country to identify how best to structure and implement it. Framing it as a right rather than a policy prescription will ensure that such a programme is not the first to be cut in challenging times, and will be consistent with a guarantee of a basic standard of living. The third pillar of meeting the economic inequality challenge focuses on tax justice and more redistributive tax policies and practices, possibly through a right to a fair, transparent, and progressive taxation system. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for among the lowest average tax 9 rate in the world, with countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Iran collecting 10 percent or less of GDP in taxes.30 While the connection between taxes and human rights might not be immediately obvious, regressive tax policies and lack of enforcement can deepen inequality and reduce funds for public programmes and services. Despite progress in alleviating progress in the Asia-Pacific region, income inequality remains high, with a pre-pandemic Gini coefficient of 0.36 on average (as compared to 0.32 in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries), while spending on social protection is a mere 7 percent of GDP (compared to 21 percent in OECD countries).31 Asia\u2019s wealth gap is one of the largest in the world, with implications for future generations.32 OECD research points to the need for \u201cwidening the tax base and greater progressivity in taxation and financing of social insurance schemes33\u201d in order to help taxation programmes combat poverty. Respecting Our Planetary Obligations and the Rights of Future Generations The impacts of environmental degradation and pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss impact the most vulnerable communities and their economic, social and cultural rights, including the rights to food and water and sustainable livelihoods. Rights, however, can also provide a pathway to respecting our planetary obligations, the rights of future generations and the rights of Nature.

In October 2021, the United Nations passed a long-awaited resolution recognizing access to a healthy and sustainable environment as a universal right. This can be literally lifesaving: the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 24 percent of global deaths are linked to the environment.36 The poorest and most marginalized communities who have often contributed least to greenhouse emissions suffer the most. The pandemic has only intensified the urgency of addressing global environmental challenges, as COVID-19 reflects not only a public health crisis, but also a broader environmental crisis of habitat and biodiversity loss. In 2020, the Asia-Pacific region produced 16.75 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions, higher than the total combined emissions of all other regions, with China accounting for 60 percent of the region\u2019s emissions and over 30 percent of the world\u2019s total.37 South Asia is the most polluted region in the world, home to 42 of the 50 most polluted cities in the world.38 And eight of the ten rivers with the most plastic pollution are in Asia.39 Pollution has a disproportionate effect on the poor. Biodiversity loss in the Asia-Pacific region is acute: while the region is rich in biodiversity, as much as half of that could be lost by the end of the century, with as much as 63 percent of GDP affected due to loss of economic activity that relies on natural capital.40 10 In the case of the low-lying Pacific islands, climate change and rising sea levels threaten their very way of life, with nearly all Pacific Islanders vulnerable to sea level rise.41 Low-lying coral atolls and reef islands, such as Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Tokelau, are among the most vulnerable, while Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are considered among the world\u2019s most disaster-prone nations.42 The phenomenon of \u201cclimate refugees\u201d \u2013 individuals and communities displaced due to climate change-induced disasters \u2013 is on the rise, whether due to drought (with implications for food and water shortages) or rising sea levels. The top four countries for new displacements in 2019 are all in Asia \u2013 India, with the greatest number, followed by Philippines, Bangladesh and China respectively.43 The needs of climate refugees are not only humanitarian and development-related, but also squarely in the realm of rights, with inadequate protections for such individuals and communities. According to an OHCHR report, climate change affects a range of human rights, including the \u201crights to life, self-determination, development, food, health, water and sanitation and housing.\u201d44 The report also indicates that the human rights framework is critical to addressing climate change \u2013 because global mitigation and adaptation efforts should be guided by \u201chuman rights norms and principles including the rights to participation and information, transparency, accountability, equity and non- discrimination.\u201d45 The connections between environmental concerns and human rights are clear \u2013 with the grim reminder that as the climate crisis escalates, attacks on environmental defenders and indigenous activists have increased, with 2020 being a record year, according to Global Witness.46 Their research found that most killings occurred in states with limited civic freedoms, underscoring the importance of freedom of expression, a free press, a robust civil society and the rule of law. In Asia, the Philippines stood out as a country of concern. Core elements of a human-rights based approach to climate change, according to UN Women, include substantive rights, such as the right to life and health, governance and accountability, which includes transparency and access to justice and procedural rights, such as the inclusion of communities in decision-making.47 The United Nations Human Rights Council\u2019s resolution is a historical step towards creating a binding legal framework for environmental protection and it has significant implications for environmental rights and the rights of the poor who are often most affected by environmental harms. It can help spur collective action around the world. It could also have positive ripple effects, for example, on the status of climate refugees \u2013 individuals suffering from displacement due to climate-induced disasters or prolonged environmental shifts, such as drought,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bddf309-38db-4597-a2c3-54458cfeab7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0bddf309-38db-4597-a2c3-54458cfeab7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "NEW CATEGORIES OF RIGHTS | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "350f80cd7c1e1e00920f664cdf05f24366d0b84276e655e67e0fad217f47248f"}}, "hash": "350f80cd7c1e1e00920f664cdf05f24366d0b84276e655e67e0fad217f47248f", "text": "earthquakes, flooding and crop loss. As we think about protecting the rights of those most affected by environmental change \u2013 indigenous communities, slum dwellers and other vulnerable communities \u2013 we must address the rights of future generations. Protecting our collective rights and obligations to ensure intergenerational equity must be high on the agenda. Sixty percent of the world\u2019s youth live in the Asia-Pacific region,48 which has significant implications for our collective efforts to protect the rights of future generations. Future efforts to stem environmental degradation and loss must not only focus on the impact of nature on humans, however, but also on the rights of Nature herself. For example, warning of significant loss in biodiversity in the Asia-Pacific region, the United Nations Environment Programme states that \u201cBiodiversity \u2013 the essential variety of life forms on Earth \u2013 continues to decline in every 11 region of the world, significantly reducing nature\u2019s capacity to contribute to people\u2019s well-being.\u201d49 (Emphasis added.) Respecting the rights of Nature goes beyond the human-centred approach of Nature\u2019s contribution to our own well-being. While the rights of Nature are more prominent in the discourse and policy developments in Latin American countries, such as Ecuador and Bolivia, they are also significant in those of many countries in Asia. For example, Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court recently upheld a decision to ban cement plants in environmentally fragile zones50 and in July 2019 Bangladesh granted the country\u2019s rivers the same legal status of humans. Similarly, a river in New Zealand and the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India were given the same legal status as humans in 2017, with guardians appointed on behalf of the rivers.51 As in any contested domain where such rights might expand, difficult questions arise about the enforceability of rights, resources allocated to implementation and enforcement, the role of norms shaping versus legal and policy change and who acts as stewards and what are the consequences of such choices. It is important to note that securing and expanding rights in the face of climate change involves not only legal strategies, but also an emphasis on principles of participation, transparency and accountability, non-discrimination and equality, and inclusion of vulnerable and indigenous communities most affected by climate change. In many indigenous cultures and traditions around the world, the earth, water, wind and other forms of Nature are not inanimate, but are imbued with life and are worthy of respect and rights. Humans are not seen as distinct from Nature, but as one part of Nature. Complementing the human right to a healthy environment \u2013 and a logical extension \u2013 are the rights of Nature. \u201cIt makes sense to attribute rights to Nature as a whole \u2013 to the system upon which the Earth itself depends \u2013 even if not every element of that system independently deserves the status of rights holder.\u201d52 What this means then is that the \u201crights of Nature\u201d could refer to the rights of certain parts of Nature \u2013 such as a river \u2013 and to the whole of Nature. \u201cA critical question is whether those rights are determined by what is good for human beings... or by what is good for Nature itself.\u201d53 Building Digitally Inclusive and Deliberative Societies Technological advancements in recent decades have transformed the human experience in every facet of life \u2013 from education to employment to communication. Much of the euphoria around digitization has been tempered by the more recent realization that technology is used by corporations and governments to surveil populations, and that it can help reproduce patterns of exclusion, discrimination and exploitation. Winners and losers in the digital era (\u201cdigital divides\u201d) often mirror historical divides, requiring urgent policy solutions grounded in respect for rights and equality. For example, despite rapid expansion in e-commerce and social media throughout the Asia-Pacific region, digital divides remain with respect to gender, age and geography. Rural residents are 37 percent less likely to use mobile Internet than urban residents, and women in Least Developed Countries are 52 percent less likely than men to be online.54 As mentioned earlier, digital rights and freedoms need to focus both on \u201cfreedom from the state\u201d and \u201cfreedom through the state\u201d \u2013 digital inclusion and access to the best that technology can offer in improving the human condition, while establishing guardrails against the unfettered use of sophisticated surveillance by governments and corporations that have implications for our privacy, 12 autonomy, safety and dignity. Three areas of concern are highlighted in this brief that have profound implications for building digitally inclusive and deliberative futures: shutdowns and surveillance, particularly in the context of the pandemic; large-scale biometric identification and tracking programmes;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "320415d5-434a-435f-8590-c22a9fd2a4b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "320415d5-434a-435f-8590-c22a9fd2a4b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "NEW CATEGORIES OF RIGHTS | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4be0f7cc251d82bc121e13fe461f2ebb84b5d3b1c9e340afe3a48f643c420e7d"}}, "hash": "4be0f7cc251d82bc121e13fe461f2ebb84b5d3b1c9e340afe3a48f643c420e7d", "text": "and the use of social media platforms to spread disinformation and hate. Internet shutdowns in India and Pakistan and in other countries in Asia, such as Indonesia, Myanmar and Tajikistan, are cause for concern, as governments shut down the internet to control the spread of information and communication, while in the case of China high levels of internet censorship and surveillance exist.55 Research by Canada-based Citizen Lab uncovered the use of sophisticated surveillance spyware in at least five large-scale operations in Asia, affecting Bangladesh, India, Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, as well as in many countries around the world.56 This spyware \u2013 for sale only to governments and for national security, anti-terrorism and crime-fighting purposes \u2013 has been misused to hack into the phones of individuals. The human rights risks and harms far outweigh any potential benefits, given that journalists, human rights defenders and political dissidents have been targeted by such malware. The pandemic has served as a pretext for increased mass surveillance in many parts of Asia, especially in Cambodia, China, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand.57 Increased surveillance, home searches, data breaches and contact tracing amid lack of adequate regulations and public oversight raise concerns that emergency measures instituted in the context of the pandemic might become permanent. Thailand banned the spreading of \u2018false messages\u2019 and news that could pose a threat to state security, a move criticized as stifling freedom of association and expression under the pretext of the pandemic and national security, while Myanmar\u2019s new cyber laws allow the military unlimited access to individual citizens\u2019 user data.58 While North Korea is one of the world\u2019s most repressive countries, the government used the pandemic as a pretext to further block information flowing in and out of the country and also to introduce other repressive measures, such as harshly controlling access to food.59 The use of large-scale biometric identification projects may hold promise of financial inclusion and reduction of corruption. They do raise concerns around adequate privacy safeguards and the appropriate procedures to protect the data of vulnerable communities, issues that need to be centred in programme design and development. The use of social media platforms to spread hate and disinformation has significant implications for the health and flourishing of communities and societies in the Asia-Pacific region. The United Nations Report of the independent international Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar cited a range of Facebook posts and the use of the Facebook platform by military leaders and Buddhist monks to spread a hate and disinformation campaign against the Rohingya.60 In Bangladesh, online campaigns against religious minorities falsely accused them of anti-Muslim blasphemy.61 In these instances, as well as in other countries in South and Southeast Asia, the online spread of hate speech and disinformation is complemented by and contributes to violence, vandalism and brutal killings. Government attempts to tackle such challenges through legislation limiting free speech might inadvertently, or even deliberately, stifle citizen engagement and mobilization. Although a right to privacy is well-established in many constitutions around the world, the argument that privacy is less important than, for example, the right not to be tortured, or the right to life, as well as the argument that privacy is a Western value, makes it imperative that this right be bolstered and upheld in a digital age. In many instances, violations to the right to privacy go hand-in-hand 13 with violations of other rights and freedoms, particularly when it comes to journalists, human rights defenders, anti-corruption advocates and environmental activists. Furthermore, surveillance traditions and laws inherited from the colonial era, combined with a current lack of democratic and human rights protections, behoove us to ensure that the right to privacy is centred in government policies, laws and initiatives, even if such initiatives are framed as technology for social good. Citizen-led, civil society-based initiatives to promote digital literacy and civic education, appropriate governance of technology platforms and accountability of government agencies and programmes can play an important role in mitigating future technological harms and better harnessing technology\u2019s potential. BUSINESS, THE INFORMATION ECOSYSTEM AND HUMAN RIGHTS The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (\u201cRuggie principles\u201d) are guidelines for states and corporations to prevent, address and remedy human rights violations in business practice and can serve as a powerful, albeit voluntary, tool to promote corporate transparency and accountability. The guiding principles rest on three pillars: protect (state duty to protect human rights); respect (corporate responsibility to respect rights); and remedy (for victims of business-related rights violations).62 \u201cThese Guiding Principles,\u201d states the document, \u201care grounded in recognition of: (a) States\u2019 existing obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "575c6c8f-4e50-4e3f-94e5-b30592b65574": {"__data__": {"id_": "575c6c8f-4e50-4e3f-94e5-b30592b65574", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "NEW CATEGORIES OF RIGHTS | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be7cf7a138ee0d33894753f003fb56a0caa43d88ce9beef7dd5cb21de73b7928"}}, "hash": "be7cf7a138ee0d33894753f003fb56a0caa43d88ce9beef7dd5cb21de73b7928", "text": "fundamental freedoms; (b) The role of business enterprises as specialized organs of society performing specialized functions, required to comply with all applicable laws and to respect human rights; (c) The need for rights and obligations to be matched to appropriate and effective remedies when breached. These Guiding Principles apply to all States and to all business enterprises, both transnational and others, regardless of their size, sector, location, ownership and structure.\u201d Applying the United Nations Guiding Principles in the digital age requires cross-sector collaboration to ensure the following: that technology platforms integrate human rights concerns in the design, development and deployment of technologies; that business models and data protection standards are transparent and respect rights; and that states protect and respect digital rights, rather than use technologies to further amass power and control. Similarly, applying the United Nations Guiding Principles in the context of climate change can ensure that states hold companies accountable. Businesses, after all, play a central role in climate change, as business and economic activities contribute to CO2 emissions. Businesses can also play a role in climate change mitigation and adaptation and in new forms of economic activity that are environmentally friendly. In addition to the United Nations Guiding Principles serving as a protection against climate-related human rights abuses by business, the UNOHCHR recommends that businesses should undertake the following: reduce greenhouse gas emissions; improve transparency through climate disclosures; disclose corporate lobbying related to climate; ensure free, prior and informed consent of affected communities; protect environmental human rights defenders and support civic space; ensure access 14 to the benefits of science is universal; help move to a climate resilient economy; and ensure justice in climate action.63 On a related note, the right to information can be a powerful tool to promote transparency, accountability and justice, and to ensure that civil society can hold governments and businesses accountable. According to Delia Ferreira Rubio, Chair of Transparency International, \u201cA well- functioning Right to Information system is critical for exposing and deterring abuses of power, and for supporting the fight against corruption.\u201d64 While over 120 countries around the world have a Right to Information, these laws are often weak, ineffective or noncompliant with international standards. Strengthening the right to information in the Asia-Pacific region can play an important role in fighting corruption and strengthening public accountability, while also promoting citizens\u2019 participation, freedom of expression and the media ecosystem. Looking Ahead: Re-envisioning Rights \u2013 Respecting Public Spheres and Societies While rights might be portrayed by some leaders as a Western preoccupation or a distraction from development, rights are essential for human development and for the survival and flourishing of the planet in the coming decades. The expansion of rights might be questioned by those who critique the human rights framework and movement, and by those who urge us to focus on core rights. However, the changing landscape facing vulnerable communities in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 caused by demographic and environmental changes, rapid advancements in technology and science and deepening economic fragility \u2013 require us to focus on the consolidation of existing rights and the reconceptualization and expansion of rights to accommodate these new realities. Building public support and institutional momentum around consolidating and strengthening existing rights and expanding new rights is no easy task. According to CIVICUS, a global civil society association, closing civic space \u2013 \u201cthe bedrock of any open and democratic society\u201d \u2013 in Asia is cause for concern: they highlight the Philippines which was downgraded from obstructed to repressed, due to the vilification and attacks on human rights defenders and journalists.65 Closing civic space impacts the freedoms of association, assembly and expression, but it has a close connection to and impact on a range of other rights and freedoms, such as the right to vote. The Asia-Pacific region, however, has a long-standing history, an established tradition of robust rights. Civil society and social movements in many countries have vibrant and forward-looking strategies to promote accountability. Recent democratic backsliding in many parts of the region and a decline in public trust in all types of institutions require a purposeful focus on policy and public messages to deepen cultures that respect rights and practices. Investing in education, including human rights education, is essential for an informed and engaged society and for accountable and effective governments. National and regional human rights institutions and coalitions and social movements must be supported and strengthened, and laws to regulate civil society must be updated to ensure that such institutions are able to thrive. Domestic sources of funding are essential for such work to ensure that such institutions can set their own agendas and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb8a50a8-a544-4fa5-8a95-023455dcf2bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb8a50a8-a544-4fa5-8a95-023455dcf2bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "NEW CATEGORIES OF RIGHTS | REIMAGINING DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC FORESIGHT BRIEF", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "340af99eaec16d856883f091e72f16b4714657ed76c24b0bc9ce690c818e2054"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c32022e-445e-47bc-b5c7-7c9a03e5cd16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/new-categories-rights-reimagining-development-asia-and-pacific-foresight-brief", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76d32aeeebea34e1aa6277858c8f14f85112edcc71fc25d6ad1f6ffad5e0b968"}}, "hash": "3e4306a7f62f1de49d436a799c40d81822eca4220715059ec6f239c27a373da0", "text": "priorities in alignment with local communities and their leadership. In all these efforts, the perspectives and leadership of women and marginalized communities must be centred in order to ensure that policies and programmes address the deep- seated disparities and lived realities of those for whom the promise of rights is still to be realized. 15 The notion that rights can strengthen individual capabilities and agency, as well as shape and be shaped by societal norms and values, thereby contributing to human development, is one that needs to be reinforced by trusted institutions and leaders. The capabilities approach \u2013 pioneered by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum and adopted by many institutions including the United Nations \u2013 provides a strong foundation to connect individual well-being and flourishing with their ability to secure and realize related rights. The notion that societal norms and values, individual capabilities and agency can be forged by, and contribute to, determining the future of development and a future with rights is important as we invest in building more just, sustainable and prosperous futures in the Asia-Pacific region.

The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 3 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PUBLICATION Reducing inequality is at the heart of leaving no one behind and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet inequality remains the greatest chal- lenge to achieving sustainable development. This poli- cy brief has been prepared based on discussions at the 6th ASEAN\u2013China\u2013UNDP Symposium on the SDGs, guided by the theme \u2018Reducing Inequality in the De- cade of Action to Achieve the SDGs and Recovery from COVID-19 Pandemic\u2019, jointly organized by the ASEAN Secretariat, the Mission of the People\u2019s Republic of China to ASEAN, the United Nations Development Pro- gramme (UNDP), and the Philippines as the Chair of the ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Rural Develop- ment and Poverty Eradication (SOMRDPE). It outlines and elaborates on approaches to reducing inequality in the ASEAN region to achieve the SDGs. Moreover, this paper discusses specific dimensions of the differential impacts on the population which cover five key issues: jobs, social protection, education, health and food se- curity. It concludes by discussing an exit strategy and suggests a series of exit indicators that ASEAN coun- tries may consider monitoring.

It conducts the analysis through five important aspects of inequalities: jobs, social protection, education, health and food security. The policy brief builds on the long-standing cooperation between ASEAN, China and UNDP for the SDGs, and out- comes of the 6th ASE AN\u2013China\u2013UNDP Symposium on the SDGs held on 7 December 2021. With the theme 'Re- ducing Inequality in the Decade of Action to Achieve the SDGs and Recovery from COVID-19 Pandemic', the sym- posium was jointly organized by the ASEAN Secretariat, the Mission of the People\u2019s Republic of China to ASEAN, and UNDP, with support from the ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Rural Development and Poverty Eradication (SOMRDPE), under the leadership of the Philippines.

Deng Xijun Ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to ASEAN Paterna M. Ruiz Chair of the ASEAN SOMRDPE Christophe Bahuet UNDP Deputy Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific FOREWORD The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 8 Reducing inequalities and ensuring no one is left behind are integral to achieving the Sus- tainable Development Goals (SDGs). Though progress has been achieved, much effort is still needed to reduce inequality in the region. This is particularly critical as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to exacerbate the incidence of inequality. The impact of the pandemic has reversed the progress made towards gender equality. Areas where progress is cur- rently noticeable might experience a regression soon if no concerted action is taken. Sus- tained and targeted interventions are needed to address the needs of those who are hit hardest by the pandemic \u2013 particularly low-income households, workers in the informal sector, ethnic minorities, migrant workers, and women in all settings. This policy brief was developed to assist policymakers in unpacking and understanding in- equality in relation to achieving the SDGs in the ASEAN region. It provides analysis and offers recommendations especially to ensure equity through more decent jobs; bridge the inequal- ity in the quality of work through improved social protection; reduce inequality in education and health; address poverty, the rural\u2013urban divide and food security; and improve data to monitor the progress. The policy brief intends to inform the initiatives of ASEAN sectoral bodies to build back bet- ter from the pandemic, acknowledge the gendered impacts and narrow the existing gaps in society. The policy brief likewise contributes to the implementation of the ASEAN Compre- hensive Recovery Framework (ACRF), which sets out strategies and provides concrete mea- sures to respond to the pandemic and protect vulnerable groups. Lastly, it provides useful information to navigate and steer regional cooperation to foster achievement of the SDG targets in the coming years. The development of the policy brief benefited from the discussion during the 6th ASE AN\u2013 China\u2013UNDP Symposium: Reducing Inequality in the Decade of Action to Achieve the SDGs and Recovery from COVID-19 Pandemic, which was held on 7 December 2021 under the leadership of the ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Rural Development and Poverty Eradi- cation (SOMRDPE).

There is little prospect of their being mitigated in the absence of re- newed growth. Recovery is expected: according to the most recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook Update, the growth estimate for ASEAN is 3.1 percent in 2021, and the projection is 5.6 percent in 2022.2 A rise in inequality triggers an increase in the incidence of poverty. It is estimated that a 1 percent increase in the Gini Index in each country in 2020 would increase the number of additional poor people by around 15 per- cent\u2014or around 152 million people. Going beyond in- come poverty, around 7.7 percent of the population of Southeast Asia are at risk of falling into multidimension- al poverty as a result of the pandemic.3 In ASEAN, the rate of rural poverty is higher, with around 18 percent of rural people living below the poverty line.4 At regional level, ASEAN is currently implementing the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, which contains a comprehensive response, including mea- sures to protect vulnerable groups. It is expected to contribute to avoiding widening gaps in society. This policy brief has been prepared based on discus- sions at the 6th ASEAN\u2013China\u2013UNDP Symposium on the SDGs, guided by the theme \u2018Reducing Inequality in the Decade of Action to Achieve the SDGs and Re- covery from COVID-19 Pandemic\u2019, jointly organized by the Senior Officials Meeting on Rural Development and Poverty Eradication (SOMRDPE), through the leader- ship of the Philippines, the Mission of the People\u2019s Re- public of China to ASEAN, the United Nations Develop- ment Programme (UNDP) and the ASEAN Secretariat. It outlines and elaborates on approaches to reducing inequality in the ASEAN region to achieve the SDGs. Moreover, this paper discusses specific dimensions of the differential impacts on the population which cover five key issues: jobs, social protection, education, health and food security. It concludes by discussing an ex- it strategy and suggests a series of exit indicators that ASEAN countries may consider monitoring. THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON ECONOMIC AND HUMAN WELL- BEING A survey by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) suggests that intra-country inequalities in the ASEAN region are a matter of concern.5 The impacts of COVID-19 on various dimensions of economic and social well-being are striking: Job losses. The pandemic led to lockdowns and supply disruptions, which contributed to 6.7 million job losses, in both the formal and informal sectors, between 2020 and 2021.6 Also, a significant number of workers exit- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1 International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook: Managing Divergent Recoveries, Washington, DC, April 2021, https://www.imf.org/en/ Publications/WEO/Issues/2021/03/23/world-economic-outlook-april-2021. 2 International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Update.

The size of the impact has varied across countries, driven by several factors, including the ability to control the pandemic, as well as the stringency and duration of lockdown measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Often, the crisis disproportionately affected low-paid workers, thereby increasing wage and income inequalities. Informality. The pandemic opened up an unprecedented jobs gap, but the high levels of informal workers (over 60 percent) without social security faced greater uncertain- ty than formal workers. In a survey of migrant workers in the ASEAN region, 97 percent of the unemployed migrant workers interviewed did not have access to any social security. Many workers who were originally in formal em- ployment moved into informal employment, experiencing a deterioration in working conditions, which is not reflect- ed in the job loss estimates.7 Moreover, the majority of the rural population are en- gaged in agriculture, and the vast majority have no or lit- tle social security.

Unemployment has increased, but practically no part of the workforce, including in the for- mal sector, receives unemployment benefits. Gaps also exist in the number of children/households receiving child/family cash benefits, and in the number of vulnera- ble people covered by social assistance. Education and health impacts. Given the considerable inequality at school level, the effects of a year or more of lost face-to-face schooling can be serious, even though every government has tried to ensure access to online schooling. An ADBI survey in the ASEAN region8 found that about 27 percent of children who stopped attending school could not fully participate in online learning programmes due to a weak/insufficient Inter- net connection and a lack of digital devices. Pre-exist- ing gender inequalities further exacerbated this digital divide. In terms of health, the behaviour and choices of poorer and disadvantaged individuals put them on the front lines of infection during the pandemic, causing them to bear a disproportionate burden of health costs. Food security. COVID-19 has threatened food security and undermined households\u2019 nutrition via overall stag- nation in the economy and associated income short- falls and job losses, particularly for migrant workers and poor households. Such job losses and declines in in- come typically result in consumers shifting towards \u2018ca- loric sufficiency\u2019 starch-based diets, at the expense of nutritious food. Such dietary shifts exacerbate already high rates of stunting in children under 5 years old and anaemia among women. In poorer ASEAN Member States\u2014and poorer households in particular\u2014such di- etary shifts could have longer-term adverse impacts on maternal and child health, with knock-on complications for the incidence of stunting, mental health issues and educational attainment prospects in the long term. SUGGESTED RESPONSE MEASURES The following thematic approach can help in dealing with inequalities in the ASEAN region, both in general as well as related to COVID-19, to assist in achieving SDG 10. While SDG 10 is focused on reducing inequal- ities, the approaches discussed here will also assist progress on the other SDGs. Theme 1: Ensuring equity through more jobs The ASEAN region collectively had allocated nearly 16 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to the fis- cal stimulus response as of the end of May 20219. The range of support partially reflects public budgetary constraints. However, at country level, the fiscal action may need to increase, on the strength of domestic bor- rowing, given that fiscal deficits as a share of GDP are low by historical standards and international levels. Second, the symposium highlighted differential impacts by gender, and the need to invest in building systems of the care economy to reduce the burden on women. If governments were to invest more in ensuring childcare for pre-school children, in addition to expanding access to pre-schools (which remains low), it would go a long way to ensuring that women, who were the worst affect- ed in the labour market due to the pandemic, may more easily return to work. 7 International Labour Organization, COVID-19 crisis and the informal economy: Immediate responses and policy challenges, Geneva, 2020. 8 Morgan, Peter J., Long Quang Trinh : Impacts of COVID-19 on households in ASEAN countries and their implications for human capital develop- ment, ADBI Working Paper Series, No. 1226, Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI), Tokyo, 2021. 9 Viegelahn, C., and Phu Huynh, COVID-19 and the ASEAN labour market: Impact and policy response, ILO Policy Brief, International Labour Or- ganization, Bangkok, August 2021.

Second, the pandemic has resulted in massive income and health shocks for many households, with increases in unemployment and underemployment. Reductions in income and the need for greater health spending will make it difficult for some families to cover education costs over and above the already significant out-of- pocket spending prior to COVID-19. Therefore, educa- tion budgets may require some restructuring towards school education. Third, funding will also be needed so that the impact of the pandemic does not fall disproportionately on girls, and on children in poor and vulnerable households. This has the potential to widen already stark disparities in learning outcomes among children. Fourth, it is important to take into account the needs of children with disabilities given pre-existing inequalities and the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic. Fifth, as the pandemic begins to subside, and schools reopen, it will be critical to ensure that public schools are adequately funded and that they are prevented from seeking additional fees or contributions from parents. Education institutions will also require additional fund- ing to implement new health and safety requirements, undertake the outreach activities needed to persuade students to return, and facilitate remedial teaching to minimize learning losses. School stipends, cash trans- fer programmes, school meals and fee waivers can all help to encourage children to enrol and increase their attainment and learning. Sixth, investment in digitalizing the education sec- tor could prevent any setbacks in the event of further school closures, and also serve as an investment in equipping the young generation with appropriate skills for the 21st century as the labour market potentially shifts towards the gig and green economies. Health-related measures. First, until effective vaccines and therapeutics are widely available and provided to all who need them, improving information on the pan- demic\u2019s spread and containment with widespread test- ing will enhance the ability to identify and isolate new cases, thus reducing infection risks. Second, health inequality in ASEAN is generally the re- sult of limited government expenditure on public health infrastructure, and burdensome private health expendi- ture (mostly out of pocket, due to limited coverage by health insurance). Without increasing public spending on health, private expenses cannot decrease; such expens- es can exacerbate inequality and poverty at the time of a once-in-a-century pandemic. Finally, primary and pre- ventive health measures will need to be expanded. Theme 4: Food security and minimizing the rural\u2013 urban divide in the time of COVID-19 One way to reduce extreme poverty and structural in- equalities is through accelerated food systems trans- formation that is both pro-poor and inclusive. In rural areas in particular, the transformation of agri-food sys- tems represents an opportunity for some of the poorest smallholders, who are not well integrated into food value chains. This integration of poor smallholders into food value chains could be better facilitated through public\u2013 private\u2013producer partnerships and digitization of rural and agricultural value chains, which will provide oppor- tunities to overcome poverty and structural inequalities. Actions to improve agricultural productivity and re- lieve rural distress. First, governments could acceler- ate movements to digital transactions in wholesale and retail operations and at the border for both products and people. Second, governments could consider re- placing input subsidies and output subsidies with direct income support for farming households. Third, safety nets could include migrants and food system workers. Fourth, there may be a need to explicitly include wom- en in pandemic stimulus and adjustment policies. Fifth, The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 12 governments could improve the coverage, granularity and timeliness of data on agriculture, food and nutrition to assist public and private decision-making on produc- tion, distribution and trade. Sixth, nationwide digitaliza- tion strategies need to be coupled with the identifica- tion of specific needs of rural communities to ensure impactful interventions. Finally, at regional level, ASEAN might consider estab- lishing a fund to support empowerment of rural people\u2019s organizations. Moreover, as ASEAN is currently in the process of developing a masterplan on rural develop- ment, it is suggested that the masterplan promote a com- prehensive and cross-sectoral approach to transforming rural areas, especially addressing the nexus between agriculture, food security and rural development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0528766-b009-4907-a5cd-f343e2cfeb36": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0528766-b009-4907-a5cd-f343e2cfeb36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "REDUCING INEQUALITY IN THE DECADE OF ACTION TO ACHIEVE THE SDGS AND ACCELERATE POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "024d72384d0cc3f84e77afe4aa677544b1a78e67b3458222cd896d836645490b"}, "2": {"node_id": "8372ba39-765e-4838-9534-8e5cc925a865", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6bfde568e2feca1cd8aa424f88648008e7cf8626c4e1d61afd93213ab3a4a8d8"}}, "hash": "c098fbe911594f03439041dada122a09d1022c42e5ee8b18d5414fe048e2c2c9", "text": "Theme 5: The lack of adequate data and the need for regular monitoring of an \u2018exit\u2019 strategy and indicators Data gaps persist, at least at the international level (though the same data may be available at national level, we have no way of confirming this data availability).

They must be quickly generated if they are not already being generated. In most cases, the fast-moving indicators should cut across a variety of economic and human development indicators. Of prime significance is transparent data generation on these indicators in each country with the required periodicity. There is a need to enhance statistical systems and the availability of data to monitor progress, design targeted interventions and enhance accountability. Policymak- ers, for instance, should know in which areas progress has been made, which groups are furthest behind, and which types of programme should be designed. ASEAN Member States should also use opportunities arising from technology such as big data in collecting, manag- ing and presenting data. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 13 Reducing inequality is at the heart of leaving no one be- hind and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet inequality remains the greatest challenge to achieving sustainable development. The 2019 \u2018Hu- man Development Report\u2019 comprehensively discusses how inequality is an obstacle to human development and how individuals are placed in disadvantageous sit- uations largely due to their circumstances such as sex, religion, race and place of birth, among others.10 The \u2018Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2021\u2019 indi- cated that concerted efforts are needed to improve the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) re- gion\u2019s performance to achieve the targets under Goal 10 (reducing inequality). Special attention is required to reverse the trend under Target 10.7 (safe migration and mobility).11 An increase in the Gini Index, indicating a rise in income inequality, was recorded for two ASEAN countries (In- donesia and Lao PDR).12 A deeper look into the state of inequality in the region shows a more diverse picture. This is the case, for instance, for gender-based inequal- ity. On average, ASEAN nearly reached gender parity between males and females in gross enrolment in pri- mary education, with minimal or no inequality in access to primary education in all ASEAN Member States.13 However, overall gender-based inequality remains a major issue for many countries in the region (see Table 11ii). According to the Global Gender Gap Report, which measures the gender gap from 0 (imparity) to 1 (parity), the overall score in five ASEAN Member States remains below 0.7.14 Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic will ex- acerbate and deepen inequalities unless policymakers take adequate and immediate action. A study by the In- ternational Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that the im- pacts of COVID-19 on inequality will be stronger than those of previous pandemics faced by the global com- munity.15 The negative impacts might even persist for a longer time and lead to intergenerational inequality. This is especially true in the case of inequality in vac- cine roll-out among nations. A rise in inequality triggers an increase in the incidence of poverty. It is estimated that a 1 percent increase in the Gini Index in each country in 2020 would increase the num- ber of additional poor people by around 15 percent\u2014or around 152 million people.16 Going beyond income pover- ty, around 7.7 percent of the population of Southeast Asia are at risk of falling into multidimensional poverty as a re- sult of the pandemic.17 It is important to note that the rate of rural poverty in the ASEAN region is high, with around 18 percent of rural people living below the poverty line.18 Yet without robust policies, reducing inequality is not impossible. For instance, ASEAN Member States have shown promising progress in achieving SDG 10, es- pecially Target 10.2 (social, economic and political in- clusion) and Target 10.4 (fiscal and social protection policies).19 It is also important to share, exchange and consolidate good practices in reducing inequality across ASEAN Member States. At regional level, ASEAN has also undertaken collective efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19.

The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 14 This policy brief was prepared based on discussions at the 6th ASEAN\u2013China\u2013UNDP Symposium on the SDGs, guided by the theme \u2018Reducing Inequality in the Decade of Action to Achieve the SDGs and Recovery from COVID-19 Pandemic\u2019, jointly organized by the Se- nior Officials Meeting on Rural Development and Pov- erty Eradication (SOMRDPE) through the leadership of the Philippines, the Mission of the People\u2019s Republic of China to ASEAN, the United Nations Development Pro- gramme (UNDP) and the ASEAN Secretariat. It outlines and elaborates on approaches to reducing inequality in the ASEAN region to achieve the SDGs and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that inequalities in ASEAN were in- creasing before the onset of COVID-19,20 and there is lit- tle prospect of their being mitigated in the absence of re- newed growth. Growth has slowed to varying extents in the ASEAN region, but the decrease is much worse on the whole than after the Asian economic crisis of 1998 and the global economic crisis of 2009. The economies of the ASEAN region were growing at an even pace after recov- ering from the global economic crisis, until the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020.21 Unexpectedly, ASEAN economies found that gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in 2020 for the first time in a long time (see Table 1), and GDP growth slowed significantly. According to the most recent IMF 'World Economic Outlook Update', the growth estimate for ASEAN in 2021 is 3.1 percent, and the projection for 2022 is 5.6 percent.22 This will, of course, depend on various factors, including the uncertain dynamics of the pandemic. But the contraction implies that the fis- cal space available to most countries will still be con- strained, even though the pandemic response will de- mand more spending. All ASEAN Member States have a Human Development Index (HDI) in the medium, high or very high category (see Table 2). However, when we adjust for inequality in the dimensions that constitute the HDI (income, health and education status), there is a significant loss in the rel- atively impressive HDI levels. This clearly suggests that inequalities are considerable in almost all the countries. To better understand these impacts, the Asian Develop- ment Bank Institute (ADBI) carried out computer-assist- ed telephone interviews of households in eight Asian Development Bank developing member countries: Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thai- land and Viet Nam. The empirical results suggest that intra-country inequality in ASEAN is of concern: various household characteristics, including household income class (before COVID-19), household demographic fac- tors and COVID-19-induced factors such as having at least one person who lost their job or being located in lockdown areas, all affected the likelihood of a decline in income.23 This policy brief, which takes into account discussions at the symposium, focuses on which inequalities in the region need priority attention.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58d29bd9-8c29-47d8-b972-3e21d554b8fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "58d29bd9-8c29-47d8-b972-3e21d554b8fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "REDUCING INEQUALITY IN THE DECADE OF ACTION TO ACHIEVE THE SDGS AND ACCELERATE POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6a7bc71554c2d388911e9dfea69c7275eb0b63023c71470aaa2a6ac6bd5e1fe"}, "2": {"node_id": "c466848e-b0b4-4fe5-99f0-71d06f80a55f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5706363276c962ac95e3374dbe9615a0535f6dd0382eb8bd135f2a89e9fa55be"}}, "hash": "c7418a0ad55dcbf0ed2d2f5b89ac3f4886eb836eb34a0c68315a8fcccaa3f7fa", "text": "Inequality is conceptual- ized as prevailing in five domains: income inequality as a result of impacts of the pandemic on income and the labour market; social protection; education; health; and food security.

It addresses the question of how jobs lost can be revived. Section 3 addresses a structural source of inequality in ASEAN, in respect of the quality of employment: roughly two thirds of the workforce are in informal employment, while the re- maining third have formal employment.24 COVID-relat- ed joblessness can entrench already high informality (60\u201365 percent) in the ASEAN workforce. There is con- siderable scope for extending social insurance to the informal workforce. Section 4 examines the unequal impacts of COVID-19 on different groups of people in the education and health sectors, and makes suggestions about how these in- equalities can be redressed. Section 5 addresses a final theme: how the pandemic has affected the food security of some segments of the population, but not of others. What is the nature of food security? And how was it af- fected in ASEAN countries? It also examines the rural\u2013 urban divide. Finally, Section 6 discusses an exit strat- egy from the pandemic\u2019s impact, with a focus on data requirements\u2014a set of socio-economic indicators that need to be monitored by each country. Tables 1\u201314 feed into the analysis of the five themes of the paper. 24 Viegelahn, C., and Phu Huynh, COVID-19 and the ASEAN labour market: Impact and policy response, ILO Policy Brief, International Labour Organization, Bangkok, August 2021. 25 Viegelahn, C., and Phu Huynh, COVID-19 and the ASEAN labour market: Impact and policy response, ILO Policy Brief, International Labour Organization, Bangkok, August 2021. 26 Ibid. 27 In Viet Nam, it fell between 2004 and 2017 from 47 percent to 40 percent; in Myanmar from 47 percent to 44 percent; in the Philippines from 35 percent to 25 percent; in Lao PDR from 50 percent to 45 percent; in Indonesia from 42 percent to 38 percent; and in Brunei it remained at 45 percent (UNESCAP presentation at the 6th ASEAN\u2013China\u2013UNDP Symposium, 7 December 2021). 28 In 2020, the Philippines saw the largest working-hour losses, of 13.6 percent. In contrast, working hours in countries such as Viet Nam, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam and Lao PDR decreased by only 4.3\u20134.5 percent. The decreases in other countries in the region were between these extremes. 29 International Labour Organization, ILO Monitor: COVID-19 and the world of work, Geneva, 2021. 30 For example, Viet Nam has grown in recent years to become the second-largest supplier of apparel and footwear to the United States after China, but supplies were disrupted by lockdowns. Viet Nam made it through the first part of the pandemic relatively unscathed, but with the Delta variant on the rampage, it highlighted the uneven distribution of vaccines globally and the threat that new outbreaks pose to the world\u2019s economy (Paddock, Richard C. and Chau Doan, 'Spared for Months, Vietnam Faces a Wave of New Infections', New York Times, 2 June 2021, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/world/asia/ vietnam-covid-ho-chi-minh.html). The pandemic led to lockdowns and supply disruptions, which contributed to job losses. The International Labour Organization (ILO) found that, in 2020, the ASEAN region recorded working-hour losses of 8.4 percent relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, which is only marginally lower than the global losses of 8.8 percent and slightly higher than the losses in the whole Asia-Pacific region of 7.9 percent.25 The working hours lost in the region due to the pandemic are equivalent to the working time of about 24 million full-time workers, assuming a 48-hour working week. In the first two quarters of 2021, the ASEAN region is estimated to have seen working-hour losses of 6.1 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively, relative to the fourth quarter of 2019.26 The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) presented the labour share of income prior to the pandemic for most ASEAN countries, revealing that it was falling between 2005 and 2017\u2014i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "030631a8-ed65-43e7-9db3-9fd669549b97": {"__data__": {"id_": "030631a8-ed65-43e7-9db3-9fd669549b97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "REDUCING INEQUALITY IN THE DECADE OF ACTION TO ACHIEVE THE SDGS AND ACCELERATE POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cecadff7cd2f4e13593197e0cc9763c0a932866af83aa518eb37cbd00a15515d"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a43058f-9769-41c7-b185-c2e92229266a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40d38a992ac0a9210a2cafbe3ec5254e981b402315ee6599bba11f152f7c6c8c"}}, "hash": "f4a54ce5f3d242bf4c393188f9e584899b037a5cb6638f2398c7674654fc31ca", "text": "inequality in the labour market was already high.27 With massive job losses, the pandemic is likely to have worsened this dimension of inequality.

Also, countries\u2019 capacities to provide fiscal stimulus to their economies (see Table 3) and to keep workers in employment have differed vastly.

While employment in the ASEAN region had been on a steady upwards trajectory, largely driven by demo- graphic trends, the COVID-19 pandemic has reversed it. In 2020, there were 10.6 million (or 3.2 percent) fewer workers in employment than expected in a no-pandemic scenario.32 In 2021 and 2022, the employment gap in the region relative to the no-pandemic scenario is projected to remain at 9.3 million and 4.1 million jobs, respectively. This is unprecedented. Even during previous economic crises such as the Asian financial crisis of 1998 or the global economic crisis of 2008\u20132009, employment had always been on the rise in the ASEAN region. Most of the 6.7 million workers who left employment in 2020 went into economic inactivity (i.e. left the labour force), which increased by 4.8 million people compared to 2019.33 Some of those workers might have been dis- couraged from searching for a new job, and others\u2014in many cases, women\u2014might have been forced to give up employment because of unpaid care responsibilities as schools closed. There are many inequalities embedded in the na- ture of these job losses. Women and young workers were affected most severely, losing more employ- ment than their male counterparts, globally as well as in the ASEAN region.34 More specifically, female employment in the ASEAN region in 2020 was 3.9 percent lower than the expected level in the absence of the crisis, but for men it was 2.7 percent lower.35 Likewise, young workers have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. Youth employment losses were 6.2 percent, compared with 2.8 percent for adults, with many young workers moving into either unemployment or inactivity. The share of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) increased between 2019 and 2020 in large parts of the ASEAN region, including in Indonesia, Singapore, Thai- land and Viet Nam, in line with global trends.36 There were also inequalities in respect of which regions were affected, and who within countries was more affect- ed. In the ASEAN region, 7.8 percent of labour income was lost in 2020, which corresponds to US$100 billion (using 2019 market exchange rates) or 3.3 percent of the region\u2019s GDP in 2019.37 This drop was slightly small- er than global income losses, but higher than regional Asia-Pacific income losses. Often, the crisis dispropor- tionately affected low-paid workers, thereby increasing wage and income inequalities.38 Working-hour losses and job losses led to their risk of falling into poverty. SUGGESTED ACTIONS The ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, adopted at the 37th ASEAN Summit on 12 November 2020, lays out a clear implementation plan that \u201cserves as the consolidated exit strategy from the COVID-19 cri- sis\u201d.39 Its areas of focus are: agricultural productivity; in- formal and gig employment; labour migration; support for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs); occupational safety and health; skills development; so- cial dialogue; and social protection. To counter the disequalizing economic effects of the pandemic, the ASEAN region collectively had allocat- ed nearly 16 percent of GDP to the fiscal stimulus re- sponse as of the end of May 2021.40 The range in the magnitude of the fiscal policy response in each country has been wide, however, partially reflecting public bud- 31 Viegelahn, C., and Phu Huynh, COVID-19 and the ASEAN labour market: Impact and policy response, ILO Policy Brief, International Labour Organization, Bangkok, August 2021. 32 Ibid. 33 Ibid. 34 Ibid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b4b6a64-5090-42e6-9fa2-0cf0c3afb002": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b4b6a64-5090-42e6-9fa2-0cf0c3afb002", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "REDUCING INEQUALITY IN THE DECADE OF ACTION TO ACHIEVE THE SDGS AND ACCELERATE POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a9c98c3832cba9848ef63d1e949b49f1a6bc319df0d6a33aa0aa079e69aca65"}, "2": {"node_id": "af00b0cb-edc2-418e-a910-ecaab190fbbc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4d1e2abdbf461df1550c56a0a59d8e9c85e9f66bdc85402c3ee7ca9d1acc85d"}}, "hash": "9d3fab24ffbd0caec4cbb350465544ae6e6e1ed30482cc09fc43cd60b0af9047", "text": "32 Ibid. 33 Ibid. 34 Ibid. 35 The inference is drawn based on data for Southeast Asia as a group.

Fiscal deficits are manageable in the region, and debt-to-GDP ra- tios are not forbidding (see Exit Table 1); governments can borrow more domestically. This is an almost war- like situation, which requires creative thinking. In any case, there is not a single country in the world that has not increased borrowing. In fact, fiscal stimuli in the emerging market economies have averaged 4.7 percent of GDP,42 and ASEAN countries need to ex- plore the possibility of greater domestic borrowing. Providing that the borrowed funds are used for capital investment, the return over time will mean that the in- vestment pays for itself.43 ASEAN Member States had announced 133 social protec- tion measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as of mid-May 2021.44 Of the various types of social protec- tion measures, special allowances and grants (for exam- ple, cash transfers to low-income households) accounted for the largest proportion (20.3 percent), followed by in- come and employment protection (15.8 percent).45 Income and employment protection schemes includ- ed temporary wage subsidy programmes introduced during the crisis to effectively retain jobs, sustain the essential employer\u2013employee relationship and boost consumption. Sizeable investments were made in such policies in some countries.46 However, given that the labour market impact of the pandemic has differed by sector, governments will now need to focus on sectors where the job losses have been the worst, including contact-based services, transportation and tourism. Tourism has been severely affected; this is serious because most countries in the ASEAN region are heavily dependent on international tourism. Exit Table 2 shows the scale of the loss in for- eign exchange earnings from tourism as a share of GDP between 2019 and 2020. The contribution of tourism as a proportion of GDP fell by half or more between the two years. The number of tourism- and travel-relat- ed jobs fell by 10\u201325 percent in all the lower-middle-in- come countries (LMICs) and upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) in the region (see Exit Table 2). However, some countries have taken specific action in tourism that others can emulate. In July 2021, Thailand began a campaign to start reviving its crucial tourism in- dustry by letting visitors who follow strict COVID-19 pro- tocols roam freely on the resort island of Phuket. The so- called \u2018Phuket Sandbox\u2019 programme47 effectively turned Thailand\u2019s largest island into a quarantine zone for over- seas tourists who were fully vaccinated and had nega- tive test results.48 Hotel operators and owners of small businesses say the programme has helped the ravaged local economy, and other Southeast Asian countries with resort islands are considering emulating it. Second, if necessary, governments may need to consid- er initiating public works with the government as an em- ployer of last resort, for a limited period, at least until the economy fully revives. Such actions can be taken by local governments in both rural and urban areas, supported by the central government, until the economy recovers. Third, a new focus on the low-carbon and gig econo- mies provides opportunities for more employment (and employment growth), including for women and young people. Governments will need to explore such possi- bilities.49 One solution is to sustainably manage natural forests, which has multiple benefits from water and air filtration to flood prevention. Well-designed payment for ecosystem services, as in Viet Nam, can help to con- serve forests and the services they provide, while also 41 For example, at the upper end of the scale, Malaysia and Singapore had invested around 30 percent of GDP to counter the COVID-19 crisis. In contrast, both Myanmar and Lao PDR had announced fiscal stimulus packages of less than 1 percent of GDP.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8c73b7f-a9f5-4167-bc8f-41ad1a760813": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8c73b7f-a9f5-4167-bc8f-41ad1a760813", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "REDUCING INEQUALITY IN THE DECADE OF ACTION TO ACHIEVE THE SDGS AND ACCELERATE POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "995afe36239ef84deb5ee8190e86e03bc84e44f49de5b4c611fc6dccdb9dd7df"}, "2": {"node_id": "53d8f1b6-1041-431c-afff-0d1913150adc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "446b330a9b63e7d43f1880f8efb99c801b47e8b2519d18137f30bfe89cd7115b"}}, "hash": "10ed461d92f1439ad4fda17cfd01e6bb2d75308f627e802f2b99e2e018331b00", "text": "42 These data are is based on the IMF Fiscal Monitor, various issues, and cited in Mehrotra (2021). 43 Governments across North America and Europe have borrowed, as they have in emerging market economies.

ASEAN has supported var- ious initiatives with a view to narrowing digital divides. The ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025 includes \u2018digitally inclusive society\u2019 as one of its desired outcomes. It is im- portant to foster inclusive digital literacy as part of human resources development while at the same time building more digital infrastructure and enabling accessibility. Fifth, an important action is to boost digital-ready MS- MEs. The pandemic has promoted digital practices, including in business. It is important to enhance the digital capacity of MSMEs and ensure no MSME is left behind in using digital economic opportunities. The number of MSMEs is quite high in the region, and they have the potential to foster economic recovery. Other opportunities include the high number of Internet us- ers, the growth of online spending, and the large young population. Beyond readiness for digitalization, governments need to strengthen other interventions to support MSMEs, such as fostering financial inclusion and considering the provision of interest-free loans, especially for those MSMEs hit hardest by the pandemic. 50 Fossil fuel subsidies, which promote polluting technologies and inefficient energy use, cost the region about US$51 billion in 2012, equivalent to roughly 11 percent of all general government spending. Indonesia has the region\u2019s largest fossil fuel subsidy programme, amounting in 2012 to about 15 percent of general government expenditures and 60 percent of its public expenditures on education and health. Reforming these subsidies could improve the environment, set countries on a more sustainable path and free up spending for education, health and other pov- erty reduction measures (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \u2018Towards Green Growth in Southeast Asia Solutions for Policy Makers\u2019, Paris, 2014, https://www.oecd.org/dac/environment-development/Final%20SE%20Asia%20Brochure%20low%20res.pdf). 51 Informal workers could also be those who lack entitlement to paid annual or sick leave, lack a written employment contract or who are engaged in casual/temporary work. However, the sharp dividing line is social insurance coverage. These definitions derive from the International Con- ference of Labour Statistics 1993 and 2003, conducted every five years by the International Labour Organization. 52 As many as 22 percent of all informal workers in Brunei (31.9 percent of the total workforce) are in the formal sector, without social insurance.

However, there are also many informal workers in the formal sector.52 Tables 5i and 5ii examine social protection in the ASEAN region, which is an obvious source of inequality between and within ASEAN countries.53 The pandemic has led to unprecedented job losses in the midst of such high levels of informality. Inevitably, in- formal workers are unequally prepared to face the labour market; lacking social security, they face greater uncer- tainty. Many workers who were originally in formal em- THEME 2: BRIDGING THE INEQUALITY IN QUALITY OF WORK: ADDRESSING INFORMALITY THROUGH IMPROVED SOCIAL PROTECTION The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 19 ployment have moved into informal employment, expe- riencing a deterioration in working conditions, which is not reflected in the estimates of job losses.54 This trend in the region is consistent with the global trend of workers losing formal jobs.55 SUGGESTED ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF LABOUR MARKET INFORMALITY The ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, ad- opted at the 37th ASEAN Summit on 12 November 2020, lays out a clear implementation plan that \u201cserves as the consolidated exit strategy from the COVID-19 crisis\u201d.56 Among its priorities for labour are: improving agricultural productivity; informal and gig employment; labour migra- tion; MSME support; occupational safety and health; skills development; social dialogue; and social protection. National policy responses in ASEAN are unprecedent- ed. Sizeable investments have been made in employ- ment and income protection policies in some countries. In Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, for example, the temporary schemes amounted to 1.1 percent, 2.3 per- cent and 4.6 percent of GDP, respectively.57 Employ- ment support schemes in many ASEAN countries have been used to assist the most vulnerable and hardest-hit segments of the labour market. They include support for MSMEs in Brunei Darussalam and the Philippines, gar- ment manufacturing and tourism in Cambodia, which predominantly employ women, and low-paid workers in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.58 The fiscal stimulus has been significant (above-the-line measures for the health and non-health sectors post-COVID as a share of GDP are presented in Table 3). ASEAN countries have undertaken a range of social protection measures in response to COVID-19 (as noted above). However, the picture that emerges from the col- umns of Table 5 i shows a highly fragmented pre-pan- demic social protection system in many countries. It is possible that social protection could still be perceived as a cost rather than an investment and engine for recovery and growth. Unemployment has increased, but practical- ly no part of the workforce, including in the formal sector, receives unemployment benefits.59 The proportion of people above retirement age receiv- ing a pension is low in all countries except Singapore and Brunei.60 There is a case now to expand access to pensions, to recover more resiliently and equitably, since those who are near retirement age are unlikely to find new employment when the economy revives. What would have been most beneficial during a shock such as the pandemic are children/households receiv- ing child/family cash benefits or vulnerable people cov- ered by social assistance (the last two columns in Ta- ble 5i), but here too the gaps existing prior to COVID-19 were significant. These gaps could be filled, to reduce inequality. The proportion of vulnerable people cov- ered by social assistance is extremely low across the region, with a few exceptions.

For a better recovery, fair wages and decent working and living conditions for migrant workers are key con- siderations. The pandemic has highlighted how vulner- abilities of migrant workers can have repercussions for economic growth and recovery of the whole economy.

In Thailand, Viet Nam, Malaysia and Cam- bodia, around 70\u201377 percent of children studied in schools with online classes. The figure is slightly lower in the Philippines, at only 57 percent of children. Most children in Lao PDR and Myanmar still went to school rather than taking online classes. Only 48 percent of pupils in Myan- mar continued their education during the pandemic, and only 6 percent studied online classes. This may be because only a small number of schools in Myanmar can offer online courses (Morgan and Tranh, 2021).

About 8 percent did not attend any online classes, 19 THEME 3: INEQUALITY IN EDUCATION AND HEALTH The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 21 percent attended only a few, and 16 percent attended some but not all.68 The ADBI survey examined the reasons why some stu- dents did not fully attend the online classes, given that the school offered them. There were four major rea- sons: doing household chores; lack of computer/tablet; lack of Internet connection; and weak/unstable Internet connection. Table 6 presents data on these parameters of access to technology (Internet users as a percent- age of the population, Internet subscriptions as a per- centage of the population, and broadband subscribers as a percentage of the population), revealing a digital divide. On average, about a third of households with children who did not attend online classes fully did not have facilities for online learning (i.e. devices or Internet connections).69 It is quite widely recognized that there is a digital divide in most LMICs and UMICs. The proportion of broad- band subscriptions as a percentage of the population is much lower than the proportion of Internet subscrip- tions; even the latter shows huge gaps in the popula- tion: 53.4 percent in Indonesia, 46.7 percent in the Phil- ippines, 75.1 percent in Thailand and 71.3 percent in Viet Nam (Table 6). Given the much lower proportion of broadband con- nections in each country, Internet use is dependent on access to smartphones (on which we did not find any information). The number of smartphones is expected to be limited in a lower-income household, and certain- ly not adequate to provide access to all children when online classes are being run by schools at the same time. Thus, exclusion is inevitable, even among those children who do not belong to poor households. Even before COVID-19, education in the East Asia and Pacific region was facing a learning crisis.70 On top of the 15 million girls out of school, a sizeable proportion of girls in school were not on course to meet minimum proficiency in basic reading and mathematics: one in every five girls in the region was unable to read and understand a simple text by age 10. UNICEF also finds that even more girls are missing out on learning, com- petencies and skills (including information technology literacy) required for thriving in the economy and soci- ety of the 21st century.71 A recent World Bank study predicts falling test scores and a 19 percent increase in the proportion of lower sec- ondary school-aged girls and boys in the region who are below the minimum level of proficiency due to the prolonged school closures and delayed implementa- tion of distance learning programmes. These estimates assume that schools were closed for five months. The longer school closures last, the greater the negative im- pact COVID-19 will have on learning.72 The gender disparity within the overarching digital di- vide is stark. In the East Asia and Pacific region, 20 per- cent of girls\u201440 million in total\u2014were not reached by distance learning delivered online or through TV or ra- dio, due to the lack of devices and/or policies geared towards their needs. Girls in rural and poor households in particular are facing barriers to accessing distance learning during school closures.73 In the East Asia and Pacific region, 55 percent of men had access to the Internet, compared to 41 percent of women before COVID-19.74 Girls are still often disadvan- taged with regards to access to devices and the Inter- net in multi-child households in which the number of children exceeds the number of devices.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4f30186-e66c-41fb-babd-d08102eff140": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4f30186-e66c-41fb-babd-d08102eff140", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "REDUCING INEQUALITY IN THE DECADE OF ACTION TO ACHIEVE THE SDGS AND ACCELERATE POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3438a3ba3ff9f80ae85f687cbb5e75453db311b578820d32e0cca57217c0cb10"}, "2": {"node_id": "36093ff0-df4d-4cd4-83a4-d3c0313c2ff0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eed3926b218b7d35b75d6005ec03fee430fb025d4540d52916e71d3c3c8e4802"}}, "hash": "cbb4acb3797be474602231888b183832fa5ca93db89b03bdd26c49e5595eac63", "text": "Even before COVID-19, girls from poor households were more disadvantaged than boys in terms of their access to education.75 In the case of limited resources, poor 68 A high proportion of children in Indonesia and Viet Nam attended all online classes (79\u201380 percent), while the figure was very low in the Phil- ippines (only 21 percent) and only moderate in Thailand, Myanmar and Malaysia.

In the least devel- oped ASEAN countries, there was a clear problem of under-provision at upper secondary level (though not at lower secondary level in any country, as noted above). Government spending is key. The pandemic will af- fect households\u2019 ability to fund education, since gov- ernment fiscal pressures have grown due to the lower GDP and higher health expenditure requirements. This is quite apart from the fact that teachers themselves are likely to have become infected, affecting their ability to deliver teaching. Governments, households and devel- opment partners\u2014in that order\u2014are the main funders of education. Their contributions differ significantly across country income groups.78 However, LMICs could consider additional investments to enable children\u2019s access to computers and the Inter- net (through local community centres). Public spending on education is already very low in most LMICs; given these already low budgets, diverting funds could have detrimental impacts. Since some LMICs did not close schools, their focus could be on ensuring that all teach- ers and school administrative staff are vaccinated as a priority group, to protect themselves as well as the chil- dren, so that schools can function safely. China intro- duced additional resources for online education in early 2020\u2014weeks after the pandemic began\u2014especially in the form of 22 online platforms providing 24,000 online higher educati
