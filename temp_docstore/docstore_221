e extent to which laws in each country accord with human rights norms and standards. In addition, the country reviews are accompanied by concrete guidelines for Enabling Effective Responses to HIV in Pacific Island Countries Options for Human Rights-Based Legislative Reform.126 This comprehensive legislative review has highlighted that in most Pacific Island countries, there are a number of important gaps in laws rel- evant to HIV issues, and that generally, the overall legal frameworks do not reflect established human rights and gender equality norms and standards. Only PNG and Pohnpei state of the Federated States of Micronesia have comprehensive HIV laws that largely reflect a human-rights based framework. However, even with these comprehensive laws, additional law reform would further ad- vance the human rights of women and men living with HIV in these two countries. In the 13 other Pacific Island countries, significant legal reforms are required to provide an enabling national environment for HIV responses. For example, laws are silent on informed consent, confidentiality, access to prevention information and treatment care and support. Criminal laws are still used in ways that affect most at risk populations and reinforce women\u2019s low social status, both of which have a negative effect on HIV prevention, treatment and care. For example, \u2018prostitution\u2019 remains a criminal offence in every Pacific Island country except Palau and two states of Federated States of Micronesia. Of the 15 Pacific Island countries reviewed, homosexual sex between consenting adults remains a crime in all but four countries. Abortion is criminalised in 14 of the 15 Pacific Islands Countries reviewed and no countries specifically recognise the right of women and girls to access reproductive health services including safe abortion facilities. Generally Pacific Island countries have fault based models of divorce and family laws and in a significant number of countries, sexual assault laws do not yet provide ad- equate protection and do not attract sufficiently serious penalties, as is discussed further below. Many of these outdated laws were inherited from colonial periods and reinforce discrimination against women. In addition, customary practices and laws that determine control over land and resources as well as inheritance and property issues also often discriminate against women, underscoring the need for constitutional guarantees of equality rights. 125 Anita Jowitt, 2004, Creating a framework for HIV/AIDS related legal reform in the South Pacific Journal of South Pacific Law Vo. 8 2004 Issue 1 (accessed online: http://www.paclii.org/journals/ fJSPL/vol08no1/3.shtml) 126 UNDP Pacific Centre (in press) CEDAW is the second most ratified treaty in the Pacific second to the Convention of the Right of the Child (all Pacific Island countries except Nauru, Palau and Tonga are bound by CEDAW).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf183a28-c042-400b-8311-d9af4d628126": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf183a28-c042-400b-8311-d9af4d628126", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a98aaefcef48b5ce742500a8a44988b35d72dc6500714ad5e89096ff37ba8ed6"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc98e5a1-7291-4e95-8c5f-182943ba8920", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b1738a4984e0b76caffead34778f01fcd209b13541c93215b475b2a6913aa15"}}, "hash": "1801ae19ea4641a4c083f7f70a26934196e79a8d115d9172317834459488c4ed", "text": "A joint UNDP Pacific Centre/UNIFEM publication on CEDAW Legislative Compliance in 9 Pacific Island Countries127 concretely demonstrates what is required of the laws in each of the Pacific Island country reviewed to comply with the spirit and intent of CEDAW.128 Many of the CEDAW legisla- tive compliance indicators developed are also relevant to comprehensive HIV law reform.

Although some progress has been made in advancing legislative compliance with CEDAW, significant legislative change is required for Pacific Island Countries (both those that have and have not yet ratified CEDAW) to translate this important treaty into national laws and accelerate the implementation of these laws. Current HIV and AIDS messages and approaches in the Pacific are less effective because they are gender insensitive, culturally inappropriate or often misunderstood A number of studies from Papua New Guinea show how that fears of HIV and AIDS (compounded by ignorance of how infection occurs) have been associated with evil forces or integrated into traditional cosmologies and associated with supernatural witchcraft and sorcery.129 When this occurs people are further encouraged to misunderstand how the HIV virus is transmitted and to ignore educational messages for prevention. Some Christian churches also encourage people to believe that HIV can be \u2018cured\u2019 by prayer, while in Papua New Guinea it is not uncommon for quacks to cash in on the epidemic by selling potions to the credulous that claim to prevent or cure infection.130 127 UNDP Pacific Centre, 2007 Translating CEDAW into LAW 128 There are now 10 completed CEDAW legislative compliance reviews, see also UNDP Pacific Centre, 2008, Translating CEDAW Into Law: CEDAW Legislative Compliance in the Cook Islands 129 Nicole Haley, 2008.

In Leslie Butt and Richard Eves (eds.). 47 Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region What does cultural relevance means? Cultural relevance means prevention and treatment measures should be based on evidence about and analysis of gender relations and sexual behaviour in their respective culturally specific contexts. It means that cultural values of embarrassment or secrecy about sex should be identified so they can be confronted appropriately. Culturally appropriate approaches will find ways to talk frankly about HIV and other STI. Cultural relevance also means recognition of change, of contested understandings of what is \u2018customary\u2019 and of the power relations that can be inherent in such contexts. In all cases, care must be taken to ensure that HIV strategies do not inadvertently reinforce harmful or discriminatory aspects of cultural practices or traditions that put women, girls, boys, men and transgendered individuals at greater risk of HIV infection. It is important to educate the public about HIV, however misunderstood messages can be more harmful than no mes- sages.

Campaign posters captioned \u2018Show you Care\u2019 and \u2018She\u2019s Perfect\u2019, showed young women in westernized dress and touching young men in public (highly untraditional behaviour) which reinforced the view of rural people that girls get HIV because of their modern, \u201cpromiscuous\u201d behaviour. In their view, the solution lay in tighter control over young girls\u2019 and earlier marriage to stop them \u201cplaying around\u201d, not better availability of condoms. Another poster - intended to de-stigmatize people infected with HIV - showed a diverse group of potentially infected Papua New Guinea men and women. But because these rural people did not identify with any of the people portrayed, they were encouraged in their belief that HIV/AIDS is a problem belonging to other people.134 131 Katherine Lepani, 2008.

Citing the findings of a development practitioner, Elizabeth Reid, she warns that women\u2019s fear and sense of powerlessness will be in- creased unless some more meaningful solutions are provided. Condom use should be promoted as part of a caring relationship. This would create a more enabling environment for women to negotiate condom use within a regular relationship, where their risk is greatest.

To encourage such conditions a transformational approach is clearly called for in the context of the situation in many Pacific Island societies; an approach that would focus on social, educational, economic and political strate- gies to address marriage as a high risk setting, and to enable women and girls to take greater control of their own sexuality and act on safer sex messages. Prevention messages in the Pacific have mainly tended to target men because men usually control sexual relations. So- cial conventions usually permit men to have more sexual partners than women, men are more likely to be at risk of HIV transmission from alcohol and drug abuse; sexual aggression; peer group pressures; increased exposure opportunities through migration for work or mobile occupations; and residence in all-male situations such as prisons, army barracks, mining and logging camps and road construction sites. Another reason for targeting men is that many Pacific cultures glorify masculine risk-taking. However, commenting on a male-targeted campaign poster captioned in Papua New Guinea Pidgin \u201cTake care of yourself\u201d, Leslie Butt and Richard Eves point out that \u201cif prevention messages do not coincide with the cultural realities, a poster exhorting men to look after themselves is unlikely to be effective in a region where assertions of masculinity are so marked.\u201d Katherine Lepani reports an example of a message that is both culturally effective and gender sensitive in the Trobriand Islands, where premarital sex is socially accepted (although considered a very private matter that is never discussed) and where young women and men are likely to enjoy relations with a number of partners. The message is conveyed in a poster illustrating an idealized depiction of youthful consensual heterosexuality, advising the use of a condom \u2018every time\u2019. It should be noted however, that in more sexually repressive cultures, this message may appeal to young people but is likely to meet with widespread social disapproval, including among health workers. Richard Eves, who has studied the relationship between masculinity, violence and the spread of HIV in Papua New Guinea, is critical of approaches that are expected to empower women in sexual relationships, based on the highly ques- tionable assumption that women have the power and ability to control their sexual and reproductive lives. He points out: Since the problem of violence, and particularly violence by men against women, is clearly a category of gender, then male socialization and what it means to be a man becomes a central aspect of any solution for HIV prevention. If gender-based violence and HIV transmission is to be seriously tackled and eliminated, men and boys must be included in the project, since they are not only part of the problem, they are part of the solution The aim must be to inspire men and boys to take responsibility for their actions and to adopt more constructive and cooperative behaviour. 144 144 Richard Eves, 2008.

The central aim of these guidelines is to increase the number of people who know their status - a milestone objective towards Universal Access. It has been emphasised145 that a person\u2019s knowledge of his or her HIV status in itself is insufficient: HIV testing and counselling has to be linked to prevention, treat- ment, broader care and support, accompanied by intensified action to address social issues, such as stigma, discrimina- tion, violence and other serious negative consequences related to disclosing one\u2019s status to others.

If they fear being asked to accept testing, arousing suspicion for refusing consent, or being tested without consent, they may avoid attending health centres when they are ill, or taking infants for vaccination, or children for health care, or having antenatal checkups, or medically supervised deliveries. In many parts of Papua New Guinea, women are likely to fear their safety is at more immediate risk than the effects of the virus, if they are found HIV positive, from disclosure to their partner, being seen to be having treatment, counselling, and by not breast feeding for example. Further, women who are abandoned because of their HIV status may have few options to support themselves which can lead to selling sex, which is likely to contribute further to the spread of HIV.146 Human Rights-Based Approaches to HIV (Adapted from UNAIDS 2006) A Human Rights-Based approach to HIV not only focus on the rights of those vulnerable to infection and those already affected, it also produces positive public health results in relation to HIV. It brings human rights standards and principles into the heart of HIV programming processes, empowers people to know and claim their rights and develop capacities of governments to advance human rights based responses.

Introduction of PICT For PPCT: Possible Negative Impacts On Women. Unpublished Discussion Paper. 53 Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region SUGGESTED RECOMMENDATIONS Mainstream gender equality into national and regional policies, strategies and programmes for HIV prevention and care and make them culturally relevant and human rights based Why? The importance of the many gender dimensions of HIV is often given insufficient attention and is frequently limited to the situation analysis section of national strategic plans for HIV and AIDS responses, usually as an after thought resulting from lobbying rather than as a critical concern that is, from the beginning, built into the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of all HIV prevention strategies. As a result, last minute changes/additions to the planning of HIV policies, strat- egies and programmes seldom translate into interventions that are truly gendered. HIV strategies must be fully gendered at all stages of planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, based on evidence and reflecting participatory planning and implementation processes, all grounded in human rights principles, norms and standards. Current HIV and AIDS messages and approaches in the Pacific are less effective because they are not sufficiently gender responsive.

Address the prevention of violence against women, children (both girls and boys) and sexual minorities as an integral part of preventing the spread of HIV Why? Gender based violence is both a gross human rights violation and a significant public health problem. Globally the evidence mounts that there is likely to be a higher risk of heterosexual HIV transmission where women have very low social, economic and political status and experience very high levels of violence. It is now a fact that in many regions and countries \u2013 including in the Pacific, more women are being infected with HIV than before. The very high levels of sexual violence from intimate partners reported in the Pacific Islands, coupled with women and girls\u2019 heightened HIV vulnerability is a double whammy.

Programmes emphasising life skills, sexuality education, HIV and STI prevention, as well as family life education, legal and human rights awareness and good citizenship should be promoted and scaled up. \u2022\ufffd More\ufffdvigorous\ufffdefforts\ufffdare\ufffdneeded\ufffdto\ufffdimplement\ufffdnational\ufffdpolicies\ufffdto\ufffdpromote\ufffdthe\ufffdeducation\ufffdof\ufffdgirls\ufffdat\ufffdall\ufffdlevels\ufffdand\ufffdto\ufffd increase their legal empowerment, especially in countries where gendered barriers to education still exist. \u2022\ufffd Using\ufffdcommunity\ufffddriven\ufffddevelopment\ufffdapproaches,\ufffdsuch\ufffdas\ufffdtransformational\ufffdleadership\ufffdmethodologies,\ufffdthe\ufffdStep- ping Stones or the appreciative enquiry models for example, will assist in transforming norms and attitudes about gender roles so they are more equitable, caring and empowering for women and girls. These approaches need careful implementation to avoid reinforcing existing stereotypes. They also need to engage with community-based organizations such as village councils, women\u2019s associations and church associations and gatekeepers. Improve the legal framework for gender equality and human rights as an integral part of preventing the spread of HIV Why? As shown throughout this report, power imbalances and double standards between men and women are core underlying drivers of HIV risk in the Pacific Islands and a major cause of vulnerability. Gender inequality is caused or exacerbated by some key laws while others fail to advance gender equality as they could and should. As such, this results in national legal frameworks that are ill equipped to and unsuitable for enabling effective responses to HIV. For example, penal (or criminal) laws in many Pacific Islands reflect a punitive approach towards sex work, HIV transmission and male-to-male sex while remaining silent on issues such as martial rape, rape of men & boys, and violence against women. Pacific constitutions do not fully enshrine substantive equality and freedom from discrimination, including on the grounds of sex, marital status, sexual orientation and disability (among others). Generally therefore, not only do existing Pacific legal frameworks not yet fully confirm with international human rights norms, standards and commitments, they also pose significant challenges to universal access, prevention, treatment and care support. Improving the legal frameworks in the Pacific to better address gender inequality generally and specifically in relation to HIV prevention, treatment and care is therefore, not just an important milestone to improving the overall HIV response, but it is also a necessary step - though not the only one, that will contribute to transforming harmful norms, values and patterns of gender relations and social interactions that underpin and drive vulnerability to HIV infection and deprive indi- viduals of their rights and the power to protect themselves against HIV and its consequences.

Women who have their own money and rights to own and control assets are less vulnerable to gender-based violence, less dependent on men and more empowered to negotiate safe sex. In most Pacific Island societies women either lack cus- tomary rights to property or control over land and resource use or if they do have traditional rights, these may have been eroded in modern economic contexts. Girls and women who engage in sex work as a result of lack of economic opportuni- ties or choices are more vulnerable to HIV and other STI exposure and to violence because they are more disempowered and less able to negotiate safe sex with clients than sex workers who are in control of their working and social conditions.

Yet despite the differences that ex- ist, the national epidemics share common characteristics such as being centered mainly around unpro- tected paid sex, the sharing of contaminated injection drug equipment and unprotected sex between men. An estimated 75 million men in Asia visit sex workers and 10 million women cater to them. Add to these figures male Intravenous Drug Users (IDUs) and Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) - approximately 20 million - and we have a very large number of people who are at high risk of getting infected and, in turn, can potentially infect their partners. Since most men who buy sex are either married or will get married, significant numbers of ostensibly \u2018low risk\u2019 women who only have sex with their husbands are exposed to HIV. A conservative estimate by the Commission on AIDS in Asia put this number at 50 million women1. In 2008, women accounted for 35 per cent of all adult HIV infections in Asia \u2013 up from 17 per cent in 1990. Evidence from several Asian countries shows that these women are either married or in long-term relationships with men who engage in high-risk sexual behaviors. Studies in Asia show that almost all new infections among women are contracted through marriage2.

Evidence from some countries shows that men are more likely to hide, or delay, the disclosure of their HIV status to their partners, compared to women6. This prevents regular condom use and hence higher transmission of HIV. Furthermore, women\u2019s subjugation and low status in society and within the house- hold gives them very little power to negotiate safe sex. This makes it particularly difficult for women generally, and \u2018married\u2019 women specifically to protect themselves from HIV exposure and ultimately infection through sex with their lifelong partner. The culture of silence that surrounds sex7, gender inequality, violence and discrimination that are so pervasive in the region exacerbate the problem8. Migration and mobility facilitate the spread of HIV. Most migrants are separated from spouses and fami- lies, and are often pushed into poor working and living conditions without recreational activities lead- ing to isolation and stress. Across Asia, in male dominated migrant workforces such as the ones found on construction sites, commercial fisheries, extracting industries and plantations, men find themselves in worksite subcultures in which the purchase of sexual services is common. As a result, they have a high risk of acquiring HIV, and passing it on to their partners when they return home infected9. 1 Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008 2 Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008 3 Silverman J.G. et al., Intimate partner violence and HIV infection among married Indian women, JAMA, 2008 4 HIV Transmission in Intimate Partner Relationships in Asia, UNAIDS, August 2009 5 Dr. Prasada Rao, Director, UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific, quoting Decker et al., Intimate partner violence is both a risk marker and a transmission mechanism for women\u2019s HIV infection: Findings from a national population-based sample of Indian husband-wife dyads, JAIDS, 2009 6 Caitlin Wiesen, HIV Practice Team Leader, UNDP Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacific (from China HIV/AIDS Survey Data, UNDP, 2009) 7 Geeta Rao Gupta, President, ICRW 8 Dr. Nafis Sadik, UN Secretary General\u2019s special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific 9 HIV Transmission in Intimate Partner Relationships in Asia, UNAIDS, August 2009 INTRoDUCTIoN 2 Traditional expectations related to masculinity and male sexual behaviour also increase the risk of in- fection among men and boys. Typical male roles that call for men and boys to be tough, aggressive, sexually dominant, and risk-taking are often associated with behaviours that increase men\u2019s HIV risk. In particular, having multiple sexual partners, use of drugs or alcohol, and poor health seeking behavior increase the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections10. The mutually harmful nature of some gender norms underscores the importance of involving men and boys in any effort towards change. An important yet rarely acknowledged factor that potentially influences men\u2019s extramarital sexuality is the social construction of marriage, that is, the emotional, cultural, and economic meanings of conju- gality in a society. \u201cUnderstanding and addressing HIV transmission among intimate part- ners is therefore one of the most complex, difficult and sensitive areas but it is also the key to dealing with the rapidly rising HIV epidemic in the region and may even be the key to turning it around\u201d 11 If sustained and effective programmes to curb HIV transmission in commercial sex, drug injection, and male-to-male sex are established, countries are likely to see a steady decrease in spousal transmission12. Realising the complexity and importance of this issue for tackling Asian epidemics, the 9th Interna- tional Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP), convened on 11 August 2009 the symposium: \u201cHIV and Intimate Partner Transmission: A Call for Action\u201d. Jointly organized by UNDP, WAPN+, UNAIDS, UNIFEM, UNFPA and ICRW the symposium took stock of emerging evidence, facilitated the exchange of ideas and perspectives and proposed critical policy and programme responses to begin to halt and reverse Intimate Partner Transmission of HIV in Asia.

It should also change the direction of policy to prevent and control the spread of HIV and AIDS. As the report notes, not only has the proportion of women among people living with HIV been rising steadily, but many of these women are married women who are overwhelmingly monogamous. The vast majority of them have acquired their infection from their partners, who are buyers of unprotected sex. Research also shows that spousal violence - domestic and sexual - is widespread, and not confi ned to the lower socio-economic groups as once thought. \u201cProgrammes addressing the particularly critical intersection of violence and HIV risk and reducing high-risk behavior on the part of men are few. In general, policies and interventions to better address the social determinants of HIV risk in the region are urgently needed.\u201d Reacting to a proposition that married women in Asia should be regarded as a \u201chigh risk group\u201d, respon- dents from across the region participating to an E-Discussion on Intimate Partner Transmission hosted by UNDP raised the following points: \u2022\ufffd The focus needs to be on understanding and addressing the high\u2013risk sexual behaviors of married men. There needs to be a better understanding of why men go to sex workers and the complex and multidimensional determinants of extramarital sex as well as the political economy of marriage in the various Asian contexts. It was noted that one of the eff ects of insisting on condom use by men who are clients of sex workers has reduced the proportion of men seeking commercial sex, which is a signifi cant fi nding in itself. Underlying issues of gender-based violence, and spousal violence in particular and overall gender inequality are central to married women\u2019s HIV vulnerability in Asia. \u2022\ufffd The heightened HIV risk vulnerability of migrant workers - male and female \u2013 and in turn their partners\u2019, is a neglected area.

As the Commission on AIDS report (2008) notes, \u201cIf sustained, effective programmes to curb HIV trans- mission in commercial sex, drug injection, and male-male sex are established, countries will see a steady decrease in spousal transmission\u201d \u2022\ufffd Effective protection for women calls for programmes far beyond efforts made so far, which have concentrated on remedial approaches at home, providing shelter for women who fear or suffer vio- lence, or economic empowerment that at least offers women some independence. However, the root causes are still to be addressed. This requires a slew of activities, but, most important, social behavioral change and transformation. \u2022\ufffd National policies that support the many women who fear, or are actually suffering emotional or physical violence, including coerced sex within marriage, are needed. National legal frameworks are poorly enforced and family networks offer little support to the sufferer. Sometimes the woman who is the victim is even condemned. \u2022\ufffd Voluntary counseling and testing, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission services should be available at all sexual and reproductive health facilities. They should use expertise and experi- ence gained in family planning and reproductive health programmes. But they must also reach those who are not covered by these programmes - the unmarried, young couples who haven\u2019t had children, and men. The e-participants felt that compulsory HIV testing before marriage would be ineffective, because it does not address the main problem \u2013 that is, spousal behaviour post mar- riage. \u2022\ufffd Most participants felt that countries must eventually address the underlying power structures that effectively keep women in subjugation. As part of this approach, women need wider social and economic measures to empower them to take their lives into their own hands. \u2022\ufffd Research in Kerala, India, (also quoted in the AIDS Commission\u2019s report) is showing that 49 per cent of women with no property reported physical violence compared to only 7 per cent of women who owned property. \u2022\ufffd Women and girls need more and better general education on a par with men and boys. They need specific education on their sexual health and on ways to avoid sexually transmitted infections, in- cluding HIV. And they need the means to put their knowledge into practice. \u2022\ufffd Education and services must include sex workers. Such an approach involves tackling stigma and discrimination against them and their work. The whole area of commercial sex must be brought out in the open and frankly discussed. Educational outreach on sexual and reproductive health must include men and boys, specifically teaching them respect and consideration for women, in general, and their partners, in particular. \u2022\ufffd The final point emerging from the e-discussion is that infected women and their children need much more than care and treatment. They need real protection from stigma and discrimination. Such is the state of ignorance and prejudice that women are often blamed, quite unfairly, for infect- ing their husbands, when the reality is often the other way round. Their children may be excluded from school and from health services. Women also need economic empowerment. \u2018AIDS widows\u2019 are often denied their inheritance. Some have found themselves on the streets, shunned by their husbands\u2019 families. The law is on their side; but very few have the resources or the social support to seek legal redress. With empowerment, HIV positive women have become powerful advocates for change. Concluding, Dr. Nafis Sadik called for an open, frank and value-free discussion that shall reach every vil- lage and street, and informs policy and enforcement agencies from the highest level to the individual.

Rationale for Discussion on Intimate Partner Transmission Terminology Intimate Partner Transmission is a relatively new terminology for what was most commonly known as \u201cspousal transmission\u201d - the transmission of HIV between spouses, husband to wife mostly. IPT has long been recognized, particularly in Asia Pacific, as one of the major routes of transmission. A broader terminology was necessary to include men who have sex with men, some of whom also have sex with women. These women may not always be their wives, but could be domestic partners, girlfriends and so on. The Role of the Commission on AIDS in Asia Report in Highlighting Intimate Partner Transmission in Asia The focus on Intimate Partner Transmission has come about mainly because of the recommendation of the Commission on AIDS in Asia. We all know that this transmission is occurring. But there are questions, such as how intense is it? How many women are at risk? How many men pose the risk of transmitting the virus to their sexual partners? The Commission has estimated that 75 million men could transmit infections to 50 million women who are at risk of getting infected. Together this constitutes 125 million people, which is not a small number. This indicates the gravity of the issue that we are dealing with, and compels us to take note and address it. A UNAIDS report on Intimate Partner Transmission launched earlier identifies the issue specifically. It suggests country-level actions and highlights major information gaps. \u201cThere is a need for a lot of operational research in this area. For example we hardly know how many sero-discordant couples (couples in which only one partner is HIV positive) are there, and how we should address their spe- cific needs. Existing strategies are not well documented, and implementa- tion strategies not yet available. There is an urgency to find solutions for each specific context\u201d 8 PANELIST PRESENTATIoNS AND STATEMENTS Dr Nafsiah Mboi, a Pediatrician and Master of Public Health by training, has been active in the field of HIV and AIDS since its first appearance in Indonesia. She presently serves as Secretary of the National AIDS Com- mission, a position to which she was appointed by the President of In- donesia in 2006. Dr Nafsiah has had a lengthy career of public service. For 35 years she was a civil servant with the Ministry of Health. Thereafter she served one term in the Indonesian Parliament. She later joined the World Health organization as Director of the Department of Gender and Women\u2019s Health. In addition to her professional career, Dr Nafsiah has been active through the years on a voluntary basis having founded and led a succession of community organizations in a range of fields includ- ing, family planning, social welfare, women\u2019s economic advancement, and rural family welfare. In addition to to serving in a number of national commissions, she has served as chair of the UN Com- mission on the Rights of the Child and Vice Chair of the Global Commission on Women\u2019s Health prior to that. The Challenges of Engendering National AIDS Programmes Including Low Risk Women Research in Indonesia In 2006, a mapping exercise on high-risk behaviour populations and their partners in Indonesia found that while Injecting Drug Users represented 46 per cent of the \u201cat-risk population\u201d, their partners com- prised 7 per cent. Similarly, there were significant numbers of partners of other \u201cat-risk groups\u201d such as clients of sex workers and Men who have Sex with Men (MSM). Focus on Evidence-Based Policy First, there is a need to integrate gender, reproductive rights and HIV throughout policy related to education as well as the workplace. Decriminalization of sex work is very important from the perspec- tive of prevention programmes, and in achieving 100 per cent condom use. We need explicit policy response for gender-based violence. We also need to scale up prevention of mother-to-child transmis- sion (PMTCT) programmes, and make data as the basis for policy and programmes. \u201cAlthough the number of at-risk women compared to men was small for the data collected in 2006, we found in our projections to the year 2020 that the proportion of women, both sex workers and others, would grow rapidly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a26ef41-752f-41cd-97ea-2bf4b5fb6413": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a26ef41-752f-41cd-97ea-2bf4b5fb6413", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-intimate-partner-transmission-call-action-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Intimate Partner Transmission: A Call for Action - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-intimate-partner-transmission-call-action-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09eb302e8031ed2e4adaa0e3a09fd9873a67b67dd18957fe5bf02ffadb5d09ae"}, "2": {"node_id": "88c4a178-36eb-4e37-9b5d-e3ed778c8e01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-intimate-partner-transmission-call-action-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f53f027d300a130d0b75fa6ebca51743a582267e7d3b16adb7898e34ff0566f3"}}, "hash": "689b905929e9e727a07991e31c96e8c92bc5bc472a34c0a0b99f69d78dd9ec3e", "text": "This growing impact on women became evident and therefore there is a need to focus a lot more on women in our response\u201d Training & Education towards Behavioural Change More specific and explicit information and skill-training programmes are needed on managing rela- tionships and on responsible sex, giving priority to adolescents and married couples.

Promoting Condom-Use We also need to educate and involve stakeholders in condom-use campaigns \u2013 both in terms of com- mercial sex and longer-term relationships. It is very important to have the buy-in of local governments and policy-makers as well as pimps for eff ective condom promotion among clients of sex workers. We need to take this approach because all along we have only propagated condom-use among sex work- ers, and not to their clients. We also need to carry out periodic and systematic legal review and reform. Need for More Research We need to undertake more rigorous research because strategic choices are not possible without hard data. We need full epidemiological analysis of HIV and AIDS and projections as to who will be most at risk. Social research plays a crucial role in telling us what works in our setting and what empowers people for change. This includes sex workers, adolescents, police, clients of sex workers and so on. Delivering Key Messages Finally, we need public leadership to acknowledge, challenge and publicly embrace gender and rights- based approaches. We need to empower our men and women to take on new roles in relationships. We also need strong partnerships between health and community systems. We need to bear in mind the crucial factor of culture, and use culturally popular methods to deliver new messages.

Introduction to Intimate Partner Transmission in the Asian Region Another key dimension to the multiple linkages that exist between communities that are high at risk of HIV is migration. There are many men and women who migrate, get infected, and return home, which is an important factor in leading to risk of HIV infection in the region. The Increasing Risk Faced by Women in the Region As highlighted earlier, unprotected paid sex is the main driver of HIV epidemics in Asia. Three out of four adults living with HIV in Asia are men, yet the proportion of women living with HIV has increased from 19 per cent in 2000 to 24 per cent in 2007. The data are even more alarming for countries such as Thai- land where women account for 35 per cent of the infections, as well as Cambodia (47 per cent), India (37 per cent), and Papua New Guinea (60 per cent). In Thailand, a third of new infections are among women, and 70 per cent of infections among youth between 15 and 24 years are among women and girls. Ac- cording to the Commission on AIDS in Asia there are an estimated 50 million women who are at risk and vulnerable to infection from their partners who engage in high risk behaviors such as unprotected paid sex and injecting drug use and unprotected sex between men. 11 PANELIST PRESENTATIoNS AND STATEMENTS The Effects of Migration Another population group that is highly at risk of HIV infection is the \u2018mobile\u2019 men who travel for work. A 2006 study conducted by Family Health International showed that this group is much more likely to engage in paid sex than men within the general population.

They often end up in very exploitative and abusive situations that put them in extreme risk for vulnerability to HIV\u201d Unsafe migration can lead to situations where women are trafficked and exploited. While human traf- ficking takes many forms, trafficking of women and girls for purposes of sexual exploitation remains the overwhelming dominant form of trafficking. Sexual exploitation, powerlessness, and inability to negotiate safe sex make women and girls vulnerable to HIV infection. Studies have shown that the rate of HIV infection is higher in younger women who were trafficked and sexually exploited. Nearly 60 per cent of women and girls who were trafficked in Nepal between the ages of 7 and 14 had contracted HIV infection, according to a 2007 study conducted by Jay Silverman of the Harvard School of Public Health. The study looked at the different gender norms that sanction violence against women, and cre- ates extraordinary vulnerability to sexual abuse and exploitation. The Gender Equation A country study undertaken in China on the impact of HIV and AIDS on marriage and households showed that the percentage of HIV-infected widows is much higher than widowers. More men are being infected at the outset and in turn are in turn infecting their spouses. As a result many men are dying early, leaving the burden of care and support for the family to their HIV positive spouses. Crucial to maintaining sero-discordancy among couples where one partner is HIV postiive and the other nega- tive and thereby halting the transmission of HIV in intimate partner relationships is the issue of early 12 PANELIST PRESENTATIoNS AND STATEMENTS disclosure of HIV status. A study from China on the issue of disclosure in sero-discordant couples clearly showed a trend where women tend to disclose their HIV status earlier than men. In India, evidence shows that women are being largely infected by their husbands, and widows are most likely to have contracted HIV from their husbands. Nevertheless, as shown by another study in India, 80 per cent of HIV widows were denied a share of their husband\u2019s property, and when their hus- bands died they were pushed out of their marital homes often with their children and left to fend for themselves. Prevention Priorities The Commission on AIDS in Asia report concluded that prevention priorities in Asia were not strong enough, and that, \u201cat present, there is no effective strategy to protect women within marriage or steady relationship on a large scale. There is a need for high quality research for designing prevention pro- grammes for these populations\u201d. Recommendations A joint UNAIDS, UNDP,UNIFEM, ASEAN Foundation publication was released at ICAAP, detailing a frame- work for addressing intimate partner transmission. The framework advocates the following measures: \u2022\ufffd Income support for HIV positive women \u2022\ufffd Livelihood security for widows and affected families \u2022\ufffd Secure property and inheritance rights for women \u2022\ufffd Health insurance to protect against catastrophic health expenditures A publication was released this morning, detailing a framework for addressing intimate partner trans- mission.

We should include wom- en at policy-making levels and empower them to change their status within their home and the com- munity through income generation and political participation. Encourage Partnerships in Advancing Equality to Promote Gender Equity There are many inequalities that women face, such as in accessing basic facilities and opportunities, inequalities at the workplace, within households, and in inheritance and property ownership as high- lighted earlier. Policies should be in place for law enforcement and legal agencies to support women who are victims of violence including marital rape. \u201cWe should encourage more partnerships in advancing equality to promote gender equity.

The Gender Dimensions of HIV Transmission in Intimate Partner Relationships A Note on the Terminology While I recognize that a lot of thought has gone into the terminology of \u201cIntimate Partner Transmission\u201d, we need to be careful of not over-generalizing terms when we define problems broadly, as this may lead to ineffective solutions. We need to be clear about the exact problem we are grappling with in dif- ferent contexts, and then develop solutions to address them specifically. The recognition of what we call \u201cIntimate Partner Transmission\u201d should underscore for us the need to continue to do what we are already doing, that is, directing our resources to those who are most-at-risk. It is the infection among those most-at-risk that are being transmitted into long-term intimate partner- ships.

We need better public leader- ship, more empowerment and stronger partnerships\u201d 15 PANELIST PRESENTATIoNS AND STATEMENTS Three Structural Factors Fuelling Intimate Partner Transmission There are three fundamental gender-related structural factors that interact to fuel intimate partner transmission. The first is gender inequality in access to productive resources, an inequality that favors men and creates an unequal balance of power in heterosexual relationships. This inequality makes it less likely that women will have control over sexual interactions and make them more prone to be vic- tims of domestic violence. It also makes them less likely to be able to negotiate condom use or fidelity in their relationships, or leave relationships that they perceive to be risky. Moreover, when women marry young and marry men older than them, a demographic pattern that is fairly common in this region, that power imbalance is further exacerbated, making young women even more vulnerable to becoming infected from their partners. The second factor that fuels Intimate Partner Transmission is the prevalent sexual norms that promote a hetero-normative view of male and female sexuality. This stigmatizes homosexuality and bisexuality, and upholds a double standard of appropriate sexual behavior. The stigma associated with homosexu- ality and bisexuality forces men who have sex with men to keep their sexual behavior and sexual prefer- ences hidden, and adhere to the social pressure to prove their heterosexuality by marrying unsuspect- ing women. Similarly, it is the criminalization and stigmatization of sex workers that put them at greater risk of physical and sexual violence, and forces them to go underground or disperse into settings where it is difficult to reach them or provide health services. The stigma and criminalization also drive their male clients underground, making it difficult to reach them with HIV-prevention education. In all of these ways prevalent sexual norms conspire to create the grounds for Intimate Partner Transmission. The third structural factor that feeds women\u2019s vulnerability in long-term relationships in Asia is the culture of silence that shrouds sex and sexuality, despite more than two decades of exposure to the HIV virus. It is this culture that creates the dichotomy of casual sex as compared to intimate partner sex. Casual sex is socially structured as furtive, free of social boundaries and thus, satisfying, while intimate partner sex is structured as obligatory, stable, for purposes of procreation and, thus, not exciting. It is this culture that keeps women uninformed about sex and HIV prevention, apart from restricting inter- partner communication on ways to make sex more satisfying and pleasurable. A Paradigm Shift \u201cWe cannot hope to address this problem only through public health mea- sures. We need to shift the dynamic of gender relations\u201d Community-based initiatives that address damaging norms of masculinity and femininity and reduce the acceptability of violence against women must be supported and scaled up. Simultaneously, we must implement legislative, policy and programmatic measures to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. These should include the enforcement of laws to grant women equal property and inheritance rights and allow them to make independent decisions regarding mar- riage and divorce. We should also work towards policies that increase women\u2019s access to economic op- portunities and formal employment. We should step up efforts to ensure that girls complete secondary education and have livelihood alternatives, and put in place programmes to increase women\u2019s access to sexual and reproductive health services. \u201cOnce women have more choices to earn an income, to move freely, to de- cide if and when to have sex and get married, and when men realize the cost of perpetuating inequality and damaging norms of masculinity, then reduc- tions in long-term intimate partner transmission will follow\u201d 16 PANELIST PRESENTATIoNS AND STATEMENTS Rufino \u201cRaffy\u201d Martinez is a Migrant Health advocate with ACHIEVE Inc. and a graduate of the Philippine Maritime Institute.

I was on medication for eight months, but I thought everything would be fine once I recovered. But it was not. I was diagnosed with HIV. Although it was difficult, I told my wife about my infection. After a long explanation everything was settled. I encouraged her to have a test done for HIV but she refused to do so. In her mind, she already had the virus. She was also worried about the potential social and health consequences of being infected, including the future of our children. At that time, free ARV treatment was not available for people living with HIV. The pre-departure orientation sessions conducted by my employer did not include HIV/AIDS orientation. We travel far from our loved ones, and tend to engage in sexual encounters with other women and with men. We are also subject to peer pressure to engage in such activity, especially when the ship is in port. There are also negative attitudes with respect to condom-use. Seafarers are largely unaware of the risk that they expose themselves and their loved ones to. Four years after my diagnosis, my wife decided to undergo an HIV test. The availability of ARV through the Global Fund programme, and the help of positive commu- nity networks, NGOs, Government, and other stakeholders made her realize that it was important to get tested. She also tested positive. Migrant workers returning home do not choose to undergo voluntary testing. This is important to ensure that the migrant knows his status, and so he can save himself from infectious diseases. Spouses left behind by their husbands remain faithful. Most spouses don\u2019t think they can get infected with HIV because of the belief that only sex workers can get HIV/AIDS. Finally, the spouses don\u2019t know that if they are already infected with HIV, mother-to-child transmission is Meanwhile, we must continue to work towards reducing the vulnerability of most-at-risk populations, including decriminalizing sex work and homosexuality. These measures will help to reduce the risk of these populations apart from helping to reduce stigma and fostering openness about sexual identity and sexual practice. We must continue to push for age-appropriate sex education for children and ado- lescents, and facilitate open, community led discussions of sexuality, while simultaneously sponsoring new research that will demystify the sexual lives and identities of women and men. With all of these measures, we will be able to dismantle the foundation of inequality, fight the stigma, and break the silence on which intimate partner transmission thrives. 17 PANELIST PRESENTATIoNS AND STATEMENTS Anandi Yuvaraj is Asia-Pacific regional coordinator for the Internation- al Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS (ICW).

There exists a huge gap in the understanding of the characteristics of sexual behaviour among intimate partners that render the designing of effective prevention programmes difficult; \u2022\ufffd The strong patriarchal culture in Asian countries severely limits a woman\u2019s ability to negotiate sex in intimate partner relationships; \u2022\ufffd HIV prevention programmes focused on female partners of men with high-risk behaviors have still not found a place in national HIV plans and priorities; \u2022\ufffd Interventions that only focus on the behaviours and do not address the structural context that shape these behaviours are likely to fail; \u2022\ufffd It is important to understand why men seek paid sex. In this context, it is also important to under- stand the sexual behaviours of migrant workers. While there is no or very little research on this, it could be speculated that seeking paid sex gives them a sense of control which they lack in their daily lives; \u2022\ufffd Violence \u2013 intimate partner violence in particular - and HIV risk have a number of critical intersec- tions. While forced sex poses a direct biological risk for HIV, intimate partner violence also poses in- direct risks, by for example limiting one\u2019s ability to refuse sex or negotiate safe sex, and violence, or the fear of it, may deter women from disclosing their HIV status or seeking HIV testing. This brings to the fore the issue of gender inequality; \u2022\ufffd This also brings into focus the need to address the underlying power structures that effectively keep women in subjugation. As part of this effort, women need wider social and economic mea- sures that would empower them to take their lives in their own hands. This is an area that remains largely under-served; \u2022\ufffd The infected women and children need much more than care and treatment. Importantly, they need protection from stigma and discrimination. There is an urgent need to have an open, frank and value-free discussion on this issue that reaches every person, including in remote corners of the countries in the region, and informs policy-makers and enforcement agencies; \u2022\ufffd The current efforts to address the issue are only remedial. There is a need for programmes to go far beyond these and address structural interventions that are the key to making a dent in the factors underlying the growth of intimate partner transmission of HIV. 19 PANELIST PRESENTATIoNS AND STATEMENTS Key Recommendations A Framework to Address Intimate Partner Transmission of HIV A framework to address HIV transmission in Intimate Partner Transmission in Asia is urgently needed. The framework needs to be both strategic and comprehensive. Critical in this framework is a strong cross-collaboration among actors and the need for a long-term vision. The coverage of populations is an important factor. In most Asian countries, the coverage levels of HIV prevention programmes are barely 30 per cent on an average and hence they hardly dent the progres- sion of the epidemic. Initial work undertaken in Asia highlights the need to incorporate protection for women into all HIV prevention programmes and the need for high quality research to deepen the understanding of the dynamics of HIV transmission among intimate partners prior to designing prevention programmes to address it. Key strategic interventions that have proved successful need to be significantly scaled up. In particular, interventions for MSM, IDUs and clients of sex workers; prevention programmes for \u201cmobile popula- tions\u201d and migrant workers with strong focus on protecting intimate partners. other interventions must include preventing intimate partner violence (including sexual violence), promoting gender equality, reducing income inequities across gender, promoting property rights for women, reducing vulnerability conditions in migration, reducing stigma and discrimination, and im- proving disclosure within discordant couples13. These interventions need to be supported by an enabling environment, hence the need to begin to address the structural determinants of Intimate Partner Transmission of HIV, such as profound gender inequality in law, custom and practice and unfavorable legal frameworks to address HIV comprehen- sively.

It is Important to provide women easy access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health ser- vices14 and also make these services \u2018couple friendly\u2019. Gender and reproductive rights should be an in- tegral part of all HIV programmes and there should be an explicit policy on gender-based violence15. In certain contexts, the prevention of violence against women, girls, boys and sexual minorities should be an integral part of HIV prevention. In this context, it is important to have a periodic review of policies and reform of the legal systems that govern women and vulnerable populations, including the review of laws that criminalize sex work and homosexuality. 13 HIV Transmission in Intimate Partner Relationships in Asia, UNAIDS, 2009 14 Caroline Thomas, Women\u2019s Asia Pacific Network of Positive People (WAPN+), Indonesia 15 Dr. Nafsiah Mboi, Secretary National AIDS Commission, Indonesia 20 PANELIST PRESENTATIoNS AND STATEMENTS Addressing Underlying Structures: In order to support effective preventative measures and interventions, it is important to address the underlying structural causes that put women at risk and increase their vulnerability to HIV in long-term and stable sexual relationships. This will substantially enhance the effectiveness of the efforts to reduce the HIV risk of sex workers, MSM, and IDUs, and would also help break the link between their risk and that of their regular sexual partners. Legal frameworks that continue to pose significant challenges to universal access, prevention treat- ment and care need to be improved and integrate the gender equality and human rights obligations made by governments in line with their international commitments. Measures and programmes that promote and enhance women and girls\u2019 economic empowerment is another broad area of structural intervention that has proved determinant in decreasing women\u2019s vul- nerability to gender based violence and increasing their ability to negotiate safe sex. Community-based initiatives that address damaging norms of masculinity and femininity, promote positive models of masculinities among men and boys and reduce the acceptability of violence against women must be supported and scaled up. Similarly, it is critical to put in place a system to address the factors that make the migrants vulnerable to HIV throughout the migration process. A re-integration programme for migrant workers who are sent back from the host country after being infected with HIV should also be worked out16. Legislation preventing the movement of people who are HIV positive or that impose mandatory testing of future migrants need to be revised as they are ineffective, violate human rights and are not justified in public health. Enhancing Education, Training and Behavioural Change: While continuing to create conditions to lower the vulnerability of most-at-risk populations, there is a need to continue to push for age-appropriate sex education for children and adolescents, and facilitate open, community-led discussions on sexuality. Providing adolescents and married couples skill-train- ing programmes on managing relationships and information on responsible sex is important. There is a need to incorporate e-learning tools in all training programmes so as to reach as many young people as possible. There is also a need to train and re-train behavioral change counselors and VCT counselors, especially focusing on couple counseling. Promoting Condom-Use: As condoms remain the most effective HIV prevention intervention, there is a need to educate and involve all stakeholders in condom-use campaigns. Important in this is to have the buy-in of local gov- ernments, and policy-makers for effective condom promotion among clients of sex workers and among married couples. This approach is particularly important because so far efforts on condoms promotion have essentially targeted sex workers and not their clients. More Research: Quality and context specific research is the basis for making informed policy choices and design effec- tive interventions. There is need for more rigorous operational social research on the political economy of marriage and extramarital sex in the various Asian contexts and understand how this shapes HIV risk and how people could be empowered for change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b399be97-ff56-4cb1-959e-a1343513b76b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b399be97-ff56-4cb1-959e-a1343513b76b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-intimate-partner-transmission-call-action-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Intimate Partner Transmission: A Call for Action - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-intimate-partner-transmission-call-action-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2393a306b1db0f173194ecd5f2622e2c7a54dc9d1eda1ca43864f0fb53f0d013"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e632a60-1435-461d-a018-4aa35103007d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-intimate-partner-transmission-call-action-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50ee50f5a2a429c13c790855bd42714b832cf1437c3f1fa5016127f6eb0b8768"}}, "hash": "fa64f1a8848e8dfdfa1dc391a48620b99072216d47446d100dee580a51ea7bec", "text": "Epidemiological analysis of HIV trends and projec- tions are also needed to keep track of the often changing trends of HIV epidemics and better target in- terventions.

No country in Asia has any programme for impact mitigation. Among the programmes that must be included are income support systems for foster- parents, livelihood security for widows and affected families, securing property and inheritance rights for women, health insurance and social protection mechanisms to protect against catastrophic health expenditures. Resource Needs Estimation Tools: There is need for new \u2018resource needs\u2019 estimation tools. Gender and human rights concerns are found in national AIDS strategies but are not often budgeted and therefore not translated into action. Thus, it is important to include the provision of an enabling environment, including human rights and gender dimensions to HIV responses, even while working out budgets17. Delivering Key Messages and Leadership: Public leadership is needed to acknowledge, challenge and publicly embrace gender transformative and rights-based approaches. There is a need to empower men and women to take on new roles in relationships. It is important to build strong partnerships between health and community systems and build a strong prevention advocacy community. It is crucial to recognize culture as an important factor and use culturally popular methods to deliver messages as well as for creating safe and secure spaces for women and girls and men and boys to discuss issues related to sexuality and build more HIV resilient communities. 17 Caitlin Wiesen, HIV Practice Team Leader, UNDP Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacific 22 RESoURCES References Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008.

HIV/AIDS and Mobility in South Asia With funding and support provided by: ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This report presents the results of a number of qualitative research studies carried out in countries across South Asia, under the oversight of the UNDP Regional HIV, Health and Development Programme for Asia and the Pacifi c, in close partnership with Coordination of Action Research on AIDS and Mobility in Asia (CARAM Asia), ILO Subregional offi ce in Delhi, and with support from UNAIDS. The study profi les seven countries of the South Asian region, namely Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The production of this report has been a particularly collaborative process, driven throughout by a desire to strengthen HIV/AIDS programming at a regional level, and defi ne strong and relevant responses and recommendations that can best address the needs of vulnerable mobile populations in South Asia. We would like to acknowledge the colleagues and partners across the region whose substantive contributions have made this report possible. HIV/AIDS and Mobility in South Asia benefi ted from regional and country level technical reviews, including a joint consultation based on the initial fi ndings of the country studies convened by the SAARC Secretariat, UNDP and ILO in June 2008 in Nepal. The consultation brought together participants of all member states of the SAARC, including representatives of Civil Society and Trade Unions, Ministries of Health and Ministries of Labour and UN Agencies, to discuss in depth and validate the initial fi ndings of the country studies, presented by CARAM Asia. Our thanks to CARAM Asia, a leading regional network of CSOs working on migration and HIV in Asia, and their national counterparts. Particular thanks goes to Cynthia Gabriel of CARAM Asia and Afsar Syed Mohamed of ILO, as well as the SAARC Secretariat and HIV focal points from member states for their role in providing validation of data and valuable advice and input throughout the various stages of this publication. We gratefully acknowledge lead writers Javita Narang and Sue Carey, and editor John Tessitore for their substantive contributions to the production of this report, which was prepared under the overall guidance of Caitlin Wiesen-Antin, former Regional HIV/AIDS Practice Leader and Programme Coordinator for Asia and Pacifi c, UNDP Regional Centre. Special thanks as well to our UNDP colleagues Marta Vallejo Mestres, Jennifer Branscombe, Ian Mungall and Nashida Sattar for their contributions and validation of the report\u2019s fi ndings. It is our hope that the collaborative process which helped shape this report does not end here, that this comprehensive analysis of situations, standards, and practices aff ecting vulnerable mobile populations can strengthen regional programming and advocacy in the region, and drive stronger collaboration throughout South Asia in the future. The goal remains that mobile populations will have access to HIV prevention, care and support services throughout the full cycle of migration.

Vulnerability to HIV is often not the result of any individual choices or actions, but rather the outcome of multiple external factors, including: language barriers; prejudice; discrimination; exploitation; lack of access to health-care facilities, information, social networks, and support mechanisms. While this study highlights many such challenges faced by migrants with regards to HIV, it also illustrates a number of opportunities and examples of best practice from the region. In this regard, there are a number of initiatives already working to reduce the health vulnerabilities of migrants and mobile populations: from the Royal Government of Bhutan\u2019s policy of providing \u201cHealth for All\u201d \u2013 not just Bhutanese residents but also migrants; the decision by the Government of Sri Lanka to include HIV prevention and protection issues in pre-departure sessions for female migrants; and, the initiation of regional and intersectoral consultative processes such as the SAARC conventions and the Colombo process. This study provides a synthesis of current migration trends and the HIV situation in seven countries of South Asia, examining the HIV situation of migrants within the context of gender, national and international migration patterns, policies and legislation. It is our hope that it provides a comprehensive reference tool for future policy, programmes and advocacy, and ultimately, contributes to the protection of migrants\u2019 rights throughout the whole migration cycle. Nicholas Rosellini Deputy Assistant Administrator and Deputy Regional Director Regional Bureau of Asia and Pacifi c UNDP Asia-Pacifi c Regional Center CONTENTS Overview 2 Country Profi les Bangladesh 26 Bhutan 44 India 58 Maldives 82 Nepal 94 Pakistan 112 Sri Lanka 128 2 OVERVIEW Introduction South Asia is home to 23 percent of the world\u2019s population and is the most densely populated region in the world, accounting for about 40 percent of the population of Asia \u2013 as well as 40 percent of the global poor.1 The eight countries of the region (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) are members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), established in 1985. Mobility within each country and migration within the region and abroad continues to grow. Migration is an increasingly attractive option for the millions who seek greater employment and economic opportunities. Migrants are an essential component of the workforce in more economically developed countries and are signifi cant contributors to the national economies of their home countries. In a highly mobile world, migration has become an increasingly complex area of governance, inextricably interlinked with other key policy areas, including economic and social development, national security, human rights, public health, regional stability, and interstate cooperation. Whether national, regional, or international, migration is a multifaceted process. Regular or irregular, forced or voluntary, migration poses critical management challenges to the countries of South Asia.

Significant financial opportunities motivate both skilled and unskilled workers from South Asia to undertake great risks to migrate for employment, most often in neighbouring countries within South Asia, but also to the Middle East and South-East Asia. The four main international markets for South Asian service-providers are: (1) the Gulf and Middle East, primarily Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE); (2) South- East Asia, mainly Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei Darussalam; (3) North-East Asia, both Republic of Korea and Japan; and (4) the English-speaking industrialized countries, in particular the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and Australia. Major mobility also exists within the region. Workers from Bangladesh go to Pakistan and India, and there is movement in both directions between India and Nepal, as well as between Sri Lanka and the southern states of India. The Maldives receives large numbers of migrant workers from the sub-continent, especially workers from Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka working in construction and tourism. Bhutan receives large numbers of migrants from India and Nepal, primarily in the construction industry. Irregular Migration The last twenty years has seen alarming growth in irregular migration. India and Pakistan are frequently used as transit countries for undocumented migrants from Bangladesh and Nepal en route to the Middle East and South-East Asia. Given the informal nature of undocumented migration, no definitive source of irregular or undocumented migrant workers is available. Estimates vary widely, from equal to the number of documented migrants (Bangladesh and India) to five times that number (Nepal). The irregular movement of people is often the result of inadequate regular means of migration and imposed restrictions on segments of society, particularly women. This reality is posing increased challenges for Asian governments, inducing greater regional cooperation in the effort to develop a sustainable regional migration framework. Social networks, with their strong cultural ties and trust, play a vital role in facilitating migration of South Asians to Arab States. In Pakistan and India, Azad visas, known as \u201cfree\u201d or \u201copen\u201d visas, are arranged by acquaintances and relatives who are currently in the Arab States. The cost of overseas employment depends on the type of visa and the nature of work. For example, a company- sponsored visa to Saudi Arabia could cost as much as US$2,900, whereas an Azad visa costs about US$1,450.3 However, the questionable legality of an Azad visa puts the migrant at risk of deportation or harassment by law enforcement agencies. Migrants are generally unaware that Azad visas are not work visas and that their status changes to \u201cundocumented\u201d upon arrival in the host country. According to sources in the labour market and social organizations, there has been a sharp increase in the number of foreign workers arriving on Azad visas. Other practices have a similar impact on the vulnerability of migrants. For example, migration to many Middle Eastern countries is governed by a sponsorship programme, whereby foreigners can be employed only if they are sponsored by a citizen of the respective country. Many citizens sell sponsorships to agents, who charge exorbitant fees, sometimes thousands of dollars, for a work permit. In addition, many migrant workers are sent abroad by agents on either a tourist visa or social visit visa and become undocumented workers when these visas expire. Recruiting Agents An important feature of the South Asia migration process is the emergence of the recruiting industry. Over 90 percent of all recruitment in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh is carried out by recruitment agencies, which develop employment opportunities and facilitate the placement of migrant workers abroad. Initially, agents were paid by potential employers in the destination countries, but more recently they have been allowed to charge workers directly. The dependency of prospective migrants on middlemen and recruiting agencies for information regarding procedures frequently leads to financial exploitation through high processing fees, handling costs, and demands for bribes. Workers seeking employment opportunities abroad are seldom aware of the fee ceiling placed by respective governments on recruitment processes and visa charges, and so are subject to abuse. 3 UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, \u201cHIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: From Asia to the Arab States,\u201d 2009 OVERVIEW 6 Most migrant recruitment in sending countries is licensed and regulated by source country governments. However, given the fragmented nature of the recruitment process and the number of recruiters involved, governments face a major challenge in regulating recruitment agents and halting the operations of unregistered individual agents (dalals), middlemen, or sub-agents who engage in fraudulent practices. Indeed, unregistered agents proliferate in areas affected", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d325db3b-784c-4ec5-b0b1-5bf3f80683cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "d325db3b-784c-4ec5-b0b1-5bf3f80683cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe704a1f5a2e47ee3e283c600d0021ba5c7a19afa14f28dc0c77c78998f20057"}, "3": {"node_id": "9dbe4045-34ce-4bd5-83a4-c225ade2fd87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43145bfbc49c91b57fd817c2bc7ec2f3699f10a1a4bfd8e50e51b8054bfb88e8"}}, "hash": "7f8698dfb9b1bfea29eef8d27def5be00cb946babe60871f509563422cb5f414", "text": "by poverty, economic disparities, conflict, and other factors that cause people to migrate. Occupational Profile Labour flows to the Arab States are dominated by the lower-skilled occupational categories, in particular construction work, transport operations, and domestic service. The estimated percentage of temporary contractual workers from South Asian countries currently in the Arab States is 36 percent from India, 21 percent from Bangladesh, 11 percent from Pakistan, and 10 percent from Sri Lanka. India and Pakistan continue to supply workers to support infrastructure projects in the Gulf States. Both men and women from India work as domestic workers and nurses, construction workers, and technicians in various countries of the Middle East. Female domestic workers from Sri Lanka are now the largest segment of that labour market, spurring the feminization of migration in the Gulf region.4 There is some movement of professionals to the Arab States from South Asia, especially doctors, nurses, and accountants. In 1975, India and Pakistan contributed 97 percent of Asian workers to West Asia, but this is now less than 35 percent, with the South-East Asian share growing from 2 percent to more than 50 percent.5 Growing insecurity at home, lack of economic opportunities, and the prosperity stories of recruiting agents and returnee migrants encourage large migration flows from Nepal to India. Most Nepalese migrants, both men and women, are engaged in low- paying manual labour in manufacturing, construction, agriculture, or the service sector, including domestic work. Thriving construction and tourism industries coupled with a short supply of labourers in the Maldives and Bhutan attract external migrants from the sub- 4 International Organization for Migration (IOM), World Migration Report \u2013 Regional Overviews \u2013 Asia, 2005; available at www.Iom.org. bd. 5 Hugo, G.

India A \u2018new Diaspora\u2019 led by high-skilled professionals moving to Europe and North America and semi- skilled contract workers moving to the Gulf and West and South-East Asia has emerged. About 60% of Indian migrant workers are employed within the construction industry, healthcare, and domestic service. Most Indian migrants to the Middle East are unskilled and semi-skilled temporary migrant labourers who return to India after expiry of their contracts. Nepal During the first eleven months of the fiscal year 2007-2008, of the total 215,639 migrant workers, most were unskilled. The Nepal Government recorded 201,507 workers headed to four countries (Qatar, Malaysia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia) to assume blue-collar jobs in construction, manufacturing, and the service sectors. Pakistan Unskilled or semi-skilled workers account for 66% of total documented Pakistani migrant workers employed abroad and registered in the period 1971 to 2007. Most are manual labourers in the agriculture or construction sector. Migration of professionals remained relatively stable at 2%, with skilled workers decreasing from a high of 36% in 2003 to 29% in 2007. Sri Lanka Of the total cumulative migrant workers from Sri Lanka up to 2008, 22% were unskilled workers and 45% were housemaids. The remaining 33% were semi-skilled, skilled, and professionals.

Women migrate through regular and irregular channels and face social inequality both in host countries and in their home states. Their employment is largely confined to low- skilled, unrecognized, care-centred jobs in the service sector, such as domestic work or entertainment, where vulnerability to verbal, physical, and sexual abuse is high given the isolated nature of their work environment.

The single most important reason for Sri Lankan women to migrate is the inability of their spouses to find employment, either domestically or as migrant workers.6 Independent estimates report that women accounted for 69.1 percent of migrants from Nepal in 2005, although government statistics reported women migrants as 10.8 percent for the same year. A review of migrant remittances to Bangladesh indicates a far greater contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) than official statistics on the number of migrants would suggest. It follows that the actual number of Bangladeshi migrants, both male and female, are significantly understated. Studies show the proportion of undocumented female migrant workers is considerably higher than undocumented male migrants, a fact confirmed by human trafficking estimates within the region. Vulnerability to exploitation, various forms of violence, 6 UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, \u201cHIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: From Asia to the Arab States,\u201d 2009 and rights violations, including human trafficking, are much higher for undocumented migrant workers, especially women. Though restrictive measures on the migration of women in many countries are aimed at protecting them, the number of women migrating under irregular conditions due to these restrictions has increased, putting them at an even greater risk. Human Trafficking Due to its criminal and clandestine nature, human trafficking is difficult to quantify. Within Asia, an estimated 300,000 to 450,000 people are trafficked each year.7 South Asia, with the second largest number of internationally trafficked persons globally, reports an estimated 150,000 trafficking victims each year and has emerged as a source, destination, and transit area for trafficking in persons for both in-country and cross- border trafficking.8 Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are the major centres of origin, while India and Pakistan are destinations or transit countries to other regions, particularly the Middle East.9 Commercial sexual exploitation is the most virulent form of trafficking in South Asia, followed by trafficking for the purpose of forced labour. Other forms of human trafficking include forced marriage, domestic service, organized begging, camel racing, circus work, illicit adoption, pornography production, and organ trafficking. Most of those trafficked are women and girls, but men and boys are also trafficked, with boys as camel jockeys, for forced labour, for adoption, and in some areas as sex workers, and men for forced labour. Within South Asia, a large number of Nepali and Bangladeshi women are trafficked into India and Pakistan, most often as sex workers in the entertainment industry. In Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan, adult women and children of both sexes are more frequently identified as trafficking victims. Trafficking in Nepal is primarily for sexual exploitation. Adult male trafficking victims were reported in Bangladesh, but often for 7 UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, \u201dHuman Trafficking and HIV: Exploring vulnerabilities and responses in South Asia\u201d, 2007 8 The highest numbers are estimated to be 225,000 and come from South-East Asia according to the United Nations Population Fund, State of World Population 2006: A Passage to Hope \u2013 Women and International Migration, 2006. 9 Masud Ali, A.

A significant number of forced labour cases were reported in India from 2003 to 2006, with labour trafficking more frequent than trafficking for sexual exploitation. Migrants have been illegally smuggled into Europe and other countries from South Asia, often under hazardous conditions and under various guises.10 The common route to the Middle East and Europe from Bangladesh or Nepal is to transit through India or Pakistan, often utilizing Indian air routes. Trafficking from Bangladesh to India and Pakistan is via the main trafficking route: Dhaka-Mumbai-Karachi-Dubai. Conflict zones are known to be a haven for traffickers, as internal displacement and adverse human security conditions often lead to forced migration from these areas.

Remittances help to alleviate current account deficits and foreign indebtedness. Remittance flows to developing countries reached US$328 billion in 2008, a 15 percent increase from US$285 billion in 2007. South Asia registered a 33 percent growth in remittance flows in 2008, with India reporting US$51.5 billion, retaining its position as one of the top recipients of migrant remittances among developing countries. Bangladesh was among the top 10 recipients.11 Official statistics do not fully reflect the actual inflow of remittances, as remittances through unofficial channels are very popular, accounting for an estimated 54 percent of total remittances. For example, more than half of total remittances to Bangladesh are sent through hundi/hawala systems,12 or are transferred via friends and relatives or carried by hand by migrants when they return. In Pakistan, the real flow of remittances is estimated to be eight to ten times the US$7 billion going through official channels. The World Bank observes that although remittance flows to South Asia grew significantly in 2008 despite the global economic crisis, the risks of a slowdown in a lagged response to a weak global economy are significant.13 HIV/AIDS Situation Of the 33.4 million adults and children living with HIV and AIDS worldwide, an estimated 2 to 3.5 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) are in South Asia.14 Given its large population, the South Asia region is second 11 World Bank, \u201dMigration and Development Brief 10\u201d and \u201cMigration and Development Brief 11,\u201d Migration and Remittances Team Development Prospects Group, July 13, 2009. 12 Hundi refers to financial instruments evolved on the Indian sub-continent and used in trade and credit transactions as remittance instruments (to transfer funds from one place to another).

Since migrant male workers tend to buy sex when they are away from home, several million of them will be at risk of infection during the migration cycle. All countries in South Asia have established official national AIDS coordinating bodies and national strategic frameworks in response to the HIV epidemic. However, the political status, authority, and capacity of these bodies vary greatly; and the development of appropriate national policies, plans, and programmes are often hindered by limited human and financial resources and leaders who lack the mandate to effectively guide a coordinated response to the epidemic. India alone accounts for 2.4 million people living with HIV, approximately 93 percent of those infected in South Asia. Nepal, with the highest prevalence at 0.5 percent, accounts for only 2.7 percent of infections regionally. And Pakistan, with an estimated 96,000 PLHIV, accounts 15 Redefining AIDS in Asia: Crafting an Effective Response, Oxford University Press, 2008 16 Markus Haacker and Mariam Claeson, (eds.), HIV and AIDS in South Asia \u2013 an Economic Development Risk, World Bank, 2009. OVERVIEW 10 for 3.7 percent. Within the region, the most severe epidemics occur in parts of India and Nepal, where the epidemic is driven by sex work, injecting drug use, and unprotected sex between men. Both Bangladesh and Pakistan face growing epidemics, particularly among injecting drug users, but HIV rates remain relatively low among sex workers in those countries, providing an opportunity to avert a major heterosexual epidemic. HIV prevalence in Sri Lanka remains low, even among vulnerable groups. In all of these countries, MSM represent an important vulnerable population. Although there is little data in Bhutan and the Maldives, what data is available suggests that both countries have low-prevalence epidemics. Drawing comparisons on PLHIV and HIV prevalence in adult populations of the countries of South Asia is hazardous given the varying parameters in epidemiological data collection in each country. In many cases the information is just not available, and what is available lacks sufficient analysis to allow for realistic comparisons across countries. Discussions about the numbers of PLHIV, HIV prevalence, and migrants as a percentage of estimated PLHIV in the countries in South Asia must be prefaced with a caution about interpreting estimates based on minimal data and the scale of testing versus the relative absence of testing among the general population.

Despite the bias of HIV testing of migrants, large proportions of people living with HIV in South Asia became infected while working abroad, showing a large gap in the HIV response that needs to be addressed. In Bangladesh: According to the National AIDS STI Programme Report (2006), approximately 67 percent of identified HIV-positive cases in the country are returnee migrant workers and their spouses. Bhutan: The National Strategic Plan for the Prevention and Control of STIs and HIV/AIDS reports an estimated 160 cases of HIV in Bhutan, 80 males and 80 females. No data is available about the number of migrants or expatriates who have tested positive for HIV. India: By 2007, 2.4 million people in India were estimated to be HIV-positive. In spite of a high level of mobility, both external and within the country, and of reports of trafficking of women and children, migrants are not included among the most-at-risk populations. In the National AIDS Control Programme Phase III (NACP- III), the focus is on three most-at-risk population groups (female sex workers, IDU, and MSM) and one bridge population, internal migrants. In 1998 the National AIDS Control Organization in India formalized an annual HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) across the country, with the number of sites for the HSS increasing from 176 in 1998 to 1,215 in 2008. Prior to 2005 sentinel surveys did not include migrants as a vulnerable population, so data related to migrants was limited. From 2005 onward sentinel surveys have collected data on migrants (focussing on high-risk migrants/single male migrants), and the overall number of sentinel sites for migrants has increased over the past three years, from one site in 2005 to eight in 2008. Maldives: The total number of HIV cases in the Maldives is estimated at 182, of which 93 percent (168) are expatriates and 14 are Maldivians. Nepal: According to estimates in the UNGASS 2007 Nepal Report, 41 percent of people living with HIV in Nepal are migrant workers. According to the UNAIDS 2006 Report, 46 percent of HIV cases in Nepal were among seasonal labour migrants. HIV prevalence among returnee migrants in Nepal is estimated to be above 1.5 percent. A study conducted in 2006 among Nepali migrants travelling to Indian cities for work found that 27 percent of the men engaged in high-risk sexual behaviour while in India. Another study indicates that between 22 and 38 percent of young Nepalese women trafficked to India and returning to Nepal were found to be HIV positive. Pakistan: According to UNAIDS estimates, about 96,000 people were living with HIV in Pakistan at the end of 2007, about 0.1 percent of the adult population.17 The National AIDS Programme\u2019s latest figures show over 4,000 HIV cases reported to date. Recent evidence indicates that the situation is changing rapidly, shifting to a concentrated epidemic. At present, the overall seroprevalence of HIV among IDUs is 15.8 percent and among MSW 1.5-1.8 percent.18 The National HIV and AIDS Strategic Framework includes migrant workers among the groups vulnerable to HIV transmission within the country. Many of the reported HIV-positive cases are found among low-skilled Pakistani workers deported from the Gulf States. NACP officials claim that the country lacks a proper database of information about migrants who travel abroad and return home. During the period 1996-1998, 58 returned migrant workers with HIV represented more than half of all reported cases, with the wives of five returning workers also testing positive for HIV.19 Sri Lanka: Statistics vary widely on the number of PLHIV in Sri Lanka. A conservative estimate is 3,800 (58 percent male, 42 percent female), of which about 1,990 (52 percent) are migrants and almost half are women migrants. The high prevalence rate among migrant women is an indicator of the increasing number of migrant workers in the Arab States who are testing HIV positive. Migration and HIV/AIDS Many migrants are unaware of AIDS and continue to remain so even after testing HIV positive.

Consequently, the development, implementation, and enforcement of a comprehensive migration policy at the national and regional level represent a vital first step toward effective protection of South Asian migrant workers. 20 The migration process for both documented and undocumented migrants increases vulnerability to physical and economic exploitation. Vulnerability to HIV is not so much the result of individual free choice, but rather the outcome of multiple external factors, including: language barriers; prejudice; discrimination; exploitation; lack of access to information, social networks, and health-care facilities; limited support mechanisms; and changes in lifestyle due to being away from home.21 Moreover, given their illegal status, undocumented migrants face even greater challenges accessing health information and services prior to departure, in-transit, and at destination. Access to Health Services and HIV Prevention Lack of access to health care is a persistent problem among migrant populations as host countries and employers often don\u2019t provide health care free of charge. Moreover, given their limited financial means, restricted access to information, discrimination and language barriers, seeking health care when they need it makes it a real challenge. Undocumented migrants are even less likely to access medical services offered by the government as they live in fear of detention and deportation. Lack of referral systems and support services in most destination countries is a major impediment in addressing HIV among mobile populations. One reason that governments are reluctant to make anti-retroviral therapy (ART) available to migrant workers is that they fear it will lead to an increasing number of HIV-infected migrants trying to enter the country, thus burdening public health programmes. The reality, however, is that economic opportunity remains the driving force behind migration, not the 20 CARAM Asia, \u201cState of Health of Migrants,\u201d Coordination of Action Research on AIDS and Mobility Asia, 2007. 21 CARAM Asia, \u201cThe Forgotten Space,\u201d 2004. search for therapies. For example, in countries such as Thailand where ART is provided to migrants, no major increase in migration has been reported. In South Asia, only in Bhutan is primary health care provided free to everyone who accesses the health care system irrespective of nationality, although ART is not available for non-citizens. Mandatory Testing Countries of origin, such as Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, have clear national policies against mandatory HIV testing of their citizens, but no South Asian nation has the comprehensive monitoring and enforcement to ensure HIV-testing standards are met by either private or government-approved testing centres. The reality is that prospective migrant workers will agree to the testing in order to meet the requirements for an employment opportunity abroad. At the very least, such HIV testing standards as pre- and post-test counselling, informed consent, and confidentiality need to be applied in these situations. Unfortunately, these standards are rarely met. There have been several reported cases of migrants who tested positive for HIV and were prohibited from migrating and, further, who were not informed of their HIV test result or given counselling or referral. As a result, these prospective migrants remained unaware of their status and were likely to infect their partner or spouse unknowingly. In Sri Lanka, mandatory medical testing for departing migrant workers is practiced with the approval of the government, which permits the Gulf Cooperation Council Approved Medical Centres Association (GAMCA) to conduct mandatory testing without ensuring that HIV testing standards are applied. Migrants are also required to undergo mandatory HIV testing in most host countries, especially in South-East Asia and the Gulf, upon arrival, despite pre-departure tests in the country of origin. After integrating in the host country as regular migrants, these individuals are required to submit to periodic mandatory testing in order to maintain their eligibility to stay and work in the country. In the Maldives, there is compulsory HIV screening of all persons who seek employment; and all Maldivians who spend more than a year outside the country are required to be screened upon return to their home country. In Bhutan, there is no mandatory testing except for blood donor screening. 13 Worldwide, there are 30 countries that force HIV- positive foreigners to leave.22 When as a consequence of HIV-positive status migrants are taken into custody and detained, adequate systems are not in place in most of the countries to ensure appropriate HIV treatment. Moreover, there are reports of cases where migrants have been jailed upon discovery of their HIV status and subsequently deported without any explanation or discussion of their condition.23 Imposition of compulsory health testing in destination countries may drive migrant workers who are aware of personal health conditions or HIV status to shun healthcare systems out of fear of being", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8653107-79c1-4a0e-b223-0c524823e69f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8653107-79c1-4a0e-b223-0c524823e69f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68bc2b30a2e50f63ecb40ecc0291c0e041873e809049613a49a5fa0e560a839b"}}, "hash": "68bc2b30a2e50f63ecb40ecc0291c0e041873e809049613a49a5fa0e560a839b", "text": "deported or because of their undocumented status. This exclusionary policy defeats any public health goals as those in need of health services will not access them, potentially resulting in the worsening of the individual\u2019s health condition, and perhaps negatively affecting public health. The spread of tuberculosis is a good example of the unfortunate outcome of this approach.24 South Asian nations have no process for reintegrating HIV-positive migrants who have been deported or return home on their own. HIV-infected returnees often prefer to hide their deported status, as well as their HIV status, for fear of exclusion and humiliation. A strong support system that facilitates migrant reintegration is an important component of migrant health programming. Migration Policies and Legislation International, Regional, and Bilateral Agreements There is no exclusive regional framework or regionally- funded initiatives for migration management in South Asia. There are, however, agreements on the steps that need to be taken to address the primary issues, as well as ongoing efforts to engage key stakeholders at regional and national levels. 22 Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, and all countries in the Gulf. The United States was also part of this list, but although it implemented this policy for over 20 years, the policy was discontinued as of January 2010. 23 Human Rights Watch, \u201cDiscrimination, Denial and Deportation \u2013 Human Rights Abuses Affecting Migrants Living with HIV\u201d, 2009. 24 Gilmore, N., \u201cHuman Rights Issues and Migration,\u201d presentation at the 12th World AIDS Conference, Geneva, Switzerland, July 1998. International Conventions International conventions and regional agreements concerning the rights of migrant workers are the result of governments working to tackle the legal grey areas regarding the cross-border movement of populations. The complex migration process creates ambiguity in terms of accountability for the welfare of migrants throughout the migration cycle. Broader governmental and legislative support coupled with adjustments and ratification of domestic legal norms is necessary to secure the rights for noncitizens. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is applicable to all member states of the World Trade Organization (WTO), regardless of their national policies. The aim is to achieve highly progressive levels of liberalization of trade in services among WTO members. Labour migration is particularly affected by Mode 4 of GATS, which targets Temporary Movement of Natural Persons (TMNP). The GATS does not take a rights-based approach to labour migration, and it provides leeway for states to exclude migrant workers from domestic legislation and basic human rights. The rights of migrants are often compromised by the policies and regulations of the source and destination countries from pre-departure to integration in the host country to reintegration upon their return home. Destination countries are free to impose restrictive policies that curb a migrant\u2019s liberty of movement and right to work, and to disregard a migrant\u2019s right to public health services. GATS allows labour-importing countries to ignore socio-economic public expenditures, such as health and social services, cultural issues, and the integration mechanisms associated with large-scale permanent migration. In South Asian countries constitutional rights generally apply only to citizens, leaving migrant workers extremely vulnerable to discriminatory practices. To address this reality, the 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families was adopted by the UN General Assembly and came into force July 1, 2003. The convention requires States to provide migrant workers with the same access to education, housing, and health services that is available to nationals. In South Asia the response to the convention has been limited, as it has been ratified by Sri Lanka and signed by Bangladesh, only. OVERVIEW 14 Regional and Bilateral Agreements Very few bilateral, multilateral, or regional agreements exist to protect the rights of migrants. Moreover within those, the rights to health and access to health services are low priorities. In 2004 the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with the UNAIDS Secretariat and its co-sponsors to help Member States work toward the goals of HIV prevention and the appropriate care and support for people living with HIV and AIDS. The SAARC Regional Strategy on HIV and AIDS (2006\u20132010) was endorsed in August 2006 at the 27th Session of the Council of Ministers, held in Dhaka, where leadership mobilization and promotion of a regional dialogue on cross-border issues relevant to HIV/AIDS were stressed. At the initiative of the Labour Minister of India, a meeting of Labour Ministers of SAARC countries, HIV/ AIDS in the World of Work, was held in Geneva on the sidelines of the 96th Session of the International Labour Conference of the International Labour Organization (ILO)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f607ce12-d91c-42af-8e20-e0fd9e40fe5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f607ce12-d91c-42af-8e20-e0fd9e40fe5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f3c6dba23c7b31c4755a8c852f323442ffa656f886e01e21b6896f1ef9913e7"}, "3": {"node_id": "dea07483-9a22-41ec-ade0-029ab6278dda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35e046f54e5e174ba604dad9fb9da4af60de0331fbb33cb42e511118e0306a12"}}, "hash": "f57419a0a9c415150d85b86f9a722e0b86531801f20b6e225208092577884b90", "text": "in June 2007.

The SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution (2002) represents significant and substantial progress in the fight against trafficking. Efforts to draft a convention to combat trafficking began at the Ninth SAARC Summit in 1997. The convention was adopted by SAARC during the 11th Summit in 2002. By 2005 all SAARC Member States had ratified it and it entered into force. Regional Consultative Processes Regional consultative processes (RCPs) on migration bring together representatives of states, international organizations, and, in some cases, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for informal and non-binding dialogue and information exchange on migration- related issues of common interest and concern. RCPs involve participating states from multiple geographical regions, drawn together by common interest in a specific migration topic or topics. The Colombo Process, which began in 2003, is officially known as the Ministerial Consultation on Overseas Employment and Contractual Labour for Countries of Origin in Asia. The governments of five South Asian countries of origin \u2013 Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka \u2013 along with six other Asian labour- exporting countries are participants in the Colombo Process, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) acts as secretariat. The core priorities of the process include: \u2022\ufffd Protection of and provision of services to migrant workers; \u2022\ufffd Optimizing benefits of organized labour migration; \u2022\ufffd Capacity building, data collection, and inter-state cooperation. As a follow-up to the third ministerial consultation under the Colombo Process, held in Bali in 2005, activities in two broad areas were undertaken: \u2022\ufffd Working with governments and private institutions to enhance national capacity \u2013 for instance, introducing a labour market research unit in each Colombo Process country to monitor manpower requirements in major countries of destination in order to meet demand with matching skills and to establish linkages among countries to better facilitate labour migration.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dea07483-9a22-41ec-ade0-029ab6278dda": {"__data__": {"id_": "dea07483-9a22-41ec-ade0-029ab6278dda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f3c6dba23c7b31c4755a8c852f323442ffa656f886e01e21b6896f1ef9913e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f607ce12-d91c-42af-8e20-e0fd9e40fe5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f57419a0a9c415150d85b86f9a722e0b86531801f20b6e225208092577884b90"}}, "hash": "35e046f54e5e174ba604dad9fb9da4af60de0331fbb33cb42e511118e0306a12", "text": "\u2022\ufffd Disseminating information to potential migrants regarding legal labour migration opportunities and procedures and the risks of irregular migration in order to ensure that migrants make informed decisions.

The first Ministerial Consultation on Overseas Employment and Contractual Labour for Countries of Origin and Destination in Asia, known as the Abu Dhabi Dialogue, was held in January 2008. The United Arab Emirates took the groundbreaking step of hosting the inaugural Ministerial Consultation between Asian sending countries and host countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. Yemen and two other Asian countries of destination, Malaysia and Singapore, also participated. The Abu Dhabi Dialogue constitutes a milestone in regional cooperation on contractual labour mobility based on a new collaborative approach that is forward-looking and action-oriented. At the end of this Ministerial Consultation, ministers of the participating countries adopted the Abu Dhabi Declaration. The Abu Dhabi Declaration aims to better address issues OVERVIEW 16 surrounding temporary contractual labour mobility by developing key partnerships between source and destination countries and by optimizing the benefits of migration to countries and migrant workers. Priorities include: \u2022\ufffd Developing and sharing knowledge on labour market trends, skills profiles, workers, and remittances policies and flows, and on their relationship to development. \u2022\ufffd Building capacity for the more effective matching of labour supply and demand. \u2022\ufffd Preventing illegal recruitment and promoting welfare and protection measures for contractual workers. \u2022\ufffd Developing a framework for a comprehensive approach to managing the cycle of temporary contractual work that fosters the mutual interest of countries of source and destination. The Bali Process is officially known as the Bali Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime among 42 participating governments, including six South Asian nations: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The current thematic priorities remain strengthening regional policy and law enforcement cooperation to combat trafficking and smuggling. These ministerial consultations have balanced the agenda to evenly address trafficking issues with an increasing focus on victim protection. Child sex tourism, particularly greater law enforcement cooperation in combating the crime, has been added as a priority area. The Inter-Governmental Asia-Pacific Consultations on Refugees, Displaced Persons and Migrants, referred to as the APC, involves 33 governments, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka from South Asia. APC was established in 1996 to provide a forum for discussion and greater regional cooperation regarding issues of population movements, including refugees, displaced or trafficked persons, and migrants. Bilateral and Multilateral Agreements A limited number of bilateral or multilateral agreements aimed at protecting the rights of migrants have been signed and implemented in South Asia. Bangladesh has signed agreements with Iraq, Libya, Qatar, and Malaysia. Its MoU with Malaysia addresses workers\u2019 rights on wage scales, working and living conditions, and levels of social protection, e.g., provident funds, gratuities, medical care and compensation, and access to instruments of social dialogue, such as freedom of association. India has bilateral agreements with Jordan, Qatar, UAE, Oman, Kuwait, and Malaysia. In addition, it has signed an Indo-German agreement on Social Insurance and an India-France Social Security Agreement. India is negotiating and concluding bilateral social security agreements and labour mobility agreements with major destination countries. Nepal has signed MoU with the governments of Qatar, UAE, and Republic of Korea. The UAE agreement specifies compliance with labour contracts signed between recruiting agencies and workers according to the rights and obligations of workers and employers in both countries. The Qatar agreement assures Nepali workers remuneration and facilities according to Qatar\u2019s labour law, with wages to be paid at par with migrant workers from other countries. Nepal\u2019s MoU with Republic of Korea fixes the minimum monthly salary at 780,000 Korean won (US$844). Pakistan has signed agreements with Kuwait, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Qatar, and UAE, and two MoU have also been signed between Pakistan and Libya. Sri Lanka has signed MoU on migration with Lebanon, Bahrain, and Malaysia. In May 2009 leaders of the Sri Lanka trade unions and their counterparts from Bahrain, Jordan, and Kuwait signed major cooperation agreements to protect the rights of Sri Lankan migrant workers in the Arab States. National Policies and Legislation All South Asian countries follow national legal frameworks to manage migration, although most have yet to develop streamlined policies. Apart from India and Bangladesh, there are no specific policies on internal migration in countries in the region. Poverty reduction and urbanization policies marginally cover internal migration. India\u2019s Emigration Act (1983) governs overseas migration, including the recruitment agencies that must register with the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs. The office of the Protector General of Emigrants is assigned responsibility for protecting, advising, and 17 aiding migrants throughout the migration cycle.

The act supports coordinated management of the migration process, and protects the rights and welfare of migrant workers. Migration in Pakistan is regulated and controlled under its Emigration Ordinance (1979) and Emigration Rules (1979), both of which are undergoing amendments. These policy documents empower the office of the Protector of Emigrants to act as the guardian of migrants in Pakistan, advising on legal issues, such as assessing the legitimacy of the overseas employment contract. Pakistan as a host country has established the National Alien Registration Authority to issue work permits to those seeking employment or operating a business. Sri Lanka has a National Labour Migration policy developed by the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, with ILO support. As a host country, Bhutan has strict policies on immigration governed by the Immigration Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan (2007). The goal is to ensure the Kingdom remains free from illegal immigrants and retains control of the immigration of foreigners. The entry, exit, and stay of foreigners in India are governed by the Foreigners Act (1946) and the Passport (Entry into India) Act (1920). All foreigners who stay in India for longer than 180 days are required to register with the local police. However, citizens of India and Nepal can travel and work freely across the border under the bilateral friendship treaty signed in 1950. Similarly, the Government of the Maldives has a legal framework for regulating entry of expatriate workers. All expatriate employment is controlled by the Ministry of Higher Education, Employment, and Social Security, which requires a security deposit from employers to be used to facilitate the repatriation of employees, if necessary. Work permits are required before employment. Opportunities and Best Practices from the Region Access to Healthcare for Migrants in Bhutan The Royal Decree on HIV and AIDS, issued in May 2004, serves as the guiding principle in the fight against HIV and AIDS in Bhutan. The decree calls for all members of society to help prevent HIV and AIDS and to provide care and compassion to those infected.

In line with the Alma Ata Declaration, Bhutan committed to establishing a relevant and cost-effective health-care delivery system based on the primary health care approach. This has been informally taken to apply to all residents of Bhutan, including non-nationals. Labour Attach\u00e9 Position in Bangladesh Missions Overseas The post of Labour Attach\u00e9 was created in the Bangladesh missions in labour receiving countries to register migrants and to protect their rights. The provisions for signed contracts and measures regarding breach of contract by employers ensure more accountability from the agents and sub-agents of recruiters, and they allow the Labour Attaches to take action when breaches occur. Pre-departure Training for Migrants in Sri Lanka A significant number of migrants employed abroad are not reached by existing national sexual and reproductive health programmes at departure, in transit, on arrival at their host country, or on return to their home country. However, pre-departure seminars recently launched by the Government of Sri Lanka offered to female migrants usually run for 13 days (72 hours) and have started to include a two-hour session on HIV prevention and protection issues. Regional Consultative Processes Initiatives such as the SAARC Conventions and the Colombo process are examples of positive regional cooperation on issues of migration and trafficking.

Challenges Policies and Enforcement While migrant workers are considered a vulnerable group in terms of HIV, most South Asian countries do not have an effective programme to provide them with HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care, and support at any point in the migration cycle. No South Asian nation has comprehensive migration policies that address all stages of migration; enforcement regulations to protect migrants from mandatory HIV testing; or monitored adherence to generally accepted testing standards. India and Pakistan are in the process of formulating these migration policies. Pre-departure Orientation Programmes South Asian migrants lack basic information and awareness about their universal human rights and legal rights. Although some nation states have initiated pre- departure orientation programmes to address this issue, participation is not compulsory and content is limited. Significant efforts will be required before measurable outputs are achieved. While pre-departure orientation programmes exist in South Asia, they often do not include an effective health component. Migrants remain unaware of their health rights. Despite the inclusion of an HIV component in the orientation programmes in Nepal and Sri Lanka, their training programmes need close follow up to ensure they met minimum requirements of basic HIV awareness and information. Migrant Rights No pro-active system exists in South Asia, either at the national or regional level, to address the violation of migrants\u2019 labour rights or human rights at any stage of the migration cycle. Most South Asian nations remain passive when it comes to enforcing the rights of international migrants. Most labour exporting countries in South Asia allow themselves to be dictated to by destination countries in their efforts to find employment for their citizens, while doing too little to encourage employment and income generation at home. 19 Recruitment Procedures Dependency of prospective migrants on middlemen and recruiting agencies for overseas employment assistance creates a fragmented recruitment process and increases fees. Moreover, the large number of recruiters makes it difficult for governments to monitor recruitment standards and migration trends . Reintegration Reintegration programmes for returnee migrants are almost non-existent, especially for those HIV-positive migrants who are deported from host countries. Gender Inequality Overly protective and restrictive gender policies lead to illegal migration, which is evident from the unofficial statistics of female migrants. Intra-regional trafficking within South Asia is more prevalent than trans-regional trafficking. India and Pakistan are the main destinations of trafficking, while victims are sourced primarily from Nepal and Bangladesh. Information Quality Regularly updated databases of migrant labourers are unavailable in South Asia, making it difficult to develop targeted services and programmes for migrants in the country of origin, as well as in the host country. OVERVIEW 20 Recommendations Multi-faceted cooperation among SAARC Member Countries is vital to ensuring an eff ective response to HIV and migration in South Asia, and to guaranteeing safe migration and reduced HIV vulnerability among migrants throughout the migration cycle \u2013 pre- departure, transit, post-arrival and return. To reach this, it will be necessary to take action in a range of key areas, such as: 1.

With over 160 million people in 2008, Bangladesh is the eighth most populous country in the world and is among the most densely populated countries globally.1 According to the World Bank the 2008 gross national income per capita was US$520.2 Bangladesh has a high poverty rate, although the poverty rate has fallen signifi cantly over the past several decades: from an estimated 70 percent in 1971 to 58 percent in 1992 and to 40 percent in 2005.3 The World Bank also notes that the country has made signifi cant progress in human development in the areas of literacy, gender parity in schooling, and reduction in population growth.4 Migration Patterns Migration is widely accepted as a livelihood and development option in Bangladesh. According to estimates from the state-run Bureau of Manpower, Employment & Training (BMET), the number of documented migrants travelling abroad for employment in 2008 was 875,055, an increase of 5.1 percent over 2007. Despite global economic recession, in 2009 alone a total of 475,278 migrants left the country for overseas employment. The cumulative number of migrants from 1976 to 2009 is 6,741,187.

Professional workers include doctors, engineers, teachers, and nurses; skilled workers include manufacturing or garment workers, drivers, computer operators, and electricians; semi- skilled workers include tailors and masons; and unskilled workers include housemaids, agricultural workers, hotel workers, and such basic labourers as cleaners, cart loaders, and cotton pickers. 5 Bureau of Manpower, Employment & Training (BMET), \u201cFlow of Migration by Country of Employment,\u201d 2009. For the period 1976 to 2009, 50 percent (3.4 million) of all migrant workers going abroad were classifi ed as unskilled, 31 percent (2.1 million) were skilled, 16 percent (1.1 million) were semi-skilled, and only about 3 percent (0.2 million) fell into the professional category. Although there are about 800 formal recruitment agencies in Bangladesh, a large number of migrant workers receive work permits through unoffi cial channels, such as relatives and private recruiting agents, and migrate without the knowledge of BMET. According to available estimates, 55-60 precent of migrants seeking overseas employment do so in this manner.

In these cases, hiring agents are usually involved only for paper processing, including BMET clearance, and ticketing. There is no mechanism to identify and regulate the middlemen who are recruiting domestic workers. Migration of children is also reported. In Bangladesh child migrants constitute two broad groups: those who choose to migrate in recognition of the gaps in opportunities between home and the cities; and those who are victims of economic deprivation, social discrimination, or environmental degradation.8 Irregular migration via informal recruitment practices, large migration costs, informal and unregulated channels for remittances, and human traffi cking all contribute to abuse and violations of the rights of migrants. There is also a lack of data and follow-up with returnee migrants. An increasing trend among Bangladeshi migrants returning from diff erent countries indicates the need for reintegration assistance by various stakeholders to prevent irregular migration. 6 International Labour Organization (ILO), \u201cInternational labour migration from Bangladesh: A decent work perspective,\u201d 2005; Therese Blanchet, et al., \u201cDocumenting the undocumented: Female migrant workers from Bangladesh,\u201d July 2005. 7 UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, \u201cHIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: From Asia to the Arab States,\u201d 2009. 8 Development Research Centre on Migration, Globalization, and Poverty, 2009.

Prior to 1991, 98 percent of all migrants were men. During the period 1991 to 2003, less than 1 percent of total migrants were women. Signifi cantly lower migration among women is largely due to government restrictions on overseas employment of female workers. In 1981 the government banned the migration of all categories of female workers other than professionals. In 1987 the ban was replaced by restrictions on the migration of unskilled and semi-skilled women. In 1988 and again in 1997 the government eased these restrictions; and since 2003 restrictions apply only to women under 35, who are still not allowed to migrate on their own.9 As is often the case, restrictions on the mobility of female workers have only encouraged clandestine migration. Currently, women offi cially account for 4 percent (nearly 21,000) of registered Bangladeshi migrant workers abroad, although many more undocumented female migrants are believed to be working in Asia and the Middle East.10 9 ILO, \u201cInternational labour migration from Bangladesh.\u201d 10 IOM Press Briefi ng: IOM Backs Training for Bangladesh\u2019s Women Migrant Workers, July 8, 2009; available at www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/ media/press-briefi ng More recently, in September 2007 a Gazette Notifi cation was issued by the Government of Bangladesh on female domestic workers bound for Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arab States.

The main traffi cking route is Dhaka-Mumbai-Karachi-Dubai .16 The lucrative market for irregular migration and traffi cking is fuelled by restrictive immigration policies that deter regular migration, such as poor regulation of recruitment agencies or sanctions for traffi ckers, and long-standing economic and political trade-off s between traffi ckers and regulators. Internal traffi cking in Bangladesh is also rampant, as women and children (both girls and boys) from rural areas are traffi cked to urban centres for commercial sexual exploitation and forced labour.

Migrants from Noakhali and Chittagong generally have not become citizens of destination countries. However, they help others to migrate, intensifying temporary migration from their home district.

Remittances The fl ow of migrant remittances to Bangladesh has consistently increased over the last 30 years. While total remittances to Bangladesh were only US$24 million in 1976, remittances sent by migrants through offi cial channels in fi scal year 2007 reached a record high level of US$6.568 billion, according to the Central Bank of Bangladesh. In fi scal year 2009 migrant remittances leaped to US $10.72 billion, far exceeding all projections.20 At the end of fi scal year 2007 the remittance-GDP ratio in Bangladesh jumped to 9.4 percent from 7.7 percent in the previous year. Bangladesh was the 10th largest recipient of remittances among the developing countries in terms of average per migrant for the period 1990 to 2005, and it ranked 14th among all of the remittance-recipient countries in terms of the total amount of remittances received in 2005.21A summary of the remittances of Bangladeshi workers each year from 1991 to 2008 is provided in Figure 5. Offi cial channels for transfer of remittances include demand drafts issued by a bank or an exchange house, 20 World Bank, Migration and Remittances Factbook 2008; and Central Bank of Bangladesh, 2009. 21 US State Department, The World Factbook 2009; available at www.cia.gov/library/publications. travellers\u2019 cheques, postal money orders, account- to-account transfers, automated teller machine transactions, electronic funds transfers, and in-kind transfers such as gold purchases. Remittances are sometimes transferred directly from the foreign account of a migrant worker to his own account at home. Government and several private fi nancial institutions off er competitive interest rates and tax exemptions to attract remittances through offi cial channels. These instruments include the Non-resident Foreign Currency Deposit (NFCD), Wage Earners\u2019 Development Bond, and the Non-resident Investor\u2019s Taka Account (NITA). Offi cial channels and schemes are utilized mostly by migrants with professional backgrounds and high wages, whereas semi-skilled and unskilled migrants often use unoffi cial channels, which are less expensive and more easily accessible. Hundi, or money couriers, are the most common unoffi cial channels of transfer. Hundi refers to the transfer of resources outside the international or national legal foreign currency transfer framework. Other unoffi cial methods include asking friends and relatives who are returning to Bangladesh to personally carry home funds earned abroad. According to a study conducted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the period 1981-2000, the total recorded and unrecorded private transfers to Bangladesh amounted Figure 5: Expatriate Bangladeshis and their Remittances 1991 to 2008 BANGLADESH 32 to US$34.5 billion and US$49.6 billion respectively, indicating that unrecorded remittances represented 59 percent of total remittances to Bangladesh.22 This is similar to the World Bank estimate of 54 percent. 23 In order for the financial system to use remittances more efficiently to accelerate the country\u2019s economic development, funds remitted informally would need to be channelled through smooth, easy and quick formal arrangements.

HIV/AIDS Situation According to the Bangladesh National AIDS and STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease) Program (NASP), the number of HIV cases in the country is estimated at 7,500, although the number of cases officially reported is significantly lower.24 By December 2009 there were 1,745 reported cases of HIV and 619 cases of AIDS, as well as 205 AIDS-related deaths.

An estimated 2.2 to 3.9 million Bangladesh nationals are considered to be at higher risk of acquiring HIV, including drug users, female sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men (MSM), and internal and cross border migrants.26 From 1999 to 2008, HIV prevalence in central Dhaka showed a rapid increase, and the 8th Serological Surveillance indicates HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs) has reached a concentrated epidemic of 7 percent in one neighbourhood in Dhaka.27 Moreover, passive case reporting suggests that Bangladesh nationals returning from regions of high HIV prevalence, whether victims of cross-border trafficking or migrants returning from jobs overseas, may also be at higher risk.28 National Response to HIV/AIDS The Directorate General of Health Services in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare produced a National Policy on HIV/AIDS in 1997. A high-level National AIDS Committee (NAC) was formed, with a Technical Advisory Committee and a National AIDS/STD Program (NASP) unit in the Ministry. NAC comprises national experts from various disciplines, including parliamentarians, representatives from key ministries, and NGOs. NASP is responsible for coordinating with all stakeholders and development partners involved in HIV and AIDS programming. Based on the National Policy on HIV/AIDS, the five year (1997-2002) Strategic Plan for the National AIDS Program of Bangladesh focused on issues related to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STI), with emphasis on safe blood transfusion protocols. The implementation of the 2nd Strategic Plan for the National HIV/AIDS Program (2004-2010) is currently underway. In 2007 the government agreed on a National AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation framework, and developed the Operational Plan 2006-2010, which includes ongoing national programs funded by international and national donors. The Government of Bangladesh developed the National Advocacy and Communication Strategy (2005-2010) in 26 World Bank and UNAIDS, \u201c20 Years of HIV in Bangladesh: Experiences and Way Forward\u201d, December 2009, 27 Ibid. 28 Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, Bangladesh HIV Surveillance, 7th Round, Annex \u2013 III, 2007. 33 collaboration with all relevant government ministries, NGOs, the UN, and other development agencies. The policy identified priority groups for HIV intervention as sex workers, IDUs, MSM, mobile populations (emigrants, people regularly crossing borders, transport workers, factory and other mobile workers), prisoners, uniformed forces, and street children. The multi-sector response to HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh has broadened beyond the Health Ministry to include all sectors of government. Efforts have yielded a variety of strategic action plans for NASP, defined fundamental principles, and provided the framework for a national response. The national response is supported by specific guidelines on a range of issues, including testing, care, blood safety, and HIV prevention among youth, women, migrant workers, and commercial sex workers. The Ministry of Health, through the National AIDS Committee, conducts general mass HIV prevention campaigns using electronic and print media. Bangladesh is well positioned to avert an HIV epidemic through strategic, effective, and quick interventions among vulnerable groups engaging in high-risk behaviours as well as among the general population, including women and youth. Without strategic interventions, it is estimated that prevalence in the general adult population could be as high as 2 percent in 2012 and 8 percent by 2025.29 Migration and HIV/AIDS The linkage between migration and HIV for migrant workers and their families is now of growing concern in Bangladesh.

Therefore, the finding that HIV is more prevalent among returning migrants and their spouses than among the general population is a misinterpretation of current data. The Bangladesh government does not include migrant workers as a high-risk group in the national HIV surveillance program, and the national program also does not satisfactorily address significant HIV vulnerabilities due to porous borders with India and Myanmar. Although overseas migration and MSM were included in the overall HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (HAPP), overseas migrants were dropped from the program in the final stage.31 However, the HIV/AIDS Targeted Intervention (HATI) programme includes a package of targeted interventions for external migrants, and migrant workers have been identified as a priority in the Bangladesh National Strategic Plan for HIV and AIDS, 2005-2010. BMET is the only agency that offers pre-departure briefings to migrants on a regular basis incorporating general information on health, including STIs. However, BMET does not raise any awareness on HIV and AIDS issues, and no linkages between STIs and HIV are established. Private recruiting agencies and the medical centres do not conduct pre-departure briefings on HIV, and consequently migrants go abroad for employment without the necessary information to protect themselves from HIV infection. To reduce the vulnerability of migrants and their families throughout the migration cycle, a reliable evidence base is needed that better informs the national response on targeted interventions.32 Currently, integration of migration and HIV in national policies and programming is limited. Mandatory Testing The newly formalized External Migration Policy and National Policy on Health do not mention any specific rules for mandatory medical testing of migrants. Although the National Policy on HIV/AIDS and STD bans mandatory HIV testing and has directive guidelines to protect the rights of all those who undergo testing, 31 HIV/AIDS Prevention Project, UNAIDS, 2008; available at data. unaids.org/pub/report/2008/bangladesh_2008_country_progress_ report_en.pdf. 32 \u201dBangladesh HIV-AIDS Follow-on Activity,\u201d USAID-Bangladesh.

Regional and Bilateral Agreements Bangladesh has ratifi ed the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Convention on Preventing and Combating Traffi cking of Women and Children for Prostitution. Despite many high-level delegations to destination countries to negotiate bilateral and multilateral agreements, there remains a general reticence among receiving countries to sign legally binding agreements or Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) on migration. In response, the Bangladesh Government has developed a minimum set of standards for migrant workers, which includes wage scales, working and living conditions, gratuity, medical facility, and compensation. These standards are provided to the receiving country by the government and are expected to be honoured once an understanding for sending labour is reached. To date, agreements have been signed with Iraq, Libya, Qatar, and Malaysia. Unfortunately, these standards are not legally binding. The MoU with Malaysia (2003) set out the number of workers to be employed over a stipulated period, i.e., 50,000 workers over 2004 and 2005, and also addressed worker rights in terms of wage scales, working and living conditions, levels of social protection (for example, medical care and compensation), and access to instruments of social dialogue, such as freedom of association.34 National Policies and Legislation After independence, migration from Bangladesh was regulated under the 1922 Immigration Act, which was a legacy of British colonization. In 1976 formal migration of Bangladeshi workers was initiated under the direct supervision of a specialized agency, the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET), created to facilitate migration. Currently, BMET is developing resource centres to train women seeking employment abroad. 34 ILO, \u201dInternational labour migration from Bangladesh.\u201d Migration from Bangladesh involves various government ministries and agencies, private recruiting agents, and other local and international intermediaries. It is regulated by the Emigration Ordinance of 1982, which deals with the process of recruitment, licensing of recruiting agencies, emigration procedures, prevention of malpractices, minimum standards for wages and service conditions, along with provisions to penalize unlawful practices of unoffi cial recruitment channels. The ordinance also holds migrants accountable for abiding by the employment contract. Overseas recruitment was solely the responsibility of government until 1981, when licensed private recruiting agents were allowed. In 1984 the government established a limited company, the Bangladesh Overseas Employment Services Limited (BOESL), to undertake direct recruitment. By December 1984, 23 recruiting agencies had organized themselves under the Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA). Today BAIRA membership has increased to over 700 government-approved recruiting agencies. In December 2002 the government revised and clarifi ed the rules to address ambiguities and to facilitate legal enforcement of the ordinance, stating the roles and functions of concerned stakeholders (government, employment agencies, foreign employers and migrant workers). The revised rules included the Emigration Rules, the Recruiting Agent\u2019s Conduct and License Rules, and the Wage Earners\u2019 Welfare Fund Rules. Specifi cally, the post of Labour Attach\u00e9 was created in Bangladesh missions in all labour-receiving countries to register migrants and to protect their rights. In addition, the Recruiting Agent\u2019s Conduct and License Rules allows for improved monitoring and control of the activities of agents and sub-agents, and provides them with clear Source: BMET, 2009.

The policy also lacks gender sensitivity, and female migration is not addressed. Although the remittances of migrant workers are recognized as an important contributor to the economy of Bangladesh, implementation of welfare measures for migrant workers continues to be a challenge. One problem here is the absence of space for civil society to contribute to policy formulation, hindering a holistic perspective. In addition, gaps in policy exacerbate issues around illegal migration. For example, undocumented migrant workers are generally willing to accept positions refused by native workers, often exposing themselves to a range of occupational risks. Given their status, however, health services and facilities are frequently unavailable. The absence of clarity on the implementation of policies has encouraged a nexus between middlemen and government officials. When immigration procedures are manipulated, less informed migrant workers become more vulnerable to exploitation. No initiatives are currently underway to address these issues. Implementation of development policies and programs rarely trickle down to the grass-roots level where migrants can be reached. To be effective, the process for putting national policies into practice must be clear, focused, and funded, with well-documented guidelines for enforcement. National Legislation and Policies on Human Trafficking In order to address trafficking, exploitation, and violence against women and children, Bangladesh has made significant changes in their legal provisions. The Suppression of Immoral Traffic Act (1933) was enacted for the suppression of brothels and of trafficking in women and girls. Currently, all offences relating to trafficking in women and children are tried under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act (2000), as amended up to 2003. The 2000 act contains specific penalties for trafficking in women and children with a provision for the death sentence or life imprisonment; and in the 2003 amendment a child has been defined as a person under the age of 16.35 In addition, the Children Act (1974) deals with the safe custody, protection, and treatment of children. A national policy was formulated and launched in 2005 with the aim of creating mass awareness for combating trafficking in women and children. Government and non-government organizations (NGOs) are implementing programs under the aegis of this national policy and are expected to send monthly reports to the Ministry of Home Affairs.36 Key Stakeholders Those dealing with migrant workers and HIV in Bangladesh include both licensed government agencies and networks, and non-government and civil society organizations (CSOs). The following is a summary of the roles and responsibilities of these agencies and organizations. Government Agencies and Networks Ministry of Expatriates Welfare and Overseas Employment (MEWOE) Established in December 2001, this ministry is responsible for promoting, monitoring, and regulating migration. The Bangladesh foreign missions play an extremely important role in migration by exploring potential labour markets, providing consular services for Bangladeshi workers, and ensuring the protection 35 MHA, \u201dBangladesh Country Report.\u201d 36 Ibid. 37 and welfare of migrant workers. Setting up 26 expatriate welfare centres in Deputy Commissioner Offices across the country is a positive step forward. Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET) BMET, the implementing body of MEWOE, is responsible for the control and regulation of recruiting agents, collection and analysis of labour market information, and registration of job-seekers for foreign employment. It also develops and implements training programs, organizes pre-departure briefing sessions, and acts on behalf of migrant workers. Bangladesh Overseas Employment Services Limited (BOESL) BOESL was established in 1984 as a limited company to facilitate the recruitment of Bangladeshi workers abroad. The key mandate of BOESL is to ensure better employment of workers within the shortest time and with minimum migration cost. District Employment and Manpower Offices (DEMO) The district offices support overseas job seekers, with activities supervised by the head office in Dhaka. Technical Training Centres (TTC) Technical Training Centres conduct technical training of migrant workers to improve their skills and prepare them more effectively for jobs overseas. Expanding the TTC curriculum to include health considerations and HIV prevention as part of pre-departure programming would better prepare prospective migrants. Improved cooperation and integration of programming between TTC with DEMO would increase the number of skilled workers prepared to work abroad. Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) Licensed recruiting agencies formed their own association in December 1984 to promote their common interests. The association interacts with the government, foreign missions, and employers to explore job opportunities abroad and facilitate the migration of Bangladeshi workers.

National Anti-Trafficking Committee An Inter-Ministerial/Inter-Organizational committee led by the Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs has been formed. This committee is reported to hold meetings once a month and to monitor the progress of the activities undertaken by the various ministries and departments to combat trafficking in Bangladesh. GO-NGO National Co-ordination Committee for Trafficking in Women and Children This committee consists of representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, the Attorney General\u2019s Office, and various NGOs involved in monitoring and implementing programmes to combat trafficking. The Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs leads the committee, which is expected to meet at least once every month. Police Monitoring Cell A Police Monitoring Cell was established at Police Headquarters in 2004, which maintains the database of cases related to trafficking. Its functions include: collection of information and intelligence regarding human trafficking, particularly trafficking in women and children; monitoring the movement of criminals involved in human trafficking; arrest of criminals; rescue/ recovery of trafficked persons; assisting in prosecuting relevant cases; rehabilitation of trafficked persons and subsequent follow-up; and monitoring the progress of such cases. A monitoring unit has been formed in each of the 64 district headquarters, each of which sends updated statistics to central headquarters. Non-government Organisations Bangladesh Madrasa Teacher\u2019s Training Institute (BMTTI) involves inter-faith leaders in reducing the vulnerability of women and children to trafficking and violence. BMTTI is a programme aimed at raising awareness of the role that religious leaders can play in curbing trafficking and violence against women and children. BANGLADESH 38 Shikkha Shastha Unnayan Karzakram (SHISUK) promotes leadership from within to create a sustainable response for safe migration by facilitating migrant workers\u2019 access to correct information, services, and institutions for collective self-reliance and sustainable support to vulnerable groups. Rupantar People\u2019s Awareness for Counter Trafficking Interventions uses folk songs, folk drama, as well as Alternative Living Theatre (a third-generation theatre group) for awareness building on trafficking. Daywalka Foundation (Community Mobilization for Combating Human Trafficking) works to build awareness using cultural programmes, and it supports goodwill ambassadors and law enforcement agencies. DHARA, Jessore focuses its community mobilization efforts on supporting NGOs such as Counter Trafficking Women\u2019s Forum, cultural programmes, and emergency hot-lines to combat trafficking. Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program (OKUP) works to promote the health rights of Bangladeshi labour migrants through providing HIV education to the prospective and departing migrant workers through trained peer educators in 10 districts and three destination countries i.e. Lebanon, Dubai and Bahrain. BRAC, Bangladesh facilitates safe migration through its Safe Migration Facilitation Centre project using the PIM (Participation, Interaction, and Mobilization) process to spread migration rights awareness. SHISUK Jamuna Nari Unnayan Shangstha empowers spouses of migrants to participate in decision making and to respond holistically to successful migration through its Spouse Program. The Bangladesh National Woman Lawyers\u2019 Association (BNWLA) aims to unlock opportunities for community-based work by developing sustainable reintegration mechanisms. BNWLA\u2019s unique model addresses alternate care mechanisms and ensures a quality standard of care for survivors of trafficking, restoring their dignity and addressing issues of stigma and discrimination in society. Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) sponsors programming for the prevention of cross-border trafficking in women and children between Bangladesh and West Bengal through the C-BAT project, which combats human trafficking within South Asia by reinforcing the roles of community, local government, and families in prevention and recovery. Sirajgonj Community Enterprise, Ltd., aims to promote productive utilization of remittances to regenerate the local economy by facilitating the investment of remittances in community enterprises that provide livelihood options, capacity building, and economic empowerment of spouses of male migrants. Association for Community Development (ACD) supports the Promotion of Safe Migration and Anti- trafficking Intervention in the Northern Region of Bangladesh, by advocating to ensure effective community management in addressing safe migration.

In order to reduce the HIV vulnerability of current and future migrant and mobile populations it will be necessary to take action in a range of key areas, as detailed below. 1. Ratify the 1990 UN Convention on the Protection of Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families and the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Traffi cking in Persons. 2. Strengthen understanding and competencies of linkages between and among mobility, human traffi cking, and HIV through evidence-based research and analysis of statistical data, informing policies and programs accordingly in order to mainstream HIV issues into migration and human traffi cking sectors. 3. Ensure eff ective operationalization of the National Policy on Migration 2006, including the cessation of mandatory testing as required by some overseas employers or at a minimum ensure that HIV tests include counselling and are confi dential. 4. Develop mechanisms for registration of all migrant workers, including those from rural areas and cross- border points, in order to check undocumented migration and combat human traffi cking. 5. Develop an eff ective fi nancial mechanism to ensure that remittances are channelled through smooth, easy, and quick formal arrangements that benefi t returnee migrant workers, their families, and the Bangladesh economy. 6. Develop bilateral agreements with host countries for the protection of migrant workers, including protection of domestic workers, removal of mandatory HIV testing and deportation, and adequate access to health services. 7. Make provisions for pre-departure and post-arrival orientation and training programmes for migrants, their families, and other key stakeholders that integrate information on migration issues, unsafe mobility, human traffi cking, and HIV. 8. Develop eff ective reintegration programmes for returnee migrants that can no longer migrate overseas due to their positive status. 9. Monitor and regulate recruiting agencies in meeting the needs of the migrant workers they contract. 41 BANGLADESH Bibliography - Bangladesh Bangladesh Bank - Central Bank of Bangladesh (2008).

To the south, east, and west the country borders the Indian states of Assam and West Bengal, and to the north it borders China. In the west, Bhutan is separated from nearby Nepal by the Indian state of Sikkim, and in the south, it is separated from Bangladesh by West Bengal. The country\u2019s borders are porous, with thriving commerce and trade.2 Bhutan\u2019s per capita gross national income (GNI) is one of the highest in South Asia, and has consistently risen from US$730 in 2000 to US$1,900 in 2008.3 However, despite rapid economic growth and the signifi cant development eff orts of the Royal Government of Bhutan, about 25 percent of the population, mostly from rural areas, continue to live below the poverty line. Accordingly, the country\u2019s Tenth Five Year Plan (2008- 2013) has adopted poverty reduction as its overarching theme and primary goal.4 Migration Patterns Bhutan is largely a migrant-receiving country, reported in 2007 as hosting approximately 18,000 foreign workers.5 Outward migration in Bhutan is minimal, 1 National Statistical Bureau, Royal Government of Bhutan, 2005; available at www.bhutan.gov.bt/government/ aboutbhutan.php. 2 National Strategic Plan for the Prevention and Control of STIs and HIV and AIDS (NSP), Royal Government of Bhutan, 2008. 3 World Bank,\u201dBhutan - Country Overview,\u201d October 2009. 4 Gross National Happiness Commission, \u201cTenth Five Year Plan,\u201d Volume 1: Main Document, 2008-2013, Royal Government of Bhutan. 5 Labour Market Information Bulletin, Issue #2, Department of Employment, Ministry of Labour & Human Resources, 2007 45 and limited data is available on documented migrants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5743c82-2d46-43d3-8840-3ac10aa05fe9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5743c82-2d46-43d3-8840-3ac10aa05fe9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b53232030ee0d288446081c2d43bc203e20e78d636d4d742044b2ce189daa42e"}, "2": {"node_id": "14e2cfbe-668e-4b7b-8067-e6fc01cb12f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e152e21e77597a0ae798020256d66db5a6609dde6f835fb74c80d81766e09284"}}, "hash": "77a67fc81e9b82260063b4f01d5ecaf40daef06ea462998976b33f7c93d88e53", "text": "Bhutanese leaving the country in search of work abroad are usually undocumented, but the number is still very small. The Labour Market Information Division under the Department of Employment has sole responsibility for conducting surveys and research on labour.

The Ministry of Labour and Human Resources (MoLHR) reported a national labour force of 249,030 individuals (158,073 male and 90,957 female) in 2005, of which 108,617 worked in the agricultural sector, with the next largest number working in the construction sector.6 Many who are classifi ed as \u201cemployed\u201d do not necessarily have a year-round job, but work seasonally, with little or no remuneration.

Labour force participation in rural areas is 63.5 percent, with the highest rate (82.8 percent) in the 35- 39 age group. There is active internal mobility, with the government reporting that, as of 2005, more than a sixth of the population had moved from rural villages to urban centres since birth.7 Approximately 20,000 people working as drivers and in private and public transport services have signifi cantly added to this rural- to-urban group.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e83a8b67-ff8a-4489-9f29-ea60bc5cc8f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e83a8b67-ff8a-4489-9f29-ea60bc5cc8f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c36ff6c16358e5e2b1e0170d6f382f56b12192d68e35feb5491e1d57716267e"}, "3": {"node_id": "36c1ee10-1523-4795-afc9-6eca4fee99b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec83c6193994cd599bb66b130b1f2cbcdf59f5eac8f7dd5b495b64ebf61e6225"}}, "hash": "0a16f2a3c06ed44b48a06098ad9536560709757ab4d994570e1bad5dea17ff87", "text": "With a booming construction industry adding nearly 30,000 skilled and unskilled workers every year, Bhutan is heavily dependent on a workforce imported largely from neighbouring India and Nepal.8 Approximately 3,000 local workers or expatriates are recruited to work as temporary daily labourers in the construction and production sectors.

Gender and Migration In Bhutan, overall the participation rate of men in the labour force is higher (74.4 percent) than that of women (60.6 percent). Although the participation of women in the labour force has increased over the past fi ve years, household responsibilities, care of children, and work on the farm, together with their relative lack of education, have hampered women from accessing employment opportunities outside the home.9 Table 2: Gender Profi le of Mobile Populations 2007 Labour and Unemployment Rates Male Female Labour Force Participation Rate - Overall 74.4% 60.6% Labour Force Mobility \u2013 Rural to Urban 60.0% 40.0% Labour Force Participation Rate - Urban Areas 76.8% 41.5% Urban Unemployment Rate 3.6% 7.4% Source: Bhutan Living Standard Survey 2007 Analysis of mobility data reveals that 60 percent of internally mobile populations are men.

BHUTAN 46 out of school, further limiting their future employment opportunities.10 Urbanization has led to increased financial pressures and unemployment, which has affected women more than men. According to census reports the urban unemployment rate is much higher for women (7.6 percent) than for men (3.6 percent).11 The linkages between migration and unemployment, poverty, and financial burdens are well established, and often lead to the increased labour migration of women \u2013 most often undocumented and unsafe. Reports on the status of women and children in Bhutan, particularly in rural areas, indicate that some women are abandoned by husbands who set off to find work elsewhere and never return.12 Lack of data makes it difficult to analyse the gender profile of migrants from Bhutan. An in-depth study focusing on the various factors and linkages associated with migration, including an assessment of the impact of male migration on the women and families left behind, would be useful in understanding the role of gender in migration patterns and trends. Human Trafficking Although official data regarding trafficking in women and young girls within or outside Bhutan is not available, there have been anecdotal reports of Bhutanese women and children in the sex market outside Bhutan, and fairly frequent reports of missing persons.13 Due to socio-economic progress and rapid modernization, the economic disparities between groups, regions, and sexes is widening, leading to increasing financial pressure on women and girls. As a result, many young girls from rural areas move to affluent urban areas in search of better opportunities and, once there, suffer from various forms of exploitation and human rights violations, including domestic violence, sexual exploitation, and forced sex work.14 Evidence of increasing commercial sex work in towns such as Phuentsholing and Thimpu has been reported. 10 National Commission for Women and Children, Royal Government of Bhutan, May 2007; National Plan of Action for Gender, 2008-2013, Gross National Happiness Commission, National Commission of Women and Children, Royal Government of Bhutan. 11 National Plan of Action for Gender, 2008-2013. 12 UNICEF,\u201dSituation Analysis of Children and Women in Bhutan,\u201d 2008. 13 National Plan of Action for Gender. 14 Ibid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36c1ee10-1523-4795-afc9-6eca4fee99b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "36c1ee10-1523-4795-afc9-6eca4fee99b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c36ff6c16358e5e2b1e0170d6f382f56b12192d68e35feb5491e1d57716267e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e83a8b67-ff8a-4489-9f29-ea60bc5cc8f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a16f2a3c06ed44b48a06098ad9536560709757ab4d994570e1bad5dea17ff87"}}, "hash": "ec83c6193994cd599bb66b130b1f2cbcdf59f5eac8f7dd5b495b64ebf61e6225", "text": "13 National Plan of Action for Gender. 14 Ibid.

The Bhutan Penal Code of 2004 recognizes human trafficking as a fourth-degree felony and child trafficking as a third-degree felony.16 The Constitution includes provisions to eliminate all forms of discrimination and exploitation toward women, including trafficking, prostitution, abuse, violence, harassment, and intimidation at work, in private, and in public spheres.17 Similar protection is provided for children. The NCWC organized its first National Consultation on Human Trafficking and HIV/AIDS and Promoting Cross- Border Cooperation in October 2009. The consultation, which was held in collaboration with other national partners, including the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs (MoHCA), Ministry of Labor and Human Resources (MoLHR), the Royal Court of Justice, and the Royal Bhutan Police, emphasized the need for a multisectoral approach to address the issue of trafficking in women and children and its nexus with HIV. The understanding on human trafficking in Bhutan points toward existing vulnerability factors, such as unemployment, poverty, and gender-based violence, and recognizes the linkages between human trafficking, unsafe mobility, and undocumented migration.

Bhutan\u2019s entry into Interpol has also opened up a platform to improve cooperation in the area of trans-border human trafficking with neighbouring countries.18 Source, Transit, and Destination Bhutan has constructed several major hydropower plants and expanded road networks, boosting migration flows into the country. The country also receives foreign workers under different categories for various donor-funded projects. The majority of migrant workers in Bhutan are from India and Nepal, although no official records are kept on incoming migrants who work on development projects. There is evidence of an increasing number of Bhutanese leaving the country to work abroad. Countries of destination include the United States, Australia, India, and the Gulf States. Types of work range from the unskilled to the professional, and include domestic help, baby sitters, construction, security guards, call centres, airline pilots and flight attendants, engineers, and doctors. Remittances There are no official records on the amount of remittances received by Bhutan from migrant workers as most funds are sent through informal channels. Formal financial channels include money transfer service companies, such as Western Union, which is operated by Bhutan Post, or direct transfer through either of the two banks in the country, the Bank of Bhutan or the Bhutan National Bank.

However, by taking appropriate action, Bhutan has the opportunity to avert a full-scale epidemic. National Response to HIV/AIDS The Royal Decree on HIV and AIDS issued in May 2004 serves as the guiding principle in the fight against the virus in Bhutan. The Royal Decree calls for all members of the society to help prevent HIV and AIDS and to provide care and compassion to those infected. The Royal Government has always maintained a policy of providing Health for All. In line with the Alma Ata Declaration, Bhutan is committed to establishing a relevant and cost-effective health-care delivery system based on the primary healthcare approach. This has been informally taken to apply to all residents of Bhutan, including non- nationals. Basic primary health care is provided free to everyone who accesses the health-care system. The National HIV/AIDS Commission (NHAC), a multisectoral body functioning at the highest level and chaired by the Minister of Health, is the official coordinating body responsible for the nation\u2019s response to HIV. The objective of NHAC is to ensure a well coordinated, effective, and efficient response from the Ministry of Health through its National HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention and Control Programme, in collaboration with other ministries, organizations, and stakeholders. The NHAC prevention programmes focus on the segments of society most vulnerable to HIV, including youth, while ensuring that key prevention messages and interventions reach the broader population and take into consideration the social, cultural, and economic factors affecting individuals, families, societies, and the nation as a whole. These initiatives bring together the cumulative effort of various stakeholders beyond the Ministry of Health. NHAC recognizes the need to increase prevention activities. However, lack of baseline information in relation to location, actual numbers at risk, and their behavioural practices have resulted in limited effective interventions among the most vulnerable populations. While the NSP 2008 provides the overarching framework for HIV programming, there are a range of other HIV, AIDS, and STI policies and guidelines that guide implementation of programmes and services in Bhutan. These include: \u2022\ufffd Technical Strategy for Prevention and Control of STIs; \u2022\ufffd Manual for the Dzongkhag Multisector Task Force for HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention and Control; \u2022\ufffd Behaviour Change Communication Strategy; \u2022\ufffd National HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention and Control Project: Operational Manual; and, \u2022\ufffd Condom Social Marketing Plan. The Tenth Five Year Plan, 2008-2013, is based on achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the long-term goals articulated in the Vision 2020 document \u2013 an ambitious poverty-alleviation plan \u2013 that includes Gross National Happiness. HIV and AIDS have been identified as one of the important cross-cutting development themes. The National Strategic Plan for the Prevention and Control of STIs and HIV and AIDS, 2008 was developed in collaboration with government and non-government agencies and development partners, and was overseen by the NHAC. The National HIV/ AIDS and STI Prevention and Control Programme led the implementation process. NHAC, NACP, Dzongkhag (district level) multisectoral taskforces, and Gewog (subdistrict level) multisectoral taskforces were established as coordinating bodies. The NSP builds on past achievements, learns from experience, identifies gaps, and focuses on scaling-up existing cost-effective prevention interventions to ensure appropriate reach. The current focus of the NSP is on strengthening institutions and building the capacity of service providers; improving the quality of care, support, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and AIDS; providing voluntary counselling and testing (VCT); improving strategic information through research and surveillance; and effectively monitoring and evaluating progress. In addition to the focus on HIV prevention, the NSP identifies the importance of providing for the health care needs of people living with HIV and AIDS; and the government is committed to providing antiretroviral treatment.

Approximately 2,000 STI cases are reported annually in Bhutan, the most prevalent being syphilis and gonorrhoea. Given the weaknesses in national reporting systems, it can realistically be assumed that STI cases are grossly under-reported. Given the stigma attached to STI infection, people resort to self-treatment or cross the border to Indian Military Training Team hospitals and bordering towns in India to seek treatment. The country\u2019s Basic Health Units (BHUs) and Outreach Clinics (ORCs) provide HIV information and education, syndromic treatment of STIs, counselling, and referral for HIV testing. In 2008, with support from the Global Fund, voluntary counselling and testing competencies in strategically selected BHUs were initiated. At the district hospital level, screening for syphilis, HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment (ART), monitoring, counselling, and follow-up activities are conducted. While the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital (JDWNRH) and the regional hospitals are responsible for the initiation of ART, follow-up actions are carried out at the district level. Treatment for STIs is available free of charge from every health care setting, from district hospitals to BHUs. Bhutan has 171 national medical doctors (doctor: population ratio of 2.6:10,000), 567 nursing staff, and about 1,250 other health workers. Today, 90 percent of the population has access to basic health-care services, delivered through a network of 30 hospitals, 178 BHUs, and 519 ORCs. Health-care costs have increased and disease dynamics have changed with the advent of HIV and increases in non-communicable diseases.28 Bhutan plans to establish a relevant and cost-effective health-care delivery system to deliver health-care services to all people who reside in the country. The Public Health Division has launched a three- year program to encourage the use of condoms and voluntary testing.29 HIV testing is voluntary and free in Bhutan.

Strict confidentiality is maintained during the testing process. The rapid test for HIV detection is conducted in all district hospitals, and all positive cases are referred to designated hospitals. With decentralization of STI, HIV, and AIDS services to the districts, training and posting of more counsellors are needed in all 20 district hospitals. Due to an increased number of infections diagnosed among housewives, in 2005 the NHAC mandated spouse/partner testing and reporting of results. The health-care system provides treatment, care, and support for people living with HIV (PLHIV). In an effort to combat stigma and discrimination, the identity of infected persons is kept in strict confidence. ART based on results of the CD4 count has been available for all infected pregnant mothers since 2001 and for all PLHIV since 2004. It is unclear whether migrant workers will be covered under this policy, as no migrant workers are currently on ART. The NSP reports that facilities for CD4 count analysis are available at the JDWNRH in Thimphu and the Mongar Regional Referral Hospital in the East. The total number of individuals on ART by November 2008 was 28, with 5 deaths reported after ART commenced. Treatment of Opportunistic Infections and counselling services are continuously provided. A Health Information and Service Centre, located in Phuentsholing, provides free voluntary counselling services and rapid HIV tests for all. Clients include sex workers, students, businessmen, and migrant workers. A similar centre is located in Thimphu. These centres are managed by the National Referral Hospital. Implementation of primary health care with regard to HIV depends on high levels of awareness and behavioural change support systems. Intersectoral collaboration is essential to meeting the demands of emerging health problems such as HIV/AIDS.

The NSP prioritizes programs on at-risk populations, those who are already infected, and those most vulnerable to infection. Mobile and migrant populations are among the most vulnerable. Given the absence of information on migrant workers from Bhutan, little has been done to inform programming for this high vulnerable group. Migrants to Bhutan are subject to the restrictions of the Immigration Act. In Section 8, Inadmissibility and Refusal of Entry, a foreigner can be refused entry to Bhutan on medical grounds. Health based refusal of entry is justified in the interest of public welfare and national security. Article 63 of the Act states: A foreigner shall be inadmissible into the Kingdom on health grounds if his health condition as stated by the Sub-articles (a) is likely to be a danger to public health or safety; or (b) might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health or social services. Migrant workers are required to undergo a medical check-up at the point of entry into Bhutan. They are checked for tuberculosis (TB) and other infectious diseases, but HIV tests are not required. Access to Health Services and HIV Prevention Access to basic health care services in general are provided free of cost to all. Migrant workers in Bhutan 31 UNICEF, \u201dSituation Analysis of Children and Women in Bhutan,\u201d2006. 32 World Bank, HIV/AIDS in Bhutan, 2006 have access to free voluntary counselling and testing. Non-nationals are not entitled to free ART, although they are able to access it at cost.33 The National Plan of Action for Gender criminalizes prostitution, which hampers commercial sex workers (CSW) in accessing health services, especially HIV prevention. CSWs avoid police on both sides of the border (Phuentsholing, Bhutan-Jaigaon, West Bengal, India) and are reluctant to visit hospitals to seek treatment, collect condoms, or use testing services. Mandatory Testing Although migrant workers are required to undergo a medical check-up and are tested for TB and malaria, mandatory testing for HIV is not practiced in Bhutan except in terms of blood-donor screening. However, students applying to study abroad or individuals going to other countries for short-term training are sometimes required to undergo testing by their respective academic institutions. Policies, Legislation, and International Conventions International Conventions Bhutan has ratified several international human rights conventions, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and Convention on the Rights of the Child. In addition, articles of CEDAW have been incorporated to a large extent into national laws. Bhutan is a signatory to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), but it has yet to ratify it. Bhutan has not yet ratified the 1990 UN Convention on the Protection of Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families and the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons. Bhutan is not currently a member of the International Labour Organization (ILO), but the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources is exploring the possibility of membership. The Labour and Employment Act of Bhutan 2007 allows local workers to form their own associations, facilitating protection of labour rights. 33 Sub Article (f) of the Immigration Act. BHUTAN 52 Regional and Bilateral Agreements Bhutan ratified the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation convention on the Prevention and Combating of Trafficking of Women and Children for Prostitution in January 2002, and the instrument of ratification was deposited in September 2003. However, Bhutan has not yet engaged in bilateral agreements on labour migration. National Policies and Legislation As a host country, Bhutan has strict policies on immigration. In 2007 the National Assembly of Bhutan passed the Immigration Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan. The preamble states that the Act would ensure that the Kingdom remains free from illegal immigrants and that it would retain control over the immigration of foreigners for the security and prosperity of the nation.

Even so, all organizations are required to have internal service rules outlining salary range, benefits, and entitlements. The Labour and Employment Act of Bhutan 2007 also addresses issues specific to certain sectors. Key Stakeholders The primary stakeholders in addressing migration and HIV are the Royal Government of Bhutan and the United Nations Development Programme in Bhutan. During the implementation of the National Strategic Plan, ministries, agencies and organizations were identified as valuable contributors to the national response to HIV/AIDS. The NSP includes suggested interventions for such key government ministries as the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources, Royal Civil Service Commission, Ministry of Works and Human Settlements, and Ministry of Information and Communications, and for such autonomous agencies as the Gross National Happiness Commission, National Commission of Women and Children, the National Statistical Bureau, civil society organizations, and the private sector. Each ministry appoints a focal person to coordinate the HIV/AIDS efforts according to the roles and responsibilities outlined in the NSP. There are no NGOs working specifically on issues of mobility and HIV/AIDS in Bhutan. The United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) is supporting the NCWC in exploring the nexus between human trafficking and HIV, co-sponsoring the National Consultation on Human Trafficking and HIV and Promoting Cross Border Cooperation. The issue of human trafficking and violence against women is 35 Ministry of Labour and Human Resources, Handbook on the Recruitment of Foreign Workers in Bhutan, 2005. 36 Immigration Act of the Kingdom of Bhutan, 2007, Chapter 10, Article 100. 53 gaining attention due to the eff orts of the NCWC and members of the local NGO community, such as Respect, Educate, Nurture and Empower Women (RENEW), who are exploring the linkages between gender-based violence and HIV. Recommendations The following recommendations are made within the context of the foregoing analysis of Bhutan\u2019s migration patterns and policies and HIV situation. In order to reduce the HIV vulnerability of current and future migrant and mobile populations, it will be necessary to take action in a range of key areas, as detailed below. 1. Ratify the 1990 UN Convention on the Protection of Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families and the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Traffi cking in Persons. 2. Develop a mechanism to register/document the Bhutanese migrants, both inter- and intra-country, and to address the problem of undocumented migrants. Undocumented migrants include Bhutanese seeking employment outside the country and foreigners entering Bhutan without work permits or other documentation, such as domestic workers from the neighbouring states of India. 3. Design and implement systems for the collection, analysis, and broad dissemination of gender- disaggregated data on vulnerable populations and the linkages between unsafe mobility, human traffi cking, HIV, and violence against women. 4. Enhance understanding of HIV issues and build capacity of all stakeholders in government ministries and departments, police, judiciary, media, health-care providers, multisector task forces, civil society, NGOs, and the private sector in addressing HIV, mobility, human traffi cking, and their linkages. 5. Develop a better surveillance system to identify PLHIV in the country, and take action to reduce the stigma and discrimination associated with STIs, HIV, and AIDS. 6.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88b123c4-2cfe-426e-8531-25e4885ef28f": {"__data__": {"id_": "88b123c4-2cfe-426e-8531-25e4885ef28f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a95614e2db73b83215416b1a49c600d7079831d2eab5ab6279adf1fba81df531"}, "2": {"node_id": "a21aef70-8ba4-4d72-a20e-5800fe712807", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "527528037a709d1d1350adabf4e5e3825c4cbe2cd951a6df0eeaa4215001423f"}}, "hash": "7bef5d0338704ed9b3cc4479fabe2aec3e441119d93a4b2f6069fe46fef72775", "text": "6.

It is also the world\u2019s largest democracy. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the west, and the Bay of Bengal on the east, India has a coastline of 7,517 kilometres. India also shares borders with Bangladesh, China, Nepal, and Pakistan, Myanmar and Bhutan. As a growing economy, India\u2019s gross domestic product is over US$1 trillion, with an average annual growth rate of 9 percent. Despite such pressing problems as signifi cant overpopulation and extensive poverty, rapid economic development is fuelling the country\u2019s rise on the world stage. India\u2019s diverse economy includes traditional village farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts and textiles, and a wide range of modern industries and services, particularly in the technology sector.

Despite these varied data sources, there remains a lack of reliable offi cial data on migration. Data available from the PGE is largely based on the number of emigration clearance documents, which are required by low- skilled migrants with limited education. However, there is limited coordination with the recruiting agencies handling the processing of these documents. The NSSO conducts surveys on internal mobility, and the Census information includes all mobile populations, internal and external. The NSSO uses the concept of native place and usual place of residence as criteria for defi ning a migrant worker, and ignores the movement of labour from India to other countries. The Census defi nes a migrant as a person whose last residence is diff erent from the place where he or she is enumerated.5 Table 1: Reasons for Migration 2001 Reason for Migration Inter-state Migrants International Migrants Work employment 5,360,016 173,282 Business 310,515 10,239 Education 442,206 23,405 Marriage 3,754,844 130,051 Moved after birth 639,570 7,099 Moved with household 4,899,938 238,515 Other 1,419,790 158,276 Total Migrants 16,826,879 740,867 Source: Population Census 2001.

The number increased substantially according to the Census in 2001, when about 307 million Indians had moved from their place of birth and about 315 million were enumerated at a place outside their place of birth. Of these, 221 million were female, with the majority assumed to have moved due to marriage.6 The vast majority of migrants who go from India to the Middle East, primarily the Gulf States, are semi- skilled and unskilled workers, and most are temporary migrants who return to India after expiry of their 5 A return migrant is identifi ed as a person who has returned to his or her place of origin. 6 Ministry of Overseas Indian Aff air (MOIA), Annual Report 2008- 2009.

No separate data is collected from the Indian missions on skilled and unskilled workers. However, the missions do provide rough estimates on the percentages of unskilled and semi-skilled workers in the Gulf. In Saudi Arabia, 80 percent of total Indian workers are low-skilled labourers; for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) it is 65 percent; and in Qatar it is 65 to 70 percent. An estimated 800,000 to one million Indian workers in the UAE are working mostly in the construction industry. In Kuwait, 48 percent of Indian migrants work in the unorganized sector; in Saudi Arabia it is 43 percent. The number of unskilled Indian migrants flowing to the Gulf States doubled between 2004 and 2008, but preliminary evidence suggests that fewer low-skilled workers are currently leaving for work abroad.

Migrant workers, primarily those with ECNR passports and those who are undocumented, are often exploited by recruitment agencies and subject to discriminatory procedural requirements by receiving countries. In many Middle Eastern countries, employment of foreigners requires sponsorship by a citizen of that country. Citizens sell sponsorships to agents, who then charge migrants very high fees for a work permit. In addition, many Indian migrant workers are sent abroad by agents using either a tourist visa or social visit visa and become undocumented workers when these visas expire. Once undocumented, a worker is even more vulnerable to extortion by contractors, employers, and agents who threaten with arrest and deportation if the wages and working conditions offered are not accepted. 61 When an undocumented migrant is reported, criminal charges and detention in the host country prisons are immediate, pending deportation to countries of origin. There were 6,277 Indian prisoners in foreign jails as of March 7, 2007, as stated by Indian missions abroad, of which 57.6 percent were imprisoned in the Arab States, Singapore, and Malaysia. Occupational Profile of Migrants Since the 1950s overseas labour migration from India has consisted of two distinct groups. The first is composed of persons with technical skills or professional expertise who have principally migrated to industrialized countries in the West, a process that started in the early 1950s and accelerated in the 1990s.8 By 2000 an estimated 1.25 million Indians, most of them skilled, had emigrated to the industrialized West. Of these, a large number of well-educated Indian migrants categorized as professionals (including engineers, information technology specialists, and doctors) are currently working in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Of the 409, 600 skilled foreign- worker admissions to the United States in 2008 under the high-tech H-1B visa,9 38 percent were from India. Indian students accounted for 15 percent of the 623,805 international students enrolled in US universities in 2007-2008.10 Indians also accounted for more than 40 percent of the estimated 22,000 entries under the UK Highly Skilled Migrant Program.11 Highly skilled migration has traditionally been through education. Indian students go abroad for higher studies and remain in the host country after graduation, taking up employment.12 In some cases, the increased flow of Indians was triggered by attempts of European governments\u2019 to tap India\u2019s highly skilled labour force.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4772b04-615c-4704-aa1b-ecf5be3b747e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4772b04-615c-4704-aa1b-ecf5be3b747e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "362296949f7eb9c507e49936b684bfc8d61a50742c0226d81d13e0264c82e28c"}, "2": {"node_id": "cbdaab63-ccd8-4b74-8518-9c68b7de4afd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0289046b477fe5f918473b9e75bab5c5a2e382a35adaead6f0fd7bd99fdb897b"}}, "hash": "28851e0837b8e662a4ed2bb8e82bb580664ad4187ba94f764bebed449e48085d", "text": "For example, Germany\u2019s temporary migration 8 R.

The second, and far larger, group of Indian migrants is comprised primarily of unskilled or low-skilled workers whose principal destination is the oil-rich Gulf region. It is estimated that by 2000 the Gulf Region countries had become home to more than three million Indian migrant labourers.13 The Indian community in Italy consists largely of formerly illegal migrants, now being regularized. Most of them are from Punjab and tend to work on dairy farms and in agriculture.14 The High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora, set up by the Ministry of External Affairs in 2001, provides information on Indians living abroad in various countries, including their occupational profile.15 Gender and Migration The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) reports that, while men are mobile for employment, women are mobile for marriage. However, given the limited gender disaggregated data on both migration and mobility, it is difficult to assess the trends and patterns of female migrants from India. It is generally accepted that female migration is grossly understated, with a reported 24,313 female migrants out of 809,000 migrants going abroad for employment in 2008. In recent years a steep rise in female migration has been reported in Kerala, the largest sending states in India. Data on migration from Kerala shows a steady increase of women migrants between 1999 and 2004, from 9 percent to 17 percent. During the same period an increase of 150 percent in the number of female migrants was reported, as compared to a 23 percent increase in the number of male migrants. This growth in numbers is also reflected in women who obtain emigration clearances and migrate as domestic workers.16 This could be attributed to a rise in demand in the Gulf States for domestic workers, with women 13 Irudaya, et al., \u201cBeyond the Existing Structures.\u201d. 14 Naujoks, \u00abEmigration, Immigration, and Diaspora Relations in India,\u201d 2009. 15 Table compiled from the Report of the High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora, Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, December 2001; available at moia.gov.in/pdf/Executive_ Summary.pdf. 16 \u201dBackground Report for National Policy on International Migration.\u201d INDIA 62 employed as housemaids, cleaners, baby sitters, and home nurses. Gender disaggregated estimates from Indian missions in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries are provided in Table 4. Of all migrant workers, unskilled workers \u2013 particularly domestic workers \u2013 are the most vulnerable. To address the risk of exploitation of these migrant workers, the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA) has mandated that all women migrants on ECR passports to ECR countries must be at least 30 years of age, regardless of the type of work or category of employment; employers recruiting the worker directly should deposit a security deposit of $2,500; and embassy attestation is mandatory regarding all women and unskilled category workers to all ECR countries.

Most studies and reports on trafficking in India focus on commercial sexual exploitation, but internal forced labour may constitute India\u2019s largest trafficking problem. Men, women, and children are held in debt bondage and face forced labour working in brick kilns, rice mills, agriculture, and embroidery factories; women and girls are trafficked within the country for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced marriage; children are subjected to forced labour as factory workers, domestic servants, beggars, and agriculture workers, and have been used as armed combatants by some terrorist and insurgent groups.17 India serves as a major destination country for women trafficked in South Asia and is a transit country for women trafficked to the Middle East, with an increase in sex trafficking to smaller cities in recent years.18 Specifically, India is a destination for women and girls from Nepal and Bangladesh for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation. Over 30,000 women and girls are estimated to have been trafficked to India from Bangladesh alone between 1990 and 2000.19 The Coalition against Trafficking in Women (CATW) estimates that 200,000 to 250,000 Nepalese girls are believed to be working in the sex industry in India, with 5,000 to 7,000 Nepalese women and girls, between the ages of 10 and 20, trafficked into the red light districts in Indian cities each year.20 According to Human Rights Watch, the average age of girls trafficked from Nepal to India was 14-16 years in the 1980s and dropped to 10- 14 years in 1994. The Ministry of Women and Child Development reports that large numbers of children are trafficked within the country for marriage; sexual exploitation; adoption; work in entertainment and sports venues, 17 World Bank, The World Factbook 2009, India; UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, \u201cHuman Trafficking and HIV: Exploring vulnerabilities and responses in South Asia,\u201d 2007. 18 US State Department, \u201dTrafficking in Persons Report,\u201d 2009; available at www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/ tiprpt/2009. 19 F.

Ethnic conflict in many parts of the North East, displacement coupled with poverty, and porous borders with neighbouring countries all contribute to human trafficking, and to the potential for hastening the spread of HIV.22 The widely prevalent patriarchal culture creates unequal gender relations, leaving women and girls with little choice or decision-making power regarding education, occupation, and marriage. It also means that they have no power to negotiate safer sex practices, which increases their risk of HIV infection. As in many societies, ignorance leads prospective clients of sex workers to believe that young girls are virginal, less sexually experienced, and, hence, disease-free and safe.23 Source, Transit, and Destination Source Most Indian migrants are from the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Punjab, with Kerala accounting for the largest share of migrants abroad.

The characteristics of this diversifi ed group vary according to what the MOIA calls \u201cold Diaspora\u201d countries and \u201cnew Diaspora\u201d countries. The prominent countries that fi gure in the old Indian Diaspora are Malaysia, Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago, Fiji, Guyana, and Suriname. The prominent countries in the new Indian Diaspora are developed countries, specifi cally the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, which are attracting skilled and highly- skilled labour migrants. Lower-skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour migrants, many from Kerala, go to Gulf countries.25 24 For details on State fi gures on workers granted emigration clearance/ECNR endorsement during the years 2004-2008, see additional information at the end of this report. 25 Ministry of Overseas Indian Aff airs, Country Specifi c Indian Diaspora, 2009; available at moia.gov.in/accessories.aspx?aid=11 According to the US Department of Homeland Security, the infl ux of Indian immigrants more than tripled from 27,000 in 1986 to 85,000 in 2005, with India\u2019s share of total immigration fl ows to the United States rising from 4.4 to 7.4 percent. Indian citizens accounted for 5.7 percent of all persons obtaining lawful US permanent resident status in 2008.26 The major outfl ow of migrant workers from India in the last few years has been to the Gulf countries, where an estimated four million Indian migrant workers, the largest group of migrants in the Gulf, are employed. The UAE is the main destination for Indian workers, followed by Saudi Arabia. Of the 849,000 workers emigrating in 2008, more than 90 percent are in the Gulf (350,000 to UAE; 228,000 to Saudi Arabia; 83,000 to Qatar) and South-East Asia.27 Outside the Gulf region, the intake of Indian manpower by Malaysia showed signifi cant and consistent increases until 2005, with considerable decline noted since 2006. Currently, there are approximately 150,000 Indian workers in Malaysia. During 2007, about 30,916 workers migrated to Malaysia on ECNR passports after obtaining clearance from the Protector General of Emigrants, although the number of migrant workers decreased to 21,123 in 2008.

High population density on both sides of the long porous borders between India and its neighbours, endemic poverty, and natural disasters are major contributing factors for illegal migration to India.

For many Bangladeshis living near the Assamese border (North East India), Guwahati is the largest day-labour market. Labourers congregate daily at railway and bus stations to find work on Indian construction sites or farms.32 In 2003, 20,768 foreigners were deported, as compared to 6,394 in 2002, and more than 90 percent (18,801) were Bangladeshi nationals.

The most striking impact of remittances on an individual state is the case of Kerala, where remittances made up 21 percent of state income in the 1990s.

According to MOIA and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the increase in annual remittances from 2005 35 Remittances from foreign workers, mainly from India and Pakistan, account for nearly 9 percent of the GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council member nations each year. The largest transfers originate from Saudi Arabia, which account for 63 percent of all remittances, followed by the United Arab Emirates at 15 percent.

Again in 2008, India maintained its position as the leading remittance- receiving country in the world.36 About 40 percent of the US$43.5 billion in remittances received by India in 2008 is contributed by the increasing number of unskilled and semi-skilled Indian workers employed in the Gulf States and Malaysia. The RBI reported that 44 percent of the remittance fl ows to India came from North America, followed by 24 percent from Gulf Countries, and 13 percent from Europe (see Figure 3).37 HIV/AIDS Situation The fi rst case of HIV was diagnosed in Chennai, India, in 1986 and the number of cases has grown steadily since, with an estimated 2.31 million (1.8-2.9 million) HIV-positive persons in 2007, in the average adult (15- 49) age group. HIV prevalence of 0.34 percent (0.25-0.43 percent) was reported by the National AIDS Organization (NACO), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, in its 2008-2009 annual report.38 Although earlier estimates placed the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) at 36 Reserve Bank of India, \u201cBalance of Payment Statistics,\u201d RBI Bulletin 2008. 37 Reserve Bank of India, \u201cInvisibles in India\u2019s Balance of Payments,\u201d RBI Bulletin, November 2006. 38 National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), Annual Report, 2008- 2009 ; available at: www.nacoonline.org/upload/Publication/Annual_ Report_NACO_2008-09.pdf 5 million, this was revised by NACO to an estimated 2.5 million in July 200739 and supported by UNAIDS, WHO, and UNICEF in their revised prevalence estimates for India.40 According to the HIV Sentinel Surveillance 2007, conducted at 1,134 sentinel sites \u2013 646 sites among general populations and 488 sites among high-risk populations (female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users (IDU), migrants, and truckers) \u2013 the overall HIV prevalence among diff erent population groups in 2007 continues to portray a concentrated epidemic among high-risk groups: IDU (7.2 percent); MSM (7.4 percent); FSW (5.1 percent); migrants (3.61 percent); truckers (2.51 percent); sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinic attendees (3.61 percent); and a low prevalence among anti-natal care clinic attendees (0.48 percent).41 The major mode of infection continues to be heterosexual transmission, followed by injecting drug use in some states. The epidemic is greater in urban areas than rural areas; the prevalence rate is higher among males than females and decreases as education level increases; prevalence among women is highest among spouses of men working in the transport industry.42 Of the estimated number of PLHIV, 39 percent are females and 3.5 percent are children. Expanded surveillance among MSM has revealed a concentrated epidemic (more than 5 percent HIV prevalence) in Karnataka (17.6 percent), Andhra Pradesh (17 percent), Manipur (16.4 percent), Maharashtra (11.8 percent), Delhi (11.7 percent), Gujarat (8.4 percent), Goa (7.9 percent), Orissa (7.4 percent), Tamil Nadu (6.6 percent), and West Bengal (5.6 percent).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f60ac464-4b18-455f-b8eb-f5451706d504": {"__data__": {"id_": "f60ac464-4b18-455f-b8eb-f5451706d504", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0acebd2da7a448bb8f409a11d2f7f9780385db6c54bd62fdcfd7541d565514f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "91156929-1d26-439b-a528-53fe75324026", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "293718a9c28ecf8178387158859f0711228b3e9968883a3f94abdbd24fb36e1f"}}, "hash": "9970f4d1f4e9c0725e400d56c4effa944d080260857cd734ab378267e93a9bff", "text": "Trends among IDUs are on a decline in Manipur (17.9 percent), Nagaland, and Chennai, while there is a steady rise in Meghalaya, Mizoram (7.5 percent), West Bengal (7.8 39 The revision was based on an expanded surveillance system and a revised and enhanced methodology, which also included the results of a National Family Health Survey III, conducted in 2005- 2006. 40 UNDP, Law, Ethics, and HIV/AIDS in South Asia : A study of the legal and social environment of the epidemic in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, 2004; available at www.hivpolicy.org/Library/ HPP000261.pdf., p.15. 41 NACO, \u201cHIV Sentinel Surveillance and HIV Estimation in India 2007: A Technical Brief,\u201d October 2008; available at nacoonline.org/ upload/Publication/M&E%20Surveillance,%20Research/HIV%20 Sentinel%20Surveillance%20and%20HIV%20Estimation%20 2007_A%20Technical%20Brief.pdf. 42 NACO, Annual Report, 2008-2009.

Data on the number of people living with AIDS and AIDS deaths have not been provided by NACO for some time. The most recent estimates at the end of 2005 suggested that 116,905 people were living with AIDS, about a third were 30-years old or younger, and 34,177 were women.43 These fi gures under-represent the actual number of people living with AIDS in the country, since many cases of AIDS and AIDS deaths go unreported due to stigma and discrimination and the lack of access to health services. National Responses to HIV/AIDS The National AIDS Control Organization is the body that coordinates and directs HIV programming in India. The National AIDS Control Programme \u2013 Phase III (2007- 2012) (NACP III) was launched in June 2007 with the overall goal to halt and reverse the epidemic in India over the next fi ve years. According to the framework proposed by NACP III, prevention strategies will take a three-pronged approach: 1. Core High Risk Groups (HRGs): There are four divisions in HRGs: female sex workers; high-risk men who have sex with men; trans-genders (TGs); 43 WHO, \u201dIndia: Summary country profi le for HIV/AIDS treatment scale-up,\u201d December 2005. and injecting drug users. Through the targeted interventions under NACP III, these populations receive a comprehensive package of preventive services. State AIDS Control Societies are expected to saturate coverage of these groups before moving on to cover other groups. 2. Bridge Populations: Clients of sex workers are the major focus. They receive a combination of services, including condom promotion, referrals to clinical services for STI management, and behaviour change communication. Two other major populations within the bridge population are truckers and high-risk internal migrants. 3. Other Vulnerable Populations: Risk groups in rural areas, HIV-aff ected children, youth (15-19 years), and women receive a package of services delivered through an expanded mechanism. Targeted interventions are organised for persons most at risk for HIV, such as FSWs, MSM,TGs, and IDUs, as well as bridge populations such as truckers and internal migrants.44 NACO is silent on the specifi c segments of cross-border migrant populations that programming needs to address. NACO delivers prevention and treatment services through a network of Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC)45 across India that off er a good standard of service, although at relatively high cost.

The free ART programme, launched in 2004 in eight government hospitals in six high-prevalence states, has since been scaled-up to include 211 centres.

As a result, 68,244 people were trained on HIV and AIDS issues and 116,183 persons were provided counselling.

National AIDS Policies The Indian Constitution recognizes broader application of the right of all individuals to life, liberty, and equality before the law and equal protection under the law when addressing issues in the context of the HIV epidemic. On a number of occasions the Supreme Court of India has interpreted the right to health and medical assistance, the right to life with dignity, and the right to protection from sexual harassment as constitutional rights. Where there is no specifi c legislation, the Supreme Court of India has determined that international treaties to which India is a signatory have the force of law. The Indian Supreme Court holds that failure on the part of a government to provide timely medical treatment to a patient who is in need of such treatment is a violation of the right to life.49 However, these constitutional rights have been applied only rarely to protect those aff ected by HIV.50 49 Paschim Bengal Khet Mazdoor Society vs. State of West Bengal, AIR 1996, SC 2426; UNDP, \u201cLaw, Ethics and HIV/AIDS in South Asia.\u201d 50 Ibid., UNDP.

This policy, drafted in consultation with all stakeholders, aims to create a healthy work environment and reduce discrimination and stigma associated with HIV and AIDS. The MOLE is working toward inclusion of HIV prevention and AIDS care programmes for workers in the informal sector by making suitable provisions in labour laws and social security measures, including insurance. Indian law criminalizes injecting drug use, and sex work, both of which have an immediate and harmful impact on the spread of HIV. At the same time the Indian Government places a high priority on containing the spread of the epidemic, protecting the rights of those affected, and providing HIV services to those on the margins of society. These priorities are reflected in the HIV Bill (2006) currently pending before Parliament (at the time this publication went to print), which was drafted in a series of consultations with various stakeholders.

Most private health practices, including diagnostics, do not have to follow standardized practices and 51 In the case of Armed Forces recruitment, HIV screening before employment may be carried out voluntarily with pre-test and post- test counselling and results may be kept confidential. are generally unaware of pre-test and post-test counselling, confidentiality rights, and the requirement for consent prior to testing. Violations are the norm. Neither the Government of India nor the governments of destination countries monitor the activities of these medical centres, and no reports are required. Once a migrant reaches the destination country, s/he is often required to take another mandatory HIV test to secure a work permit and other documentation. Testing may also be required on an annual basis to retain the work permit. In the event that a migrant tests HIV positive, s/he is immediately deported, often without notification of their HIV-positive status. The interventions of NACO focus on the 8.64 million temporary, short-duration migrants in India, and NACO coordinates programs with community volunteers, employers, and employees. The draft HIV Bill focuses on people who are displaced due to infrastructure development projects. Moreover, in special sessions on people on the move at recent international forums (such as the 17th International AIDS Conference in Mexico City in August 2008 and the 24th Programme Coordination Board of UNAIDS in June 2009) NACO emphasized the need to focus on migrant workers in India and to launch special initiatives addressing their needs in order to avert an increase in HIV infections among migrant populations. Policies, Legislation, and International Conventions International Conventions India has ratified several international conventions including the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Although India is a major source country, the nation is not yet a signatory to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Family. India has signed but not yet ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons. Similarly, though India has ratified various ILO conventions, including Convention No.111 concerning Discrimination (Employment and Occupation), it has not ratified conventions 97 and 143, concerning migrants and the welfare of their families. ILO developed a new 71 international standard on HIV/AIDS, which was adopted in June at the 2010 International Labour Conference. Regional and Bilateral Agreements India has ratified the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking of Women and Children for Prostitution as well as the SAARC Convention on Regional Arrangements for Promotion of Child Welfare in South Asia. At the initiative of the Labour Minister of India, a meeting of Labour Ministers of SAARC countries on \u201cHIV/AIDS in the World of Work\u201d was held in June 2007 in Geneva, on the sidelines of the 96th Session of the International Labour Conference of the ILO. However, little progress was made, and the Ministry of External Affairs for the Government of India is currently pursuing bilateral cooperation with SAARC countries on this issue. India signed labour agreements with Jordan and Qatar in the 1980s, but no further progress was made for many years. Since its creation in 2004, the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs has made a concerted effort to enter into bilateral Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with all major destination countries in order to ensure better protection and welfare of Indian migrants. Within the span of the past few years (2006-2009), the MOIA has signed a number of MoU and social security agreements with receiving countries. The MoU with the UAE was signed in December 2006, with Kuwait in April 2007, with Oman in November 2008, and with Malaysia in January 2009. The MoU with Malaysia also provides for the constitution of a joint working group. An additional Protocol to the existing Labour Agreement between India and Qatar was signed in November 2007. MoU have been proposed with Bahrain, Yemen and Libya, and efforts are underway to explore the possibility of a similar MoU with Saudi Arabia. For migrants working in Gulf countries, minimum wages are not prescribed by local laws, but are governed by the contracts between employer and worker. To protect women migrants, the Government of India initiated a process for ensuring minimum wages for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efafa3b6-5b26-4cb2-9689-268b6a7ad62a": {"__data__": {"id_": "efafa3b6-5b26-4cb2-9689-268b6a7ad62a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcd7d2699fbdbc624d0b12b7dfefc401b64bb736b8abc1ca03d18b11f2a26a5b"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee3c1c9f-35fa-4812-923a-0521ecb98b95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f433fec9a2e0d0fc766c7eee5648ae38ab8a327c515dcca9e7c76abca7730459"}}, "hash": "0253c8b80ee4b43d6150a13428f9afcbc99c0adedba8bb8f09f9c5aebcface6c", "text": "women. A minimum wage in the range of US$300-350 per month is fixed by the Indian Mission after taking into account the prevailing market wage in that country. In addition to concluding Labour Welfare and Protection Agreements with Gulf countries and Malaysia for the benefit of skilled and semi-skilled workers, the MOIA is negotiating and concluding bilateral social security agreements with countries in Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific for the benefit of Indian professionals. The Ministry is also taking steps to build labour mobility partnerships with key countries of destination in the European Union and select member states of the EU. The Ministry has initiated the process for negotiating labour mobility agreements with Poland, the Czech Republic, Norway, Switzerland, Hungary, and Romania. In addition, the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs has signed bilateral social security agreements with Belgium, France, and Germany. The Indo-German agreement on social insurance was signed at the Ministerial level in New Delhi and provides for exemption from payment of social security contributions for posted workers and professionals of both countries on a reciprocal basis. The India-France Social Security Agreement was signed in Paris in September 2008. National Policies and Legislation The Government of India has a number of policies in place within the legislative framework to address the issues surrounding mobility and migration both at home and abroad.52 In October 2009 the Ministry of Labour and Employment in India launched the National Policy on HIV/AIDS and the world of work. Emigration Act, 1983 In India, the Emigration Act of 1983 governs and regulates overseas migration. The operational matters relating to emigration, the provision of emigration services to emigrants, and the enforcement of the act are under the Protector General of Emigrants. The PGE is the statutory authority under the Emigration Act and also oversees the eight Protector of Emigrants (POE) field offices located in various states of India. Under the Act, migrants can seek emigration clearance from POE by processing the case by themselves, through a recruiting agent, or through an employer, who, in turn, can process the documentation independently or use a recruiting agent. 52 This information has been collated from MOIA annual reports and relevant websites, such as: migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more. php?id=3404_0_3_0; www.igovernment.in/site/india-launches- global-advisory-council-sets-resource-center-for-overseas-workers/; migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/ more.php?id=3496; and migration. ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=3513. INDIA 72 The Emigration Act also regulates the functioning of the recruitment agencies. Detailed provisions in both the act and the Emigration Rules registration, recognition, and removal of recruiting agents. The PGE is authorized to grant certification to a recruitment agency after obtaining a security deposit in the form of bank guarantee.53 A recruiting agent works under the permit for an initial period of three years, which can subsequently be renewed. In order to recruit workers and obtain emigration clearance for their departure, agents must obtain originals of the Demand Letter, Power of Attorney, and Specimen Employment Contract from the foreign employer. The Specimen Employment Contract must contain the basic terms and conditions of employment, including salary, accommodation, medical coverage, and transport. When dealing with vulnerable migrants, i.e., women and unskilled workers, employment documents must be attested by the Indian Mission in the destination country. In addition, a scale of fees is prescribed limiting what migrants are required to pay.54 In spring 2008 the government amended the Emigration Rules to require foreign employers who do not use authorized recruitment agents to post a $2,500 bond for each Indian migrant recruited, refunding the bond to the employer upon the migrant\u2019s return to India. This requirement is aimed at encouraging foreign employers to use authorized recruitment agents. The MOIA considers amendments to the Emigration Act essential to ensuring it is an effective instrument for facilitating legal migration, preventing irregular migration, and empowering migrants. The Indian Constitution The Indian Constitution contains basic provisions on conditions of employment, non-discrimination, and the right to work, which are applicable for all workers in India.55 Although Constitutional Rights apply only to citizens, migrant workers are covered under almost all 53 The amount varies based on the number of persons authorized to be recruited. Present scale is Rs. 300,000 (up to 300 workers), Rs. 500,000 (301-1000 workers), and Rs. 1,000,000 (1,001 workers and above).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee3c1c9f-35fa-4812-923a-0521ecb98b95": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee3c1c9f-35fa-4812-923a-0521ecb98b95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcd7d2699fbdbc624d0b12b7dfefc401b64bb736b8abc1ca03d18b11f2a26a5b"}, "2": {"node_id": "efafa3b6-5b26-4cb2-9689-268b6a7ad62a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0253c8b80ee4b43d6150a13428f9afcbc99c0adedba8bb8f09f9c5aebcface6c"}}, "hash": "f433fec9a2e0d0fc766c7eee5648ae38ab8a327c515dcca9e7c76abca7730459", "text": "1,000,000 (1,001 workers and above). 54 Recruiting agents are authorized to charge each worker a service fee at the following rates: Unskilled Workers - Rs.2000; Semi- skilled Workers - Rs.3000; Skilled Workers - Rs.5000; Professionals - Rs.10,000. 55 Articles 23 (1); 39; 42; and 43. labour laws and policies.56 Relevant Ministries and Mechanisms for Indian Migrants The Ministry of Labour and Employment and the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs are responsible for migration issues.

Recently, the Government of India, through the POE offices in each country, began offering basic information for those leaving the country to take up jobs in the Gulf and South-East Asian countries.57 An amendment to the Emigration Bill (2002) proposes establishing a charged with improving the lives of migrants by promoting employment opportunities, creating an employment and communications database, establishing standards and guidelines for migration, and administering the Overseas Workers\u2019 Welfare Fund. Some of the initiatives implemented and proposed by the MOIA for the welfare of the migrants are: \u2022\ufffd Overseas Workers Resource Centres (OWRC): Established in January 2008, OWRC assist Indian workers planning to go abroad and those already abroad by providing relevant information and assistance, including a multilingual help-line for grievance redress and interventions for overseas workers in distress. \u2022\ufffd Overseas Citizen of India (OCI): Beginning in 2006, persons born in India who became naturalized citizens of other countries can obtain OCI cards that allow visa-free entry to India and simplify the process of obtaining work and residence visas. By July 2008, some 280,000 overseas Indians had obtained cards. \u2022\ufffd Smart Cards: MOIA has proposed that all first- time migrant workers leaving the country receive 56 These laws include the Minimum Wages Act, 1948; the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970; the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976; the Building and Other Construction Workers Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service Act, 1996; the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 1923; the Payment of Wages Act, 1936; the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986; the Bonded Labour Act, 1976; the Employees State Insurance Act, 1952; and the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961. The last two acts, however, cover only organized sector workers and exclude temporary migrants. 57 The information comprises the contact information of Indian embassies and consulates and basic orientation information regarding the history of the host country. 73 Smart Cards that include passport information, work-contract data (such as the name of the employer), and insurance details. However, this had not been executed at the time of this writing. \u2022\ufffd Pre-Departure Training: First-time migrants will undergo training about the laws of the country to which they are going, and recruiting agents will be jointly liable with foreign employers for violations of worker contracts, as is the practice in the Philippines. Feedback from migrants would be used to rate recruiters, and this information would be made available to potential migrants. An Emigration Policy Division was created in MOIA in March 2006 to articulate and implement policy reforms in all areas related to Indian migrant workers. Priorities and responsibilities include: formulating policies for improving migration management; guiding reforms to legislation and migration procedures, including institutional changes; implementing e-Governance; developing welfare schemes for migrants; and strengthening bilateral and multilateral cooperation in International migration. An International Migration Policy for India has been drafted, which needs to be finalized and declared. A compulsory insurance system for Indian workers moving overseas, the Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana, was launched in 2003. A Welfare Fund for overseas workers that covers boarding and lodging for distressed overseas Indians in the domestic sector and unskilled labourers is operational, and the transferability of migrant social security contributions have been negotiated in bilateral agreements. Human Trafficking Legislation The national legal framework to deal with human trafficking includes: \u2022\ufffd Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (ITPA), 1956 \u2022\ufffd Provisions under the Indian Penal Code, such as selling and buying minor girls for prostitution or procuring a minor girl, and importation of a girl below 22-years of age. \u2022\ufffd Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 \u2022\ufffd Child Marriage Prohibition Act, 2006 The ITPA clearly defines trafficking for the purposes of prostitution and provides comprehensive protection for children. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2006, drafted and introduced in Lok Sabha, makes trafficking and sexual exploitation of persons for commercial purposes a punishable offence and aims to ensure stringent punishment of traffickers. The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) is the lead ministry dealing with the prevention of trafficking in women and children for commercial sexual exploitation. In its efforts, MWCD works very closely with the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs, Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Labour and Employment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "855413de-7b86-40bf-85f2-2db04a5c0b9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "855413de-7b86-40bf-85f2-2db04a5c0b9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ae769237b83ad2b6d6c5d02b831af88b33855f4c349f77f99fb4f919aac9fc2"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd58c9d3-bdae-423b-9bc9-980163d6ee62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "679ce7d81f6902e3f39ed50083249ab74eb680c81f8a6fff7113df45da1824cf"}}, "hash": "735e345d0642e602b7f39bd5a9f60038ba34994d65aa57fcf692a1fbf7a5dd43", "text": "Some of the initiatives undertaken by the MWCD to combat trafficking58 are: \u2022\ufffd National Plan of Action (1998), developed to combat trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of women and children, with the objective of mainstreaming and re-integrating women and child victims of commercial sexual exploitation into the community. \u2022\ufffd National Plan of Action for children (2005) to ensure that the rights of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "358a3379-f541-4077-8512-fc97be8d53fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "358a3379-f541-4077-8512-fc97be8d53fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bb5a62e7d5f287967b27d94811290389b451c623c650d0e06396140995ca950"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e377b14-7f8e-4cc3-9f17-622b0adcca93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0fbf59caa65d2066a029a08d82fe17bc06f799fbac4fdbf1d3e5072a15b4693"}}, "hash": "6ad06c66e630eb053706c237d76351fce92ed71b37f340114f13686bf97e7fc6", "text": "all children (defined as up to the age of 18 years) are protected. \u2022\ufffd Integrated National Plan of Action to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Human Beings, with Special Focus on Women and Children has been formulated in collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Labour and Employment, National Human Rights Commission, and National Commission for Women, and in consultation with various stakeholders.

Similarly, in 2008 the Ministry of Labour and Employment developed a protocol for prevention, rescue, repatriation, and rehabilitation of trafficked and migrant children that provides guidelines for concerned stakeholders in order to ensure safe procedures for rescuing children forced into child labour. Key Stakeholders Government Agencies and Networks Ministry of Labour and Employment (MOLE) is primarily responsible for protecting and safeguarding the interests of organized and unorganized sector workers in India in matters of wages, terms and conditions of service, training and skill development, safety and health, and social security and welfare, with special emphasis on women and child labour. Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is responsible for immigration, visa, foreign contribution, and citizenship related matters. Entry, exit, and stay of foreigners in India is regulated by the Bureau of Immigration (BoI) and the State governments. Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA), created in 2004, is mandated to oversee the welfare of Indian citizens abroad. Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for HIV prevention services and AIDS care and treatment. National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) is responsible for controlling the spread of HIV in India and, under NACP III, NACO is working toward reversing the epidemic over the next five years by integrating programmes for prevention, care, support, and treatment. Ministry of Labour and Employment (MOLE) and International Labour Organization, in close collaboration with NACO, UNAIDS and network of People Living with HIV, are implementing a project, \u201cPrevention of HIV/AIDS in the world of work: A Tripartite Response\u201d. The project is supported by the US Department of Labor/PEPFAR. Non-resident Keralites\u2019 Affairs (NORKA) is a government department in the state of Kerala, launched in December 1996 to redress the grievances of non-resident Keralites (NRK). NORKA is the first department of its kind in India and is a single-window agency, working to fulfil an assurance given by the Government of Kerala to its expatriate community. NORKA aims to strengthen relations between the NRK and the Government of Kerala; find solutions to the problems faced by the NRK community; and institutionalize an administrative framework. NORKA has established NORKA Roots to act as counsel for non-resident Keralites. Many other state governments have approached NORKA for guidelines regarding non-resident Indian affairs. Non-government Organizations In India, there are many civil society and non- governmental organizations dealing with the issues of migration, human trafficking, and HIV, primarily focused on protecting migrants and mobile populations within and outside India. Very few have adopted an integrated approach. Some of these organizations are listed below: Trade Unions are slowly taking note of the reality of migrant workers in India. The apex trade unions Indian National Trade Union Congress, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Hindu Mazdoor Sabha, All India Trade Union Congress, and Centre for Indian Trade Unions have signed a Joint Statement of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. There is a need for building capacity of trade unions for developing interventions for reaching migrants. ILO is supporting some trade union intervention in the construction sector, which attracts a large number of migrants in India.

Indian Personnel Export Promotion Council, established by both private and public labour recruitment agencies in the Middle East, arranges overseas worker placements for Indian workers in various destination countries in the Middle East. 75 Arunodhaya Migrant Initiative (AMI), formerly Migrant Forum, addresses the issues of labour, migration, and trafficking, and specialises in the issues of domestic workers, particularly health and the vulnerability of migrant workers to HIV. AMI along with Peace Trust have begun to lobby members of parliament to include special attach\u00e9s in embassies and consulates abroad to deal specifically with migrant workers\u2019 rights. Apart from regular work such as research, consultancy services on travel, job opportunities, visa formalities, and recruitment agencies, the Migrant Forum and Peace Trust also provide assistance with legal documentation, information dissemination, and, to a lesser extent, educational classes. AMI along with the All India Trade Union Congress, with its construction workers union, launched a pre-departure programme in Kalpakkam (100 km from Chennai) on May 1, 2008. Catholic Workers Movement (CWM) is part of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India\u2019s Labour and Justice Wing. Both the Young Christian Workers movement and CWM address the issues of migrants as a priority. The Kerala CWM has taken the lead by establishing a Migrants Desk at Trichur, with a person assigned to deal exclusively with returnee issues. There are some programmes for migrant families, and CWM lobbies the government to provide insurance for the families of migrants and welfare schemes for returnees. Migrant Forum (MF), established in 1998, addresses the issues and problems of Indian workers migrating abroad, with a special focus on unskilled workers in Asian destinations. MF addresses trafficking, the growing feminization of migration, and issues faced by domestic workers. It also addresses health issues, including the HIV vulnerability of migrant workers. Migrant Forum has a central office in Mumbai and a regional office in Chennai. Peace Trust, working with migrants since 1999, focuses on both construction and domestic workers who leave for countries in the Middle East and South-East Asia. The Trust has published the Tamil version of The Emigration Act as a guide for Tamil migrants to India. V.V. Giri National Institute of Labour for India (VVGNLI) is the premier organization involved in research, training, education, publication, and consultancy on labour related issues. The Institute has a capsule course on HIV/AIDS basic issues, such as modes of infection, prevention, and the facilities provided by government for testing, counselling, and treatment. In 2007-2008 the Institute conducted 130 programmes on different labour related issues, reaching out to more than 4,000 participants. Young Christian Workers (YCW) \u2013 India organizes young workers of all faiths and races, and works to maintain the dignity of workers and to fight for their rights while promoting interreligious dialogue aimed at creating an intercultural society where solidarity prevails. YCW is particularly active in Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu. In recent years, campaigns and educational activities have centred on workers in the informal sector and capacity building for women workers. From 1999 onward, YCW- India has focused on issues relating to migrants, taking up the case of 19 migrant fishermen arrested by the Iranian police and imprisoned in Pakistan. The ordeal of these fishermen ended on April 24, 2000, as a result of the active campaigns of YCW and other civil and trade union groups in Tamil Nadu. INDIA 76 Recommendations The following recommendations are made within the context of the foregoing analysis of India\u2019s migration patterns and policies and HIV situation. In order to reduce the HIV vulnerability of current and future migrant and mobile populations, it will be necessary to take action in a range of key areas, as detailed below. 1. Ratify and implement the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and Their Families as a host (destination) country and a sending (source) country. 2. Ratify the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Traffi cking in Persons, to which India is currently a signatory. 3. Regulate labour migration by establishing a Central Manpower Corporation to protect the interests of migrant workers. The structure could be similar to that of the Overseas Manpower Corporation currently operating to regulate skilled migration in some states. 4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87399736-cd5d-45f4-9e62-77019a12c1e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "87399736-cd5d-45f4-9e62-77019a12c1e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76b69fae9b584c4987aa30059807231a5d3d083459b911d4134e28fa2c8a2c3f"}, "2": {"node_id": "8fa6e3f1-c21a-4534-ac38-23926162285a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b83258fe505ddbefcb512ebc89a3f67c1de8aab5cb64301f85385040f69ef69d"}}, "hash": "2f82ef66df4c6d6540c29d6226705c996f8dbfd7e2ae60139aded35587b0c19a", "text": "4.

Amend existing laws and initiate new laws to ensure penal sanctions for those who engage in human traffi cking or who violate the human rights of migrants. 8. Acknowledge the feminization of migration and allow women to travel abroad for employment by signing separate MoU with countries employing domestic workers, and by introducing Standard Labour Contracts for foreign domestic workers that defi nes the rights and responsibilities of workers and employers, using the format developed by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and following the example of the Jordanian Ministry of Labour. 9. Design and implement, with the support of the Ministry of Internal Aff airs, MLE, MOIA, trade unions, and civil society organizations, a well-structured pre-departure programme that is a prerequisite for all migrants. Content should include: information on HIV/AIDS; host country laws and customs; the rights of migrant workers; and the health services available to migrants. 10. Ensure policies and legislation are based on gender-sensitive, rights-based, and multisectoral approaches; and integrate migration issues with issues of HIV and AIDS while acknowledging the nexus between migration and human traffi cking by passing the pending International Migration Policy, the HIV Bill, and amendments to the ITPA. 11. Ensure comprehensive migrant-friendly voluntary HIV testing that protects the rights of both Indian migrants abroad and migrants in India in a process governed by best practices, i.e. informed consent, confi dentiality, and pre- and post-test counselling. 12. Protection of migrants from mandatory testing and deportation due to HIV status needs to be stated in existing and future bilateral agreements and MoU with labour receiving countries. This applies for Indian migrants going abroad as well as for migrants in India. 13. Ensure returning migrant workers, as well as migrants in India, have access to HIV and AIDS care, treatment, and support, including free ART. 77 INDIA Bibliography - India ActionAid (2008).

According to the 2006 census, the population of Maldives was 298,968, making Maldives the smallest Asian country in both population and area.1 Maldives gross domestic product (GDP) was US$1.7 billion in 2008, and real GDP growth has averaged over 7.5 percent per year for more than a decade. In late December 2004 a major tsunami left more than 100 dead, 12,000 displaced, and property damage exceeding $300 million. As a result of the tsunami, the GDP contracted by about 4.6 percent in 2005, but rebounded with a growth of 18 percent in 2006 largely due to increasing tourism and reconstruction. A slowdown in growth since 2006 is attributed to the global recession.2 Although poverty has decreased overall in Maldives, some vulnerability persists, with an estimated 16 percent of the population below the poverty line. Poverty remains particularly high on many farming and fi shing islands that do not have the benefi t of the tourist trade. Migration Patterns External and international migration from Maldives is very small, but mobility within the country is signifi cant. 1 Ministry of Planning and National Development, Statistical Year Book of Maldives 2008. 2 US State Department, The World Factbook 2009; available at www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mv.html. 83 The capital, Male\u2019, is the centre of commerce and attracts those seeking employment, better education, and advanced healthcare facilities.

Although difficult to estimate, the number of undocumented workers is believed to be between 10,000 and 30,000.11 Occupational Profile of Migrants According to sector data reported by the Ministry of Employment and Social Security, the construction industry, including electricity, gas, and water, employed the majority of non-nationals, estimated at 34,770 workers in 2008, followed by the tourism and hospitality sector at 15,096 expatriate workers (see Table 2). Expatriate workers are engaged in professional, middle-level, clerical, and skilled work. By far the largest occupation category is elementary or unskilled labour, accounting for almost half of the total documented expatriate workers employed in Maldives. Although details on undocumented workers are not available, it can realistically be assumed that the majority are employed as unskilled workers. 10 Ministry of Employment and Social Security. 11 The Immigration Department estimates that as many as 30,000 illegal migrant workers may be in the country.

Gender and Migration Participation of women in the labour market in Maldives is very low compared to other South Asian nations.12 Rural women, particularly those who are heads of households, rarely travel beyond their atoll; are more vulnerable to poverty than men, owning few, if any, assets; and are unable to obtain credit. However, women make a significant contribution to household income and food security by carrying out practically all fish processing and agricultural activity as unpaid labour for the family.13 As primary caregivers, they are responsible for cooking, farming, fish processing, collecting firewood, and other priorities around the home. The role of women in fishing and marketing of fish is negligible and Inter-island trading by women is virtually non-existent.

Rising concerns over the mistreatment of migrants, including the practice of bringing a person for one job and forcing them to work on another and/or not providing the conditions of work promised at the time of recruitment, can be considered as human trafficking as defined in Article 3 of the Protocol on Trafficking in Persons.16 The Human Rights Commission has called for urgent action with respect to migrant workers in Maldives, and recommends establishing a separate bureau for expatriate workers with responsibility for issuing quotas on their employment, granting of work permits, collecting and maintaining statistics, dealing with complaints, and other related matters. Source, Transit, and Destination The emigration rate in Maldives is less than 0.4 percent of the total population with a small number of Maldivians migrating abroad for employment and educational opportunities. The top 10 destination countries for the people of Maldives are Nepal, United Kingdom, India, Australia, Germany, United States, Switzerland, New Zealand, Japan, and Italy. Maldives is a destination country for expatriate migrant workers from South Asia, mainly Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka, but also Nepal and Indonesia (see Table 1). 14 US State Department, Trafficking in Persons Report 2009 - The Maldives; available at www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2009/. 15 HRCM, \u201cRapid Assessment.\u201d 16 Protocol on Trafficking in Persons to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. Remittances The Human Development Report 2009 indicates that US$3 million in remittances were sent to Maldives in 2007, about 0.2 percent of GDP. Average remittances per person were US$10, compared with the average for South Asia of US$33. Outward remittances exceeded 9.1 percent of GDP in 2009, largely due to the number of expatriates employed in the country. HIV/AIDS Situation Maldives is categorized as a \u201clow prevalence country,\u201d with an HIV prevalence of less than 0.1 percent in the 15-49 age group.17 Seafarers and injecting drug users (IDU) are considered the highest risk groups, but legal, cultural, and social issues have impeded working with these vulnerable groups. Given that the rural population is spread out on 200 of the country\u2019s 1,200 islands, there are real barriers to educating people on HIV and AIDS, distributing condoms, and treating people for sexually transmitted infections (STI). The mission of the Centre for Community Health and Disease Control, within the Ministry of Health and Family, is to improve the health and well- being of the people through prevention and control of communicable diseases, provide essential health care, and promote health awareness. Specific programs are available on health education, health promotion, and the prevention and control of STI and HIV. The first case of HIV in the Maldives was reported in 1991. According to World Bank data, by mid-2006, 13 HIV-positive cases were reported among Maldivians (11 male, 2 female) and 168 cases among expatriates. All infections were reportedly acquired through heterosexual transmission.

The 2008 BBS confirmed findings of rising use of intravenous drugs, needle sharing, and high-risk behaviours amongst drug users, such as early sexual activity and risky sexual behaviour. IDUs in Male\u2019 (31 percent) and Addu (23 percent) reported injecting with a used needle or syringe the last time they injected drugs. In addition, 59 percent had unprotected sex in the past 12 months.21 National Response to HIV/AIDS The AIDS Control Program in Maldives started in 1987, before the first case of HIV was reported in 1991. The National AIDS Council (NAC), a multisectoral body with representatives from the government, NGOs, and private sector, was established to coordinate this program and provide policy direction. The country\u2019s first National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS was developed and implemented from 2002 to 2006, and the National Strategic Plan 2007-2011, approved in 2007, aims to limit HIV transmission, provide care for infected people, and mitigate the impact of the epidemic through seven strategic directions. An advanced Media Committee for HIV and AIDS helps to provide the public with reliable information and overcome the stigmatization of People Living with HIV. A National AIDS Control Unit within the Department of Public Health was set up to track infections. 19 Republic of Maldives, \u201cBiological and Behavioural Survey, 2008\u201d; Evidence to Action, HIV and AIDS Data Hub for Asia Pacific; available www.aidsdatahub.org. 20 World Bank, HIV & AIDS South Asia: Maldives. 21 Republic of Maldives, \u201cBiological and Behavioural Survey, 2008.\u201d Migration and HIV/AIDS By 1995, 9 cases of HIV were detected among Maldivians, all of them seafarers. Consequently, special programmes for HIV and STI prevention are included in the training curriculum for Maldivian seafarers. There were 168 HIV- positive cases among expatriates living in the Maldives in 2006, though none of them received treatment there, nor do they continue to reside in the Maldives. Mandatory HIV testing is required of all Maldivians who spend more than a year outside the country, and they are screened upon their return.22 Mandatory Testing All migrants engaged to work in Maldives are expected to undergo a medical check-up prior to leaving their home country and must submit to another examination upon arrival in order to secure a work permit. Both these medical examinations include HIV testing. By law migrants are not denied entry if found to be HIV positive. In practice, however, if they test positive for HIV, their contracts are immediately terminated and they are deported back to their home country. Policies, Legislation, and International Conventions International Conventions Maldives has ratified several international human rights conventions, including: \u2022\ufffd International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD); \u2022\ufffd Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); \u2022\ufffd Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) ; and \u2022\ufffd International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Maldives is not a signatory to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families and the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons. Maldives recently became a member of the International 22 World Bank, HIV/AIDS in South Asia: Maldives. 87 Labour Organization (ILO), and initial steps are being taken to conform to ILO requirements. Regional Conventions Maldives has ratified the South Asian Agreement for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Trafficking of Women and Children for Prostitution. There seems to be no particular regional or bilateral agreements to which Maldives is a party, which needs to be considered given the country\u2019s huge influx of migrant workers.

No health or social security benefits are mandated. In the event that these rights are violated, a foreign worker can lodge a legal complaint against an employer at the Labour Tribunal of the Maldives. The Human Rights Commission reports that little has been done to implement the act, as the institutions provided for in the act have not begun to function appropriately. Employment agencies in Maldives, with their counterpart agents abroad, supply migrant labour. Normally, agents who recruit for jobs in the Maldives advertise vacancies in smaller foreign newspapers, specifying the job and outlining compensation for what is usually a one-year renewable contract. Once hired, the contract generally states that if accommodation, food, transport, and medical care are not supplied by the employer, the worker will be reimbursed actual expenses. According to interviews conducted with migrant workers who have either worked or are working in Maldives, recruiting agents charge fees that are sometimes excessive. Monthly wages vary from US$100 to $150, well below the recommended wages set by countries of origin, and many workers live crammed into make-shift homes. From time to time, the local media features stories about the physical and verbal abuse faced by migrants, particularly those from Bangladesh. Nursing Personnel Convention, 1977 Many nurses migrating to Maldives for work faced challenges that were addressed by the Nursing Personnel Convention. The convention requires states to adopt measures to provide, recruit, and train Maldivians as nurses, providing them with the education, training, working conditions, career prospects, and remuneration necessary to attract and retain Maldivians to the profession. Home Work Convention, 1996 The Home Work Convention aims to promote equality of treatment between home/domestic workers and other wage earners, particularly in relation to freedom of association, protection against discrimination, occupational safety and health, remuneration, social security, access to training, minimum age for admission to work, and maternity protection. In the Maldives, female mobile and migrant workers are employed as domestic workers and live in the homes of their employers. Their accommodation is often cramped or overcrowded, their wages are low, and most are expected to work more than eight hours per day. Domestic workers are particularly vulnerable as they are isolated, seldom have employment contracts, lack legal protection, and are generally in a weak bargaining position. Key Stakeholders As part of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Department of Immigration and Emigration (DIE) is responsible for immigration control throughout the Maldives. DIE recently announced the inauguration of the all-purpose visa sticker coming into effect at the start of 2010. The current stickers used for work visas, marriage visas, foreign widow visas, student visas, and dependant visas, would be replaced by this all-purpose visa sticker and its added security features, providing a more secure MALDIVES 88 and simplified authorization process.23 In the early 1990s the mandate for labour administration was given to the Ministry of Trade, Industries, and Labour. It was later transferred to the Ministry for National Planning and Development, and then to the ministry responsible for higher education and human resources. In November 2008 the newly created Ministry of Human Resources, Youth, and Sports was given responsibility for labour administration in Maldives. The ministry has so far confined itself to issuing work permits to foreign workers and to dealing with related issues; it does not currently have the resources or policies in place to effectively address the wider labour and employment issues and challenges facing the nation. The ministry collects and compiles statistics on the employment of foreign workers, but does not collect or publish national labour statistics, and has recently stated that the statistics collected with respect to the employment of foreigners and the relevant databases are neither adequate nor accurate.24 The Ministry of Health and Family is responsible for the delivery of health services. Despite government efforts since the early 1990s, a major constraint facing the health sector is a shortage of skilled personnel and health facilities. The Maldives medical establishment consists of the Male\u2019 Central Hospital (Indhira Ghandi Memorial Hospital), four regional hospitals (two in the north and two in the south), and twenty-one primary health-care centres. Each administrative atoll has at least one health centre, staffed by community health workers. Most of the inhabited islands also have traditional medical practitioners. However, the atoll hospitals and health centres treat only minor medical problems; more complex medical needs are addressed at the Male\u2019 Central Hospital. Participation of interested NGOs in health education and promotion programmes is encouraged. On a voluntary basis, doctors from the Maldives Medical Association conduct awareness programmes for communities, hold an annual Doctors Day, participate in Blood Donor Camps, and circulate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "083e88d3-3737-491f-b9b8-040d29aede64": {"__data__": {"id_": "083e88d3-3737-491f-b9b8-040d29aede64", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d65bfec341ac89f0a731487bf1ea44a18bacab6cf56da4edbcf1c91a6461233"}, "3": {"node_id": "12e88bce-3d2b-4109-97ab-82f0f2a3a7ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a48cc696b2b0eeae73af131c7ea64c96687b00a50b7688a79888db02301f775"}}, "hash": "882cd5101b8aef00854e2f6b574051937088a06b9f0b68ae06bc888550f59c88", "text": "statements on drug use.

In order to reduce the HIV vulnerability of current and future migrant and mobile populations it will be necessary to take action in a range of key areas, as detailed below. 1. Sign/ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families and the UN Protocol on Traffi cking in Persons. 2. Strengthen understanding about, and collect and analyse data on, the migration-traffi cking nexus and the vulnerability of migrants to HIV. 3. Ensure comprehensive migrant-friendly HIV testing that includes voluntary counselling and testing and protects the rights of migrants in a process governed by best practices, including consent, confi dentiality, and pre-test and post-test counselling. 4. Highlight the issue of HIV and Mobility in Maldives as part of the SAARC Regional Strategy on HIV/AIDS, drawing the attention of the Technical Committee on Health and Population and the SAARC Expert Group on HIV and AIDS, and mobilizing the leadership of SAARC Member States. 5. Support the Interministerial Group of SAARC Member States representing health, labour, and other relevant ministries in discussion of HIV and mobility issues; recommend actions for improved collaboration between labour sending and receiving countries; strengthen labour policies and laws, based on ILO conventions and such other relevant UN instruments as CEDAW, the ILO Multilateral Framework for Migration, and the ILO Code of Practice of HIV/AIDS. 6. Consider engaging in bilateral agreements with countries that send large numbers of migrants to the Maldives and ensure comprehensive migrant- friendly voluntary HIV testing that protects the rights of migrant workers.

It is said in Nepal that people are poor not only because of low income, but also because of their low access to opportunities or participation.2 Migration Patterns Nepal is considered to be primarily a country of origin for labour migrants, with an emigration rate of 3.9 percent. The major continent of destination for Nepalese migrants is Asia, with 95 percent of emigrants living there. Remittances from labour migrants are a major contributor to Nepal\u2019s economy. The country\u2019s decade-long internal confl ict, limited industrialization, inadequate domestic employment opportunities, and an estimated 300,000 new workers joining the labour market annually, have increased unemployment rates and forced the Nepalese to migrate in search of alternative livelihoods. Widespread poverty, the low status of women and girls, and other social inequities are other major reasons for women to migrate.

Toward the end of the 1990s some 250,000 Nepalis were employed in India\u2019s public sector, of which an estimated 50,000 were in the army.10 Gender and Migration There are major differences in the participation of women (48.9 percent) and men (67.6 percent) in the labour force in Nepal. Most women are engaged in informal, subsistence, and domestic labour, without pay or with low wages.11 Grinding poverty, gender-based 8 Surya B.

The number of female Nepali migrant workers officially reported in 2008 was 11,007 women out of a total of 266,666 migrants, a vast increase compared to the 316 women migrants reported in 2007.12 For every documented female migrant leaving Nepal, an equal number of undocumented female migrants are likely travelling on cheap flights to foreign countries through irregular channels via major cities in India or through Bangladesh. Circumventing the undeclared ban of the Government of Nepal on female migration, especially to Gulf countries and Malaysia, is the likely reason for this significant increase in undocumented female migration.13 Table 1: Key Events on Travel Ban on Nepali Female Migrants Events Date Ban on female migrant workers going to Gulf May 16, 1997 Ban lifted on female migrant workers and conditions imposed January 17, 2007 Ban completely lifted September 5, 2007 Second ban imposed for embarking to Gulf countries and Malaysia September 5, 2008 Source: Nepal Migration Year Book, 2008, Nepal Institute of Development Studies. As in the case of Bangladesh and India, gender-based bans increase the vulnerability and risks of women to exploitation and trafficking. When regular and formal channels of migration are closed, women turn to irregular and unofficial channels. For example, three Nepali females were apprehended by Nepal police in Bakey District in December 2008 as they were heading for the Gulf countries from Nepalgunj via India with two sub-agents.14 12 Nepal Institute of Development Studies (NIDS), Nepal Migration Year Book, 2007. Regarding the very low number of women migrants, the 2007 report further states that \u201cthis could mean either a decline in the number of females eager to seek foreign employment, or women preferring to fly overseas via India without seeking permission to avoid hassles and possibly pay bribes. Therefore data on female migration have remained invisible\u201d (p. 21). 13 NIDS, Nepal Migration Year Book, 2008. 14 Nepal Samachar Patra, December, 25, 2008, p. 6; and NIDS, Nepal Migration Year Book, 2008. 97 Various reports estimate that about 70,000 female migrant workers from Nepal are working in international labour markets. According to the 2008-2009 internal statistical data from a local non-governmental organization (NGO), the number of women travelling to the Gulf States in search of job opportunities \u2013 particularly Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Oman, Lebanon and Kuwait \u2013 is rising.15 Reports from NGOs and the planning document of the National Planning Commission of Nepal confirm that although overseas employment opportunities for women are increasing, women remain vulnerable to the hardships of human trafficking, forced labour, sexual exploitation, and HIV. Many undocumented migrant workers are believed to end up in the commercial sex trade and entertainment businesses in Indian cities. According to research undertaken by the Population Council\u2019s Horizons Program in conjunction with the Asia Foundation, about 40 percent of the adolescent girls surveyed said they did not want to live permanently in their villages, and 85 percent of these girls expressed a desire to travel to urban areas.16 A general lack of awareness of international labour markets and avenues for safe migration was apparent, creating an enabling environment for trafficking. The migration of Nepali women to foreign countries for work, and the consequences of their migration in terms of the impact on themselves and on the society and economy of Nepal, are inadequately understood, despite the fact that women\u2019s migration abroad is not a recent phenomenon.

Nepal is similar to Bhutan in that it is also a transit point for Tibetan women who enter Nepal illegally seeking asylum at refugee camps, but become easy prey for traffickers. Government reports in 2007 indicated that 26 out of 75 districts in Nepal were vulnerable to human trafficking, where women and girls have disappeared or have returned after being trafficked.18 Approximately 5,000 to 7,000 Nepalese women and girls between the ages of 10 and 20 trafficked into the red-light districts in Indian cities each year. 19 The open border agreement between India and Nepal allows traffickers to easily transport victims, especially teenage girls, between the two nations on their way to brothels in Mumbai and other cities that are eager to buy them. Apart from brothels, about 200 girls aged 6 to 14 are in Indian circuses. Studies on human trafficking by various Indian and Nepali NGOs estimate that while about 7-11 percent of trafficked victims are involved in domestic work and about 8 percent are married to Indian men, the balance are directly sold into the commercial sex trade in Indian cities. Hong Kong (SAR) is the second biggest market for trafficked Nepalese women; and Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and other Gulf countries are also reported to be destinations. Internal trafficking is also on the rise due to the insurgency and high rates of internal displacement, as rural women and children leave their homes and seek employment and security in urban centres.20 17 A.

No information is available on the number of documented migrants going to India to work in 2007. Based on historical records, approximately 75 percent of all documented Nepali migrants go to India to work. In 2008 the Gulf countries remained very popular destinations for numerous Nepali migrant workers throughout the year. DLEP estimates that workers leaving for the Gulf States (Qatar, UAE, and Saudi Arabia) and Malaysia accounted for more than 93 percent of total departures during the fi rst 11 months of fi scal year 2007-2008. Statistics show an increase in migrant workers going to Qatar from 83,699 in 2007 to 91,267 in 2008. Continuing construction work, higher salaries, and the labour agreement between Nepal and Qatar are considered the major reasons for this increase.

Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, estimates that in 2005-2006, 22 percent of remittances entered Nepal through banks, 44 percent through remittance transfer companies, an average of 29 percent (32 percent rural and 25 percent urban) through hundi, and 5 percent through other media.26 It is still difficult to bring remittances from India to Nepal through formal channels, although attempts have been made to ease this problem. Consequently, most remittances from India to Nepal are hand carried.27 No reliable data is available on remittances to Nepal that flow through informal, non-banking channels. There are different estimates on the volume of remittances sent to Nepal by Nepali migrant workers. The DLEP reports remittances from December 2006 to January 2008 as US$67,549,669 (5.1 Billion NPR).28 Remittance income as a percentage of gross domestic product in 2005-2006 was 16.7 percent, adding Nepal to the list of the 20 countries receiving the most remittances worldwide. According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, remittances from India that year were 2.1 percent of the total incoming remittances, and remittances from women were 11 percent.29 Data from the Nepal Migration Yearbook states remittances were US$1.51 billion for 2007 and US$1.3 24 UNIFEM, Nepali Women and Foreign Labour Migration \u2013 Summary, p. 5, June 2006. 25 Hundi refers to financial instruments evolved on the Indian sub- continent and used in trade and credit transactions as remittance instruments for transferring funds from one place to another.

As part of the informal system, hundis have no legal status. 26 National Rastra Bank, 2006 Household Budget Survey 4, 2005; available at www. red.nrb.org.np/publications. 27 NIDS, Nepal Migration Year Book, 2008. 28 Foreign Exchange rate for Nepalese rupee: US$1 = 75.5 NPR. 29 NIDS, Nepal Migration Year Book 2006. billion for 2006, approximately twice what was reported by the DLEP. The UNDP Human Development Report 2009 estimates inward remittances for 2007 at US$1.73 million, with average remittances per person US$61 A National Living Standards Survey conducted in 2004 shows that the poorest people benefit from the indirect spin-off effects of remittances. The number of rural households receiving remittances has increased from 23.4 percent in 1995-1996 to 31.9 percent in 2003- 2004.30 For example, in villages receiving substantial remittances, jobs are created and labour shortages provide opportunities for poorer people. Often, wage rates also increase. Employment opportunities are also created in towns, cities, and road heads.31 Remittances are invested in housing, industries, and services; and this economic development contributes positively to the internal movement and employment of the poor. HIV/AIDS Situation According to 2007 national estimates, approximately 70,000 adults and children in Nepal are estimated to be infected with HIV, most of whom are unaware of their infection.

However, both the NACC and the NAC have been ineffective, in part because of civil strife. The National Centre for AIDS and STD Control (NCASC) was established in 1993 under the Ministry of Health and Population and designated as the main government agency responsible for AIDS and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention. In 2007 a semi-autonomous body, HIV/AIDS and STI Control Board, was set up to improve multisectoral engagement, decentralization, donor coordination, and resource channelling to support the multisectoral responses of the NCASC. A National Policy on AIDS and STD Control, formulated in 1995, focuses mainly on multisectoral involvement, decentralized implementation, and partnerships between the public and private sectors. It underlines the promotion of safe sexual behaviour, counselling, confidentiality, and screening of blood for transfusion without any discrimination in terms of age, sex, or infection. NCASC developed a National Strategy on HIV/AIDS which was subsequently translated into the five year National HIV/AIDS Operational Plan for 2003-07. Currently, HIV/AIDS activities are programmed by the second National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan 2006\u20132011, and implementation has been coordinated under the 2006\u20132008 National HIV/AIDS Action Plan (NAP), which has the following objectives: \u2022\ufffd Prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections and HIV infection among at-risk groups. \u2022\ufffd Ensure universal access to quality treatment, diagnostics, care, and support services for infected, affected, and vulnerable groups. \u2022\ufffd Ensure a comprehensive and well-implemented legal framework on HIV/AIDS promoting human rights and establishing HIV/AIDS as a development agenda. \u2022\ufffd Enhance leadership and management at national and local levels for an effective response to HIV/ AIDS. \u2022\ufffd Use strategic information to guide planning and implementation for an improved effective response. \u2022\ufffd Achieve sustainable financing and effectively utilize funds. The second National Action Plan, for 2008-2011, was formulated in continuation of the framework developed under the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan 2006-2011. The NAP 2008-2011 is expected to serve as a blueprint for articulating the necessary actions to achieve universal access to prevention, treatment, care, and support.34 NCASC has developed National Guidelines for Voluntary HIV/AIDS Counselling and Testing (VCT) and Anti- Retroviral Therapy (ART). These Guidelines lay out the ground rules for HIV testing and ARV therapy until the proposed HIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment, and Rights Protection Bill 2007 comes into effect. HIV prevention and treatment services in Nepal include voluntary counselling and testing, anti-retroviral therapy, and the prevention of mother- to-child transmission (PMTCT). VCT services are available at 23 sites, 3 offered by the government and 20 sites operated by NGOs. Services target high-risk groups, and include youth-friendly services and sexual and reproductive health services and information, in addition to treatment for those infected. By 2006 there were an estimated 83 VCT sites in the country; PMTCT is a national programme launched in three government hospital sites; ART programming is available in government hospitals and clinics. According to the 2010 report of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS), while an estimated 16, 000 adults and 950 children in Nepal are in need of ART, 19.03 percent of this total (3,048 adults and 178 children) are accessing ART from 23 ART sites throughout the country. Nepal\u2019s National Policy on HIV/AIDS in the Workplace 2007 serves as a platform to advocate for the rights of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the workplace. The policy follows the guidelines set out in the ILO code for addressing discrimination, gender equality, a healthy work environment, and encouragement of social interaction. The policy states that HIV tests are not to be conducted for the purpose of separation from work or employment. Confidentiality of PLHIV is to be 34 National HIV and AIDS Action Plan 2008-2011. 103 respected, and PLHIV are to be allowed to continue to work as long as they can perform as required.

Migration and HIV/AIDS According to the UNAIDS 2006 report, 46 percent of HIV cases in Nepal are among seasonal labour migrants, 19 percent among clients of sex workers, and 20.2 percent among wives or partners of HIV-positive men. According to the 2007 UNGASS Nepal report, a study conducted in 2006 among Nepali migrants travelling to Indian cities for work, 27 percent of migrant men engaged in high-risk sexual behaviours while in India. Another study indicated that 22-38 percent of young Nepalese women trafficked to India and returning to Nepal were HIV positive.35 National estimates for 2008 also confirm that the highest burden of HIV is among labour migrants (38.8 percent), and indicates that 1.8 percent of the HIV cases (798) were among returned trafficking victims.36 A 2008 IBBS study conducted among male labour migrants to India, measured an HIV prevalence of 1.4 percent in the Western regions of Nepal and 0.8 percent in the Mid to Far-Western regions of Nepal. The study found that sex with FSWs is present among labour migrants and while awareness of HIV/AIDS was high, proper knowledge about HIV/AIDS transmission was low and the level of exposure of labour migrants to HIV/AIDS/ 35 Jay Silverman, Assessing the Public Health Consequences of Sex Trafficking in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, Harvard School of Public Health, 2007. 36 National HIV and AIDS Action Plan 2008-2011. STI programs was also low.37 Recent data also shows that approximately 20 percent of migrants engaged in unprotected sex in India. This group now accounts for 40 percent of all HIV infections in Nepal, with numbers of HIV cases also increasing among wives and partners.38 Research shows that migrant workers engage in risky sexual behaviour because of peer pressure, work stress, and homesickness. Although HIV/AIDS awareness is currently included in the pre-departure orientation curriculum, ill-informed trainers with little knowledge of HIV or AIDS can make the programmes ineffective in empowering migrants to protect themselves from HIV during their time abroad. Mandatory Testing Mandatory testing for HIV is prohibited in Nepal, with the exception of recruitment for both the army and police. However, most host countries demand medically fit migrants and require that potential employees undergo mandatory testing prior to departure. Migrant workers also undergo medical tests once they reach their destination countries. The Gulf Approved Medical Centre Association has five medical centres in Kathmandu and conducts medical testing for migrant workers who wish to go to the Gulf countries. Although VCT guidelines state informed consent prior to an HIV test is required, migrant workers reveal that consent is rarely requested. The recent HIV and AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Rights Protection Bill (2007) assigns the government responsibility for providing migrant workers with correct information about HIV and AIDS before and after migration. Nepal\u2019s Labour Migration Policy has a provision for including HIV/AIDS awareness and STI prevention and control measures in mandatory pre-departure training. Whether conducted by the government or private companies, the quality of this training is an issue and one of the weaknesses of current policy implementation. Recruitment agencies encourage migrant workers to contact them rather than middlemen, who make them pay more for foreign employment assistance. These agencies claim to provide pre-departure orientation to 37 NCASC, \u201cIBBS Survey among Male Labor Migrants in 11 Districts in Western and Mid to Far-Western Regions of Nepal Round II, June- September 2008\u201d. 38 UNGASS, Country Progress Report, Nepal, 2010. NEPAL 104 migrant workers as stated in the law and appear to be sensitive to HIV/AIDS issues. Those licensed to conduct medical tests for migrant workers say they provide pre-test and post-test counselling. Many recruiting agencies report visiting workers at their work place to ensure they are receiving fair treatment. The accuracy of these statements of compliance needs to be verified and confirmed. Some agencies also have offices in destination countries that workers can contact in the event of difficulties. Policies, Legislation, and International Conventions International Conventions Although Nepal has provisions in its Labour Migration Policy 2006 that are congruent with the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, Nepal has not yet ratified this convention. Nepal has also not ratified the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons.

Regional and Bilateral Agreements The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) adopted the Regional Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking of Women and Children for Prostitution on January 6, 2002. All seven SAARC states, including Nepal, have signed and ratified this convention. Although Nepal is a signatory to regional and international anti-trafficking conventions, it has yet to initiate bilateral discussions with India, which is also a signatory of these conventions. Follow-up on the implementation of the conventions is pending. Nepal has signed Memoranda of Understanding with the governments of Qatar, UAE, and Republic of Korea that include labour agreements (see Table 4).39 National Policies and Legislation Foreign Employment Act 2064 (2007) The objectives of the new Foreign Employment Act 2064 (2007), which replaced the Foreign Employment Act 2042 (1985), are to ensure the safety of overseas employment, manage the migration process, and protect the rights and welfare of migrant workers. This new legislation also has provisions to eliminate gender discrimination in contrast to the previous law, which banned Nepali women from working in the Gulf States unless in the organized sector. In Nepal, pre-departure orientation programs are mandatory for all outgoing migrants. Labor Migration Policy 2063 (2006) This policy is aimed at developing a joint perspective and strategy to control human trafficking and preserve and protect the rights of Nepalese migrants in cooperation with destination countries, SAARC member states, 39 NIDS, Migration Year Book, 2007. 105 and other countries in Asia. It provides for effective supervision and management at international borders and points of departure in order to control human trafficking and informal migration. The policy also enables the Nepalese labour sector to organize and streamline its plans according to the basic guidelines provided by the ILO. The Human Trafficking (Control) Act (2008) The Human Trafficking (Control) Act passed in July 2008 significantly strengthens measures against trafficking by broadening the definition of trafficking, increasing penalties, enhancing victim protection, and defining child victims as persons up to the age of 18. It also places the burden of proof of innocence on the accused. It is too soon to assess the impact of the new act. Key Stakeholders Government Agencies and Networks The National Centre for AIDS and STD Control, was established in 1993 and sits under the Ministry of Health. It has been the main government agency responsible for AIDS and STI prevention. The HIV/AIDS and STD Control Development Board, also sitting within the Ministry of Health, was established in 2007 as the national AIDS coordinating authority, improving multi-sectoral engagement, decentralization, donor coordination and resource channelling. The ILO is closely involved in the institutional capacity building of the Ministry of Labour and Transport Management to improve effective labour migration management in Nepal.

With 176 million people, Pakistan is the seventh most populous country in the world. Although poverty levels have decreased since 2001,1 Pakistan suff ers from decades of internal political disputes, low levels of foreign investment, and declining exports. Between 2004 and 2007, as a result of political and economic instability, the Pakistani rupee depreciated signifi cantly.2 Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the 6-8 percent range was spurred by gains in the industrial and service sectors, despite severe electricity shortfalls.3 Pakistan has a labour force of 51.78 million, of which an estimated 2.69 million (5.2 percent) are unemployed.4 Migration Patterns Due to limited resources, poverty, and high unemployment, migration is considered the road to prosperity by many Pakistanis. According to the Pakistan Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, 4.2 million Pakistani workers have registered for overseas employment since 1971, travelling to more than 50 countries. In 2007, 287,033 migrants left Pakistan through formal channels, and in 2008 this number rose to 431,842, as a result of active steps taken by the government to export manpower. 1 US State Department, The World Factbook 2009 ; available at www.cia.gov/library/ publications/the-world-factbook. 2 Pakistani rupees (PKR) per US dollar (US$)= 70.64 (2008 est.), 60.63 (2007), 60.35 (2006), 59.52 (2005), 58.26 (2004). 3 GDP (Purchasing Power Parity) estimate for 2008 is US$427.3 billion. 4 Labour Force Survey 2007-2008, Pakistan. 113 According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report 2009, Pakistan has an emigration rate of 2.2 percent, and within Pakistan there are over 3.5 million migrants, representing 2.1 percent of the total population.5 Pakistanis go abroad for employment through licensed recruiting agents or through informal channels. It is diffi cult to assess the actual fl ow of migrants from Pakistan due to the large number of undocumented migrant workers leaving the country through informal channels, but it is estimated that 3.5-4.0 million manage to migrate without authorization each year.6 Many Pakistani migrants are male agricultural workers from rural areas, where educational levels are lower than the national average of seven years. Migration patterns in Pakistan, similar to most labour-sending countries, are characterized by a two-step process: fi rst rural to urban mobility and then urban to overseas migration.7 The Government of Pakistan encourages overseas employment, and has licensed Overseas Employment Promoters (OEP) to identify demand for Pakistani workers abroad according to the instructions of foreign employers. Although it is a criminal off ence for recruitment agents to work without a valid license, there are many unauthorized recruitment agencies assisting workers to migrate. In addition, Pakistanis seek overseas employment through social networks that the migrants themselves have facilitated during their travel overseas, relying on the assistance of friends, relatives, and fellow tribesmen. Once employed, migrants may register directly with a regional offi ce or bureau of the Protector of Emigrants and would be included in the national statistics. However, the majority of migrants travel on visitor visas and work without proper documentation, remaining irregular migrants in the host countries until they are discovered and deported. Many receiving countries have passed stringent laws and deport large numbers of undocumented Pakistanis each day for illegal border crossing and overstaying visas. In addition, documented migrants who test positive for HIV in the semi-annual HIV testing conducted in many destination countries are deported, often without any information on the reason for this action. 5 UNDP, Human Development Report 2009, Country Fact Sheet, Pakistan. 6 Sattar Adnan, \u201cMigration Traffi cking Nexus: The Case of Pakistan,\u201d April 2008. 7 UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, \u201cHIV Vulnerabilities of Migrant Women: from Asia to the Arab States,\u201d 2009.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c947da7-ba1c-4a70-9cb6-98924d268cd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c947da7-ba1c-4a70-9cb6-98924d268cd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ddcfd8a4675cbb05e891d718d62216f58e4ab24359f60326d99f7eb4f4842a87"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7e8dc86-bebd-485d-98e7-a86ac1ee75db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96c2a62507dcac9b123d97e5a9b7bda33e13fae04a48d78b1575197304fb08d1"}}, "hash": "c0daed5b079aba8eba773a99e74d493cb3a640df5415067ee99624ef75a6b7ec", "text": "Occupational Profi le of Migrants Pakistan provides migrant workers to more than 50 countries in more than 40 occupations, classifi ed by the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment (BEOE) into four categories: professional, skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled.8 Doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, and managers are considered professional workers.

Gender and Migration The majority of mobile workers from Pakistan are working-class men who travel alone internally and internationally, leaving their wives and children behind. Rural-urban mobility in Pakistan is almost invariably male. There is very little data on the migration fl ows of Pakistani women; offi cial statistics on the number of Pakistani women employed abroad indicate very small numbers compared to male migrants. According to the BEOE, of the more than 700,000 Pakistanis migrating overseas during the last fi ve years, only 1,200 were women.9 Only artists and qualifi ed professional women are reportedly going abroad to work. Women younger than 35-years of age cannot legally seek employment abroad as domestic workers. There is, however, no age limit for women working in other professional positions, such as teachers, doctors, and nurses. For both groups, the terms and conditions of service are prescribed in the standard Foreign Service Agreement and are the same as for their male counterparts. Within Pakistan, labour market indicators highlight the gender gap. Women continue to be underutilized 9 UNDP , \u201cHIV Vulnerabilities of Women Migrants,\u201d 2009. in the economy, and this is refl ected in their overall participation in the labour market and representation in the economic sector and status groups. This correlates with the review of human resource development in Pakistan, which identifi ed a huge gender gap and low educational attainment of the labour force.10 The low status of women, characterized by lower levels of education and lack of opportunities for skill development, is directly linked to their lower level of participation in the labour force, both at home and abroad. Restrictions on their mobility limit their opportunities, as the departure of women is seen as a concern for the stability of the family and the welfare of children left behind. Human Traffi cking Pakistan is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children traffi cked for the purposes of forced labour and sexual exploitation.11 In the Middle East in particular, women and young girls are traffi cked for sexual exploitation, bonded labour, and domestic work.

Agency nor the provincial governments provide evidence of criminal prosecutions, convictions, or punishments for perpetrators of human trafficking. The country\u2019s largest internal human trafficking problem is that of bonded labour, which is concentrated in Sindh and Punjab provinces, particularly work in brick kilns, carpet-making, agriculture, fishing, mining, leather tanning, and production of glass bangles. Women are also trafficked within the country for forced marriages and are traded between tribal groups to settle disputes or as payment. Parents sell their daughters into domestic servitude or prostitution in order to pay debts. Estimates of Pakistani victims of bonded labour \u2013 including men, women, and children \u2013 vary widely, but the number is likely over one million. LHRLA indicates significant trafficking from Punjab Province. Similarly, the data available from BEOE reports the highest percentage of migrant labour from Punjab.

PAKISTAN 116 fraudulent job offers and high fees during recruitment, some migrants find themselves in conditions of involuntary servitude or debt bondage once abroad, subjected to restrictions on movement, non-payment of wages, threats, and physical or sexual abuse. The links between migration and human trafficking in Pakistan are apparent, but have not been scientifically established with an evidence base of relevant data/ statistics. There are many anecdotal accounts of maltreatment of migrant workers, primarily men, in the work place, such as poor working conditions, reductions in the wages promised at the time of recruitment, and lack of proper medical, nutritional, and recreational facilities. Data on the migration of girls and women from Pakistan is limited, but trafficking is evident. The government ban on women below 35-years of age seeking employment abroad as domestic maids has driven female migration underground, and has thereby increased the likelihood of unsafe, undocumented migration of women and their vulnerability to trafficking. Source, Transit, and Destination Source Pakistan is comprised of four provinces: Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan, and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). People from all provinces migrate for employment abroad, but the distribution is not uniform across them. As shown in Table 3, an estimated 52 percent of Pakistani migrant workers are from the Punjab province, while 25 percent come from the NWFP, 9.4 percent come from Sindh, and only 1.3 percent from Balochistan. In addition, the figure is 5.4 percent from the Tribal and Northern Areas, and 6.5 percent from Kashmir (Azad Jammu and Kashmir). Government figures for the period 2001\u20132006 also indicate that more than 60 percent of Pakistanis in the Middle East migrated from only 20 districts, with heavy concentration in North Punjab, NWFP, only Karachi in Sindh, and a few of the districts in Southern Punjab.

A regional recap of the number of Pakistani workers employed overseas from 1971 to 2007 is provided in the Table 4. Statistics show that about 96 percent of all Pakistani migrant labourers work in the Gulf States of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar. A staggering 2.2 million migrant workers from Pakistan are legally working in Saudi Arabia, with another 1.1 million in the UAE. In addition to the Gulf, significant destinations for Pakistani workers are Malaysia and Republic of Korea as well as countries in East Asia, the European Union, and North America. Remittances Remittances sent by Pakistanis working abroad constitute the country\u2019s largest single source of foreign exchange earnings, and are a major source of income to bridge huge trade deficits. For example, total migrant worker remittance was US$3.87 billion for the year 2003-2004, equivalent to 4.46 percent of Gross National Product (GNP).13 Remittances for fiscal year (July 1-June 30) 2007-2008 increased to US$6.45 billion from US$5.49 billion the previous fiscal year. According to the Human Development Report 2009, inward remittances to 13 State Bank of Pakistan website, www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/ index2.asp#monetary. 117 Pakistan in 2007 were nearly US$6 billion, with average remittances per person of US$37. The remittances through hundi are not documented by the State Bank of Pakistan.14 Hundi costs less than transfers through normal banking channels and may be faster in some instances. In general, Pakistani migrant workers prefer to send their savings through informal channels rather than the banking system. As a result, actual remittances are substantially higher than what is reported by the Banks. HIV/AIDS Situation The first HIV-positive Pakistani was identified in 1987. 14 Hundi refers to financial instruments evolved on the Indian sub- continent and used in trade and credit transactions as remittance instruments for transferring funds from one place to another. Technically, hundi are unconditional, written payment orders, most often used as equivalents to cheques and normally regarded as bills of exchange. As part of the informal system, hundis have no legal status. According to UNAIDS estimates, about 96,000 people were living with HIV in Pakistan at the end of 2007, about 0.1 percent of the adult population.15 Official statistics show much lower figures than these estimates; the National AIDS Programme\u2019s latest figures show over 4,000 HIV cases reported so far. Until recently, Pakistan was classified as a low-prevalence country, though with many risk factors that could lead to the fast development of an epidemic. Recent evidence indicates that the situation is changing rapidly, shifting to a concentrated epidemic. At present, the overall seroprevalence of HIV among injecting drug users (IDU) is 15.8 percent, and among male sex workers (MSW) it is 1.5-1.8 percent.16 The HIV epidemic in Pakistan is presently concentrated among IDUs, reaching up to 51 percent in certain urban areas.

National Response to HIV/AIDS Pakistan\u2019s response to HIV and AIDS began in 1987, soon after the first case of AIDS was reported and when the Ministry of Health established a Federal Committee on AIDS (FCA). The National AIDS Control Program (NACP) was created in 1990. Although the initial emphasis of the program was diagnosis of cases that came to hospitals, gradually it shifted focus toward communities. The main objectives of NACP are prevention of HIV transmission, safe blood transfusions, reduction of sexually transmitted diseases, establishment of surveillance, training of health staff, research and behavioural studies, program management, and capacity development. The Enhanced Program 2003-2008 is funded by the World Bank and the Government of Pakistan and was started in late 2005. Four of the five HIV Care and Treatment Centres \u2013 those in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar \u2013 are operational and providing HIV care services. At the time of writing the fifth centre, in Quetta, was finalizing procurement of necessary medications. The HIV Care and Treatment Centres provide various services, such as: medical care, pre-test and post-test counselling services; radiological support; pharmacy; nutritional counselling; laboratory services (including HIV ELISA screening, CD 4, and HIV viral load PCR testing) and general laboratory diagnostics, with specialized tests sent out to the reference laboratory in the National Institute of Health in Islamabad; and referral to specialist services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7923f8e-1bdc-4563-8466-ce913f234b66": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7923f8e-1bdc-4563-8466-ce913f234b66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6e67b47100b67f081e2a6f163890ad7fc45fc4a2e94bfd734d604684fc7500b"}, "2": {"node_id": "45680536-0bf4-4280-83e1-388819ac6950", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0385e4ce46b71d8e84d5c677af99c4bbb9b18a3af3f77990725e5879c10c2ef"}}, "hash": "75cf5867898727b734bd29d99362f2af6e9ef14f2fc3435aefa3f27eec98fee7", "text": "Medical care includes HIV/ AIDS anti-retroviral treatment and the management of opportunistic infections.

The new framework provides a monitoring and evaluation component for measuring progress in the priority areas and for evaluating the impact of HIV and AIDS programs. The Government of Pakistan, with support from the World Bank, launched a response in the form of the Enhanced HIV and AIDS Control Programme, under implementation since 2003. The government has finalized costed action plans for the next phase of the federal and provincial programmes covering the period 2009-2013. A draft national AIDS Policy and HIV and AIDS Law, both recommending formation of a National AIDS Council, have been prepared by the National AIDS Control Programme. Migration and HIV/AIDS Migrant workers are among the groups considered vulnerable to HIV, as specified in the National HIV and AIDS Strategic Framework (2001-2006), as a direct result of male Pakistani migrant workers deported from the Gulf States after being found HIV positive.18 Migrant workers continue to be included among the high- risk, most-at risk, bridge, and vulnerable populations under the NSF-II, which indicates greater commitment for expanded response and scaling-up of programme delivery.19 Mandatory Testing All registered migrant workers, especially those going to the Arab States, undergo mandatory HIV testing. Pre- test and post-test counselling is generally not provided. In the case of seafarers, medical testing by port health officers under the Merchant Shipping (Medical Examination) Regulation 2002 is required. Pakistani migrant workers are tested periodically for HIV, usually without their informed consent; and those testing positive are deported to Pakistan without referral. Upon completion of their contracts returnees are not required to report to any government department or agency and most return directly to their home towns. No effective mechanism is in place to provide health services to returnees. NACP officials claim that the country lacks a database for recording 18 National HIV & AIDS Strategic Framework, 2007\u20132012, Ministry of Health, Government of Pakistan 19 Ibid. PAKISTAN 120 information about migrants who travel abroad and return home. Although the Federal Investigation Agency is responsible for data collection on health and other issues, there are no available records of migrants deported by foreign countries because of their HIV status. Without proper testing and counselling, returnee migrants pose a significant risk to their spouses and family, as evidenced by increased HIV among migrant spouses. A significant number of HIV-positive cases are found among low-skilled Pakistani workers deported from the Gulf States. In the period 1996 to 1998, 58 returned migrant workers with HIV represented 61-86 percent of all reported cases. During that same period, 5 wives of returning workers were identified with HIV.20 Many migrant workers undergo job-related testing, both prior to departure for the destination and often periodically during their stay. The general population, however, is not tested. Thus, findings that HIV prevalence among returning migrants and their spouses is higher than among the general population is a misinterpretation of the available data. Pre-departure Orientation Migrants rarely have accurate prior knowledge of their destination country. While the information on HIV/ AIDS and its prevention is also part of the BEOE briefing for migrating workers, the draft National Migration Policy (2008) stresses that these briefings need to be extended and elaborated to cover migrant worker health \u2013 especially with regard to communicable and non-communicable diseases, reproductive health, HIV/ AIDS, occupational safety and health, and, if possible, access to services for prevention and treatment of health concerns. With a budget of PKR52 million (US$736,120) to train staff from various institutions, NACP launched a media campaign in 2006 on HIV prevention, awareness, and counselling for those who travel to foreign countries.

The memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Malaysia covers recruitment of semi-skilled and unskilled Pakistani workers for a large number of new job opportunities in Malaysia. Similarly, the MoU signed with Republic of Korea will send workers to Republic of Korea on a regular basis. The first group of workers left for Republic of Korea in April 2008. In May 2009 two agreements were signed with Libya: a MoU on Employment and one on Human Resource Development.22 National Policies and Legislation The legal framework that safeguards the rights of overseas workers and regulates the activities of overseas employment promoters and recruiting agents is contained in the Emigration Ordinance (1997) and the Emigration Rules (1997). The Government of Pakistan, through the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, encourages migration to foreign countries. The BEOE is the central organization for regulating labour emigration from Pakistan, and administratively is under the Ministry of Labour, Manpower, and Overseas Pakistanis (MLMOP). Its mandate has two main goals: to reduce unemployment within the country, and to earn foreign exchange through salary remittances from abroad. Overseas employment is regulated under Section 8 of the Emigration Ordinance, which grants vast powers to the Director General of the BEOE, the Protector of Emigrants, and the Community Welfare Attach\u00e9(CWA)/Labour Attach\u00e9, all of whom deal with matters pertaining to the overseas employment of Pakistani workers. The MLMOP licenses Overseas Employment Promoters (OEP) to find jobs for Pakistanis according to the requirements of foreign employers. There are about 2,200 OEPs in Pakistan. Each licensed OEP is required to obtain permission from the Protector of Emigrants prior to negotiating overseas employment for a Pakistani citizen. The Emigration Ordinance also regulates the activities of OEPs through licensing and recruitment procedures, and makes provisions for protection of workers against malpractices and for redress of workers\u2019 grievances. The BEOE, with seven regional offices, functions through the Protector of Emigrants. The Protector of Emigrants supervises the activities of overseas employment 22 Report on steps taken by the government to curtail unemployment in the country, accessed through the MLMOP, Labour and Manpower Division, 2009. promoters; processes their requests for workers; inspects their offices; and receives such reports as may be required by the BEOE Director General. The Community Welfare Attach\u00e9, the equivalent of the Labour Attach\u00e9 in other countries, is responsible for the promotion of overseas employment of Pakistani workers and for their welfare while abroad. At present, Pakistan has CWAs stationed in Bahrain, Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and the United Kingdom. According to Emigration Rule 27, all workers recruited for employment abroad are required to appear at the Protector of Emigrant\u2019s office prior to departure for orientation and briefing along with the overseas employment promoter or his authorized representative. During this visit they are briefed about the laws of the host country, the terms and conditions of their contract, and their rights and obligations while they remain employed abroad. According to the law, no one can leave Pakistan for overseas employment on an employment visa unless they are registered in the office of Protector of Emigrants and have a certificate of registration stamped on their passport. The Compulsory Insurance Scheme for Emigrants has been in place since 1982 and is renewable every two years up to the age of 58. The compensation amount increased from PKR 200,000 (US$2,831) to PKR300,000 (US$4,247) on January 1, 2001.23 Pakistan established the National Alien Registration Authority (NARA) under the Alien Registration Order (2001) with the primary functions of issuing work permits to those seeking employment or the operation of a business in Pakistan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82867489-d466-4d62-a1bc-8a8b30f6d6e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "82867489-d466-4d62-a1bc-8a8b30f6d6e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b28274a7f1717a2e7aed5e905952e4fa6bfbd9ef45922a514aa5f8f0abf640c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac9b5796-9ea7-412d-b6d3-cd547b8f9296", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8e19067cf5e52e7d75f6ae2fb7503db42ec427aa896192f9acd5fbde258beda"}}, "hash": "973d71e3b3e018c03fc3ea0f12646024a65fa2100d521fe900ba649479506911", "text": "NARA immediately registers all foreigners in Pakistan who prior to July 10, 2000, were not authorized to stay in the country.

At the time of this writing the NMP had not yet been finalized and approved. In addition, the National Migration Management Policy of the Ministry of Interior, a control and enforcement mechanism, focuses on regular migration, preventing irregular migration (trafficking 23 2008 Exchange Rate US Dollar (US$) and Pakistani Rupees (PKR) US$1: PKR 70.64. PAKISTAN 122 and smuggling), border control management, handling of deportees, and passenger information. The Human Trafficking Ordinance 2002 is a comprehensive law designed to meet Pakistan\u2019s obligations under various international treaties on trafficking of persons, including relevant provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, as well as other treaties to which Pakistan may become party in the future, such as the Protocol to Prevent, Supplementing the International Convention Against Transnational Organized Crimes. The ordinance defines human trafficking as: Obtaining, securing, selling, purchasing, recruiting, detaining, harbouring or receiving a person, notwithstanding his/her implicit or explicit consent, by the use of coercion, kidnapping, abduction, or by giving or receiving any payment or benefit, or sharing or receiving a share for such persons\u2019 subsequent transportation out of or into Pakistan by any means whatsoever for any of the purposes. Any offence related to human trafficking invites a rigorous punishment of 7 years imprisonment along with a fine. If trafficking involves women and children, punishment is 10 years with a fine. The Court is authorized to utilize this fine to compensate the victims. The government uses Sections 17 through 23 of the Emigration Ordinance to prosecute external cases of trafficking. In addition, the Bonded Labour System Abolition Act 1992 prohibits bonded labour, with prescribed penalties ranging from imprisonment for 2 to 5 years or a fine, or both. The Pakistan National Action Plan for Combating Human Trafficking (NAPCHT) was adopted in 2006; and aspects dealing specifically with trafficking of children are also addressed in the National Action Plan for Children. Key Stakeholders Government Agencies and Networks Federal Investigation Agency is a law enforcement agency that combats human trafficking, illegal migration, and other related crimes. Ministry of Interior confirms illegal immigrants deported by host countries and brings them back to Pakistan. The ministry is currently in the initial stages of developing a policy on migration-related issues and also on health issues, especially for HIV/AIDS. Ministry of Labour, Manpower, and Overseas Pakistanis deals with workers who are migrating to foreign countries for employment and issues licenses to recruiting agents or overseas employment promoters. The ministry, in collaboration with the ILO and UNDP, initiated the development of a Labour Market Information and Analysis (LMIA) system, which became operational in the second half of 2006. The LMIA system aims to provide timely information and analysis of labour markets as input into the formulation and monitoring of labour and employment policies. Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment and its seven regional offices, known as the Protector of Emigration, are the main government agencies responsible for safeguarding the interests of migrant workers from Pakistan. Protector of Emigrants offices process and register all manpower demands from overseas through licensed oversees employment promoters. Orientation and Briefing Centres provide pre-departure orientation and training to potential emigrants. Labour/Community Welfare Attach\u00e9s in nine countries promote overseas employment opportunities and safeguard the interests of Pakistani migrants. Gulf Co-operation Council Approved Medical Centres\u2019 Association (GAMCA) Centres provide medical testing prior to departure for Pakistanis migrating to GCC states. National Vocational and Technical Education commission (NAVTEC) is primarily a regulatory and coordinating body for skills development and establishment of national skill standards, certification, and accreditation procedures established by the Prime Ministers\u2019 office in 2006 to strengthen, standardize, and streamline vocational and technical education. NAVTEC recently released a draft text titled Skilling Pakistan: A Vision for the National Skills Strategy, 2008\u20132012.

PAKISTAN 124 Recommendations The following recommendations are made within the context of the foregoing analysis of Pakistan\u2019s migration patterns and policies and HIV situation. In order to reduce the HIV vulnerability of current and future migrant and mobile populations it will be necessary to take action in a range of key areas, as detailed below. 1. Ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Family and the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Traffi cking in Persons. 2. Undertake a more comprehensive approach to international migration management, including gathering statistics and data with a focus on temporary and irregular migration, gender disaggregation of information, and in-depth qualitative data on the linkages among gender, migration, human traffi cking, and HIV/sexually- transmitted infections. Better coordination among the various agencies responsible for collating, publishing, and disseminating data on HIV and migration in Pakistan is required. 3. Finalize the National Migration Policy and approve the National AIDS Policy and HIV and AIDS Law presented to the National Cabinet and Parliament. Ensure both policies refl ect a gender sensitive, rights-based, and multisectoral approach, integrating issues of migration, HIV and AIDS, and establishing the nexus between migration and human traffi cking. 4. Ensure comprehensive, migrant-friendly voluntary HIV testing that protects the rights of migrants in a process governed by best practices: informed consent, confi dentiality, and pre-test and post-test counselling. Migrant-friendly voluntary HIV testing needs to be included in current and future bilateral agreements with labour-receiving countries to protect migrants from mandatory testing and deportation in cases of HIV-positive status. 5. Strengthen the education system by upgrading curriculum and skills training and expanding access to include more women and girls, in order to maximize the quality of the labour force and address gender-based vulnerability factors at the grassroots level in those areas prone to high migration and human traffi cking, 6. Integrate basic information on migrant rights and HIV vulnerabilities in pre-departure briefi ngs conducted by emigration sub-offi ces, with special programmes for female migrants. 7. Make provisions for a fast, convenient, and formal alternative system that enables overseas Pakistanis to transfer remittances and funds to Pakistan safely, securely, and at an attractive market exchange rate, and discourage the use of the hundi system. 125 Bibliography \u2013 Pakistan Adnan, Sattar (2008).

With 21 million people and a labour force of 7.6 million, Sri Lanka had an estimated poverty rate of 23 percent as at 2008.1 The 25-year civil confl ict between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka has been a serious impediment to economic activities. Despite a brutal civil war that began in 1983, Sri Lanka saw gross domestic product grow at an average rate of 4.5 percent annually over the last 10 years, with the exception of a recession in 2001. In late December 2004 a major tsunami claimed about 31,000 lives; left more than 6,300 people missing and 443,000 displaced; and destroyed an estimated US$1.5 billion in property. Government spending on development and fi ghting the LTTE drove GDP growth to about 7 percent in 2006-2007, before slowing in 2008 due to the global recession. At the same time, government spending and high oil and commodity prices raised infl ation to almost 15 percent.2 Migration Patterns Both international migration and internal mobility occur in response to economic hardships in rural and urban areas in Sri Lanka. According to the UNDP Human Development Report 2009, Sri Lanka has an annual emigration rate of 4.7 percent, or approximately 350,000 emigrants.3 Of these, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment 1 US State Department, The World Factbook, 2009; available at cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ce.html. 2 Ibid. 3 UNDP, Human Development Report 2009, Country Fact Sheet, Sri Lanka. 129 (SLBFE) reported that an estimated 252,000 Sri Lankans went abroad to work, most to the Gulf States. Almost half of this total were female. Over 70 percent of migrants employed abroad through SLBFE were housemaids or unskilled labourers, with the number of migrants in both job categories increasing signifi cantly in 2008. Overall, foreign employment placements during 2008 increased almost 15 percent over the 217,306 migrant workers reported by SLBFE in 2007. There were 626 licensed recruitment agencies operating in Sri Lanka at the end of 2008. To encourage agencies to register with the SLBFE, the Sri Lanka Government instituted a national award scheme for employment agencies, based on performance and adherence to regulations. According to the most recent statistics, the use of recruiting agents licensed by the SLBFE declined from 75 percent in 2003 to 64 percent in 2008.4 Diffi culties in monitoring the activities of recruitment agencies and reports of high fees are thought to have contributed to the decline in the use of recruiting agents in general, as well as those licensed by the SLBFE. For example, the SLBFE reported in June 2008 that Sri Lankan men migrating to Gulf oil-exporter nations were expected to pay a minimum Rs 60,000 (US$550) in fees to recruiters; the SLBFE charges each migrant only Rs 7,700 (US$70.60). 4 Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment reports.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "133bc5da-44eb-4043-abfe-37414dfcd1bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "133bc5da-44eb-4043-abfe-37414dfcd1bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52eefb17ceab3b8383e00a5e4bbb5e44bd9928d087d09271aedf002f8ddcd973"}, "2": {"node_id": "fbc402ef-ae7b-46e4-bacd-a6d81d85744d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcfe2653d11964ea72e66d58a9e6192451a4061fea3a533935b35a289faab132"}}, "hash": "e51ec4062b35f110e67decc44fbb1e8cf5a2926fc2e1f17a461104e734d7317b", "text": "4 Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment reports.

SRI LANKA 130 Documented workers most often assume positions in health, information technology, tourism, and construction industries. Professional positions held by Sri Lankan migrants in the health sector include doctors, surgeons, psychiatrists, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, pathologists, and radiographers. The information technology sector employs software engineers, data processors, systems engineers, and analysts. In the tourism sector, skilled and semi-skilled jobs include accountants, surveyors, administrators, chefs, hair dressers, cashiers, receptionists, and security offi cers, among others. In the construction sector, skilled workers fi nd jobs as masons, painters, carpenters, plumbers, and metal workers. The number of unskilled workers migrating is much higher than the skilled and professional categories. In 2008, 59,400 departing migrants were classifi ed as unskilled, while 2,800 were classifi ed as professionals. Undocumented workers include migrants who enter destination countries without proper documents and those who may have entered as documented, but their status was subsequently changed, their visa expired, their contract fi nished, or they were dismissed from their work. There is also a growing tendency for Sri Lankan students to migrate to Western countries for educational purposes and then later obtain employment and residency in these countries. There are huge data gaps on these individuals since there is no single authority that records the fl ow of undocumented Sri Lankans living in foreign countries.7 Gender and Migration The collapse of the rural agricultural economy and increasing levels of economic hardship and poverty, compounded by years of confl ict, have all led to increased migration of Sri Lankan women. Sri Lanka has an active policy of promoting emigration of its female citizens for work in the Arab States and affl uent South- East Asian nations, such as Singapore and Malaysia, primarily as domestic workers. Over the past three decades the number of Sri Lanka migrant workers has increased steadily, as has the proportion of women in the emigrant group. More than a million female Sri Lankan citizens are estimated to be earning their livelihood abroad in the Arab States.8 7 IOM, International Migration Outlook. 8 UNDP, \u201cHIV Vulnerabilities of Women Migrants: from Asia to the Arab States,\u201d 2009.

This was due to high demand for skilled and unskilled jobs for males in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and, Jordan, particularly in the construction and manufacturing sectors. At the same time, female migration to Saudi Arabia and Oman decreased, mainly due to inadequate remuneration, but possibly also as a result of increased job opportunities for women in Sri Lanka. By 2008, an estimated 810,500 Sri Lankan women, many from rural areas, were working as low paid domestic helpers in the Arab States and South-East Asia.

Very often children are left behind to be looked after by their father and/or other relatives. These children are often neglected and de-motivated, and many drop out of school, are negatively infl uenced, and/or are abused.10 In recent years, the Sri Lankan Government has sought to increase the migration of skilled workers through training and skill development and to discourage the outfl ow of domestic and unskilled workers. At the same time, to better prepare women for employment overseas, beginning in 2009, female domestic workers receive an 18-day pre-departure English and literacy program. Overall, the government\u2019s goal is to reduce the share of female domestic workers to 25 percent of total Sri Lankan migrants.11 10 IOM, International Migration Outlook. 11 National Labour Migration Policy for Sri Lanka 2008, Ministry for Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare.

Trafficking often flourishes under the pretext of labour migration, eventually changing into forms of forced labour and exploitation. Some migrants in the low-skilled and unskilled categories find themselves in situations of involuntary servitude, restrictions on movement, withholding of passports, threats, physical and/or sexual abuse, and debt bondage.13 The Government of Sri Lanka considers that much of this vulnerability is due to lack of pre-departure education, training, and awareness regarding host country laws and working conditions.14 Children are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and, less frequently, for forced labour in unregulated businesses in the informal sector such as garment factories, construction sites, and domestic service. Under-aged girls are trafficked using forged documents that indicate they are adults. Trafficked children, both boys and girls, often end up in the commercial sex trade, some reportedly providing sexual services to tourists.15 Source, Transit, and Destination Source Since the early 1980s when Sri Lanka opened its economy, migration for overseas employment was 12 US State Department, The World Factbook, 2009 13 US State Department, Trafficking in Persons Report 2009. 14 National Labour Migration Policy for Sri Lanka, 2008. 15 UNDP, \u201cHuman Trafficking and HIV: Exploring vulnerabilities and responses in South Asia,\u201d 2007; and Trafficking in Persons Report, 2009. permitted without restrictions.

Remittances Sri Lanka ranks among the top 20 countries in the world in migrant remittances. International remittances play an important role in the Sri Lankan economy, contributing 7 percent of its GDP, 36 percent of its export earnings, and 36 percent of current receipts in the Balance of Payments. Remittances have become the leading source of foreign capital to Sri Lanka, 133 overtaking official development assistance and foreign direct investment.16 Total foreign remittances in 2008 were US$2.92 billion (LKR316 billion), an increase of 16.6 percent over the previous year. 17 This increase was attributed to an awareness campaign launched by the SLBFE, with the assistance of banks, licensed recruitment agencies, and the media, aimed at increasing the level of foreign remittances from migrant workers.18 According to the UNDP Human Development Report 2009, approximately US$2.53 billion in remittances were sent to Sri Lanka in 2007, for an average of US$131 per person. These remittances help support five million Sri Lankans, roughly a quarter of the total population, making it possible for the government to reduce welfare subsidies to low-income families, which become 16 IMO, International Migration Outlook. 17 Current exchange rate US$:LKR (Lanka Rupee) is 108.29. 18 Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Economic and Financial Statistics. ineligible to receive government welfare transfers once a member of the family migrates.19 Not all migrant remittances are processed through the banking system and official channels. Informal transfer mechanisms are discouraged by the government, and the extent of these money transfers is unknown. Earnings are also repatriated in the form of goods brought home by returning migrants. HIV/AIDS Situation The first case of HIV in Sri Lanka was detected in 1987. As of the end December 2009 the estimated number of people living with HIV was 3000, and a cumulative total of HIV cases, 1,196, had been reported to the National STD and AIDS Control Program (NSACP), the majority of which were in the 25-49 age group.

Many of the infections recorded in 2007 are associated with overseas work.22 Data collected in the first Behavioural Surveillance 20 UNGASS, \u201cCountry Progress Report, Sri Lanka, 2008-09,\u201d 2010 21 Ibid. 22 UNGASS, \u201cCountry Report, Sri Lanka, January 2006-December 2007,\u201d 2008. Survey (October 2006 to March 2007) confirmed relatively high levels of risk behaviour among high-risk groups and vulnerable populations, including migrants. The size of the population at risk is difficult to assess, but there are several factors that may fuel an HIV epidemic in Sri Lanka: low condom use; prolonged civil unrest in the country; poverty and gender inequity; increased casual, unprotected sex; misuse of alcohol and drugs, especially among young adults; and proximity to and mobility from AIDS epicentres, such as Tamil Nadu in South India. National Response to HIV/AIDS In 1992, the Government of Sri Lanka initiated HIV- prevention and control efforts through the NSACP of the Ministry of Health, under the Director General of Health Services. NSACP integrates services for STIs and HIV/AIDS and the National Reference Laboratory for STI/HIV. NSACP is responsible for coordination of the national HIV/AIDS response through planning, monitoring, and coordination of all stakeholders. The NSACP, in collaboration with the provincial governments, has undertaken HIV-prevention activities, such as a mass-media communications strategy, to improve knowledge and awareness of HIV and to provide care and treatment to people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHIV). Sri Lanka has a well established sero-surveillance system; and a second-generation behavioural surveillance among vulnerable groups was conducted in 2006. NSACP oversees a network of 30 STI clinics, while 11 branch clinics are conducted on an outreach basis from five provincial hospital clinics. NSACP also oversees scaled-up voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) and HIV clinical management services, pilot programmes for prevention of parent-to-child transmission (PPTCT), and the development of HIV/STI clinical management guidelines. The National Blood Transfusion Service is responsible for ensuring blood safety in Sri Lanka. No cases of transfusion related HIV infections have been reported to the NSACP since 2000.23 The National AIDS Council, formed in 2006, is the highest governing body, chaired by the President and with relevant ministers as members. The National AIDS Committee (NAC) formed in 1988, is the main body for coordinating HIV prevention and control initiatives 23 UNGASS, Country Progress Report 135 and for overseeing implementation of programmes to prevent the spread of HIV. It is chaired by the Secretary of the Ministry of Health Care and Nutrition, and members include other ministerial secretaries, NGOs, PLHIV, representatives of the private sector, and donors. Voluntary Counselling and Testing services are provided free of charge at government clinics. Counselling services are undertaken by NGOs such as the Migrant Service Centre (MSC), Lanka+, the Salvation Army of Sri Lanka, and Community Development Services. Anti- retroviral therapy is given freely to persons registered at STI clinics, although less than 10 percent of the 3,000 people in Sri Lanka who are estimated to be HIV positive regularly call at clinics to receive therapy.24 Within the health sector, several departments provide HIV/AIDS-related services, such as the Family Health Bureau, Health Education Bureau, National Blood Transfusion Service, National TB Programme, and the Health Services Department (clinical care). Other government sectors also respond to HIV, including the Ministry of Education (school-based life-skills education), Ministry of Labour, and the Foreign Employment Bureau (pre-departure education for migrants).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fe02866-1522-4093-986c-162c16c633c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fe02866-1522-4093-986c-162c16c633c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and Mobility in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85aaf9e1ca2e2cf0dab6b27557eb6ff815d49790007b00c8d8415f2c058d82ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "4210706a-cb07-478e-9303-99109b73aa0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-mobility-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17e38fc629a8c2719aa87d9cd61021f8d665c93028fc6c051c482ce97c563cd7"}}, "hash": "192a66698c0677f9bfe90e341cc79e794bb51e6688e3c270cb4f0ce0ad3a17fb", "text": "NSACP supports several ministries and departments to build their competence, such as defence (prevention and VCT), youth affairs, fisheries, and the police department.

It was signed by the Ministries of Labour, Health, Child Development, Women\u2019s Empowerment, Vocational and Technical Training, and the SLBFE, as well as representatives of employer organizations and large trade unions. The Declaration states: Trade Union and Employer Organizations who are signatories will encourage development of HIV/AIDS workplace policies and programmes in collaboration with the employer/employees and take the lead in protecting workers and their families from HIV/AIDS. Workers Organisations and Employers Organisations will contribute to the prevention of HIV/AIDS by developing their own policies and programmes in this regard and include HIV/AIDS awareness raising in their education and training programmes focusing on employees, their families paying special attention to vulnerable communities and taking into consideration the special needs of women and children. Worker Organisations will also raise awareness on HIV/AIDS amongst the workers in the informal sector in collaboration with their subsidiary units at all levels. All three constituents being signatories to this National Tripartite Declaration firmly dedicate themselves to cooperate and support each other in all activities related to HIV/AIDS in the workplace. 25 \u201cNational HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan 2007-2011\u201d and National STD and AIDS Control Programme, Ministry of Health Care and Nutrition, Sri Lanka. SRI LANKA 136 Migration and HIV/AIDS Mandatory Testing Most destination countries require compulsory medical tests and re-tests at regular intervals during employment. If migrants test HIV positive, they are deported, often without explanation. Where mandatory testing is a requirement of the host country, it is done without Sri Lanka Government supervision or involvement and neither the testing centres nor the government offer pre-test or post-test counselling to migrant workers. Generally there is also a lack of access to condoms. Blood and urine tests (for HIV and pregnancy, respectively) are mandatory prior to departure for women migrating through official channels. The test results are provided directly to the agents. Many of the women tested admit not knowing the nature of these tests. A VDRL test, screening for syphilis, is also required, and is provided by the NSACP. The Government of Sri Lanka allows Gulf countries to conduct mandatory testing at sites approved by the Gulf Cooperation Council Approved Medical Centres Association (GAMCA). GAMCA has approved 13 testing centres in Sri Lanka: 10 based in the district of Colombo and 3 in Kurunegala district. Migrants tested do not receive the results and no pre-test or post- test counselling is provided. GAMCA is not obliged to provide test results or statistical information to the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion, or the SLBFE. Migrant workers travelling to countries not covered by the Gulf Cooperation Council may also be required to undergo testing, and recruiting agents direct these recruits to a GAMCA centre for testing. Although government hospitals can do full medical examinations more cost-effectively, testing at private hospitals is encouraged by recruiters. While abroad, many documented migrants avoid testing, or upon detection disappear, becoming undocumented workers to avoid deportation. Many HIV-positive migrants returning to Sri Lanka hide their HIV status for as long as they can in fear of stigma and discrimination. Increasingly, Sri Lankan migrant workers tested in the Arab States are infected with HIV; and more than 40 percent of women who have tested positive, both abroad and in Sri Lanka, are or have been international migrants. It is unclear how many of these women acquired HIV infection abroad, and how many within Sri Lanka.26 As most migrant workers are screened for HIV prior to departure and retested abroad, they are over- represented in HIV testing data.

Recruitment to Republic of Korea is a monopoly of the SLBFE. Medical testing for migrants leaving for Republic of Korea is done at Sri Jayawardenapura Hospitals in Colombo, Thalapathpitiya, and Nugegoda as approved by the Government of Korea. No private medical laboratories are permitted to conduct these medical tests. All these factors point to the need to strengthen the evidence linking high-risk behaviour among migrant workers to structural deficiencies in the migration process. Generating data on the HIV vulnerability of migrant workers, with specific focus on women and on responses in both origin and host countries, will provide insights for the scaling-up of existing programmatic responses and the development of new interventions.27 Pre-departure Orientation A significant number of Sri Lankans employed abroad are not reached by existing national sexual and reproductive health programmes at departure, in transit, on arrival in receiving countries, or on return to Sri Lanka. The SLBFE conducts training and pre-departure orientation programmes for migrants, both male and female. In 2005 it began offering HIV education as part of pre-departure training that domestic migrant workers are required to attend. In 2009 the SLBFE took steps to integrate HIV/AIDS education into pre- departure training for female migrants in all 34 SLBFE training centers.28 However there is no clear policy or requirement to provide pre-departure information to all migrants on STI and HIV prevention and care. Programmes recently launched by the SLBFE on information sharing on HIV/AIDS lack sufficient material to increase knowledge about health, labour rights, 26 UNGASS, Country Report. 27 UNDP Colombo, \u201cHIV Vulnerabilities Faced by Women Migrants.\u201d 28 UNGASS, Country Progress Report 137 and services available in receiving countries through Sri Lanka missions abroad or through overseas NGOs. While pre-departure sessions vary in length, a pre- departure orientation session which runs for 13 days (72 hours) includes only 2 hours devoted to discussion of HIV-prevention and protection issues. At destination, Sri Lankan missions are not equipped to handle the sensitive health issues of migrant women. Policies, Legislation, and International Conventions International Conventions In 1996, Sri Lanka ratified the International Convention on the Protection of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, which facilitated the creation of a normative framework on which national migration legislation and practices can be developed. However, Sri Lanka has yet to pass legislation to give effect to this instrument and its provisions. Sri Lanka is also a signatory of The Protocol on Preventing, Suppressing and Punishing Trafficking in Persons especially Women and Children under the UN Convention against organized crime, though it has not ratified the convention. Once ratified, the government intends to develop a comprehensive set of rules governing trafficking, and to communicate these throughout the country with the support of relevant stakeholders. Sri Lanka has ratified other associated international conventions, including Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Sri Lanka adopted the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) in June 2001. However, there has been limited follow-up by authorities on many of the commitments made at UNGASS, particularly access to HIV/AIDS programs for all migrant and mobile populations. In addition, Sri Lanka has yet to ratify relevant ILO conventions, including Migration for Employment, the convention concerning migration in abusive conditions, the promotion of equality of opportunity and treatment of migrant workers, and recommendations concerning migration for employment. Though Sri Lanka is a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and has an obligation to protect the health rights of all Sri Lankans, no specific interventions, including the promotion of the health rights of migrant workers, have been undertaken. Regional and Bilateral Agreements Sri Lanka is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and has ratified the SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution.

The National Law on Overseas Employment regulates migration and has specified protective measures against illegal operations. All migrant workers are now required to register with the SLBFE in an effort to prevent illegal recruitment and to provide migrants with essential services. The SLBFE seeks to promote and regulate migration of Sri Lankans and provide for welfare and protection of migrants. It is generally perceived as migrant-friendly in terms of facilitating emigration and inflow of remittances. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Act 1985 includes protective measures to reduce irregular migration and clearly articulates provisions for regulated migration. However, lack of suitable enforcement measures results in frequent contravention of these laws during the migration process. Recent amendments to the Foreign Employment Act 1985, were passed by the Parliament in September 2009, increasing the punishment and fines imposed by the courts for violations of the provisions. A Parliamentary Select Committee was established to investigate complaints and grievances of migrant workers regarding recruitment procedures, training, education, language proficiency, service agreements, welfare, and security of employment, primarily in the Middle East. Enforcement of laws and regulations related to migration for employment is complicated by the fact that most of the harassment and exploitation of migrant workers takes place outside the country and offenders are not held accountable.31 In February 2006, Sri Lanka passed an amendment to the Penal Code that gives a broader definition of trafficking to include buying, selling, bartering, recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of persons, and makes trafficking a criminal offence. To protect female expatriate workers, a policy was framed to discourage recruitment of domestic workers and replace domestic work with new occupations for women migrants, such as nursing, computer-based employment, and other jobs requiring special skills that women can fill after appropriate training. In 2006, the Ministry of Labour Relations and Foreign Employment, at the time responsible for all foreign employment, requested assistance from the ILO in preparing a National Labour Migration Policy for Sri 31 Chandanie Watawala, \u201cHuman Trafficking as a Threat to Human Security: Reflection on the Context of Trafficking in Sri Lankan Women to the Middle-East,\u201d 2002. Lanka. In its Advisory Report, the ILO recommended that a multi-stakeholder dialogue on the National Labour Policy for Sri Lanka provide the following: \u2022\ufffd Improved governance and regulation of labour migration based on a consultative process with social partners and civil society in formulating migration policy. \u2022\ufffd Effective service provision to migrant workers and their families. \u2022\ufffd Maximized development opportunities given the benefits of labour migration, migrant remittances, and reintegration of returnee migrants. \u2022\ufffd Linkages with trans-national communities and effective communication of policies. In 2007 a new Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare was established and was mandated to introduce structural changes to ensure Sri Lankan workers were trained to meet the international demand for skilled workers; ensure improved working conditions for migrants through regional cooperation and signed international agreements; promote equitable treatment and higher salaries for skilled workers and minimum wage agreements for domestic workers; and strengthen the services provided overseas by Sri Lankan embassies and embassy welfare officers. The National Labour Migration Policy for Sri Lanka was officially launched by the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare on February 24, 2009, and approved by the Sri Lanka Cabinet on April 30, 2009.32 The Ten Year Plan for Development and the National Action Plan for Decent Work recognizes the importance of labour migration in Sri Lanka. The Ten Year Plan highlights safe, skilled migration as the best strategy for guiding overseas labour migration.

The agencies have organised under the Association of Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies (ALFEA), proposing to assist the government in negotiation of service contracts. An ALFEA milestone was the negotiation with their counterparts in Saudi Arabia for a uniform policy on HIV testing, which was subsequently approved by the SLBFE. Key Stakeholders Government Agencies and Networks The main institutional framework for the labour migration process is handled by the Ministry of Foreign Employment and Welfare. The other key government institutions and agencies involved in the migration process are the Ministry of Labour Relations and Manpower, Ministry of Internal Administration, Department of Immigration and Emigration, Department of Registration of Persons, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Child Development and Women\u2019s Empowerment, and the National Child Protection Authority. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) concentrates on building the capacity of government agencies and NGOs working on trafficking prevention, prosecution of cases of trafficking, and providing assistance to victims. For example, IOM trains law enforcement personnel, such as the police, immigration officers, and officers of the SLBFE, to identify and prosecute cases of trafficking. IOM also raises awareness together with these agencies on the risks of irregular migration. The National Resource Centre to Counter Trafficking was opened in May 2009 by the Immigration and Emigration Department (IED) of Sri Lanka with the support of the IOM. This centre is housed at the IED and intends to offer comprehensive training to IED staff on human trafficking, promote research, and enhance information sharing among stakeholders. It will also provide appropriate assistance and redress to victims of human trafficking and facilitate the development of a referral system. Non-government Organizations Migrant Services Centre (MSC) is a service organization established in 1990 to act as the migrant services arm of the National Workers Congress, a registered trade union in Sri Lanka with a migrant worker membership. MSC membership is open to migrants, returned migrants, and prospective migrants, including refugees. The main services provided are: stakeholder meetings with policy makers; training of trainers; information, counselling, and orientation programs for prospective migrants; health education, HIV prevention and care for migrants with AIDS; assistance with training and skills development; counselling on health problems of migrant returnees; resettlement and reintegration of HIV-positive migrant workers; and intervention in the trafficking of women and children under the pretext of migration for employment and referral of victims to relevant authorities for assistance. Community Development Services (CDS) is an active local NGO launched in 1991 and offering capacity building and advocacy on HIV awareness and prevention to a range of stakeholders, including NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs), private sector organizations, and international NGOs. CDS formed the first commercial sex worker (CSW) micro-credit programme in Sri Lanka and helped to form Lanka+. CDS works with CSWs, MSM, youth, and prospective migrant workers in several districts. It recently worked with three CBOs in the south, and has educated 333 migrant domestic workers and their families on issues such as dealing with a licensed recruiting agency, STIs, HIV and AIDS, medical testing procedures, post arrival behaviour, international labour laws, human and health rights, host country labour laws, reintegration, human trafficking, and coping strategies for people/families left behind. Community Strength Development Foundation (CSDF) is a non-profit organization registered with the Department of Social Services in 2002 under the national Secretariat of NGOs. CSDF utilizes a group of dedicated, educated, and experienced government and non-government personnel to serve the community irrespective of social, economic, or political position. Activities include issues of unemployed youth, HIV prevention programmes, entrepreneurship training and counselling programmes, drug prevention, education quality improvement, and community empowerment programming.

Expand and strengthen the data-gathering system for both immigration and emigration. 3. Expand the evidence base and research to increase understanding of the issues created by international migration, such as: the impact on families, particularly children left behind by migrant women; the nexus between migration and human traffi cking; and HIV vulnerability. 4. Ensure comprehensive migrant-friendly voluntary HIV testing that protects the rights of migrants in a process governed by best practices: consent, confi dentiality, and pre-test and post-test counselling. 5. Improve the quality of education and access to skills-based training for youth and women at the grassroots level and areas prone to high migration, with a view to foreign employment as skilled workers. 6. Ensure that pre-departure orientation and training programmes are accessible to migrant populations, particularly women migrating as domestic workers; and expand programming to include HIV and STI awareness and prevention through safe behaviour choices, such as condom use and access to health services. 7. Regulate and monitor recruitment agencies and their sub-agents; impose ceilings on fees; and blacklist agencies indulging in unlawful, fraudulent, and corrupt practices. 8. Continue to actively implement and follow-up on the commitments made at UNGASS, particularly improving access to HIV/AIDS programmes for all migrant and mobile populations. 141 SRI LANKA Bibliography \u2013 Sri Lanka Central Bank of Sri Lanka (2008).

In Cambodia, the National AIDS Authority prefers the term \u2018most-at-risk populations\u2019. The term \u2018key populations\u2019 includes people living with HIV and their partners.

Sex worker In this report the term \u2018sex worker\u2019 is used to refer to all adults (persons over 18 years) who sell or exchange sex for money, goods, or services. The term is used to refer to consenting adult female, male, and transgender people who receive money or goods in exchange for sexual services, either regularly or occasionally. The term is used to refer to people who sell or exchange sex even if they do not identify as sex workers, or consider the activity to be \u2018work\u2019. \u2018Indirect\u2019 sex workers usually do not rely on selling sex as their first source of income. They may work as waitresses, hairdressers, massage girls, street vendors, or beer promotion girls and supplement their income by selling sex. They generally do not identify as \u2018sex workers\u2019. In Cambodia and the Philippines, these workers are commonly referred to as \u2018entertainment workers\u2019 rather than \u2018sex workers\u2019. 7 Prostitution/prostitute Prostitution is a term that was commonly used in legislation enacted in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to refer to sex work or the practice of selling sex. The terms \u2018prostitution\u2019 and \u2018prostitute\u2019 have negative connotations that can be stigmatizing. This report only uses the term \u2018prostitution\u2019 when quoting from specific legislative provisions or the works of other authors that use the term. In most cases, the term \u2018sex work\u2019 is preferred in this report. Transgender Transgender is a term used to describe individuals whose gender expression or gender identity differs from conventional expectations based on the physical sex into which they were born. The term \u2018transgender people\u2019 in this report refers primarily to people who were born biologically male but who identify as female, or who have characteristics that are usually considered female. There are transgender people in all countries, and in some ASEAN countries there are specific transgender or \u2018third gender\u2019 groupings that have unique cultural identities. Most countries have their own terms to refer to culturally specific sub-populations that include feminized men, third gender, and/or male-to-female transgender people (e.g., waria in Indonesia, mak nyah in Malaysia, transpinay in the Philippines, and kathoey in Thailand). Legal systems of South-East Asia Common law: Common law legal systems combine laws made by or under the authority of parliament and laws defined by judges\u2019 decisions. The former British colonies still use or are strongly influenced by common law traditions that derive from English case law. Common law is part of the law of Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Singapore. Civil law: Civil law legal systems are derived from continental Europe and rely on codified collections of legislation. Countries with civil law systems include Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. Viet Nam\u2019s legal system combines French civil law and socialist law. Customary law: Customary law refers to traditional legal systems developed in pre-colonial times. Sharia law: Sharia law is Islamic religious law. Principles of Sharia law apply in Brunei Darussalam and to Muslim communities to varying extents in Malaysia, parts of Indonesia (e.g., Aceh), and in the Muslim Personal Laws that apply in family matters, wills, and estates in Mindanao (the Philippines). Mixed legal systems: Some countries have mixed legal systems that draw on common law and/or civil law traditions, mixed with customary or religious laws. For example, the Philippines has a strong civil law tradition and elements of common law and religious law. 9 This report was prepared for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Bangkok Regional Hub and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Taskforce on AIDS as part of the ASEAN Cities Getting to Zero Initiative, to produce evidence on the legal environments affecting HIV responses among key populations in ASEAN states and Timor-Leste.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6aa63d7b-7f14-4583-a58f-186aeb372000": {"__data__": {"id_": "6aa63d7b-7f14-4583-a58f-186aeb372000", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and the Law in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "827ce8d4ffb1904d4bc93840f2ae7ac11ae8d541d6f78223ced4db4f9f2090a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "f65e9b9d-e0b5-4a22-b68d-bf9958b30be2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1997dba29fb68209c9fdb66804504d200a62c63f669ab9afad80c94595183055"}}, "hash": "293e0646494f17810e03f744706ef4e4888cadfdffd45458987f876191cbe8cb", "text": "Information was obtained from a literature review conducted in 2013, updating previous reviews conducted for UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub in the period 2009\u20132013.1 Objectives The objectives of this study were to: i Describe the diversity of laws and police practices that affect HIV responses among people living with HIV and other key affected populations (in particular sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, and people who inject drugs) in the 10 member countries of ASEAN (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam) and Timor-Leste; and ii Provide options for strengthening legal responses to HIV for consideration by governments and civil society partners conducting reviews of HIV-related national laws, policies, and practices.

Rationale This report applies a human rights-based approach to the analysis of the impact of laws on HIV responses. People living with HIV and other key populations are entitled to legal protections of their human rights, consistent with international law and human rights norms. International human rights law requires states to take measures to respect, protect, and fulfil the human rights of people living 1 UNDP (2010), Legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific, Bangkok: UNDP; UNDP (2012), Sex work and the law in Asia and the Pacific, Bangkok: UNDP; UNDP (2013), Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific, Bangkok: UNDP. 10 HIV AND THE LAW IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA CHAPTEr 1: INTrODUCTION with HIV and other key populations to equality, non-discrimination, privacy, and the highest attainable standard of health.2 The enactment of laws to protect the human rights of people living with HIV and other key populations is essential to creating an enabling environment for HIV responses. Protective laws are essential to combat stigma and discrimination. There are continuing widespread reports of stigma and discrimination affecting people living with HIV and key populations across the region. For example, the People Living with HIV Stigma Index, Asia Pacific Regional Analysis found that HIV-related stigma and discrimination are evidenced across all areas of life, including in the key areas of employment and health care.3 HIV responses are more effective in contexts where the human rights of people living with HIV and other key populations are protected by laws and policies. With legal and policy protections of human rights in place, key populations are more likely to cooperate in prevention efforts and come forward for testing, treatment, and care. HIV services can operate more effectively when key populations can access services without fear of adverse legal or personal consequences. Legal protections also enable key populations to participate more openly in advocacy and planning, managing, and delivering HIV services without fear of reprisals. This helps to ensure that the services are effective, accessible, and acceptable to their communities. The study is intended to assist countries to respond to resolutions of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). ESCAP Resolution 66\u201310 (2010) calls on member states to ground universal access in human rights and to address legal barriers to HIV responses. ESCAP Resolution 67\u20139 (2011) requires countries to initiate reviews of national laws, policies, and practices to enable the full achievement of universal access targets with a view to eliminating all forms of discrimination against people living with HIV and key affected populations. Resolution 67\u20139 also requires countries to establish strategic and operational partnerships among representatives of public health agencies, law enforcement agencies, civil society, and key populations to scale-up high-impact HIV interventions for key populations. The study supports ASEAN states to fulfil commitments made in the ASEAN Declaration of Commitment: Getting to Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Discrimination, Zero AIDS-Related Deaths (2011), which commits member states to scaling-up HIV-prevention programmes for key populations, including people who use drugs, sex workers, MSM, and transgender people. 2 See Office of the High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) (2006), International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, Geneva: OHCHR & UNAIDS; OHCHR & UNAIDS (2007), Handbook on HIV and Human Rights for National Human Rights Institutions, Geneva: OHCHR & UNAIDS; Jurgens, R. et al.

The Global Commission on HIV and the Law also emphasized the need to strengthen implementation and enforcement of protective laws by providing key populations with prompt and affordable access to legal redress in cases of human rights violations.5 Each country needs to define its own priorities in relation to law reform and changes to law enforcement practices and policies, informed by a participatory process of consultation with communities and relevant sectors of government. It is critically important that people living with HIV and other key populations are centrally involved in efforts to reform HIV-related laws and improve legal environments. Community-based organizations and networks should be supported to participate in developing recommendations and making decisions on national priorities for law reform and other actions to improve the legal environment for HIV responses. Structure of this report Chapters 2\u20137 provide key findings and conclusions from a regional perspective for each of the populations considered by the study (people living with HIV, sex workers, MSM, transgender people, people who inject drugs, young people, and migrants). Chapter 8 provides a summary of laws, law enforcement practices, and related policies that are helpful or harmful to HIV responses. 4 Article 29, ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, 21st ASEAN Summit, Phnom Penh, 19 November 2012. 5 Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2012), op cit., p. 18. 12 HIV AND THE LAW IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA CHAPTEr 1: INTrODUCTION Chapter 9 provides examples of protective legal provisions from the countries reviewed in the areas of discrimination, confidentiality, and voluntary testing. Chapter 10 reproduces recommendations published elsewhere for consideration by governments. These include: 1 Recommendations of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law; 2 Recommendations from a UNDP study of national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific; 3 Recommendations of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on HIV-related travel restrictions; 4 The joint statement of UN agencies on drug detention and rehabilitation centres; and 5 Recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture relating to drug detention centres. 14 HIV AND THE LAW IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA CHAPTEr 2: PEOPLE LIVINg WITH HIV Universal access to HIV services is supported by the enactment of legal protections for people living with HIV in at least the following key areas: \u2022 Protection from discrimination in employment, education, and access to health care and other services; \u2022 Protection from breach of confidentiality; and \u2022 Protection from coerced or non-consensual HIV testing. The laws of the eleven countries under review provide varying levels of legal protection in these key areas (Table 1), and chapter 9 provides examples of their protective legal provisions. Anti-discrimination provisions In relation to legal protection from discrimination, five countries reviewed have specific provisions that prohibit discrimination on the ground of HIV: Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. All of these countries prohibit some forms of workplace discrimination, and have specific prohibitions against HIV-related discrimination in health care. Further, Cambodia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Viet Nam have specific prohibitions against HIV-related discrimination in education. The Philippines and Viet Nam also have specific provisions addressing discrimination in the provision of burial or cremation services. The text of these anti-discrimination provisions is reproduced in chapter 9.1. Some of these provisions extend to protect people suspected of having HIV or people affected by HIV due to their relationship with a person living with HIV (Cambodia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Viet Nam). The laws of Lao PDR and Viet Nam prohibit conduct that stigmatizes a person living with or affected by HIV. The law in Viet Nam defines stigmatization against an HIV-infected person as an attitude of contempt or disrespect towards another person because of the awareness or suspicion that the person is infected with HIV or has a close relationship with an HIV-infected person or a suspected HIV-infected person.6 Some countries have legal protections against discrimination that are worded more broadly than HIV, such as laws", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca9ba6f4-92d1-480b-a9c6-a2387d39ee2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca9ba6f4-92d1-480b-a9c6-a2387d39ee2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and the Law in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7c527be790d14e0eafea51a12b8c554e85e39ba40985f23bb0274f457e4a001"}, "3": {"node_id": "620c564b-b875-479d-b75b-7c5cace70039", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2dfb6e0fb5b1242ede61e7aa8ffbc10bc6ff3c61d6b7a53c052ef7485519e15"}}, "hash": "025368c7c190bb43e3e9621de42d33918d4bc62ca1b7ef21047c12bb81ac3da1", "text": "prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of a person\u2019s health or physical condition (e.g., Cambodia,7 Thailand,8 and Timor-Leste9).

In most cases, coerced or compulsory HIV testing is also prohibited (subject to exceptions) and informed consent is required prior to HIV testing. These national HIV laws also state the responsibilities of people living with HIV, such as not to engage in risky behaviours10 and the responsibility to disclose their status to their spouse or sexual partners.11 Some of these laws also establish an enforceable right to HIV treatment and prevention services. For example, article 26 of Cambodia\u2019s Law on the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS of 2002 provides that the state shall ensure that all persons with HIV/AIDS shall receive primary health care services free of charge from public health networks. These laws include criminal or administrative penalties that apply to persons who violate rights, and some laws also explicitly enable individuals to seek legal redress such as compensation through the courts. Enforcement of these laws generally relies on individuals making complaints to police, prosecutors, the court system, or government offices in the event that their rights are violated. The law may then be enforced either by an individual launching an administrative or civil court action in the individual\u2019s own name or by a prosecutor or police officer launching a criminal prosecution against the wrongdoer on behalf of the state. In some countries, cases may be handled as administrative complaints without necessarily resorting to the courts (e.g., the Philippines and Viet Nam). People living with HIV face a range of practical challenges in enforcing their legal rights under these protective laws. Barriers to accessing the justice system to enforce legal rights may include lack of access to independent legal advice and legal aid services, the cost and complexity of legal proceedings, lack of confidence and trust in the formal legal system, and concerns regarding disclosure of identity or health status during legal proceedings. 10 Law on HIV/AIDS Control and Prevention of 2010, article 52 (Lao PDR). 11 Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act 1998, section 34; Viet Nam, Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 2006, article 4. 17 A well-drafted national HIV law can define a consistent human rights-based approach to HIV informed by an explicit statement of principles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "620c564b-b875-479d-b75b-7c5cace70039": {"__data__": {"id_": "620c564b-b875-479d-b75b-7c5cace70039", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and the Law in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7c527be790d14e0eafea51a12b8c554e85e39ba40985f23bb0274f457e4a001"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca9ba6f4-92d1-480b-a9c6-a2387d39ee2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "025368c7c190bb43e3e9621de42d33918d4bc62ca1b7ef21047c12bb81ac3da1"}}, "hash": "e2dfb6e0fb5b1242ede61e7aa8ffbc10bc6ff3c61d6b7a53c052ef7485519e15", "text": "For example, the Lao PDR HIV/AIDS Law (2010) states the principle that HIV control and prevention should be carried out \u201censuring that equality, justice, compassion, and non-discrimination and non-stigmatization principles are respected\u201d and \u201censuring the principles of confidentiality", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f40ba12-efef-4863-8ca4-3069d215e77f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f40ba12-efef-4863-8ca4-3069d215e77f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and the Law in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67df59415f3b58f15201f4d0057a2398680c2362d60034b0d809bcd5be9951b7"}}, "hash": "67df59415f3b58f15201f4d0057a2398680c2362d60034b0d809bcd5be9951b7", "text": "and privacy for people living with HIV/AIDS.\u201d 12 The Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1998 is also prefaced with a statement of principle, as follows: AIDS is a disease that recognizes no territorial, social, political and economic boundaries for which there is no known cure. The gravity of the AIDS threat demands strong State action\u2026 discrimination, in all its forms and subtleties, against individuals with HIV or persons perceived or suspected of having HIV shall be considered inimical to individual and national interest.13 The statement of principles in Viet Nam\u2019s national HIV law refers to principles of multisectoral collaboration, social mobilization, integration of HIV-prevention and control activities into socio- economic development programmes, harm reduction intervention measures in the prevention of HIV transmission, elimination of stigma and discrimination, and the facilitation of HIV-infected people and their family members to participate in prevention and control.14 Enactment of these laws has been important in providing a rights-based legal framework for the HIV responses of these countries. However, to ensure that these laws continue to play a role in shaping their country\u2019s national HIV response, it is important that steps are taken such that people living with HIV are aware of their rights under the law and how to take action to enforce their rights, and that the laws are periodically reviewed and updated to take account of developments in the epidemic and the country context. For example, a proposed new national HIV law is due to be considered by Congress in the Philippines in 2014 (Revised Philippine HIV and AIDS Policy and Program Act of 2013) as a result of an extensive review of the Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1998. Countries without comprehensive national HIV laws Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Timor-Leste do not have comprehensive national HIV laws. In these countries there are some legal protections for people living with HIV provided by constitutional human rights provisions, general human rights laws, labour laws, and/or public health laws. 12 Article 6, HIV/AIDS Law (Lao PDR). 13 Section 2, Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1998 (RA 8504). 14 Article 3, Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 2006 (Viet Nam). 18 HIV AND THE LAW IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA CHAPTEr 2: PEOPLE LIVINg WITH HIV For example, legal protections in Indonesia are provided by ministerial decrees and regulations relating to HIV in employment and health care, as well as general human rights protections under the national human rights law (Law Concerning Human Rights, No. 39 of 1999) and the Constitution. An employment decree requires employers and workers to protect workers with HIV from discriminatory conduct. The Decree of the Minister of Manpower and Transmigration on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in the Workplace15 draws on the International Labour Organization (ILO) Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work (2001), and includes a prohibition on compulsory testing and a broad obligation to protect workers from discrimination. Indonesia\u2019s Health Ministerial Regulation No. 21/2013 on the HIV and AIDS Response prohibits discrimination in the provision of health care and requires health programmes to actively engage key populations while adhering to principles of respect for human dignity, justice, and gender equality. In Timor-Leste the law does not address HIV-related discrimination specifically, but offers protections to all citizens under broader non-discrimination provisions. The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the grounds of \u201cphysical condition,\u201d16 and the Labour Law (2012) offers protections to all citizens under the broader prohibition on discrimination on the grounds of health or disability in employment or in applying for employment.17 The Labour Law also prohibits compulsory workplace HIV testing.18 National human rights institutions, such as the human rights commissions in Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Thailand, also provide an avenue for seeking redress for HIV-related human rights violations. For example, although HIV-specific rights protections are not yet in place in Myanmar, people living with HIV who experience rights violations may lodge a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission under its general mandate to address human rights. Similarly, in Thailand any citizen \u2014 including people living with HIV \u2014 may lodge a petition to the National Human Rights Commission to complain of a human rights violation.19 The Commission accepts complaints relating to human rights protected by the Constitution, Thai law, or treaties to which Thailand is a party. Thailand\u2019s Constitution prohibits discrimination based on health conditions.20 Further, Thailand\u2019s Disabled Persons Promotion and Development Life Quality Act (2007) prohibits disability discrimination, and therefore may provide legal protection to some people living with HIV if they have a disability as defined by the Act \u2014 for example, a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76bdf34e-75d5-4947-89e5-8c352c4bd017": {"__data__": {"id_": "76bdf34e-75d5-4947-89e5-8c352c4bd017", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and the Law in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10ee46041cf675c79c7e97a3f4a8c5a6a1818f793221f4377196992b0ff62e5a"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc74c4c2-fe45-41d8-a516-d5c2a29dfd79", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05dab2100dcfbc77406741f1df6bc8b5a565d854949e1c5a079fcd1d99d7131c"}}, "hash": "6a8b4bc99055225809a1a8f5bb9eee8d70c1b35e482fa7df55922d878c84031c", "text": "visual impairment resulting from an opportunistic infection.21 To address workplace discrimination, the National Committee for HIV Prevention and AIDS Alleviation issued a Code of Practice for HIV Prevention and Management in the Workplace in 2009. 15 No: Kep. 68/Men/2004. 16 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, article 16 (physical or mental condition). 17 Article 6(2). 18 Article 72. 19 National Human Rights Commission Act 1999 (Thailand), section 23. 20 Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, BE 2550 (2007), section 30. 21 The Act defines a disabled person as someone limited in participating in daily life or social activities due to a defect in vision, hearing, movement, communication, or in mind, emotion, behaviour, or intelligence, including those who have difficulties in all such aspects and need assistance to perform their daily activities or participate in social activities. 19 Public health laws also affect the rights of people living with HIV. Some public health laws provide confidentiality protections to people living with HIV, such as the Infectious Diseases Act in Brunei Darussalam and in Singapore. In some cases, public health laws enable governments to restrict the rights of people living with HIV if they are considered a risk to others, or to prosecute people living with HIV for transmitting the disease, not disclosing their HIV status to their sexual partners, or placing other people at risk of HIV.22 In Myanmar, the Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases Law 1995 categorizes AIDS along with such highly infectious diseases as cholera and plague, with the result that isolation and quarantine powers apply. Similarly, HIV is listed as an infectious disease in the schedule of Malaysia\u2019s Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988. Provisions relating to isolation and quarantine are inappropriate for HIV because it cannot be transmitted through casual contact. National health laws and regulations can also provide a framework for access to treatment for people living with HIV. For example, Thailand\u2019s National Health Security Act (2002) provides the legal basis for the National Health Security Office\u2019s universal health coverage scheme, under which people living with HIV can access free treatment, including antiretroviral therapies. In Indonesia, Health Minister Regulation No. 21/2013 on HIV/AIDS Control provides that care and treatment costs for people living with HIV who are poor are to be borne by the state,23 and health services are prohibited from rejecting treatment and care to people living with HIV.24 Compulsory HIV testing Six of the countries reviewed have legislated to prohibit compulsory testing in certain contexts: Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. However, mandatory or compulsory HIV testing exists for some purposes in some ASEAN countries. For example: \u2022 Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, and Singapore require HIV testing of migrants (see chapter 7). \u2022 HIV testing of prisoners is mandatory in Malaysia.25 \u2022 Premarital HIV testing is required for Muslims in Malaysia. Malaysia\u2019s Department of Islamic Development imposed premarital HIV-screening requirements for prospective Muslim couples through state-level regulations introduced over several years beginning in 2001.26 22 See, e.g., Infectious Diseases Act, section 24 (duty to disclose to sexual partners) (Brunei Darussalam); Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988, section 12 (doing an act likely to lead to spread of infectious disease/HIV) (Malaysia); Infectious Diseases Act, section 23 (duty to disclose to sexual partners)(Singapore). 23 Article 46. 24 Article 30(1). 25 Wickersham, J. et al.

Regulation of sex work, brothels, and entertainment establishments In Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand there is a degree of official toleration of sex work conducted in \u2018red light\u2019 areas, including regulation of venues in certain zones to address public health and security concerns. Several countries have introduced licensing or registration of brothels, entertainment establishments, sex businesses, or individual sex workers. Examples of attempts to regulate the sex industry include:35 1 Regulation of brothel complexes (lokalisasi) in \u201cprostitution toleration zones\u201d under district or municipal bylaws or local regulations in Indonesia. 2 Legal requirements under city HIV/AIDS ordinances in the Philippines, which do not explicitly refer to sex work but in effect provide health protection for sex workers through regulation. For example, some cities have imposed regulations requiring that entertainment establishments must: a ensure workers attend clinics for regular tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs); b make condoms available within the establishment and provide proper guidelines on correct and consistent condom use; c have information materials on STI and HIV prevention and control available in the establishment and provide such information materials when requested by customers, including guidance on the correct and consistent use of condoms; d make educational posters visible within their premises, particularly in toilets and dressing rooms; and/or e have at least one trained peer educator.36 3 Police requirements for sex workers operating in brothels in Singapore\u2019s Designated Red Light Areas to attend regular medical examinations and to carry health cards;37 35 UNDP (2012), Sex work and the law in Asia and the Pacific.

Condom programmes are more effective when they are based on peer-led approaches, rather than compulsory measures. Peer-directed interventions have proven effective in the long term due to their focus on improving the self-awareness and confidence of sex workers in negotiating consistent condom usage with their clients and non-client sexual partners.39 Rehabilitation centres for sex workers In Cambodia, Indonesia, and Myanmar, sex workers who are arrested for offences such as vagrancy or soliciting may be referred to rehabilitation centres.40 In Cambodia, sex workers may be referred to Social Affairs Centres under the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans, and Youth Rehabilitation.41 In Indonesia, police may refer sex workers to a Social Rehabilitation Centre.42 In Myanmar, sex workers serving prison sentences for prostitution offences may be held at a Vocational Training Centre for Women, where skills training (usually limited to basic literacy, knitting, and basket-making) is provided prior to release.43 Viet Nam has phased out compulsory detention for sex workers. Viet Nam\u2019s National Assembly passed the Law on Administrative Sanctions in 2012, which required authorities to release sex workers detained in rehabilitation centres by July 2013.

Some countries have taken action to support HIV prevention by directing police not to confiscate condoms from sex workers to use as evidence against them. For example: \u2022 In Myanmar, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued an Administrative Order in 2000 directing police not to use condoms as evidence in prosecutions of sex workers. Although this was a helpful initiative for HIV prevention, compliance with the order has reportedly been uneven.46 \u2022 In Cambodia, the Ministry of Justice issued Explanatory Notes for the Law on Suppression of Human Traf- ficking and Sexual Exploitation in 2013 that clarified the rights of \u2018entertainment workers\u2019 to carry condoms. \u2022 In the Philippines, progress has been made in some cities to change law enforcement practices that obstruct HIV prevention. For example, meetings have been held in Quezon City involving the Health Department, Quezon City Police Department, and entertainment venue owners to discuss how police practices can support HIV prevention and access to condoms.47 The Philippines is proposing the following new legal provision to prevent confiscation of condoms by police: Prohibition on the Use of Condoms and Other Safer Sex Paraphernalia as Basis for Raids and Similar Police Operations. It shall be unlawful to use the presence of used or unused condoms or other safer sex paraphernalia to conduct raids or similar police operations in sites and venues of HIV prevention interventions. The Department of Interior and Local Government shall establish a national policy to guarantee the implementation of this provision.48 \u2022 In some countries the over-reach of anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts impedes HIV prevention. Police conduct in enforcing anti-trafficking laws against voluntary adult sex workers (rather than genuine victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation) creates obstacles to HIV prevention.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53010165-9ee6-4e81-af5b-95e64a509bd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "53010165-9ee6-4e81-af5b-95e64a509bd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV and the Law in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05c50f3b105f0d6e751b917fa11052b6236c928e06a1a116b3ce7b04241442be"}, "2": {"node_id": "d68f7c41-fc6d-4023-b4d7-cfb250412ab7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-and-law-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e567176425c211e6fb7c808a878766b934e5b0ddbe1f31de2b0f62a5c0fd402c"}}, "hash": "4eff4d0285c71f1ea4f11a530f3d86c055144349643386de6790d331edbdf4fc", "text": "Police \u2018raid and rescue\u2019 operations that fail to distinguish between sex workers and people who have been trafficked or sexually exploited can adversely affect outreach work and the provision of HIV prevention and support services for sex workers.49 46 Order No.1048 (1/2000), issued by Police Brigadier Zaw Win; see Khin Ninn Lwin (2010), Burmese sex workers dare not carry condom, fear of arrest, at moemaka.org/index.php/current/news-brief/81-news/451-burmese-sex-workers-dare-not-carry-condom-fear-of-arrest. 47 Acaba, J.

These countries have penal codes that are largely based on the nineteenth-century British Penal Code introduced during the colonial era, which includes offences for sodomy or unnatural sex (carnal intercourse \u201cagainst the order of nature\u201d). Sharia law, which applies in Brunei Darussalam, to Muslims in Malaysia, and has been proposed in parts of Indonesia,51 also criminalizes the behaviours of MSM and transgender people.52 Countries that do not criminalize sex between men No laws specifically prohibit male-to-male sex between consenting adults in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, or Viet Nam. These countries were not British colonies and have legal systems significantly influenced by European civil law traditions.53 In Cambodia54, Lao PDR55 and Thailand56 the age of consent is 15 for both homosexual and heterosexual sex. In Viet Nam57 the age of consent is 16 for both homosexual and heterosexual sex. In Timor-Leste58 the age of consent is 17 for both homosexual and heterosexual sex. Although male-to-male sex is not illegal in these countries, some MSM and transgender people may be targeted for harassment or arrest by law enforcement authorities under laws relating to public order or immoral conduct, particularly if they are suspected of involvement in selling sex.

This affected the laws of French colonies and other nations whose legal systems were influenced by European civil law. 54 Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation of 2008, article 44; Criminal Code, article 239.

Several initiatives have been taken to improve relations between police and MSM and transgender communities. In Cambodia, the Police Community Partnership Initiative is working to improve the relations between police and communities of MSM and transgender people (and other most- at-risk populations) in HIV \u2018hotspot\u2019 areas.62 In Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, the Government\u2019s harm reduction programme has worked with a local community-based organization, the Blue Sky Club, to support health promotion efforts to reach MSM and transgender people. A series of meetings and discussion workshops involving community organizations and government departments \u2014 including representatives from the judiciary, law enforcement, health, and welfare agencies \u2014 have been held to explain the club\u2019s outreach and \u2018edutainment\u2019 work, and to seek their support in taking a \u2018hands off\u2019 approach to enforcement of the law for the sake of public health. As a result, MSM and transgender people are reported to face reduced threat of police harassment or detention for having condoms in their possession.63 Protective laws and policies Among ASEAN states, only the Philippines has taken action to provide legal protections to MSM and transgender people. Six cities in the Philippines have enacted local ordinances protecting people from discrimination on the grounds of their sexuality and/or gender identity.64 Several national anti- 59 Law No. 44/2008. 60 See, e.g., South Sumatra Provincial Regulation No. 13/2003 on Eradicating Immoral Acts in the Province of South Sumatra; Palembang City Regulation No. 2/2004; and the draft Sharia criminal regulations (Qanun Jinayat) of Aceh province of Indonesia. 61 See UNDP (2010), Legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific, Bangkok: UNDP. 62 FHI 360 and Ministry of Interior (2012), Baseline Survey on the Enabling Environment for Most at Risk Populations in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
