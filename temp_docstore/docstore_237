and Algeria\u2019s DRM law sets out the principle of participation and the right of citizens to information on their own vulnerability to hazards and on measures to be taken to reduce their risk.6 The challenge remains to apply these rights to governmental duties in DRR and to determine whether they are enforceable by affected people when failures in DRR occur. Legal accountability, responsibility and liability for disaster risk reduction Public reporting and parliamentary oversight mechanisms are not a significant feature of most of the sample countries\u2019 DRM laws, nor are express provisions generally made for civil or administrative procedures against governmental officials or private persons neglecting DRR related duties. However, there are some notable exceptions (e.g. in China and Kyrgyzstan). Civil and even criminal sanctions are available under more general legislation or common law in a number of the sample countries (e.g. in Algeria, Austria, Japan and Kenya). However, these measures are reportedly used quite rarely. There is, therefore, a potential to make better use of liability as a tool to increase accountability for reducing risk, but caution is warranted (in particular with respect to criminal liability) so as not to discourage voluntarism and engagement. Legal frameworks for disaster insurance and other risk sharing mechanisms Legal frameworks for disaster insurance were not identified as a significant aspect of DRM in many sample countries, although several have announced an intention to develop national insurance schemes. For example, Mexico has implemented compulsory disaster insurance rules for its states, and several lower-income countries have started to explore other ways to share risk, including through direct public subsidies, as well as agricultural insurance schemes (e.g. in Viet Nam and China). Customary law and DRR Forms of customary law, including traditional, tribal or indigenous law, are recognized to varying degrees in different countries, most often in post- colonial countries where dual or pluralist systems of law operate. In relation to DRR, customary law is most frequently applied in rural areas to regulate matters such as land ownership and use, water resources and local governance (e.g. in Madagascar, South Africa and New Zealand). 6 Constitution of Ecuador (Ecuador, 2008), Art. 389.; Constitution of Ethiopia (Ethiopia, 1994), Art. 89(3); Loi n\u00b0 04-20 du 25 d\u00e9cembre 2004 relative \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention et \u00e0 la gestion des catastrophes dans le cadre du d\u00e9veloppement durable (Algeria, 2004), Art. 8 Early warning saves lives.

Since some countries clearly face overall resource shortfalls for their DRM needs, particularly at the level of local government, it is also important to support greater civil society and community participation to engender a whole-of-society approach to DRR. The report identified 17 recommendations specifically related to disaster risk reduction in DRM law, sectoral laws and other cross- cutting areas of law. Most are proposed to assist lawmakers and administrators in designing and reviewing legal frameworks for DRR. As the first large-scale comparative study of its kind, the report has also defined the need for more research in a number of thematic areas, which could not be adequately covered in the present effort. Recommendations on DRM laws No. 1 - Prioritization of disaster risk reduction in DRM law The country examples have shown that the level of priority given to disaster risk reduction in DRM laws depends on a range of issues, including the prevailing risk and governance context, the level of understanding of DRR, and the DRM needs and gaps in the country. It is recommended, therefore, that lawmakers and administrators base their decisions on which type of DRM law they wish to pursue on a thorough analysis of their country\u2019s context and DRM needs, as well as the capacities and resources available to implement the legal provisions. Such an analysis should guide the decision on whether there is a need for a law that focuses on preparedness and response (Type 1 DRM law), a broad DRM law (Type 2 DRM law), or a DRR priority law (Types 3 and 4 DRM laws). If there is consensus that DRR should be the main focus of the DRM law, the following suggestions are offered: \u25cf Give DRR a sufficiently high priority in the objectives of the law and in the institutional mandates that it establishes; \u25cf Emphasize a whole-of-society approach that helps to increase understanding of DRR among administrators, practitioners and the public; \u25cf Mandate a central institution that has the capacity to provide national leadership on DRR; \u25cf Ensure the DRM law provides an umbrella for other laws that regulate disaster risks by establishing mechanisms for cross- sectoral coordination, especially with laws and institutions that govern development planning at both the national and local levels, in order to support DRR mainstreaming into development; \u25cf Build in mechanisms to review implementation of the DRM law, taking a \u2018continuous improvement\u2019 approach to legislative frameworks to ensure that it is adapted to emerging DRR needs. No. 2 \u2013The relationship between disaster risk reduction policy and DRM legal frameworks The country examples indicate that DRR is currently a more distinct priority in policies, plans and strategies than in most legal frameworks. Moreover, they also indicate that DRM policy and law can positively influence each other in order to progress the DRR agenda. It is recommended, therefore, that lawmakers and administrators use legislative and policy instruments strategically, as key pillars to foster more effective implementation of DRR, in particular by using policy to set the political agenda for planned law reforms, and to put in place specific mechanisms for the implementation of new or revised DRM laws. No. 3 \u2013 Institutional frameworks for decentralized implementation in DRM law There is a marked trend in the country examples towards placing more DRR responsibilities at the sub-national level, including through legislative mandates. Irrespective of whether these responsibilities are integrated into existing local government functions or assigned to dedicated sub-national DRM structures operating under the national focal agency for DRM, they are often reported to be under-resourced and/or lacking skills and capacity for the tasks assigned to them. It is recommended that, when establishing or reviewing institutional structures for DRM, lawmakers and administrators ensure that these are sustainable in the long term within the available governmental resources. Resources should be allocated, and capacity strengthened as necessary including through training, to accompany new legislative responsibilities for DRR at the local level. It may also be useful to examine how local institutions could carry out their DRR responsibilities more effectively with increased community and civil society participation. Effective law and regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report \u2013 SUMMARY 17 18 No. 4 \u2013 Financing of disaster risk reduction in DRM law In view of competing priorities for resources, the country examples have shown that it is often difficult to ensure dedicated financing for DRR in the face of pressing response and recovery needs. Especially in poor countries where overall resourcing for DRM is an issue, it is recommended to introduce specific DRR resource streams under law", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fd65291-ba6b-4545-a540-e4593aaf4166": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fd65291-ba6b-4545-a540-e4593aaf4166", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Effective Law and Regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f987cee074b39233375dc81f9047b7ad0f8a12fcd3104ff3a6c7aab9124ae583"}}, "hash": "f987cee074b39233375dc81f9047b7ad0f8a12fcd3104ff3a6c7aab9124ae583", "text": "as an \u2018affirmative action\u2019 measure within DRM budgets. This could be achieved by establishing special national and/or local statutory funds dedicated to DRR gathered from a variety of funding sources, including from the private sector and external donors. It could also be achieved by mandating specific resource allocations at the national and local levels for DRR from DRM budgets, or by making federal DRR funds available for which local government and communities can apply directly. In view of the still limited information available on national level funding of DRR, the issue of effective national mechanisms for resource allocation for DRR in both legal and policy frameworks needs to be pursued further and would benefit from the involvement of country-level partners that are expert in the design and implementation of DRM financing. No. 5 \u2013 Participation of civil society and communities under DRM law Evidence from the country examples indicates that even when legal provisions mandate participation in DRR, they are not always easily implemented. In order to strengthen community based implementation of DRR, it is recommended that lawmakers consider including more comprehensive and detailed provisions in DRM laws that mandate the specific representation of civil society organizations and communities in DRM institutions and processes at the national and local levels. This is an important element in achieving a DRM system that is better adapted to the needs of those at risk from natural hazards, that takes account of local knowledge, and that supports communities in making informed choices about the risks they face and the related decisions that affect their lives. No. 6 \u2013 Inclusion of women and vulnerable groups in DRM law Greater inclusion of women and the most vulnerable in DRR planning and implementation is an important measure to prevent them from being disproportionally affected by disasters. While several country examples mandate the formal participation of women and vulnerable groups by law, in most cases, these legal provisions are merely aspirational statements. It is recommended, therefore, to mandate by law specific mechanisms that facilitate the representation of women and vulnerable groups in both national and local DRM institutions and processes. Since the study was not able to gather sufficient data on the implementation of legal provisions for the inclusion of women and vulnerable groups, this is an area that would lend itself to further in-depth research on legal provisions and practice concerning their involvement in DRR needs assessments, planning, implementation and institutions. No. 7 \u2013 Early warning and risk mapping in DRM legal frameworks The potential of legal frameworks to underpin the development of multi-hazard EWS has not yet been sufficiently exploited in most of the sample countries. It is recommended that lawmakers consider establishing clear roles and responsibilities for systematic national risk mapping and responsive multi-hazard EWS for different levels of government and technical institutions, and that they mandate the inclusion of communities in order to enhance opportunities to provide \u2018bottom-up\u2019 information. No. 8 \u2013 DRR education and public awareness in DRM legal frameworks Insufficient resources and capacity are identified as issues in the implementation of legal provisions on public education and awareness for DRR in a number of countries. This needs to be addressed in order to support a whole-of-society approach to DRR. It is recommended that DRM laws specifically assign legal mandates on community awareness, together with implementation mechanisms, and that consideration be given to the inclusion of corresponding provisions in both DRM and education laws concerning child and adult education. Recommendations on building, planning and environmental laws No. 9 \u2013 DRR in building codes and land use regulations Although many of the sample countries have legally enforceable building codes and land use planning laws, few of them specifically consider DRR within their provisions and they are rarely linked to existing DRM laws or institutions. In general, local government is responsible for their implementation, and a lack of capacity and resources at this level is identified as a major challenge for implementation in many lower- and middle-income countries, together with issues of compliance. It is recommended, therefore, that lawmakers and administrators: \u25cf review laws on building, construction and spatial planning to ensure that they cover the whole territory, are regularly updated to the latest natural hazard standards, and give appropriate priority to schools, hospitals and other public buildings as well as large commercial developments where significant numbers of people gather; \u25cf increase cross-sectoral coordination between building regulations, construction and spatial planning on the one hand, and DRR initiatives under DRM laws on the other hand; \u25cf promote safety regulations in the built environment as a key pillar of a whole-of- society approach to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61946021-839b-4329-b9d3-55d611f8badc": {"__data__": {"id_": "61946021-839b-4329-b9d3-55d611f8badc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Effective Law and Regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d9681abccb5565f0b48eec4e0d71517b45fa8c707ae83c54d6c8bba6bd0dc8c"}}, "hash": "5d9681abccb5565f0b48eec4e0d71517b45fa8c707ae83c54d6c8bba6bd0dc8c", "text": "DRR in order to reduce underlying risks and prevent the creation of new risks from natural hazards due to the nature of construction and urban development; \u25cf increase local technical capacity and resources to enforce building and spatial planning regulations; \u25cf use legal sanctions, where available, in cases of non-compliance leading to unsafe buildings or other developments that may increase risk levels, and introduce such sanctions where they are currently absent. No. 10 \u2013 DRR in legal provisions for informal settlements Only a few of the sample countries have legal provisions that comprehensively address public safety concerns in informal settlements. When residents face the insecurity of being evicted and their homes demolished, there is little incentive for them to take long-term DRR measures. It is recommended, therefore, that countries facing the issue of informal settlements in high-risk areas review their legal and policy frameworks in order to determine how they can be implemented more effectively to reduce disaster risk in informal urban settlements. This should include analysing issues related to residents\u2019 rights, as well as governmental duties to protect the public, options for gradual regularization under local governance, community and civil society participation and predicted population movement and growth. It is also recommended that further inter-disciplinary study be undertaken on DRR in informal urban settlements. No. 11 \u2013 DRR in legal provisions for environmental management and impact assessments The potential use of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) as a DRR tool needs to be explored further. However, it is recommended that lawmakers and administrators review legislative and policy mechanisms for environmental management through a \u2018DRR lens\u2019. This will ensure that these laws provide a national (or state) umbrella for environmental management, which includes objectives concerning the safety of people, their property and livelihoods that relate to management of natural hazard risks. Ideally, these objectives should also apply to new risks from the effects of climate change. Legal provisions on environmental management should also feature some form of EIA for new major constructions or other large developments that include specific criteria on natural hazard risks and provide a strong voice for communities and civil society organizations in the assessment process. UNDP-supplied sprinklers help small-scale farmers grow food during the dry season and improve income. \u00a9Tom Cheatham/UNDP Effective law and regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report \u2013 SUMMARY 19 20 No. 12 \u2013 DRR and climate change adaptation laws Laws that integrate DRR, CCA and development planning into one coherent approach are likely to result in better risk governance. However, in most sample countries, CCA is administered in the environmental sector quite separately from the DRM system, and also from local land planning regimes. It is recommended that both environmental and DRM laws include provisions for cross-sectoral coordination that establish more systematic integration of policies, plans and programmes across the adaptation, DRR and development continuum. No. 13 \u2013 DRR in natural resource management laws There is significant potential to better integrate natural resource management laws to support DRR with regard to water management and the risk of floods and droughts, as well as the related areas of forest and land management. Each of these areas constitutes a substantial field in its own right and could not be adequately covered by the report. Hence, further investigating the potential of legal frameworks for natural resource management to promote the reduction of risks from floods, droughts and wild fires would be particularly useful. In addition, it is recommended to establish cross-sectoral links and include community and stakeholder participation in a more integrated approach. Recommendations on cross- cutting areas of law in support of DRR No. 14 \u2013 Constitutional and human rights in support of disaster risk reduction An understanding of how human rights relate to DRR can be an important avenue for advocacy, especially on behalf of the poorest and most vulnerable groups. This report was able to provide only partial coverage of this topic. Analysing whether and how human rights are claimed to promote and advocate for DRR, or to compensate for disaster losses would be an important area of focus for future research. This should also include a closer look at the potential of such an approach to reinforce governmental duties for DRR. No. 15 \u2013 Legal accountability, responsibility and liability for DRR Based on the report\u2019s preliminary findings on reporting, accountability, responsibility and liability for DRR, it has become evident that further study is needed on the range of such mechanisms in use for both DRM laws and sectoral laws. This should include a more detailed investigation of a wider range of practice, including stakeholders\u2019 views on the policy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7719679f-d49e-43de-be6c-2fed6fc9767e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7719679f-d49e-43de-be6c-2fed6fc9767e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Effective Law and Regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3479be3ac188de0262e987a5d15fa807cfc11f5aa54cdba4fbb5cba13e7dd0f6"}}, "hash": "3479be3ac188de0262e987a5d15fa807cfc11f5aa54cdba4fbb5cba13e7dd0f6", "text": "arguments for or against such mechanisms in supporting effective DRR, based on the four identified issues of: \u25cf legal mandates for transparent reporting and parliamentary oversight; \u25cf the use of administrative sanctions, including both internal government procedures and access to administrative tribunals; \u25cf legal liability of government officials and agencies, especially regarding development planning and the reduction of underlying risk; \u25cf legal liability of private individuals and corporations, particularly regarding compliance with safety regulations in building and construction. No. 16 \u2013 Legal frameworks for disaster insurance and other risk sharing mechanisms Also, the findings on legal frameworks to encourage disaster insurance and other risk- sharing financial mechanisms have highlighted a need for further analysis, ideally in partnership with key stakeholders on insurance and cost- sharing for disaster losses, with a focus on how these legislative schemes can best support a DRR approach. No. 17 \u2013 Customary law and DRR It is recommended that further studies be undertaken on the impact of customary law on DRR. Based on the experience in preparing this report, it would appear that an inter-disciplinary approach with local and community partners is likely to be the most effective, examining in greater detail the impact of customary rules on DRR in specific communities, and in a range of countries where customary law is recognized. These studies should aim to address how customary laws can support local DRR, including the needs of women, socially excluded and vulnerable people, and how traditionally organized communities can be better connected with national and regional DRR systems.

Access to affordable modern energy services can improve their productivity and enhance their living standards. Even so, there are no specific targets for the energy sector in the Millennium Declaration, a historic document signed seven years ago by the world\u2019s leaders. Affordable and sustainable modern energy services are a necessity for countries to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Efforts of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet these aims will be hindered unless adequate attention is paid to the crucial role energy services play in the development process. This is particularly true for the economic, environmental and social well-being of the poor. With fluctuating energy prices, the poor in many countries in the Asia and Pacific region face a daunting future. For them, access to affordable and essential modern energy services, which could improve their living conditions and ensure a means to earn a living, will fall outside their reach. Recognizing the urgency for countries to factor in access to modern energy services, particularly when shaping national poverty reduction initiatives, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided technical and financial support for national-level rapid energy assessments. The primary aim of this work, carried out through UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) and completed in 2006, was to identify gaps and priority needs in linking energy services provision with poverty reduction. The framework for rapid gap assessments linking energy and poverty was developed as a joint effort of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) and UNDP country offices in the region, with the support of experts from the region. The draft framework was discussed at two sub-regional meetings, one held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005), and the other in Apia, Samoa (September 2005). The meetings were helpful in customizing the framework to suit specific needs and circumstances of the participating countries. Subsequently, the UNDP country offices held national-level stakeholder consultations to consolidate the findings and recommendations of the assessments. This work benefited immensely from the support of government officials and representatives of civil society. Documented in individual country reports, this work serves as a resource and reference material for programming and planning for access to modern energy services for the underserved, particularly, the poor. This document is a summary of the Country Report on Bangladesh and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the country report, summarizes the challenges faced at the national level and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to energy policy, including institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, priority programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support are highlighted. It offers a way forward, outlining issues and options for the country. Our hope is that this document will be of relevance to national policy- makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organizations and academia in implementing various measures to promote access to modern energy services for the poor.

Per capita energy consumption is one of the lowest in the region, and a large proportion of the population is highly dependent on biomass fuels. Estimates reflect that as much as 85 percent of the rural populace still meets its energy needs from straw, jute stick, animal dung and fuelwood. This study examines critical energy access linked poverty issues in Bangladesh, including the institutional structure of the energy sector, policy and regulatory framework and sectoral programmes. It analyses reasons for the narrow reach of energy services to rural provinces, unsustainable dependence on traditional fuels and inefficient technologies, the restricted supply of energy by rural energy enterprises and inadequate means of financing for energy sector projects and programmes. It highlights the urgent need for key data and indicators to support energy monitoring and evaluation of energy access for areas that are least served. This report concludes that the lack of a clear and responsive mechanism mandated to coordinate the entire energy sector is a major constraint to the creation of a comprehensive pro-poor energy strategy. Such an institution could be established or an existing one could be strengthened to enhance and facilitate inter-agency coordination. The proposed institution could provide a socio-economic vision and a poverty reduction road map to the entire energy sector. It could bring together fragmented energy markets; remove barriers to efficient functioning of existing and new markets; promote the exchange of information; PREFACE vii Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh viii Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES encourage coordination; and avoid duplication of efforts among various isolated players. Experiences elsewhere show that policy convergence through consultative and coordinating mechanisms at the highest institutional level does help synergize energy access to overall development strategies in a country. Many promising initiatives already exist both at national and household levels in Bangladesh. Through national budget allocations over the last decade, the Government has provided substantial support to conventional energy development, with about 20 percent of total public sector investments in the different plans allocated for the sector. National Energy Policy, 1996, recognized the role of energy in socio- economic development and mandated the Government to provide access to commercial energy to rural population. The policy proposed to establish a renewable development agency to promote renewable energy technologies in the country. SEP (Sustainable Energy Programme), initiated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), is among the nation\u2019s first attempts at creating a sustainable environment for human and economic development in rural areas. Based on this success, UNDP and the Power Division of Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources formulated a long-term programme framework in 2005 for sustainable energy development in line with the country\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The programme framework was designed as a pro-poor, market-oriented application of sustainable energy service delivery systems. The commitment of the Government of Bangladesh to expand energy services for poverty reduction \u2013 especially to achieve the key goal of 100 percent rural electrification \u2013 to support pro-poor economic growth is highly commendable. Under the national programme framework developed jointly with the UNDP, a seven-year national SEP has been formulated to address energy and development issues in a sustainable manner. SEP aims at holistic approach, from national to grass-roots levels, to integrate livelihood improvement into energy provision strategy including policy interventions, institutional reforms, capacity building of key players and research and development. The success of these programmes will largely depend on the Government\u2019s commitment and follow through at the decentralized institutional levels. To veer away from current \u2018grid expansion\u2019 approach to a more successful nationwide access to energy service approach, the rural electrification programme should be part of a wider development plan, such as a rural energy development programme, that aims to remove disparities in standards of living between the urban and rural areas as well ix Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES as strengthen rural economy by introduction of productive uses of energy services. We trust that this report is unique in terms of giving insights into bridging the gaps between the access to energy and poverty reduction efforts in the context of Bangladesh. Our aim is to provide country- specific information on institutional structures, energy resources, policy recommendations, and capacity and financial gaps that can point the way towards improving access to modern energy services, particularly for the poor.

Bangladesh is also highly dependent on biomass fuels. Of the total energy consumption in Bangladesh, biomass fuels account for 54 percent and the balance comes from commercial fuels, namely, natural gas, oil, electricity and coal. Low electricity coverage,2 high demand\u2013supply gap and frequent supply disruptions (UNESCAP 2001, 2002 and 2005) are other problems associated with the electricity sector. Issues of energy security and non-access to electricity by roughly 60 percent of the total population remain as major concerns in the form of excessive pressure on biomass reserves leading to deforestation. Rural electrification programme, the core of rural energy programme, began in Bangladesh in 1977 when electricity supply to rural households was almost negligible. By 2003, it was able to extend grid coverage to about 40 percent of rural households. The rural\u2013urban disparity is glaringly evident in terms of the type of energy source (Figure 1).

Source BBS (2002) energy deprivation include drudgery for rural women and children burdened with the task of collecting, processing and using biomass, as well as health impacts related to indoor air pollution (IAP). The development of informal rural markets for even low-quality traditional biomass sources (for example, rice husk and animal dung) indicates an impending rural energy crisis, with prices of even the most basic fuel sources spiralling out of the reach of the very poor. Natural gas is Bangladesh\u2019s most significant source of commercial energy, with production of 420.6 billion cubic feet (about 48.8 million barrels of oil equivalent) in 2003. It accounted for about 70 percent of commercial primary energy consumption in 2003, with imported oil and hydropower production making up the balance (Figure 3). The principal natural gas consuming sectors include the power sector, the fertilizer industry and bulk retail including residential/commercial, captive power and transport. Captive power plants and compressed natural gas plants have emerged as fast-growing natural gas consumers. All these consumers more or less completely rely on natural gas, leaving the overall economy vulnerable to any disruptions in gas supply. This vulnerability is of even greater concern since current production levels of about 0.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) per year may lead to the depletion of the currently known recoverable reserves in the near future (MoPEMR 2006). Mining of coal reserves of about 1.4 billion tonnes (38.5 Tcf gas equivalent) is under way in northern districts (GoB 2006). Excessive dependence on natural gas leaves the overall economy vulnerable to any disruptions in gas supply.

Rural electrification has been made a key goal and the Government has targeted 100 percent electrification of all 84,000 villages in the country by 2020 (GoB 2004a). The national emphasis on rural electrification is also reflected in the national Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which identified rural electrification as a key area to foster economic growth with a pro-poor orientation (GoB 2005). However, the big challenge for Bangladesh is to increase access to electricity, ensuring that the poor are not excluded. Interestingly, compared to their urban counterparts, rural Bangladeshi consumers receive fewer subsidies, pay their bills more promptly and engage in less pilferage. The widening gap between the rich and the poor, however, could lead to greater challenges. FIGURE 3 PRIMARY COMMERCIAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY SOURCE, 2003 Source Samrina (2004) THE CHALLENGES Centralized institutional setting T he broader and ambitious policy goals for development and utilization of clean energy systems and technologies, and judicious and efficient utilization of domestic resources and energy, ensuring supply of energy to rural areas, have given rise to multiple institutions/ agencies with specific or overlapping missions/mandates. These multiple institutions, including ministries and their departments, and the public sector have posed greater challenges of coordination (Table 1). Reforms were initiated to encourage competition and bring in efficiency and better accountability. Power sector reforms brought forward greater challenges of governance as reforms did not yield the desired impact in 5 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES TABLE 1 THE ENERGY INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE BASED ON FUNCTION Function Investment and policy planning Project formulation and management Strategic and operational oversight and administration Rural energy provision Private\u2013public partnership programme Regulation Responsibility P The National Economic Council (NEC) holds the primary responsibility for investment and policy planning.

P There are no linkages between rural development institutions and energy service providers at national or local levels, thereby inhibiting the growth of rural energy services. P Energy sector institutions behave autonomously and interact little among themselves, and thus their policies and programmes are non- synergistic and often contradict each other. P There is a general lack of experience among national economic planners in the area of linkage between energy and poverty.

PBS is a consumer-owned, independent entity, which distributes electricity to its members and other consumers. Despite this arrangement, the following major factors have limited the delivery of modern energy services to the poorer section of the population. P Limited resources (both monetary and human), given the challenge of reaching out to about 60 million poor living in rural areas. P Weak policy orientation for supply-side management, development of traditional energy supply systems and meeting urban requirements. P Limited institutional capacities to link energy provision and poverty reduction. P A top-heavy, control-and-command structure for energy service delivery despite commitment to decentralization/partnerships. 7 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES Policy and regulatory framework The current policies for energy sector establish guiding principles to promote further use of clean and indigenous energy sources; attain energy self-sufficiency; accelerate rural electrification to improve the quality of rural life; and continue reforms, deregulation, corporatization and privatization of the energy sector to promote efficiency. The major energy sector policies are listed below. P \u2018National Energy Policy (NEP), 1996\u2019 establishing guidelines and specified targets for the overall development of the energy sector. P \u2018Private Power Generation Policy, 1996\u2019 establishing guidelines to encourage private sector investments in electricity generation. Following the enactment of the law, an agency called the \u2018Power Cell\u2019 was created to oversee private power generation projects. P \u2018Small Power Generation Policy, 1998\u2019 designed to encourage private investment in small (up to 10 MW) electricity generation plants. The primary reason for a separate policy was to target smaller plants to augment rural energy supply. P A \u2018Draft National Energy Policy, 2004\u2019. P A \u2018Draft Renewable Energy Policy\u2019 has been prepared by the Power Cell of MoPEMR to promote rural energy programmes. The 1996 NEP was the first comprehensive document spelling out the Government policy on commercial and non-commercial energy. Based on NEP, a number of plans were formulated to address issues relating to small power, private power, captive power and hydrocarbon development and its use. NEP recognizes the role of energy in socio-economic development and mandates the Government to provide access to commercial energy to people in rural areas, especially to those who do not have access to biomass. The Draft Power System Master Plan Update 2006 estimates that energy supply must increase by about 7.9 percent per year if Bangladesh is to sustain economic growth at the 5.2 percent level (ADB and GoB 2006). The requisite rate of growth in energy supply is considered achievable, given the country\u2019s available natural resources, boosted through some imports.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7382f61e-6f82-46cf-bdb8-2699a4310d19": {"__data__": {"id_": "7382f61e-6f82-46cf-bdb8-2699a4310d19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92b2e5b51df61b881392aa15c50531c72ac587d74c826b358d6516a716d4afd7"}, "2": {"node_id": "2dea4adb-4688-4f18-9fc8-ec6a3daaa469", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b5bee8ef726553618f178bee262e12d2dddbf71fd340cb36f2b6ba8cc90caab"}}, "hash": "b66e5a2165ee87df5d5d449ba53d5fdabb47c28c8300b1eb44d822ed7ae800d6", "text": "NEP addresses energy issues of rural areas with greater focus.

In the absence of any potential linkage of energy solutions for productive purposes, most energy technologies face considerable financial barrier. The policy framework has been complemented by regulatory mechanism for the energy sector in Bangladesh. The Government has established BERC in 2003 (GoB 2003). Since then, regulation of the energy sector is being gradually taken over by BERC, which performs the following functions. P Frame rules and regulations to protect the interests of the consumers and the industry. P Establish and approve tariffs. P Set codes and standards and enforce these. P Permit, license and repeal or amend such permits. P Promote competition. P Advise the Government on energy sector policies and programme development. Policies for each sub-sector, such as Power Policy, Petroleum Policy, Private Sector Policy and now the Draft Renewable Energy Policy, have been promulgated. These policies have, in effect, made these sub-sectors act independently with no linkages with the policies and programmes of other sub-sectors. This lack of coordination in policies and programmes is visible in the functioning of sub-agencies or companies under the ministries of these sub-sectors. For instance, sub-sectors such as energy and minerals do not coordinate their policies and programmes with each other, but they do coordinate with the power sector independently. Therefore, the current situation of having several policies with no synergies among them may lead to policy confusion in the energy sector. This scenario may even weaken the regulatory environment. What is missing is policy convergence through a consultative or coordinating mechanism at the institutional level in these sub-sectors. Until today, few of the reforms carried out over the years have had the results intended in the policy documents. Reforms have focused on un- bundling assets, structural changes in institutions and management reorganization, but, in practice, these were essentially de-concentration measures and not decentralization. Lack of autonomy to the new institutional set-up as part of reforms remains a concern. With no major change in the mindsets of the senior management, the new institutions function exactly as the parent organizations, and, thus, challenging the intent and purpose of the reforms. In addition, centralized decision- 9 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES BOX 2: KEY POLICY AND REGULATORY CHALLENGES P Energy policies have no strong linkages with policies in other key sectors and with ministries such as agriculture, industries, transportation and rural development. P Policies in sub-sectors (for example, power, petroleum, private and renewable energy) of the energy sector in Bangladesh need convergence through a formal consultative or coordinating mechanism to avoid policy confusion. P Continued support to loss-making operations and entities makes the energy sector financially vulnerable. Further, the energy sector suffers from inefficiency and does not provide quality services. P Electricity should be made accessible at a reasonable and affordable price to fulfil the Government of Bangladesh\u2019s vision of providing \u2018Electricity for All by 2020\u2019. P There is an urgent need for transparency and accountability in awarding contracts to the private sector. making within the Board continues without unravelling the creative potential of an independent management. Fragmented programme framework in the energy sector There are many programmes in the energy sector. The fundamental problems associated with programmes for increasing supply of energy include the ones listed below. P Inadequate supply of modern fuels P Constraints of adequate foreign exchange P Budget constraints for making heavy investment to generate electricity P Narrow programme focus to improve equitable energy accessibility P Inadequate institutional and personnel capacity to implement policies P Lack of appropriate national and regional partnerships Programmes in the energy and poverty reduction sectors are being implemented on a stand-alone mode. The interventions in renewable energy programmes are further disaggregated into technology-specific programmes on biogas, solar, micro-hydro and so on. Poverty reduction programmes focus on such issues as livelihood creation and micro-credit without much assessment of the needed support infrastructure. This is evident from the nature of interventions. There were no attempts to link Energy- and poverty- related programmes are being implemented on a stand- alone mode. 10 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES poverty reduction with energy provision.

It does not cover aspects of potential impact on these sectors through better provision of energy services for agro-processing or cold storage. This was perhaps due to the state of knowledge and the existing paradigms. Energy was always thought of in terms of electricity, whether captive or grid and, therefore, was considered too large to have any synergy with rural programmes. Even the Government\u2019s five-year plans reflect the state of knowledge. Energy was a supply issue involving large investments. The orientation of the Government towards supply management and its focus on urban areas has guided the Government programmes in the past. Therefore, programmes have always concentrated on development of conventional energy and exploitation of indigenous hydrocarbon resources. PRSP, a major document guiding Government investment, does not focus specifically on effective measures and investments to link energy and poverty reduction. The rural energy programmes have made considerable progress in increasing the grid coverage but have failed in two major aspects\u2014systems stability and in creating conditions to enable access by the rural poor. In some cases, these programmes have been unable to bring the rural poor under coverage even in villages that have been electrified. This is partly because little effort has been made to organize them into formal or informal organizations that could assist them to access electricity for productive use to raise their income possibilities. In addition, there is lack of innovative programmes to reduce the initial financial burden. BOX 3: KEY CHALLENGES TO FRAMING BALANCED PROGRAMMES P The focus of most programmes remains limited to conventional electrification. Little attention is paid to livelihood options. The Government\u2019s appreciation of sustainable energy needs must be substantially complemented through appropriate policy, institutional and financial support. P Sustainable energy development in Bangladesh is not a key development agenda of most international development partners. Most donor activities focus on awareness building and advocacy, but not on sustainable energy development as such. 11 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES Discussions with focus groups indicated that there is a large gap in information sharing among promoters of RET programmes. The efforts currently under way to disseminate RETs are at a nascent stage. Knowledge sharing, therefore, is not only expedient but also necessary to avoid duplication of coverage areas. Inadequate attention to energy efficiency Mirroring the substantial energy inefficiency and the glaring lack of energy conservation measures, the environmental impact of Bangladesh\u2019s energy use is disproportionately high. Energy-efficiency improvements, whether voluntary or not, can play a key role in improving industry efficiency levels, leading to energy savings. The Power Division has estimated that about 445 megawatts (MW) peak power demand can be saved by replacing all the present energy-consuming normal bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps. Even a conservative estimate shows that energy efficiency in lighting alone could approximately save 100 MW peak power demand through voluntary initiation of energy efficiency improvement and/or conservation measures in domestic and industrial sectors (GoB 2004a). The energy efficiency sector faces challenges in actual implementation. Recommendations from several energy assessments and analyses carried out in various industrial units by the Energy Audit Cell, a sub-unit of the Power Division, are yet to be translated into action. Lack of effective institutional and enforcing mechanisms and incentives to adopt energy-efficient measures have dampened the urgency for these initiatives. The Government\u2019s thrust to create awareness in these areas is reported to have remained low. A few past initiatives focused on improving fuel efficiency in the transport sector and brick-making industry. In 1999, the Bangladesh Environment Management Project, funded by the Canadian International Development Agency started an efficient technology diffusion process in the transport sector. The project now shows signs of success, which need to be replicated. The policy changes are yet to be in place for effective facilitating of energy efficiency enhancement across other sectors. Inefficient use of biomass fuel for cooking, a major livelihood energy need in rural Bangladesh, leads to high levels of IAP. Ninety percent of domestic cooking energy needs are met through traditional biomass resources. While global estimates on IAP are available, there is lack of documentation of such impacts in Bangladesh. Based on such information, effective strategies for meeting cooking energy needs in rural Bangladesh could be devised. Approximately, 100-445 MW peak power demand can be saved in domestic and industrial sectors through energy efficiency and conservation measures in lighting alone. 12 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES Switching to a cleaner fuel on a large scale does not seem to be a feasible option in Bangladesh due to high prices of the cleaner alternatives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f9b19e1-7b02-4e8d-ad5b-720c37cf1ac1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f9b19e1-7b02-4e8d-ad5b-720c37cf1ac1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c75a7ada8b8cd29052e31b7f31026df5d89a59804b78364245c3546e6fd6f273"}, "3": {"node_id": "926e9b7e-3b30-4e6f-bd18-11ac7c58d24e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e48794d03fa7c3821ffc4e80b9b08a084d01146c4502d40ad9f742ef65e2c2c8"}}, "hash": "ace48419e77c1cd9230a294cc070ab685c09bf85835fae9774b880971ed14052", "text": "Different types of energy-efficient cook stoves have been developed by the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. These improved stoves have the potential to save 50\u201365 percent of fuel and cooking time compared to traditional stoves (Hossain 2003). However, these designs have not caught on because of lack of innovative service delivery mechanisms involving rural women to ensure smooth operation and maintenance. BOX 4: KEY ENERGY EFFICIENCY CHALLENGES P In general, energy conservation and efficiency have received limited and fragmented attention in Bangladesh despite the high cost of delivery of modern energy services. People are not aware of the opportunities related to energy conservation and efficiency measures. P Specifically, efficient use of biomass in the domestic sector is not paid adequate attention despite the fact that IAP is the single largest environmental risk factor for female mortality and high rate of respiratory infections in children. Lack of focus on renewable energy Renewable energy has not yet been institutionalized in the energy development plans and programmes in Bangladesh. Past initiatives on renewable energy have been few and uncoordinated. At the national level, the Government has been too preoccupied with conventional power. However, numerous interventions and projects have been initiated by different bodies with funding from donor agencies (Asian Development Bank [ADB], Swedish International Development Agency, United States Agency for International Development [USAID], United Nations Development Programme [UNDP] and others). These efforts cannot be categorized as being part of any national renewable energy approach or initiative but remain individual efforts of government bodies/non-government institutions as thought appropriate by project proponents. Nevertheless, these initiatives have brought about a reasonable level of understanding of RETs. For example, Grameen Shakti, a subsidiary of the Grameen Bank, had implemented over 50,000 solar home systems (SHSs) in different rural Efficient use of biomass in the domestic sector has not been paid adequate attention. 13 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES areas up to November 2005. This was done under the SHS Programme of the Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (IDCOL), which demonstrated a market-based approach for SHSs. Other prominent players in the promotion and development of RETs are BRAC (a non- governmental organization [NGO]) and Rahim Afrooz Bangladesh Ltd. About 20 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s rural areas are estimated to be beyond the reach of conventional grid electricity in the foreseeable future (Islam 2005). The cited reasons are remoteness, natural barriers (rivers, islands), scattered nature of households and high aggregate cost of grid network. Therefore, RETs like solar photovoltaic, biogasifiers and wind turbines would need to be put in place for remote area electrification in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. The ADB-funded Promotion of Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and Greenhouse Gas Abatement project reviewed the status of existing sources of renewable energy, those planned for the next five years, and future potential based on estimates of renewable resources. Another study that highlighted the need for energy efficiency and renewable energy intervention for Bangladesh is the Asia Least-cost Greenhouse Gas Strategy Project, funded by UNDP and Global Environment Facility (GEF). Although different agencies have arrived at different figures, the potential of renewable energy to generate electricity and income in far-flung and remote locations is beyond question. Despite this, the focus on research and development (R&D), technology standards and off-the-shelf renewable energy solutions for rural energy requirements both for subsistence and productive uses is critically absent. Renewable energy technologies need to be deployed in remote areas in a cost- effective manner. BOX 5: KEY CHALLENGES TO DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY OPTIONS P Limited knowledge of renewable energy market potential hinders the intensification of private sector presence in the renewable energy sector in Bangladesh. P The market is distorted due to subsidized or grant-based hardware installation programmes. P There are no sustainable, ready-to-implement business models for renewable energy technologies. P There are no financial incentives for renewable energy development. In fact, the involvement of the financial sector in the renewable energy sector is lacking, perhaps because there is no capacity within financial institutions to appraise renewable energy proposals for loans/grants. 14 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES Constraints related to energy entrepreneurship Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro-enterprises are recognized as vital for development.

Some efforts are already under way. Prokaushali Sangsad Ltd, a private organization, supported the DC (direct current) Lamp Enterprise in Char Montaz, where a women-owned cooperative not only sells solar power lighting systems to rural households on a sustainable basis but also installs and maintains systems. Renewable energy options offer great opportunities for SMEs in energy entrepre- neurship. BOX 6: KEY CHALLENGES TO PROVIDING AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR ENERGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP P Community service providers, local vendors and small manufacturers lack the technical and business capacity to become entrepreneurs in the energy business. P Existing rural electrification programmes are focused on lighting, and neglect other productive uses of energy. P The cost of energy service delivery is high for remote locations, considering the low purchasing power of people. P The existing slow government procedures make it difficult for energy-based entrepreneurship to flourish. Also, there are no incentives for banks or other financial organizations to provide soft loans to motivate private sector investment. P There is no support service mechanism for low-cost appropriate energy technologies for SMEs. P There are limited training and development opportunities for energy-based entrepreneurship. Capacity development of key stakeholders of rural-based SMEs has been few and far between. The model of technology support diffusion that proved successful in the brick-kiln technology project (funded by UNDP and GEF) needs to be upscaled, with demonstration and technical capacity development for other smaller enterprises across rural Bangladesh. 15 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES On the other hand, energy-dependent enterprises in rural and remote areas have limited local capacity to assess their energy needs and local resources due to insufficient knowledge of equipment, services and related issues. As a result, SMEs depend largely on traditional fuels and use inefficient technologies for energy conversion. It is imperative to assess their energy requirements, develop alternative energy options and design an appropriate and comprehensive energy system. In spite of the potential for energy entrepreneurship, little effort has been undertaken to upscale and replicate some of the experiences on a wider scale. The major constraint is the absence of Government support. Other constraints are irregular and inadequate supply of electricity (Sarder 2001) and non-availability of financing and knowledge-sharing mechanisms. Even micro-credit, which is now gradually shifting to financing production activities, has been slow to finance energy-based income-generating activities. Gender concerns The Fourth Five-Year Plan (1990\u201395) highlights \u2018gender\u2019 and adopted the objectives of \u2018Women in Development\u2019 policy. This policy incorporates concerns of women\u2019s participation in public decision-making, productivity and income, nutrition and health. Furthermore, the Government is committed to implementing the Platform for Action (PFA) adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in September 1995. PFA emphasizes the strategy of bringing women\u2019s development into the mainstream of Government policies and programmes. Since then, gender equity has become a cross-cutting issue in most development programmes/projects globally. However, women in Bangladesh still do not enjoy improved access to modern energy services. Most rural households continue to depend on biomass as a major source of energy for cooking. The dominance of biomass in energy consumption translates into drudgery for women as they are the primary collectors of biomass, as well as its victims, since IAP is caused by biomass burning. Inadequate electricity supply and non- availability of financing and knowledge- sharing mechanisms hamper energy entrepre- neurship.

A large part of this funding must come from the Government resources, private domestic sources and from foreign investment flows. Energy programme financing in Bangladesh has been traditionally donor-driven, whether in the commercial sector or in RETs. However, over the last decade, the Government has also provided substantial support to conventional energy development, with about 20 percent of total public- sector investments in the different plan periods being allocated for the sector. The investments are still inadequate to meet the growing demand for energy services, both in terms of quantity and quality. It has been recognized that getting funds from multilateral and bilateral institutions under soft loans and grants has become increasingly competitive over the years. In this context, the need to tap emerging opportunities under the clean development mechanism (CDM) as well as resources under GEF is becoming more important. The first registered CDM project in Bangladesh, on waste-to-electricity generation, is worth US $6.5 million. The World Bank and GEF are supporting IDCOL\u2019s SHS Programme with other development partners. The Power Division under MoPEMR has been supported by the World Bank \u2013 and also by ADB, USAID and German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) \u2013 in its energy efficiency and conservation measures for peak power demand and energy audits. A project on improving brick-kiln energy efficiency was designed in 2006. UNDP and GEF are expected to start implementing the full-scale project in 2008. Investments are inadequate to meet the growing demand for energy services, both in terms of quantity and quality. 17 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES The UNDP Country Office is also expecting resources from GEF for its national programme on sustainable energy. However, all these non- conventional financial resources are very limited when compared to those available to neighbouring developing countries such as India and Nepal. It is important to recognize that different financial products and mechanisms must be developed for different applications. For instance, micro-credit, which is well developed in Bangladesh, could be energized to finance energy access by rural people. There is scope for innovative financial mechanisms but would require legal and regulatory support, lower collaterals and risk mitigating measures. There are missed opportunities of not effectively engaging the financial sector on a microfinancing scale, which would permit smaller enterprises to access financing. Several measures can be taken: (1) a special funding pool could be created to finance small-scale distribution systems; (2) fiscal support mandating lower interest costs could finance other small-scale rural energy projects; and (3) on the macro-level, large-scale financing must also use a combination of financing packages. Weak monitoring and evaluation system The existing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system in Bangladesh is largely project-specific. The institutional responsibility for M&E for the Government-supported projects rests with the Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation Division (IMED) of PC. IMED monitors over 1,200 projects of the Annual Development Programme (ADP) and BOX 8: KEY CHALLENGES TO FACILITATE EASIER ACCESS TO FINANCE P Few opportunities outside microfinance institutions are available for energy project financing. P Non-conventional financing options such as clean development mechanism have not been fully explored. P Slow government procedures and lack of transparency in the process demoralize the private sector from getting involved in energy sector projects. P Government incentives to support energy entrepreneurship are virtually non-existent.

The direct-calorie-intake method and the cost-of-basic- needs method are used officially to measure poverty. Poverty is often linked with food insecurity, income, nutrition and water supply and such information is available at the national level. However, there is a dearth of information on programmes for energy service provision, particularly for rural areas. There are two major reasons for this lack of information: (1) relevance of poverty in energy programmes/projects is not 19 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES understood in general and (2) a national management information system (MIS) for energy initiatives is missing. With low awareness levels on available energy costs and options and efficient utilization patterns, communities are further constrained in availing themselves of programmes best suited to their local requirements and purchasing capacities. There is no common platform at the national or local level to share experiences and exchange information on the benefits of rural energy intervention. Moreover, the studies that are available have been carried out by implementing agencies themselves, and not by independent bodies.

Further, the strategies need to be specific enough for MEETING THE CHALLENGES the country to derive clear and quantifiable benefits. Suggested below are a few ideas that could make a difference in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in general and addressing energy and poverty concerns in particular. Effective coordination mechanisms through a designated nodal agency The current institutional arrangements are inadequate to meet the twin challenges of rural energy and poverty. In this context, there is a need for a vehicle to promote and monitor the development of the energy sector as a whole. An independent nodal agency, the Sustainable Energy Development Agency (SEDA), is being envisaged as MoPEMR\u2019s focal point pertaining to energy and poverty. SEDA can be mandated by the Government to undertake sectoral coordination and formulate/modify/implement policies and strategic MEETING THE CHALLENGES 20 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES action plans. The agency should develop long-term plans to achieve the Government\u2019s vision of \u2018Electricity for All by 2020\u2019. SEDA should build its internal capacity as well as the capacity of the key stakeholders including the Government, NGOs, financial institutions (FIs), civil society and private sector. It should also establish and maintain a Sustainable Energy Development Fund to support various types of energy projects/ initiatives. SEDA could be mandated to facilitate the integration of livelihood priorities into energy access for economically disadvantaged communities. It could also promote market-based commercial instruments for mainstreaming sustainable energy. Further, a centre for coordinating all renewable energy activities is proposed, which could be linked to SEDA. Policy convergence for a unified approach A key input for linking energy provision with poverty reduction is to develop and pass enabling legislation, policy statements and government mandates to support rural and renewable energy development and access services. To improve the master planning process for electrification, it is imperative to determine the most economical method of providing electricity: grid extension, distributed or district grids, or off-grid solutions. The energy policy needs to clearly spell out modalities to improve access to electricity in electrified villages and requires REB to set aside a percentage of connections for the poor. It would be desirable to put in place a new energy policy modifying the 1996 NEP. UNDP and GTZ worked on a draft NEP together with the Government. The work was completed in 2006 and the draft NEP was submitted to the Government. The draft NEP is a consolidation and harmonization of all existing disparate policies in the power sector. For the first time it includes sustainable energy as one of the priority areas, in addition to conventional power, coal, gas and petroleum. Recent events in Bangladesh have, however, delayed the formal adoption of the draft NEP.

The impact of \u2018effective\u2019 policy reforms, however, can be seen in the case of REB. A study by the Asian Institute of Technology in May 2004 MEETING THE CHALLENGES 21 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES found that policy reforms leading to institutional restructuring improved the rate of electrification for the poor in Bangladesh to 19 percent in the post-reform period as compared to 0.2 percent in the pre-reform period. Programme framework to promote renewable energy technologies and address the concerns of the poor Bangladesh has its national energy policy, development plan, strategies and road map for power sector reform. The initiatives taken by the energy sector players aim at creating appropriate and enabling conditions, including a legal framework, for improved public sector performance and attracting private and multilateral capital flows on a significant scale. For instance, the Government has approved a Three-Year Road Map for Power Sector Reform (2006\u20132008) elaborating sector reform and investment plan in the mid-term. It has also set some yearly targets and six-monthly rolling goals. The Road Map should be effectively used to guide intervention measures. UNDP\u2019s Sustainable Rural Energy (SRE) Programme is among the first attempts at creating a sustainable environment for human and economic development of rural areas.4 The programme\u2019s strategic approach was to build community-based natural resource management capacity and to promote, demonstrate and assist in the transfer of technologies related to the use of renewable energy in off-grid areas. Based on the experience gained in the SRE Programme, the UNDP and the Power Division of MoPEMR formulated a long-term programme framework in 2005 for sustainable energy development in line with PRSP and to achieve the MDGs. The programme framework is designed as a pro-poor, market- oriented application of sustainable energy service delivery systems. The programme will not only demonstrate renewable/clean energy and energy-efficient projects but also develop energy conservation measures for the poor and low-income communities as well as for the industrial and commercial sectors. The Government is in a position to accord the required priority to the implementation of the national programme framework developed jointly with the UNDP. As per this framework, a seven-year national Sustainable Energy Programme (SEP) has been formulated to address sustainable energy issues. This includes policy-level interventions, institutional reforms (including the establishment of SEDA), national communication strategy and campaigns on sustainable energy, capacity building of key 4 The SRE Programme is under the Sustainable Environment Management Programme, which is a follow-up to the National Environment Management Action Plan.

The programme includes renewable and other clean energy technologies as well as energy efficiency and conservation. The programme is expected to raise the income of the targeted rural communities, diversify their livelihood options and significantly improve their quality of life through energy interventions. It will also provide alternative and efficient energy models for commercial use, thus contributing to the conservation of power. The success of the programme will largely depend on the Government\u2019s commitment and level of internalization of the approaches. The Government can also consider another long-term programme framework for the conventional energy sector, seeking the support of international agencies. The programme framework should consider poverty reduction as an integral part of conventional energy expansion, and build strong linkages with SEP. A knowledge bank could be established and administered by the Government, and frequent knowledge-sharing workshops be held for integrating household energy programmes with those of rural development. These can have the desired outcome of women\u2019s economic upliftment and community development. A policy for promotion of cross- sectoral cooperation on the part of the Government can achieve such an outcome. For example, social/community forestry projects in conjunction with improved stove projects will ensure supply of biomass fuel and its efficient utilization and will improve women\u2019s health as well. On the other hand, ensuring availability of modern cooking fuels in biomass-deficient areas, through decentralized fuel processing and better transportation, can ease women\u2019s search for cooking fuels. This will also reduce the pressure on biomass resources, which is all that the very poor can afford.

To overcome this, the rural energy programme should be de- linked from PDB supply and instead be cast as a type of distributed system with its own generation programme. The draft PRSP talks about development of regional REBs. This may be unnecessary and may have an adverse effect on the autonomy of PBSs. Rather, the Government should consider loosening its grip on PBSs. There is little doubt that the rural energy programme needs to be reformed to meet the challenges of fast growth and ensure good governance and financial sustainability. The PBS Graduation Policy that was approved needs immediate implementation to (1) redefine the relationship of REB with PBSs, (2) strengthen PBS The Government could establish a knowledge bank and hold knowledge- sharing workshops. MEETING THE CHALLENGES 23 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES management and (3) restructure the subsidy policy. With regard to promotion of commercial dissemination of promising RETs for productive and consumptive use in small-scale enterprises and households, it would be desirable to include recommendations focusing on P programmes to provide RETs to rural households, firms, institutions, cooperatives or communities through application of market-oriented approaches; P programmes to encourage local enterprises to manufacture and assemble, market, service and repair RETs in the vicinity of their customers (which will result in support of SMEs in rural areas); and P programmes to involve local NGOs and financing institutions, as they are important contributors to market-oriented dissemination of RETs through dedicated promotion programmes and provision of affordable financial services for both users and suppliers of RETs. As part of the rural energy programme, the rural electrification programme too is to be seen in the context of a much wider development plan: \u2018the state will adopt effective measures to bring about a radical transformation in rural areas through the provision of rural electrification and removing disparities in standards of living between the urban and rural areas\u2019. Hence, the rural energy objectives might support development of rural areas, in general, and improving living standards of the rural population, particularly those of the poor. Consequently, the programme needs to address supply of electricity for both productive use and social purposes. This implies increasing participation of rural poor. Facilitating access, promoting efficiency, cultivating energy entrepreneurship Innovative service delivery mechanisms need to be considered to enhance the productivity of SMEs. A focused strategy to ensure that modern energy services complement energy needs of the rural enterprises can be devised with greater integration with micro-credit mechanisms to overcome the financial and affordability barriers of the communities and enterprises running businesses. This would help them raise their quality of life as energy access would be enhanced for lighting and cooking but, more importantly, access to quality and reliable power for pursuing enterprises would also improve. This would not only generate additional income, but also enhance the viability of the energy service delivery models. Access to energy sources can be improved by deploying greater R&D resources for technology and fuel options for The rural electrification programme should be seen in the context of a much wider development plan. MEETING THE CHALLENGES 24 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES selecting the most sustainable and economical alternatives. In all such endeavours, the needs of the consumer should be kept at the same level as the needs of the project, ensuring that short-term expediency does not result in long-term difficulties. The Government can initiate a programme towards an energy-efficient future. To address its acute energy crisis, Bangladesh must not only enhance generation but also substantially improve energy conservation and efficiency in domestic, commercial and industrial sectors. Special financial packages and incentives will need to be given to create win-win opportunities for both users and the energy suppliers. The Government will need to facilitate greater awareness of economically viable and socially desirable options for improving energy efficiency, especially in plant and machinery. For wider application of energy-efficient cook stoves, relevant programmes/projects should undertake studies on cook stove performances and their impacts, as well as demand assessment, system preference and social acceptance. The institutions undertaking such studies should not only look at different cook stove designs but also look for their applications both at the household and community levels (small hotels, colleges, schools, madrasas and so on). They should also suggest innovative service delivery mechanisms that involve rural women and ensure smooth operation and maintenance of improved cook stoves.

The Government could take the lead by enhancing budgetary allocations as well as improving access to finance from banks and other FIs for energy-related and energy-based projects. In terms of specific financial instruments, mechanisms and modalities should include guarantee schemes much like the USAID Loan Portfolio Guarantee Scheme to eliminate non-collateral financing and lower risk perception of rural loans. The process can also be institutionalized by introducing a mandatory set-aside of 0.5 percent of all lending by commercial banks and other FIs to finance rural-energy-based income generation activities. The Government will also need to effectively explore other international funding opportunities like CDM and GEF, as well as long-term soft loans and utilize them best for promoting sustainable energy services. Develop innovative energy service delivery mechanisms that involve rural women. MEETING THE CHALLENGES 25 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES Mainstreaming gender in energy and poverty concerns Issues related to women\u2019s drudgery can be best addressed through provision of efcient energy devices for cooking. In this context, credit- based initiatives for large-scale dissemination of biogas technologies need to be expanded. Women\u2019s micro-credit groups will need to be involved in information dissemination on IAP caused by biomass smoke and measures to mitigate its adverse efects. The eforts need to be complemented by focusing on measures for enhancing the productivity of women-owned small-scale agricultural farms in Bangladesh. This can be done by means of (1) exploring the potential for improving energy services for these and (2) providing training for capacity building and other necessary inputs to women. Another key issue related to mainstreaming gender concerns is the need to develop indicators/benchmarks on benefts from energy services in general and rural energy services in particular. In the case of the latter, the indicators should take into account relationships between benefciaries of rural energy services by income groups and gaps between rich and poor, urban and rural, and male and female. Developing a monitoring and evaluation system There is a need for an efective M&E system that integrates both the energy and poverty aspects of programme and policy implementation. Eforts to document experience and lessons, and establish baseline data for M&E of rural electrifcation programmes and their impacts on rural development programmes need to be streamlined. Institutionalizing M&E process for efective regulatory frameworks could be developed. Figure 4 lists a few steps based on which M&E system could be developed. Information and knowledge management Existing systems of data collection and surveys are either isolated or limited. For example, there may be adequate information on various energy uses, but virtually nothing on energy consumption patterns on Explore all funding opportunities for promoting sustainable energy services. MEETING THE CHALLENGES FIGURE 4 STEPS IN DEVELOPING A MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM 26 Energy and Poverty in Bangladesh THE CHALLENGES which emerging energy needs may be planned. Generally, studies have a project focus, and as such are limited in scope, range and time frame. Bangladesh needs a MIS and a computerized national database for energy and poverty, which would cover all energy activities to support sound national planning. There is also a need to develop a series of discussion papers on \u2018best practices\u2019, which could later be converted into a compendium. \u2018Best practices\u2019 are essentially projects that have attained their intended objectives. Such material could be put on the public domain as well for wider dissemination. CONCLUSION T he development of Bangladesh\u2019s energy sector has been slow. Most of the population continues to rely on biomass for meeting its energy needs. Ensuring \u2018universal access\u2019 to cleaner, affordable and services is a key challenge. There is an urgent need to extend the amenities of modern energy to increase productivity, improve social welfare, and provide for efficient delivery of economic and social services. In recent times, the Government has taken some steps in its development planning process, which focus on poor people\u2019s energy needs. The PRSP document of the Government identifies energy as an essential input for economic growth and for achieving poverty reduction and livelihood improvement (GoB 2005). It agreed in principle in December 2005, following a national consultation on UNDP\u2019s Framework on SEP, to establish an independent SEDA that would serve as the apex institution for bringing sustainable energy into the mainstream of the national development process.

Access to affordable modern energy services can improve their productivity and enhance living standards. Even so, there are no specific targets for the energy sector in the Millennium Declaration, a historic document signed seven years ago by the world\u2019s leaders. Affordable and sustainable modern energy services are a necessity for countries to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Efforts of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet these aims will be hindered unless adequate attention is given to the crucial role energy services play in the development process. This is particularly true for the economic, environmental and social well-being of the poor. With fluctuating energy prices, the poor in many of the countries in the Asia and Pacific region face a daunting future. For them, access to affordable and essential modern energy services that could improve their living conditions and ensure a means to earn a living, will fall outside their reach. Recognizing the urgency for countries to factor in access to modern energy services, particularly when shaping national poverty reduction initiatives, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided technical and financial support for national-level rapid energy assessments. The primary aim of this work, carried out through UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) and completed in 2006, was to identify gaps and priority needs in linking energy services provision with poverty reduction. The framework for rapid gap assessments linking energy and poverty was developed as a joint effort of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) and UNDP country offices in the region, with the support of experts from the region. The draft framework was discussed at two sub-regional meetings, one held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005) and the other in Apia, Samoa (September 2005). The meetings were helpful in customizing the framework to suit specific needs and circumstances of the participating countries. Subsequently, UNDP country offices held national-level stakeholder consultations to consolidate the findings and recommendations of the assessments. This work benefited immensely from the support of government Energy and Poverty in Cambodia vi officials and representatives of civil society. Documented in individual country reports, this work serves as resource and reference material for programming and planning for access to modern energy services for the underserved, particularly, the poor. This document is a summary of the Country Report on Cambodia and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the Country Report, summarizes the challenges faced at the national level, and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to energy policy, including institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, priority programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support are highlighted. It offers a way forward, outlining issues and options for the country. Our hope is that this document will be of relevance to national policy makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organizations and academia in implementing various measures to promote access to modern energy services for the poor.

This study is particularly valid in the context of Cambodia, where income poverty is among the highest in South-East Asia. In fact, more than one-third of the population lives below the poverty line. Access to modern energy services is limited mainly to urban and peri-urban areas. A mere 15 percent of the total population has access to grid-electricity in Cambodia. Of the 85 percent of Cambodians who live in rural areas, only 7.9 percent have access to grid electricity. Cost of electricity can vary between US$0.18 and US$1 per kWh and is rather high for rural areas. In urban areas, about 40 percent and in rural areas, about 94 percent of energy needs are met by fuelwood. The need for improved cook stoves (ICSs) and sustainable charcoal production is very important as the total amount of fuelwood used in Cambodia is estimated at 4.5 million tonnes of wood per year. Cambodia has also been burdened with the development of basic infrastructure that was severely damaged by years of war, and this includes the energy sector too. This study examines critical energy issues in Cambodia related to the institutional structure of the energy sector, policy and regulatory framework and sectoral programmes. It analyses reasons for the limited reach of energy services to rural provinces; unsustainable dependence on traditional fuels and inefficient technologies; the restricted supply of energy by rural energy enterprises; and inadequate financing for energy. Gender concerns are also examined in rural energy projects and programmes. It highlights the urgent need for key data and indicators to support monitoring and evaluation of energy access for areas that are least served. Energy and Poverty in Cambodia viii This report concludes that deficient capacities, inadequate funds and limited synergy in the planning and implementation of various policies and programmes at the national and provincial levels are the main factors impeding the targeted provision of energy services for poor communities in Cambodia. Even though many international development agencies have supported the Government with relevant policy studies and capacity development interventions for technology and entrepreneurship development, long-term planning and implementation and technical capacities have remained weak in the energy sector. In addition, poverty reduction is not often an explicit objective of the energy sector institutions. The report proposes that a centralized responsible agency with close interaction with provincial and municipal bodies, with sufficient capacities, focusing on energy services planning, delivery and coordination can succeed in bringing together relevant line ministries, departments, rural electricity enterprises (REEs) and technical working groups to address cross-sectoral issues linking energy and poverty concerns. A dialogue mechanism can be created that enables inputs from rural stakeholders. Expanded capacity-building, targeted at provincial and local energy sector stakeholders, is imperative for the vertical as well as cross-sectoral coordination mechanism to work. Promising energy initiatives can and do exist in Cambodia. A community forestry project has been successful in increasing sustainable access to wood energy for rural households in Takeo province. The Cambodia Fuel Saving Project (CFSP) has also developed replicable practices for the design and dissemination of improved ICSs. Currently about 30 percent of urban households have started using ICSs. Government support, possibly with donor assistance, for up-scaling of these highly positive efforts can start with a provision of incentives to manufacturers to stop producing the traditional inefficient stoves. Legal frameworks encouraging new standards, fuelwood policy to govern the production, distribution, sale and utilization of fuelwood and biomass wastes can increase market penetration. Likewise, regulations for tree plantations can enable promotion of certification systems for sustainable firewood and charcoal production. Experiments with promising local gasifier technology, using agricultural waste as a fuel, can replace existing diesel generators and conventional cook stoves once proven to be economically viable. The commitment of the Government of Cambodia to achieve 70 percent rural electrification by 2030, stated in the Cambodian Energy Sector Strategy, is highly commendable. A Government initiative, the Rural Electrification Fund, is also an important step towards boosting private entrepreneurship in the energy sector in the long run, with specific focus ix Energy and Poverty in Cambodia on rural areas, renewable energy and income generation. Yet, only an equal emphasis on reforming the pricing frameworks can make electricity affordable for the rural poor. Development of the renewable energy law is yet another very positive effort that needs to be concluded. Existing and new renewable energy technology (RET) pilots can be up-scaled faster if a strong regulatory framework is in place. Especially important is the design of well targeted pro-poor subsidy and tax policies.

We trust that the report is unique in terms of its insights into bridging the gaps between access to energy and poverty reduction in Cambodia. Our aim is to provide country-specific information on institutional structures, energy resources, policy recommendations, and capacity and financial gaps that can point the way towards improving access to modern energy services, particularly for the poor.

Cambodia is decentralized and does not refer to a national grid. Urban centres have separate grids that are operated by independent power producer (IPPs). BACKGROUND he Kingdom of Cambodia scores low on the human development index, ranking 129th of all countries. Thirty-four percent of its population lives on less than US$1 a day (UNDP 2006), and a mere 15 percent has access to grid electricity.1 Decades of war have significantly hampered the development of institutional capacities and related infrastructure that could have otherwise addressed significant matters, particularly concerning the nation\u2019s poverty and its energy needs. To address these twin issues, the stakeholders in Cambodia\u2019s development should explore poverty reduction through the energy sector by introducing modern technology into the existing inefficient supply modes.

An assessment of Cambodia\u2019s energy sector highlights a number of challenges to be faced in terms of linking the concerns of energy provision and poverty reduction. Some of these concerns and challenges are detailed below. Poor synergy within institutional arrangements In Cambodia, access to modern energy services is limited mostly to urban and semi-urban areas. Electricity grids exist only in the biggest cities and are not connected to each other. The existing situation makes a compelling case to examine the effectiveness of institutional arrangements at the macro level in tackling the issues at hand. Nationally, the energy sector involves five key players: (1) the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME), (2) the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), (3) the Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC), (4) the Cambodian National Petroleum Authority (CNPA) and (5) the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF). Within these macrolevel institutions, there are departments with specific responsibilities. MIME\u2019s General Department of Energy, for example, is responsible for the development and standardization of renewable and hydroelectric energy. CNPA is responsible for import, trade and use of petroleum products as well as the exploration of oil and gas deposits. Under MAFF, the Forestry Administration is involved in tree planting for biomass energy generation, and the National Biogas Programme falls under the purview of MAFF\u2019s Department of Animal Health and Production. Collectively, these ministries and agencies represent the spectrum of official energy development, management and policy-making in Cambodia. The primary institutions that hold a mandate for energy efficiency are the Department of Energy Technique (DET) and the Energy Efficiency Office (EEO), part of and established by MIME, respectively. The mandate of EEO is to prepare, implement and control standards of energy use and guide programmes to achieve energy efficiency. The focus of these institutions has largely been limited to urban areas where, despite efforts, they have not been able to infuse efficient technologies into the energy sector. The major factors impeding energy service delivery are (1) inadequate funds, (2) deficient capacities and (3) limited synergy in the planning and implementation of various programmes. Moreover, the policies and 3 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia THE CHALLENGES programmes related to poverty, in general, and energy, in particular, are often formulated through partnerships with bilateral and multilateral agencies. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as the Cambodian Research Centre for Development, Groupe Energies Renouvelables Environnement et Solidarit\u00e9s (GERES), the Centre Kram Ngoy (CKN) and Small and Medium Enterprises-Cambodia (SME-Cambodia) have worked closely with bilateral and multilateral agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO-Japan), the Dutch Development Organisation (SNV), the European Union, the World Bank and the Governments of Japan and USA. All these players work closely with the Government of Cambodia to develop low-cost, high-efficiency energy applications and to build the capacities of the energy sector, particularly regarding research and development (R&D) and entrepreneurship skills. Often, the financial incentives provided by donors for participation become the primary motivation for officials to support the donor- proposed programmes/projects in the country. Besides, poverty reduction is often not an explicit objective stated in the mandates of a majority of central institutions in the energy sector, and their programmes and policies have only indirect linkages to poverty (Table 1). Local-level institutions, like commune councils, which are best suited to provide the necessary grassroots or community interface, do not have energy access or energy services provision as an area of focus. At the decentralized level, private institutions in the energy sector encompass medium-to-large independent power producers (IPPs), rural electricity enterprises (REEs), battery-charging stations (BCSs), solar home lighting system companies, charcoal producers and cook stove manufacturers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3677635-02d7-4c32-b3bc-14e83e08bbe7": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3677635-02d7-4c32-b3bc-14e83e08bbe7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad761e5fc5a5a9cd2d821377fb40a3b287f41847745cb8f8429c00cce9172b3d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3bfaefdf-f387-4541-b0d6-83a24d0dd47b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c489d7e2f55921a8b2b70834dd6a5a9389df9774da5ec7e5195ff42637aa9825"}}, "hash": "27714ad2f44e602c16a144dc92a87a543814f47022b6904c2213e72cfdb693a6", "text": "While IPPs have an installed capacity of over 88 megawatts (MW), they focus on providing electricity to the Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EdC).

The BCSs operate like cottage industries and are therefore managed by unskilled villagers. The inefficiencies in the supply and use of batteries by households make the energy consumed rather expensive. \u25a0 The notion of linking energy strategies to poverty concerns has not yet taken root in Cambodia. Even bodies mandated to direct energy initiatives towards socio-economic development, such as the Technical Working Group (TWG) on Energy and Infrastructure, have not been able to look beyond the power sector. Only the MEF has incorporated the poverty agenda into its mandate, as it is also the lead organization for the NPRS.

Following the same pattern, energy policies aimed at developing the power sector have failed to understand the proper place of poverty reduction within their strategies. As a result, poverty reduction and energy development programmes have largely followed mutually exclusive policy paths. Of late, the Government has committed to boost rural access to electricity through various policy initiatives (Table 2). The Rural Electrification Fund (REF) and the Cambodian Energy Sector Strategy (CESS) are welcome steps that promise delivery in the long run. However, they mainly focus on electricity and exclude fuelwood and biomass. Like REF and CESS, most policies have not adequately considered the energy needs and realities of poor communities that need basic energy for cooking and lighting.

For instance, CESS set up a national objective to achieve 70 percent rural electrification by 2030 but does not place equal emphasis on reforming the pricing frameworks to make electricity affordable for the rural poor. An accompanying strategy to show how this will be achieved will be necessary. The absence of an approved, comprehensive renewable energy development policy and law hinders the success of private and donor-led investments and interventions. Other initiatives such as the Renewable Energy Policy and Strategy \u2013 assisted by the World Bank \u2013 and the Renewable Energy Action Plan (REAP), presented in March 2003, have been slow to translate into action. Further, REAP 2004 sought to generate 6 MW of energy through renewable energy sources by 2007, but has yet to be officially adopted. REAP as well as the REF initiative, which aims to enable a 5 percent solar and small-hydro contribution to the national installed capacity, will be more effective if the Government approves the related laws and policies. Policies formulated through donor support are now awaiting approval by the Council of Ministers. Many of these initiatives provide constructive strategies for Cambodia\u2019s future. For example, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)- supported CESS and JICA draft entitled \u2018Master Plan Study on Rural Electrification by Renewable Energy in the Kingdom of Cambodia\u2019, provides promising strategies. Also hopeful, the World Bank drafted the TABLE 2 (CONT\u2019D) MAJOR ENERGY SECTOR STRATEGIES/ POLICIES/ PROGRAMMES IN CAMBODIA The absence of a comprehensive renewable energy development policy and law hinders the successful initiatives. 7 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia THE CHALLENGES \u2018Energy Sector Strategy Review\u2019 policy paper to promote electricity investments (World Bank 2005). The Australian Business Council for Sustainable Energy drafted an overview of the energy systems, renewable energy options, initiatives, actors and opportunities in Cambodia for renewable energy with recommendations, listing a summary of other reports (BCSE 2005). Moreover, the Asian Institute of Technology drafted \u2018The Role of Renewable Energy for Poverty Reduction in Cambodia\u2019 (Martin 2006), exploring all possibilities for renewable energy in Cambodia. The EC-ASEAN Energy Facility presented options for the promotion of and investment in renewable energy projects in its draft. Unfortunately, many of these project plans/strategies are not likely to be implemented (CRCD 2006). Also, the draft Renewable Energy Law is yet to be guided through different government agencies before approval by the Government. On 17 January 2007, the Government approved CESS, creating a supportive environment for renewable energy technology (RET) programmes. The formulation of the energy strategy was supported by UNESCAP (MIME 2007a). \u25a0 An inefficient legal environment, with many laws still in the process of being drafted or awaiting approval, makes for a weak regulatory framework in Cambodia. With regard to the rural electricity sector, there is little or no regulation at present. \u25a0 Donor-driven institutional reforms, even though agencies such as EdC and EAC need several reforms. \u25a0 No attempt to reduce high import duties even while the Sub-Decree on Private Sector Participation commits to facilitate private investment in RETs. Import tax on renewable energy equipment is 35 percent. \u25a0 As EAC tries to implement regulations, oversight, tariff fixation and training of REEs, REEs face high grid losses and often use very old and inefficient generators. With increasing diesel prices, they often charge more than US$0.5 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in more remote areas. Many REEs are currently loss-making ventures. \u25a0 Many development agencies are focused on supporting the Government with analytical/review reports and policy writing, rather than with long-term support to design programmes and support implementation. Government agencies are often busy helping development partners and donors, leaving little time for coherent policy development and planning.

Better synchronization will help promote new applied research for appropriate RETs in rural development and poverty reduction efforts. \u25a0 The National Technical Training Institute initiated an Energy Park for the promotion of RETs but operates with poor financial support and low capacity.

A programme framework partial to grid electricity Lack of a pro-poor energy development framework decreases the effectiveness of the ongoing energy programmes in meeting overall socio-economic development goals. Although 94 percent of rural energy needs are met by fuelwood and 2.6 percent by charcoal (NIS 2005), the main energy programmes focus only on electricity grid extension that mainly benefits urban areas and some rural rich and middle class families. The poor who have no ability to pay for grid electricity are left aside by these programmes. Two good examples of programmes that are cross-sectoral and have a rural orientation are the Cambodia Fuel Saving Project (CFSP)2 and SEILA3. The focus of SEILA, however, is on democracy, decentralization, health and education \u2013 energy is not part of its agenda. The formulation of energy policies has typically been the focus of international development agencies and donors; for example, UNESCAP\u2019s support of CESS (MIME 2007a), the World Bank\u2019s support of REAP, and the REF\u2019s aid in implementing REAP. Even though this is a good strategy, the Government will also need a renewable energy law and policy. The limited 10 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia THE CHALLENGES FIGURE 1 HOUSEHOLDS AND THEIR COOKING FUELS Sources MIME (2007a) and MIME (2007b) institutional capacities in the country, however, impede and delay the development and even the approval process of any new policy or law. Dependence on inefficient energy sources The most prevalent fuel options in Cambodia are the following: diesel, for electricity generation, industry, agriculture and transport; fuelwood, for domestic cooking and SMEs; and kerosene, for domestic lighting. While the use of fuelwood for cooking has declined significantly in urban areas to about 40 percent, rural Cambodia still relies on it as its primary source for cooking. Historically, the type of fuel source used for home cooking has corresponded to the household income. The trend shows more people have started using convenient fuel sources such as charcoal and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), reflecting the growth within the middle- and upper middle-income demographics (Figures 1, 2 and 3) (MIME 2007b).

Many reasons might influence the household\u2019s choice of fuel. During interviews, poor families did not seem to understand the difference in caloric values of the fuel sources, and often use small bottles of gas thinking they are the cheapest fuel source. The graph also shows clearly that as income increases, the use of firewood decreases. Simultaneously, the usage of charcoal rises and, eventually, there is a steady growth in the use of LPG. Otherwise the cooking fuel patterns in the highest income quintile are not very distinct from the poorer income quintiles. Combined 12 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia THE CHALLENGES use of firewood and charcoal, as well as gas and electricity, fluctuate between the different income quintiles, however, there are no distinct patterns. The future rural and urban energy demand could be predicted by analysing the switch in fuel choice during the progression in income quintiles as also by looking at other historical data from Phnom Penh. MIME is now analysing existing data and gathering new field data to formulate a rural energy balance. The result will indicate the total rural energy demand for cooking and lighting in Kampong Speu and Prey Veng provinces. \u25a0 Modern energy services that are renewable, efficient and affordable face numerous barriers. \u25a0 Rural families are particularly disadvantaged in their access to such modern alternatives in the energy ladder. \u25a0 The energy sources in common use are sub-optimal. The Cambodian Research Centre for Development recently concluded that the country\u2019s rural energy sector is environmentally, socially and economically unsustainable. BOX 4: KEY CHALLENGES TO PROVIDING ACCESS TO EFFICIENT ENERGY SOURCES Poor access to modern energy Both the public utility and private entrepreneurs concentrate their power supply towards commercially viable urban and peri-urban areas, leaving vast tracts of rural, low-income Cambodia without access to grid electricity. Consequently, of the 85 percent of Cambodians who live in rural areas, only 7.9 percent have access to grid electricity. Of the rest, 17.4 percent use lead-acid (LA) batteries, and 69.5 percent rely on kerosene for lighting. The remainder of the rural population uses a combination of grid electricity and generator power, generator power only, candles or other sources for lighting (NIS 2005). Studies indicate that even the most aggressive electrification drives will extend electricity services to only about 15-25 percent of the rural population in the next 10 years, leaving 60-70 percent of Cambodians beyond the reach of the electricity grid. EdC has a policy of restricting the sale of power to legal property owners or tenants only. This forces people in illegal housing or slums to buy electricity from individuals who illegally trade power at extremely high prices and through infrastructure that is often unsafe and unreliable for end-users. Both the public utility and private entrepreneurs focus on commercially viable urban and peri- urban areas. 13 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia THE CHALLENGES In rural areas, REEs play a dominant role in the private sector by generating electricity through diesel-powered generators. With over 700 REEs in Cambodia, the total production of electricity is approximately 14.5 million kWh. Most REEs operate below accepted standards and provide costly electricity, ranging from an average of US$0.50 to US$1.00 per kWh. Due to high diesel prices, many REEs stop their business or incur losses as neighbours request them to keep generating electricity. Although EAC licenses require a minimal fee, most REEs prefer to operate without licenses to avoid the payment as they are wary of the high transaction fees in license applications.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c6089c5-fee4-4114-aba1-0d69406aa7bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c6089c5-fee4-4114-aba1-0d69406aa7bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a881af96ebd10e165023c8a2badf9b2d42a1238887c53a7e9221b0ffe9e84f97"}, "2": {"node_id": "0df44e0e-f3b8-474c-a51a-7e7b39c3daf0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab9c04a43205c4f20c658aeadd9e4515d2b0f6778ebf025a38a8933290910c3b"}}, "hash": "b4d831f552d4c396b793ea83f756a1104adb3319951d4c9ef14813c9298fe50e", "text": "With LA batteries providing about 30 percent of rural household energy needs for lighting, virtually every village in the country has at least one BCS.

For instance, of the estimated 3665 GWh/year (gigawatt-hour per year) wind energy potential, only a small percentage of it is being tapped (Table 3) (Williamson et al. 2004). Besides a dozen very small wind turbines and some wind water pumps, only one medium-size wind turbine is planned in Sihanoukville (ASIAPROECO 2005). The ICSs, however, have achieved the biggest success among all the new technology options, with 30 percent of the urban households currently using ICSs and saving more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The need for ICSs and sustainable charcoal production is extremely important as the total amount of fuelwood used in Cambodia is estimated at 4.5 million tonnes of wood per year (Mansvelt 2006b). The relatively high hydropower potential is now being extended with a 193 MW dam in Bokor National Park (close to Kampot), while other dams are being planned in the north-eastern and south-western provinces (Kingdom of Cambodia 2006). However, as the rainy season lasts only about 4-6 months, there still remains the need for other energy sources during most of the dry season.

(2004) \u25a0 In areas where electricity is provided by REEs, high tariffs prevent low-income families from accessing power. Schools, health centres and local government offices also lack resources to pay for modern energy services. Cambodia\u2019s electricity tariffs are among the highest in the world, with EdC charging about US$0.18 per kWh, and REEs about US$0.25 per kWh. However, in deeper rural pockets, the price often varies between US$0.18 and US$1 per kWh (MIME 2007b). \u25a0 Without any concerted strategy to create uniform, subsidy-based tariff structures, the rural poor are forced to look for cheaper, less efficient options. \u25a0 Other technologies \u2013 such as solar home-lighting systems \u2013 face cost barriers, including high import taxes on equipment, or have been unable to move beyond the pilot stage, as in the case of wind pumps and biofuels. \u25a0 Capacities to identify commercial opportunities, understand and select appropriate technologies, and develop and operate projects are limited. BOX 5: KEY CONCERNS CONFRONTING MODERN ENERGY ACCESS FOR POVERTY REDUCTION Energy efficiency concerns High costs of energy in Cambodia force consumers to use energy prudently. Despite such an unfriendly market, financial sources for upgrading energy efficiency are restricted. Moreover, capacities to launch energy-efficient technologies are stuck either in the pre-pilot or pilot stages and most of the initiatives are focused on the electricity sub- sector.

This tendency inhibits the adoption of more efficient fuels for power generation. Consequently, the cost burden of running a plant through diesel generators of varying efficiency is passed on to the consumers. \u25a0 Because they are outside the official monitoring and regulatory mechanisms, most REEs do not meet accepted standards of safety, technical efficiency or service (for example, very few provide 24-hour electricity). \u25a0 EAC regulates and promotes low price schemes to REEs and provides free efficiency training, but only small improvements are feasible because of high diesel prices, low consumption and a limited number of customers. \u25a0 Large-scale energy efficiency retrofits have a considerable cost burden attached to them and require donor financing.

Most energy entrepreneurs confine their operations to profitable urban centres. \u25a0 SMEs operating in rural and remote areas lack access to grid electricity and are forced to either purchase expensive power from REEs, or to run their own, equally expensive, diesel generators. With few viable and affordable alternatives, most rural SMEs opt for locally available energy sources (such as wood) for productive use. This reduces the efficiency and quality of their output. BOX 7: KEY CHALLENGES TO POVERTY-DRIVEN ENERGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP Gender concerns Cambodia is ranked low in terms of gender equity measures in Asia, positioned slightly higher than Lao PDR, but lower than Viet Nam. With that said, Cambodia\u2019s level of women\u2019s involvement in its economy is high, with about 72.4 percent of Cambodian women involved in economic activities, compared to 73.9 percent of the men (UNDP 2006). For women, these activities often include household and SME bookkeeping. Nevertheless, persistent traditional attitudes lead to a high gender imbalance, which manifests itself through inequalities in educational attainment and literacy, rates of child labour, access to public services and representation in decision-making. The Cambodian Women for Peace and Development Association studied the impact and improvements of RET on the situation of women in rural areas (CWPD 2001). The study gathered all kinds of data on energy use by rural household, energy cost, collection time, and electrical appliances from 1,777 households in 7 provinces. In 2001, it was found that 11.8 percent of households used the improved charcoal stove and 7.4 percent made use of an improved wood stove (Figure 4). 17 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia THE CHALLENGES FIGURE 4 TYPES OF COOK STOVES USED IN RURAL HOUSEHOLDS Source CWPD (2001) Limited access to finance Cambodia has an emerging microfinance market, but many people in need of loans must either travel to provincial or district towns or rely on private money lenders who charge exorbitant interest rates. Bank loans need high collaterals, have prohibitive interest rates and short repayment terms. These conditions make bank loans particularly difficult for SMEs and REEs since they ideally need long-term and low interest rates to be able to invest in grid extension and efficient or renewable energy generating equipment (Harner 2002). In the absence of an accessible and organized financial sector, an informal group of local lenders has emerged as the most viable source of finance for most Cambodians. Informal sector loans comprise 39 percent of all loans offered in rural areas, and come with varying, but always high, interest rates (informal 4-10 percent per month). In rural Cambodia some NGOs are providing soft-loans related to project activities. The Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agency (ACLEDA) Bank, a major micro-finance institution, has a wide network in the country. It has attempted to bring down interest rates to encourage lower income households and rural SMEs to access loans for productive uses. To cite an example, the interest could be 4 percent per month for an average loan, and if the borrowed amount is US$10,000 or more, it could be 1.8 percent per month, with collaterals (GVEP 2005). Bank loans need high collaterals, have high prohibitive interest rates and short repayment terms. 18 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia THE CHALLENGES \u25a0 No specific financing mechanism is available outside of the electricity sub-sector, such as for BCSs or charcoal producers. \u25a0 There are only a few policies, such as the Land Law 2001, that pertain to finance for business.

In this context, the Financial Sector Blueprint (2001-2010) \u2013 supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \u2013 aims to provide a strategy and coordination mechanism for the financial sector. However, issues that still need to be worked upon include the short time period of licensing, the lack of information or knowledge of loans that are available for the rural sector, and the high transaction costs of all informal fees. Poorly developed management information system A scarcity of sector-specific information pervades all economic and social sectors in Cambodia, and the energy sector is no exception. This is primarily due to weak coordination amongst and utilization by departments of existing data collection and documentation mechanisms. In addition, Phnom Penh is the hub for knowledge on energy options, but the information rarely reaches rural communities, as provincial departments lack the capacities to execute awareness programmes. Despite these overarching problems, Cambodia has made some headway in establishing an information generation system through the National Institute of Statistics (NIS). NIS conducted the Cambodian Socio-Economic Study 2003-2004 to update Cambodian MDGs as well as the Statistical Yearbook 2005 (NIS 2005). The SEILA programme has also Information on energy options rarely reaches rural communities. 19 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia THE CHALLENGES \u25a0 There is a shortage of documented information on the energy sector since few systematic studies have been undertaken to assess consumer patterns of energy use and energy supply trends. Therefore, official data on energy provision in rural areas and information on the socio-economic impact of energy is scanty. Local government representatives, such as DIMEs in provincial towns, have limited capacities to collect and disseminate information from and to rural areas and thereby provide strategic guidance to focus energy policies. \u25a0 As for data collection, most household surveys include indicators on the sources of lighting and cooking fuel, thus providing a fair estimate of the type of energy used by different households. Information on energy use by SMEs is more difficult to obtain and no census has been conducted thus far. Primary data and information on village energy markets, energy use in agriculture, and productive end-use of energy are limited, and the little available information generally consists of extrapolated sample studies.

Workshops, television and radio programmes, training courses, and the internet are the main avenues of information and knowledge acquisition.4 The Global Village Energy Partnership (GVEP)-Cambodia used existing data to graph a useful footprint of rural energy use by income group. Only a few NGOs like GERES and Development for Appropriate Technology (DATe) and local associations such as the Wood Energy Network Cambodia (WENetCam) and the Renewable Energy Private Sector Association are active in rural areas to bring sustainable energy technology to the people. One of the best existing practices includes a community forestry project in Takeo province, which has been successful in increasing sustainable access to wood energy for rural households. The GERES-led CFSP has also developed replicable practices for the design and dissemination of ICSs5 (Baskoro 2005). 20 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia THE CHALLENGES 6 For more information, refer to paredp@online.com.kh.

However, data are available and a relatively straightforward analysis at MIME could create a rural energy balance that will be valuable for development planning. BOX 10: KEY CHALLENGES TO DEVELOPING EFFICIENT MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEMS 21 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia THE CHALLENGES MEETING THE CHALLENGES C ambodia needs to develop comprehensive energy strategies to overcome some of the challenges identified in the previous section. Furthermore, the strategies have to be specific enough to yield tangible and quantifiable benefits. The following are strategies that would address Cambodia\u2019s specific poverty and energy concerns, potentially leading to the achievement of the MDGs. The agencies deemed to have the capacities for enabling the processes are also mentioned in the discussion. A parent agency to address issues related to energy and poverty In order to successfully carry forward the agenda of energy and poverty, the Government needs to establish or appoint a central government agency which has the capacity to analyse government strategies for sustainable rural energy development. This central agency would also focus on the planning and coordination of initiatives related to energy and poverty concerns. A sub-committee for rural energy planning, consisting of rural stakeholders, can be established in order to provide inputs to the main agency. The main agency can host the TWG on Energy and Infrastructure, and should be made responsible for including the poverty dimension into energy plans. The central agency, along with TWG, can then facilitate coordination between MIME and the Ministry of Health and Education to create institutional synergies. Extending the policy framework to renewable energy technologies One of the key elements for linking energy and poverty is a policy framework that promotes and enables energy-efficient technologies. National institutions must therefore encourage firm enactment and enforcement of policies for RET development and application. Moreover, cross-sectoral institutional synergies need to be directed towards vigorous promotion and proliferation of RETs. The successful operation of RETs is crucial to Cambodia\u2019s energy security goals and poverty reduction objectives. As a start, the Government of Cambodia is in the process of developing a Renewable Energy Law. It is important to note, however, that further monetary and partner support is crucial, and would allow MIME to lead an integrated policy to promote RETs. This became clear during two renewable energy workshops in Kampong Speu and Svay Rieng province, where most Create a leading agency that would also focus on the planning and coordination of initiatives related to energy and poverty concerns. 22 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia MEETING THE CHALLENGES communes are unaware of effective energy saving options and other RET possibilities. The main feedback was that workshops were not as useful as bringing RETs to the people (MIME 2007b). CFSP initiated a successful ICS programme. About 30 percent of urban families (120,000 families, to be precise) are using the improved stove, thus saving 22 percent on fuelwood and charcoal (Mansvelt 2006b). Each stove saves one ton of carbon dioxide per year if used on a daily basis (Buysman 2006). The Government could establish ICSs as a benchmark product and then motivate, and possibly even provide incentives, to manufacturers to stop producing the traditional inefficient stoves. The Government will require some initial support from development partners to create new standards for cook stoves. A good example is the ongoing study by the MEF that is supported by the World Bank to analyse the effect of the reduction of import tax on renewable energy equipment. Efficient checks and balances On the regulatory front, privatizing EdC would allow it to streamline operations and boost business efficiency. Further, a clear and uniform tariff structure is essential to stopping arbitrary electricity pricing by REEs. Drawing on the draft tariff-setting policy of 2004 and the Sub-Decree on the Principles for Determining the Reasonable Cost in Electricity Business of 2005, this tariff structure could incorporate a subsidy mechanism, making it easier for the poor to access affordable electricity, while still ensuring reasonable", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e607aa66-1c2a-45fe-898d-98826d59c0da": {"__data__": {"id_": "e607aa66-1c2a-45fe-898d-98826d59c0da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07a962d69a93eb55fb77c77b1046f4cc9f4dbc767fca36d99955acc2c3f93003"}}, "hash": "07a962d69a93eb55fb77c77b1046f4cc9f4dbc767fca36d99955acc2c3f93003", "text": "returns for entrepreneurs. MIME could undertake the responsibility of proposing tariff rationalization to the Council of Ministers. At the decentralized level, the validity period of licenses should be extended for all REEs, thereby providing adequate time to recover high investments. The licenses should be contingent on the delivery of desired tariff and efficiency standards, and failure to do so would result in license revocation. In the end, the consequences of these changes would be cyclical; the efforts of EAC to increase the efficiency levels of REEs and facilitate an increase in long-term loans would also help in bringing down the cost of operations, and consequently, the tariffs. Enhancing capacities A decentralized system for energy service delivery is a key requirement to meet the challenges of energy and poverty in an integrated manner. Since programme formulation is still largely a donor-driven process, the programme development agenda may not incorporate the necessary Helping REEs increase their efficiency would also help in bringing down the cost of operations and the tariffs. 23 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia MEETING THE CHALLENGES The proposed partnership among MIME, EAC and EdC to train private technicians could bridge the capacity gaps in the private sector. capacity development. Hence, it is essential for international assistance to include financial and knowledge-building support for programme implementation. Linkages between energy and poverty with regard to capacity development should be adequately incorporated into the project execution cost by the development support and donor community. At the national level, any government initiative aimed at stimulating private sector involvement in the energy sector should include a technical advice and training component on the relationship between energy and development concerns. The proposed partnership among MIME, EAC and EdC to train private technicians offers a workable solution to bridge the capacity gaps in the private sector. At the local level, institutions like DIME should be provided funds and training to build capacity for executing programmes. Also, efforts should be made to train DIMEs on other energy technologies such as RETs, and to familiarize them with linkages between energy and socio-economic development. Organizations with experience in RET development, such as CKN and GERES, should extend the existing training linkages to local institutions. Needs-based programmes In order to work towards local development in general and poverty reduction in particular, Cambodia should adopt a \u2018needs-based\u2019 approach to its energy development programmes. A percentage of the revenue collected from the oil import tax and the electricity import tax could be used to execute decentralized energy projects that focus specifically on poverty reduction. It would also be desirable to share experiences and lessons learnt out of small-scale but effective projects and other similar initiatives with government agencies, so as to scale up and institutionalize the policy and planning framework. Moreover, international donors can also provide financial support for decentralized energy initiatives that are linked with poverty concerns. The decentralization reform programme \u2013 SEILA \u2013 with its cross-sectoral orientation, provides a good platform to facilitate such initiatives and, in this context, funds and capacity assistance can be provided to SEILA to introduce the energy component into its rural initiatives. The commune counsels could be trained to integrate RETs into their development plans. In addition, the UNDP sponsored \u2018Preparatory Activities for a Rural Energy Development Programme\u2019 should be materialized into a full scale programme. One of the key constraints for the poorer and deprived sections of the rural community is their unsustainable dependence on traditional sources of fuel, such as fuelwood. The low-income groups, especially women and 24 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia MEETING THE CHALLENGES children, face great difficulties in collecting fuelwood from far-away places. Besides, they also face health hazards due to direct combustion of fuelwood in traditional cook stoves. In this context, it would be useful to promote efficient low-cost technologies. The National Biogas Programme\u2019s (NBP) subsidization of biogas digesters and the ICS programme initiated by the CFSP are two successful examples. To further the benefits, NGO projects, such as the CFSP, which aim to promote efficient cook stoves and sustainable charcoal production, should be extended adequate legal and regulatory support. In order to facilitate such programmes, the Wood Energy Working Group of Cambodia could draft a fuelwood policy and add a legal basis to administer the production, distribution, sale and utilization of fuelwood and biomass wastes. Support could also be directed to the Forestry Administration, Energy Department and the Department of Land Management in order to formulate regulations for energy plantations.

Farmers, communities or companies who want to grow biofuel, including trees, in a sustainable way should have clear guidelines and regulations. Tree plantation that promises fuelwood should be encouraged by giving it special preference, replacing the existing uncontrolled and unsustainable harvests of the remaining deciduous forests in Cambodia. GERES is now exploring and promoting certification systems for sustainable firewood and charcoal production. This promotion should come with special low tax schemes and be excluded from unofficial road fees. Facilitating renewable energy delivery As mentioned earlier, remote rural communities are not served by EdC or REEs, so they have to depend on inefficient technologies to meet their energy needs. Without energy-based enterprises in these areas, circumstances have severely restricted economic development and significantly prevented livelihood enhancement. In this context, it is imperative that RETs that offer an option of decentralized delivery of efficient energy be taken beyond pilot stages. Further, it would be useful to implement an incentive-and-deterrent regime where low-cost clean technologies receive subsidies while inefficient technologies invite taxes. There is a need to increase the dissemination of RETs to the poorest segments of communities and rural enterprises. For this to happen, 25 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia MEETING THE CHALLENGES international agencies and NGOs need to collaborate with MIME in order to enable policies and make adequate resources available, including low interest and long-term loans, to support renewable-energy-based REEs. Also NTTI should be supported in order to enhance its Energy Park initiative as a focal point for RETs promotion. At the policy and regulatory level, the dissemination of RETs can be further pushed by exempting duties and taxes for import of technologies, which can again be facilitated by MIME and MEF. It has been suggested that import tax on renewable energy equipment should be reduced from 35 to 10 percent and that the possible extra revenues from the increased import could be used to support rural energy businesses. Cambodia needs to adopt options that focus on efficient utilization of local resources and generation of employment through energy service delivery. Agricultural waste, farming of palm sugar cane and other trees for energy plantations, and coconut and rice husks can be used for generating electricity through gasification, thereby replacing the existing diesel generators. The gasifiers are economically viable, whereas grid extensions to rural areas are not, and the technology has proven successful in Cambodia through the work of Canada-Fund and UNDP. A local NGO, SME-Cambodia, is supporting rural development through private sector aid and has introduced Indian gasifier technology into Cambodia. In Anlong Tamey, a village in the Battambang province, the Community Energy Cooperative (CEC) bought biomass from farmers who grow the fast-growing, nitrogen-fixing intercropping tree, Leucaena cephalous. The CEC then sells electricity at a lower price than most REEs in other villages (SME-Renewables LTD. 2005). The JICA Master Plan shows that at least 3,000 villages are suited for gasification as the best possible option for electrification (JICA 2006). Local initiatives are already beginning to prove their viability. SME-Renewables, a local company, has successfully sold the first 200 kVa gasifier to a rice miller, serving as a good pilot to demonstrate its economic feasibility. As has already been proven in Anlong Ta Mei of Battambang Province, the gasifier can displace 75 percent of the diesel cost, and agricultural waste can be transformed into charcoal brickets. Potential other technology is currently being developed as well. GERES Cambodia is experimenting with a new cook stove \u2013 the gasifier cook stove \u2013 which uses any kind of agricultural waste as fuel, such as that from coconut, sugar cane or chopped woodchips. However, more research is required to study the efficiency and applicability of these gasifier cook stoves. Cambodia needs to adopt options that focus on efficient utilization of local resources and generation of employment through energy service delivery. 26 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia MEETING THE CHALLENGES The promotion and growth of rural entrepreneurs is vital in addressing poverty concerns. Jatropha is another plant for which biodiesel production has high potential as a renewable energy source in Cambodia. Organizations such as SME, CKN and GERES could initiate further research on biomass and biodiesel, while international donors and the Government could contribute funds. Another related issue that needs to be addressed is the formulation of a policy for sustainable charcoal production. International donors can facilitate policy formulation by working closely with MIME, MEF, MAFF, EAC and EdC. Village energy plantation programmes for sustainable charcoal production and fuelwood supply should lead the way to resolve the wood energy crisis in Cambodia.

In this context, it is desirable to seek out private and NGO-led energy-efficient projects, such as establishing more efficient diesel generator sets as well as extending financial assistance for energy- efficiency programmes to EEOs at MIME. It is also essential to establish minimum performance standards and efficiency criteria for those energy systems that have the potential to reduce poverty. In this context, it would make sense to support the CFSP with new training centres for ICSs, and to extend governmental support to BCSs by identifying them as REEs. Enhancing productive use of energy The promotion and growth of rural entrepreneurs is vital in addressing poverty concerns. The Government should, therefore, encourage renewable energy entrepreneurship by providing long-term loans at low interest rates, along with initial investment support. The World Bank- supported REF is a genuine step toward supporting rural electrification; however, it does not focus on other sources of energy such as fuelwood. Associations such as the Renewable Energy Private Sector Association, Improved Cook Stove Producers and Distributors Association Cambodia, and Rural Electricity Entrepreneurs\u2019 Association must be encouraged to fund bottom-up approaches to boost energy-based SMEs and livelihoods in rural areas. 27 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia MEETING THE CHALLENGES The Government should recognize and support energy-based SME associations through incentives, clear tax regimes and SME investment sector support programmes. In order to extend benefits to the energy sector, a working group comprising members of private energy enterprises could be formed along the lines of other professional SME associations, such as the rice millers association, which uses rice husks as a main source of power. Other commercial activities that use a lot of fuelwood energy include the family-based sugar palm production, noodle-making, soybean processing, and brick and tile-making industries. The work of NGOs, such as GERES, that developed a post-combustion stove for small-scale industries, need support. These stoves save half the fuelwood compared to the conventional stoves used now (CFSP 2004). Incorporating gender concerns in energy-poverty linkages WENetCam, which addresses gender concerns through efficient cook stoves and sustainable charcoal production, should be extended adequate legal and regulatory support. As mentioned earlier, in order to alleviate women\u2019s drudgery, it is desirable to scale up and promote the use of low-cost technologies, such as ICSs, bio-digesters, solar lanterns and batteries. Since the availability of finance for modern energy options is a critical factor, involving women should be a step in the right direction, as they are often involved in the accounting. To this end, it would be useful to build the capacity of microfinance institutions, especially the ACLEDA Bank, to expand loan portfolios so as to include basic energy services for cooking and lighting. It is also necessary that women are included during the planning, development, implementation and monitoring stages of programmes and projects in order to ensure that their specific needs are sufficiently identified and addressed. UNDP is promoting the participation of women in governmental bodies, coordinated by the Ministry of Woman Affairs. MIME has also taken part in this initiative. Energy programmes should also require women to participate in decision-making at local levels. Building the capacity of women through the local DIME offices is necessary, and this can be done in close cooperation with the SEILA programme and NGOs like WENetCam. Boosting financial support To underscore the essential role of modern energy services in tackling poverty concerns, Cambodian banks should be provided international support to stimulate the domestic loans market. International banks and To alleviate women's drudgery, it is desirable to scale up and promote the use of efficient low-cost technologies. 28 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia MEETING THE CHALLENGES finance institutions could provide loans at low interests to local banks. This would have a direct and positive impact on the provision of local loans for productive uses of energy. Also, MIME should be provided with legal support to help dedicate loans to nurture SMEs.

In Cambodia, small-scale CDM projects are considered a high priority because they have potential to meet the country\u2019s technology and end-use needs. Also, their replicability potential is usually high. Presently, the CDM, however, largely fails to support clean energy projects that serve the energy needs of the poor. Small-scale projects are in a disadvantaged position due to the high transaction costs compared to the amount of certified emission reductions (CERs) they are able to produce. This is so despite the simplified modalities and procedures available to them. Additionally, methodological issues and risk-sharing on future trade bar small-scale projects from accessing CDM funds. One way to reduce transaction costs is through bundling several small- scale CDM projects together and developing them as one larger CDM project. Whether this can substantially reduce the prohibitive transaction costs is, however, project-specific. Also, the new initiative of programmatic CDM involves an aggregation of a number of relatively small emission reduction activities into a larger bundle called the Programme of Activities (PoA). Both the above-mentioned \u2018single project activities\u2019 require compliance with detailed rules, which are time-consuming and require greater expertise. Another source for carbon finance is the non-regulated carbon market, which favours GHG emission abatement and projects with high social value. These voluntary carbon offsets are free of the stringent guidelines, lengthy paper work and high transaction costs. Cambodia has the option to explore all of the above, with a combination that suits their particular needs. The World Bank has provided a seed grant to GERES (in collaboration with the DNA) to set up a carbon help-desk. It will help project developers with technical assistance and facilitation to get fair deals when marketing their emission reductions. GERES Cambodia has successfully assisted a local NGO in getting carbon funds from Europe for a programme that will place efficient stoves in 450 school canteens. Moreover, a rice miller has installed a gasifier and sold the carbon credits as verified emission 29 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia MEETING THE CHALLENGES 7 The use of ceramic water filters can reduce a substantial amount of fuelwood and charcoal as the drinking water does not need to be cooked anymore. The establishment of a national body for energy information dissemination will be necessary. reductions (VERs). The NBP is in the process of certification and could gain substantial financial support, if the project is approved by the CDM Executive Board. The process of approval involves many risks and the high investments in baseline studies, methodologies and certification. Other Cambodian companies are also interested in mitigating their emissions. Projects or programmes of ICSs, gasifiers, tree plantations, efficient charcoal kilns, solar lanterns, ceramic water filters7 and so on could try to sell carbon credits either through the regulated or non-regulated carbon market. However, it must be noted that there is generally quite a significant difference in the price of the carbon credits sold, depending upon the market. CERs are generally worth more than VERs. Therefore, higher price in the regulated market could offset higher transaction costs. Hence, the decision of choosing suitable carbon markets for Cambodian emission reduction projects should include a consideration of all the different issues and target the basic energy access issue at a decentralized level. Improving information flow Rural families could benefit a lot from simple modern energy services. Many of them are not even aware of the existence of these options. The establishment of a national body for energy information dissemination will be necessary. This organization should launch targeted information drives, while selecting its modalities based on the message, medium and audience. Meanwhile, training programmes and workshops should be organized to build capacities in provincial DIME offices to spread the word in rural areas. In order to capture issues related to poverty reduction, information on SMEs and REEs could become freely available if the accounting and client management software developed by SME-Cambodia is widely adopted. An appropriate software system is currently being tested by a few REEs. The relatively high percentage of ownership of televisions and radios makes these media ideal for promoting energy-related information. Over 50 percent of Cambodia\u2019s rural population has access to radio while 45 percent has access to television (NIS 2005). Worldwide, mass media has been a successful information tool. EEO and MIME must together explore ways to harness the capabilities of radio, television and the print media to inform and educate rural communities on energy efficiency and affordable options. As a first step, awareness can be generated in rural communities through energy and poverty-reduction related programmes on television 30 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia MEETING", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2a39e5b-b1eb-4166-9661-410467c0f207": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2a39e5b-b1eb-4166-9661-410467c0f207", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5196a649fe98deab0fb5589b964500cae9d52f5aa9456ff820d08ddaf7c0fa0"}}, "hash": "c5196a649fe98deab0fb5589b964500cae9d52f5aa9456ff820d08ddaf7c0fa0", "text": "THE CHALLENGES At the operational level, DIMEs across the country must be trained and adequately compensated to conduct data collection exercises. and radio. Such programmes could focus on the simple techniques of energy conservation, reducing household energy bills, renewable energy options and so on. The NGO Research Development International (RDI) has a media suite producing videos appealing to Khmer-style karaoke culture. RDI produces popular karaoke videos on clay water filter, rope pumps (a project promoted by the Word Bank) and treadle pumps. This is a very innovative approach for the promotion of energy efficiency technologies in villages. Measuring the impact A detailed set of indicators should be developed to monitor poverty reduction through energy improvements. Some of the key indicators to monitor poverty reduction through energy provision could include the following: \u2022 The number of households with energy-efficient cook stoves \u2022 The number of energy-efficient REEs and BCSs \u2022 The number of schools and health centres with access to sustainable energy supply \u2022 The number of SMEs adopting energy efficiency practices and/or using RETs for their energy needs \u2022 Tonnes of wood produced in energy plantations \u2022 The number of IPPs adopting energy efficiency measures Data generated by GVEP to map energy use by poorer income sectors can be used to establish indicators for energy and poverty. In addition, MIME and UNDP can request for NIS\u2019s involvement in the analyses of energy and poverty data. At the operational level, DIMEs across the country must be trained and adequately compensated to conduct data collection exercises. Some missing data \u2013 for instance, energy use by SMEs and biomass flows \u2013 could be integrated in regular surveys for data collation by various ministries, NIS and SEILA. The recommended central coordinating agency on energy and poverty could work together with NIS, SEILA and ministries to analyse the available figures on poverty and energy concerns. NIS has the basic user profile for cooking and lighting, as well as information on income groups collected over many years. The Energy Department could take the lead to work with the Ministry of Agriculture to collect information on available energy resources based on agricultural wastes. The Forestry Administration could be convinced to work on the demand and supply of fuelwood. This will help determine land resource needs for fuelwood tree farming. 31 Energy and Poverty in Cambodia MEETING THE CHALLENGES REFERENCES M CONCLUSION any people in Phnom Penh and other urban areas are experiencing economic development. However, the rural areas are being left far behind, as some even experience \u2018negative\u2019 growth. To develop rural areas, providing modern energy services to the poor is a critical component that needs immediate attention. At the national level, there is need for a coordinating agency to focus on issues related to energy and poverty. MIME is the apex agency that needs support and capacity-building to enable project implementation to reach rural communities. The recently ratified CESS offers a good policy framework for programme implementation. The challenge is to focus on the energy needs of the rural poor and to generate a sustainable and efficient supply of basic fuels such as firewood, charcoal, kerosene and LA batteries. It is also important to focus on the productive use of energy, without providing expensive electricity that might only be used for entertainment purposes. RET capacity-building and promotion on a national level is important. However, at the provincial and community levels, energy coordination should be a top priority. Since women use most energy for household work, their participation in energy planning, especially through the implementation of programmes at the commune and village levels, becomes essential. Financial support and small loans are important to boost productive use of energy in rural villages and should be accompanied with a secure investment climate and clear tax regime. Perhaps the most important and feasible intervention is the promotion of RETs. Large-scale awareness of these technologies and, ideally, their provision to rural households is required. Though many rural folk are interested in RETs, they are not available in rural areas. ICSs, for example, are sold only in urban areas. The above-mentioned activities as preliminary priorities can make for a good start for a rural energy development programme by MIME. However, more effort, many more programmes and additional support will be needed to improve the livelihoods of rural families. The reality is that poor, rural families often rely on firewood that threatens them with smoke-related health problems. They either have poor quality kerosene lighting or pay for immensely expensive local electricity grids.

Access to affordable modern energy services can improve their productivity and enhance living standards. Even so, there are no specific targets for the energy sector in the Millennium Declaration, a historic document signed seven years ago by the world\u2019s leaders. Affordable and sustainable modern energy services are a necessity for countries to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Efforts of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet these aims will be hindered unless adequate attention is given to the crucial role energy services play in the development process. This is particularly true for the economic, environmental and social well-being of the poor. With fluctuating energy prices, the poor in many of the countries in the Asia and Pacific region face a daunting future. For them, access to affordable and essential modern energy services that could improve their living conditions and ensure a means to earn a living, will fall outside their reach. Recognizing the urgency for countries to factor in access to modern energy services, particularly when shaping national poverty reduction initiatives, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided technical and financial support for national-level rapid energy assessments. The primary aim of this work, carried out through UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) and completed in 2006, was to identify gaps and priority needs in linking energy services provision with poverty reduction. The framework for rapid gap assessments linking energy and poverty was developed as a joint effort of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) and UNDP country offices in the region, with the support of experts from the region. The draft framework was discussed at two sub-regional meetings, one held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005) and the other in Apia, Samoa (September 2005). The meetings were helpful in customizing the framework to suit specific needs and circumstances of the participating countries. Subsequently, UNDP country offices held national-level stakeholder consultations to consolidate the findings and recommendations of the assessments. This work benefited immensely from the support of government FOREWORD Energy and Poverty in China vi officials and representatives of civil society. Documented in individual country reports, this work serves as resource and reference material for programming and planning for access to modern energy services for the underserved, particularly, the poor. This document is a summary of the Country Report on China and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the Country Report, summarizes the challenges faced at the national level, and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to energy policy, including institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, priority programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support are highlighted. It offers a way forward, outlining issues and options for the country. Our hope is that this document will be of relevance to national policy makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organizations and academia in implementing various measures to promote access to modern energy services for the poor.

As a result of rapid economic growth, China has seen significant progress in poverty reduction over the past few decades. Energy demand has increased simultaneously, and China is today a major energy consumer as well as a producer in the world. Despite the progress in the energy sector, regional imbalances keep many rural households away from the benefits brought by modern energy services. Although almost all Chinese villages have access to electricity, electricity use in poor households is less than one-third of that in higher-income households, and still a number of households in remote villages are deprived of access to any kind of electricity. China\u2019s poor still use inefficient technologies and sources of energy. Straw and fuelwood account for 54 percent and coal 33 percent of energy requirements of rural households, which indicates that indoor air pollution still poses serious health problems in poor households with traditional cook stoves. Inefficient and coal dependent rural industries are yet another source of pollution that threatens health and environment in China. This study examines critical energy issues in China related to institutional structure of the energy sector, policy and regulatory framework, and sectoral programmes. It analyses reasons for the limited reach of energy services to rural provinces; unsustainable dependence on traditional fuels and inefficient technologies; the restricted supply of energy by rural energy enterprises; and inadequate financing for energy. Gender concerns are also examined in rural energy projects and programmes. It highlights the urgent need for key data and indicators to support monitoring and evaluation of energy access for areas that are least served. PREFACE Energy and Poverty in China viii This report concludes that limited national-level coordinating mechanisms and local-level capacities constrain the targeted provision of energy services to poor communities and the fulfilling of the MDGs. The rationale is that a strengthened institutional approach can synergize energy development strategies with poverty reduction objectives and distribute benefits from improved access to modern energy services more equally. An improved coordination mechanism targeting all energy sector players at the national, provincial and municipality levels and specific capacity-building interventions for rural energy institutions can be evolved to scale-up energy access in the country. Promising energy initiatives can and do exist in China. A pilot programme to build small hydropower plants in rural areas so as to replace traditional fuel with hydropower began in 2003, and by the end of 2004, 27 small hydropower plants were built and 300,000 farmers were able to shift to hydropower. The Ministry of Agriculture has also successfully initiated development of improved cook stoves, biogas and biomass gasification systems in households and rural industries. Nevertheless, the top-down energy-programme formulation in China in general could benefit from wider integration of local concerns. Energy demand surveys and needs analyses among rural households by local governance bodies and capacity building of community-based organizations to engage meaningfully in the exercise can help replace current top-down programming practices. Promoting cooperation and exchange between eastern and western areas of China could also be valuable. Provinces and counties with sound rural energy capacities and with successful energy-service practices could play key roles in facilitating improved energy service systems on a wider scale. The commitment of the Government of China to the promotion of polices for rural energy and renewable energy development over the years is highly commendable. These policies have encouraged government spending in the area of energy, which has led to some tangible success. The Law on Renewable Energy was also put into effect in 2006. Nevertheless, this report also notes that a comprehensive national energy law, which is currently at the draft stage, is of great importance to the effectiveness of the long-term energy strategies and needs to be operationalized soon. Improving affordability of energy services for the poor requires restructuring existing energy service networks and infusing a pro-poor tariff regime within service networks. Independent community electricity networks powered by locally available renewable energy sources (biomass, solar, wind, etc.) could be part of the solution. To achieve greater energy efficiency in rural SMEs and elsewhere, the technology input must be complemented by a strong policy framework that encourages and ix Energy and Poverty in China rewards the efficient use of energy. Especially important is the design of well-targeted pro-poor subsidy and tax policies, as well as improved schemes for encouraging cooperatives to supply micro-financing for small energy projects and income-generating activities. Such policies can have a major impact on the capital costs of rural grid electrification and the development of off-grid solutions. These policies could also be key to ensuring the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb1ae967-ed94-4142-8536-a7e5def951c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb1ae967-ed94-4142-8536-a7e5def951c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ada361dda4fe1daa4f57b599a2e76edfdde1f6dec7d964f59a74d8b8073d9914"}, "3": {"node_id": "2086c38b-a914-4c36-b93c-5b0986b01e09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34cab799b450074140def74bbb8ca9fe5eb39b1877bd2c9f92c8054bb2db2d11"}}, "hash": "6b15a8a0478d4ad1e266917ce56a5d7b6ba257d5de92f5337936e707edd524b5", "text": "provision of low-cost energy services to poor people.

Approximately 60 percent of this population lives in rural areas (UNDP 2006). In terms of its total area, China is also among the largest countries in the world, covering about 9.6 million square kilometres. Over the last 30 years, developments in China have brought about enormous advances in the standard of living for a large proportion of the population, including the rural poor. According to official statistics, the number of rural people living in extreme poverty dropped from 250 million in 1978 to 28 million in 2002. Based on the international poverty line benchmark of US$1 of income per day, the number of China\u2019s poor is estimated to have dropped from around 490 million in 1990 to 88 million in 2002 (UNDP 2004)1.

In 2002, the poverty line was adjusted upward from 300 yuan per capita to 625 yuan per capita. In 2003, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) added a new poverty line at 865 yuan, which raised the share of non-food expenditure (NBS 2004). 2 Energy and Poverty in China BACKGROUND Strong economic growth has been accompanied by an increasing demand for energy. China is the second largest energy consumer in the world, after the United States. Of its actual energy consumption, coal makes up for 66 percent, oil 23 percent, hydropower 8 percent, and natural gas a mere 3 percent. Moreover, China is a major producer of energy as well as one of the major net energy importers in the world (IEA 2006). China started economic reforms with an open-door policy in the late 1970s. Since then, China has set the stage for rapid economic growth with continuous experimentation and multi-staged market reform. China\u2019s energy policies also emanated from the overall reforms for economic development. Its primary goals were to increase energy supply, optimize energy structure, and improve the quality of people\u2019s lives as well as their environment.

To some extent, one of the key reasons behind China\u2019s success lies in the decoupling of economic growth with energy growth through policies and extensive energy efficiency programmes. Significant progress has also been made in policies and regulations at the local level. Due to efforts made by various agencies, a legal framework has gradually been established for rural energy development. Over 20 provinces have adopted proactive policies to encourage rural energy development. A lot of municipality- and county-level governments have also formulated relevant policies and regulations. Despite impressive achievements, China still has formidable challenges on the poverty front. The poor residing in rural China\u2019s hinterlands still live in sordid conditions and remain highly vulnerable to natural calamities. They are distanced from industrialized coastal provinces and are therefore lacking access to the benefits of modern energy services. According to the 2000 Monitoring and Evaluation Report on Rural Poverty in China, electricity use in poor households is less than one-third of that in higher-income households (NBS 2001). This keeps low-income sectors of the population away from the benefits of economic development and opportunities brought about by electricity services. Similarly, many rural households still use inefficient sources of energy \u2013 such as straw and fuelwood \u2013 for residential heating and cooking. In 2004, straw and fuelwood together had a 54 percent share in rural residential energy use, while liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) had a toehold at 1 percent (see Figure 1). This indicates the persistence of known social and economic fallouts attributed to these traditional fuel sources, such as exposure to indoor air pollution (IAP), increases in respiratory ailments, loss of productive time, and environmental degradation. 3 Energy and Poverty in China BACKGROUND FIGURE 1 COMPOSITION OF CHINA\u2019S RURAL RESIDENTIAL ENERGY USE (2004) B THE CHALLENGES THE CHALLENGES In rural China, the dominance of traditional fuels and the absence of modern energy services threaten to derail China\u2019s commitments towards the MDGs. An analysis of China\u2019s energy sector, with special attention to its connections to the country\u2019s rural poverty reduction agenda, indicates that gaps are slowing the impact that modern energy could have on the lives of the rural poor. Some of these gaps are discussed in this document. Institutional arrangements for energy access and poverty reduction efore the 1980s, \u2018rural energy\u2019 was not a strong agenda item and an integrated rural energy management system did not exist. The focus on rural energy development had been on individual technologies for specific problem solving. In the mid-1980s, the Central Government set up the Leading Group for the Comprehensive Development of Rural Energy to coordinate among various agencies. It was led by the former State Planning Commission, and comprised ministries such as the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), the State Forestry Ministry (SFM), the Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR) and the Ministry of Power Industries (MoPI). Similar leading groups were also established at provincial and county levels. Source NBS (2005) 4 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES 2 The State Planning Commission was renamed the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) in 1998. 3 In 2003, the SDPC was restructured into the NDRC. The former State Planning Commission was responsible for overall planning, design and coordination, and for allocation of financial resources. The MoA was responsible for development of energy-saving technologies, such as energy-saving cooking stoves and stoves to heat kangs (brick-beds used in rural China\u2019s northern regions); promotion of technologies that utilize agricultural by-products and waste (through biomass gasification, carbonization, liquefaction, or ethanol production and fermentation) as well as human and animal waste; and development of new energy sources, such as solar, wind, geothermal, and small-scale hydropower. The SFM was responsible for planting and utilization of fuelwood. It was the responsibility of the MoWR to construct small-scale hydropower plants and the MoPI to construct power grids for rural areas. As economic reform in China deepened, the country\u2019s energy institutional arrangements experienced a sea change. As per the rules of the new economy, energy enterprises were pushed into the market. They became the major actors in market competition, while the Government\u2019s role was geared towards energy programming and energy macro- management.

Furthermore, the decentralized energy management model in China lacked strategy management; it could not adapt to the sustainable development demands on energy and economy. In March 2003, the new Chinese Government proposed and passed the new institutional reform scheme of the State Council and decided to establish the National Energy Bureau (NEB) within the newly built National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)3. The NEB was established by reorganizing the former SDPC, the former SETC, and some other commissions and bureaus. At a national level, it acts as a comprehensive energy management organization. NEB\u2019s main responsibility is to study and establish national energy development strategies, policies and regulations, and programmes. It has to guide and coordinate the development of the energy industry, examine and 5 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES supervise the price of energy, and manage the energy sector strategically. The implementation of this reform scheme has had a crucial impact on the sustainable development of energy in China. Yet, since the NDRC and other ministries wield the authority, achieving synergy between them has been challenging, and the NEB has not been able to manage the energy work very well. For example, in the same year that NEB was created, the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) was also established. Only a year later did the Central Government demarcate the functions of electricity pricing and electricity market supervision between the NDRC and the SERC. And, operationally, their work areas are still not distinct. This is one of the key reasons why the new electricity power law cannot be finally modified and issued. Within the NDRC (and besides the NEB), there are also other departments \u2013 such as the Economy Operation Department, Price Department, and Resource and Environment Department \u2013 that have the power to conduct energy management exercises. With the fast developing Chinese economy, energy has become a vital strategic issue that concerns national economic development, social stability and national security. The National Energy Leading Group (NELG) was established on 13 May 2005. The aim of NELG is to provide coordination of energy policy development at the highest level of the Government. The Group is headed by Premier Wen Jiabao, and the ministers of the following ministries are the members of the Group: NDRC, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST), National Security Science and Technology Commission, Ministry of Finance (MoF), Ministry of Land and Resources, MoA, Ministry of Commerce (MoC), State Assets Commission, State Environmental Protection Administration, State Administration of Work Safety, and SERC. The Deputy General Chief of Staff at the Headquarters of the General Staff of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) is also a member. To support the work of the NELG, the Office of the National Energy Leading Group (ONELG) was formed in May 2005. ONELG is a policy development think-tank. Its key policy responsibility is to provide in-depth research and analysis into key energy issues in China. Currently, ONELG is in charge of the development of the Energy Law, conducts research in other macro energy policies and provides recommendations to the State Council (see Figure 2). Achieving synergy between the NDRC and other ministries has been challenging. 6 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES FIGURE 2 CHINA\u2019S NATIONAL ENERGY INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS At the provincial level, institutions such as the provincial Economic and Trade Commission (ETC), the provincial Development and Reform Commission (DRC), and the Electric Power (Power Grid) Company organize and manage the production and logistics of electric power, coal, oil, and so on. They also execute the orders of the Government for these energy sources. The local energy institutions\u2019 frameworks follow the provincial one. Within this hierarchical institutional arrangement, access to energy services in rural areas has been taken into consideration at all levels. In this regard, the Leading Group for the Comprehensive Development of Rural Energy, set up by the Central Government, continues to coordinate among various energy agencies. The coordination aims to identify rural energy needs and implement suitable development projects, within the original structure for rural energy management (see Figure 3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1e71a9f-98ae-454d-ab09-160002a8e821": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1e71a9f-98ae-454d-ab09-160002a8e821", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "129e98dabb9c8f4538342317cd9c68f0a772d2a1317a18c3a703d0609b7dceb0"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea0cbdfc-decc-4d5f-940f-2d88b7e68609", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eee3c070c740435f625d8985360e094e02dea33ff448243c6e9d911b3326e1f7"}}, "hash": "befbba8332e16ca29b987bdd8703b248e45ccd6d0dd20778f173cfa6c0ee478b", "text": "Source State Council (2005) 7 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES FIGURE 3 INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AT THE DECENTRALIZED LEVEL In addition to the endeavours of national- and local-level energy agencies, efforts to provide access to energy services have also been made by non-energy-sector institutions such as the Poverty Alleviation Office in the State Council, or the National Poverty Alleviation Leading Group (NPALG).

Source Kewen (2000) 8 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES Policy and regulatory frameworks do not adequately address cost and affordability Policies and regulations are essential for rural energy development. They not only guide the development of rural energy, but also serve as a foundation for the rural energy market. Since the 1990s, China has formulated a number of policies to promote rural energy development. In 1994, \u2018rural renewable energy development\u2019 was incorporated into China\u2019s Agenda 21, the Tenth Five Year Plan for Economic Development, and Long-term Objectives for 2010. In 1995, the State Council of China ratified the Report on the Development of New Energy and Renewable Energy. In 1997, China put into effect the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Energy Conservation, which is not only about energy conservation, but also requires that rural energy development be strengthened. Article 38 of the law states the following: \u201cGovernments at all levels shall promote rural energy development according to the guiding principle of respecting local conditions, developing multiple energy sources which complement one another, and utilizing energy comprehensively and efficiently, and devote necessary efforts to develop renewable and new energy sources such as methane, solar energy, wind energy, hydro energy and thermal energy.\u201d This law serves as a legal basis for the development of rural energy and for the formulation of special or local rural energy development policies and regulations. These policies have encouraged government spending in the area of energy, which has led to some tangible success. Since 1998, the Chinese Government has spent 180 billion yuan in renovating the rural power grids, reforming the rural power management system, and adopting a policy of \u2018same price for the same power grid\u2019 for both urban and rural areas. After just three years of these efforts, the price of electricity decreased and the quality of power supply improved. Many farmers purchased home appliances and consumed more electricity to manufacture agricultural by-products. Despite the progress in policy interventions that carry modern energy services to rural areas, however, high cost and low affordability keep the rural and poor populations at bay from modern energy services. In 2000, it was estimated that about 7 million households in remote villages were deprived of access to any kind of electricity. Likewise, many poor households in electrified villages have been unable to benefit from electricity services because of low income. Electricity consumption by poor rural households is less than a third of higher-income households (UNDP 2001). Many poor households in electrified villages have been unable to benefit from electricity services because of low income. 9 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES Since 2002, the Central Government has been issuing policy documents on rural development to combat these statistics. These documents underscore the importance of small-scale rural infrastructure facilities, including water-saving irrigation facilities, drinking water facilities for humans and animals, methane facilities, water and power facilities, roads, grassland fences, and so on. The Agriculture Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China emphasizes that in the process of rural economic development, natural resources shall be used rationally. It also states that renewable and clean energy sources shall be developed, while ecological agricultural practices shall be encouraged so as to protect and improve the environment. In 2003, the Chinese Government kicked off a pilot programme to build small hydropower plants in rural areas so as to replace traditional fuel with hydropower. The primary objective of the programme was to subsidize some rural areas to build small hydropower plants so as to lower the price of electricity. Farmers could then replace traditional fuels \u2013 firewood or coal \u2013 with low-priced electricity for cooking and heating. This would not only lessen farmers\u2019 dependency on firewood for fuel, but also protect forests and vegetation cover, and conserve ecological resources. By the end of 2004, the programme had been implemented in 26 counties (or municipalities) of five provinces (Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou and Shanxi). Twenty-seven small hydropower plants were built, and 300,000 farmers were able to shift to hydropower. With these small successes in rural renewable energy, more attention has also been given to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acf6cb99-1e84-4f40-bbf8-32db7772e8aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "acf6cb99-1e84-4f40-bbf8-32db7772e8aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0a30e852cf4ffb6b7962f406c3ee772905b0a827c9482be6036dd296e41592d"}, "3": {"node_id": "c671bc90-0159-4559-b978-7ad7137d6ff3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ddb398ed97583d7a2be2de08fcfaa2e31f12819310608b6c1615ca8206d57c0e"}}, "hash": "f9c2bdfcf3eeefabce89d3e22afd936579da90fd1d361eba3c2c5db0c15b309c", "text": "renewable energy at a national level. China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress ratified the Law of the People\u2019s Repub- lic of China on Renewable Energy and it was put into effect on 1 January, 2006. The law addresses the development of renewable energy as a national interest, and requires the support of all members of society. It also stipulates that the Government shall take on major responsibilities in developing renewable energy. To this effect, the law establishes legal mechanisms in five respective areas: market cultivation and protection; resource development and planning; technological and industrial support; price support and cost sharing; and financial support and economic incentives. It also stipulates that the Treasury of the Central Government shall establish a special \u2018renewable energy development fund\u2019 to support renewable energy research and development, the formulation of product and technical standards, and energy development in economically disadvantaged regions. 10 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES Despite these policy interventions, a legal national energy system has not yet been set up, which weakens the effectiveness of long-term energy strategies and polices. A draft of China\u2019s first energy law is being reviewed for further revisions. It is expected to be finalized in 2008. This overarching law for the country\u2019s energy industry and trade will address issues of energy planning, exploration, conservation, reserves and technological innovation. Hopefully, these policy advances will further the spread of modern energy access that rural China has been witnessing since the late 1970s. Progress has been made \u2013 for example through the previously mentioned hydropower plants \u2013 and rural consumption of modern commercial energy sources (coal, oil, electricity, and so on), vis-\u00e0-vis the total rural residential and energy consumption, has risen from 28 percent in 1987 to 43 percent in 2004. In China, both residential and productive energy consumption in rural areas has increased greatly between 1987 and 2004 (see Figure 4). In the same period, the use of crop straw and fuelwood in the total rural household energy mix saw a decrease from 71 percent to 54 percent. Almost all Chinese villages (99 percent) had access to electricity in 2003 with variation across the country, ranging from 86 percent in Qinghai to 100 percent in many areas like Hubei, Shandong and Jiangsu; and the use of modern energy for cooking also saw a substantial increase (see Figure 5). Yet, while access to modern energy is on the rise, the issue still requires critical attention with regards to affordability and the equal im- plementation of macro-level change across broad rural regions.

BOX 3: KEY CHALLENGES IN PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK Energy- programme formulation largely follows a top-down approach. 13 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES compelled by the high incidence of IAP and rising levels of rural industrial GHG emissions. With biomass and coal having the largest share in rural domestic energy consumption (87 percent combined), energy efficiency programmes focus on improving the efficiency of traditional cook stoves that use these fuels. It is estimated that approximately 150,000 children under the age of five years die every year from acute lower-respiratory infections that have a direct link with IAP caused by inefficient cook stoves (Smith 2005). Such cook stoves have low-heating efficiency (less than 10 percent) and are used by over 40 million rural households, mostly in China\u2019s poorer interiors. This figure would be much higher if not for the decades of technology development which have facilitated a degree of popularization of high-efficiency cook stoves. These cook stoves can operate on fuelwood with a 20-30 percent heating efficiency, or on coal stoves with a 30-40 percent heating efficiency. The increased penetration of clean energy sources for cooking is being simultaneously pursued.

BOX 4: KEY CHALLENGES IN PROMOTING RURAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY 15 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES The energy sector in particular has seen growing private investment, with the untapped potential for modern energy services in rural China attracting keen entrepreneurial interest (see Figures 6a and 6b). There are two types of private energy entrepreneurs: the energy production-based type that produce energy or sell equipment and parts; and energy service enterprises that provide after-sales service for equipment and parts, technology consulting and training. By 2004, over 1,100 private energy production-based enterprises had established themselves in rural areas, employing over 19,000 people. These enterprises have been particularly active in the renewable energy sector \u2013 solar energy, biomass, biogas, and so on. In the same year, 2,240 private energy service producers emerged in rural China, employing over 15,000 people (MoA 2005). However, rural energy enterprises (like all RSMEs) are beset by problems of obsolete technology, inadequately trained personnel, and restricted access to credit and finance. The financial and technological hurdles are especially acute in energy-based ventures, which require more investments in modern technology and processes than, for example, a traditional-style brick- or cement-making facility. As a result, many energy-based enterprises fail to sustain themselves in the long run. FIGURE 6A RURAL ENERGY PRODUCTION- BASED ENTERPRISES Source MoA (2005) 16 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES FIGURE 6B RURAL ENERGY SERVICE ENTERPRISES \u25a0 Rural energy enterprises are beset by problems of obsolete technology, inadequately trained personnel, and restricted access to credit and finance. \u25a0 Lack of standard operating rules or policies to guide non-state- owned enterprises wishing to enter the energy industry. \u25a0 Lack of official incentive mechanisms further dissuades private enterprise from investing in areas deemed unprofitable. BOX 5: KEY CHALLENGES IN PROMOTING ENERGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP Constrained financial support for rural energy development China\u2019s transition from a planned economy to a market economy forced changes in financing for rural energy development. Previously, in the 1980s, the Central Government provided annual funds for rural energy development from its financial budget. Then, over the course of the 1990s, government support shifted to a loan mechanism for rural energy projects, including infrastructure, technological innovation and small hydropower plants, which were supported through loans from banking institutions. However, since the restructuring of the financial sector, the state-owned banking institutions have emerged as independent commercial banks, and provisions like loans for energy projects have been abolished. Source MoA (2005) 17 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES One benefit of this modality is that rural areas earlier serviced only by the government-owned Agricultural Bank of China and Agricultural Development Bank of China can now theoretically gain access to commercial bank loans. However, in actuality, many rural entrepreneurs have found it difficult to take advantage of commercial bank funding. Loans to RSMEs comprised only 6 percent of all bank loans in 2003, a figure attributed largely to the lack of information in banks about the profit potential of rural enterprises, and rural energy enterprises in particular. For instance, banks have limited knowledge about the biogas industry, and therefore have not developed credit services for biogas projects. Since the late 1990s, the support for rural energy development has reverted to the previous modality: the Government acts as the major fund provider for rural energy projects and rural energy development depends mainly on fiscal support.

BOX 6: KEY CHALLENGES RELATED TO FINANCING Gender concerns Chinese women are the backbone of rural economies, with about 74 percent of women economically active at the local level. Hence, any energy initiative that focuses on poverty reduction would necessarily require special Banks have limited knowledge about the profit potential of rural energy enterprises. 18 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES mechanisms to involve women. Even more importantly, it is doubly beneficial to include women in energy initiatives because the energy needs of women are often different from men \u2013 for example with regards to cooking and traditional work. There has been a lack of focus on reducing drudgery for poor, rural women (mostly caused by traditional cooking practices). These deeper dimensions of poverty keep rural women excluded from healthier lives and empowerment. Even though improved cook stoves have been relatively well-disseminated in China, traditional stoves and kitchen ranges (generally with two heat openings \u2013 one for cooking food and the other for livestock) still persist. Each of these heat openings has a huge burning chamber, but rarely possesses an installed chimney. Biofuel burned in this kind of installation has low heat efficiency. Yet, in 2004, 41 million Chinese farmers living in low-income regions (out of a total of 230 million farmers) were still using these inefficient, old-style stoves and kitchen ranges. The smoke and dust from these stoves and kitchen ranges has adverse effects on health, especially that of rural women. They are the direct victims of IAP caused by inefficient energy use. According to a survey done for a rural energy research project (in natural reserve zones in Sichuan Province in 2005) by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), energy consumption in low-income households is not lower than energy consumption in high-income households, as might otherwise be expected. There are two main reasons for this: firstly, the stoves or kitchen ranges in low-income families have very low energy efficiency (as mentioned above) which results in unnecessary waste of fuelwood; secondly, in low-income regions most farmers still use traditional methods to raise animals such as pigs, which consume quite a lot of fuelwood. While pig rearing is still the most important source of family cash revenues in rural areas in China, it consumes a lot of energy. In economically and technologically advanced regions, farmers usually feed their pigs compound or hybrid feedstuff, neither of which require reheating before being served. In poor areas, conversely, the feed needs to be heated before it is served to animals. An investigation related to energy consumption at farms shows that energy used for heating animal feed is even more than that for cooking food for humans. Millions of farmers still use inefficient stoves in low-income regions. 19 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES Lack of linkages between energy and poverty in monitoring and evaluation frameworks In 1993, China established the statistical reporting system for rural energy programmes and projects to collect information on processes and trends relating to renewable energy programmes in rural areas. This has provided the basis for strategy and policy formulation and development of future rural energy programmes. Indicators for this system were further developed in the following years. This led to the yearbook entitled Statistical Summary of Rural Renewable Energy in China in 1996, issued by the MoA\u2019s Science, Technology, and Education Department. From then on, it has been annually published with updated findings. Similarly, to facilitate the enforcement of various poverty alleviation policies and programmes, the NBS launched a poverty-monitoring system for selected rural areas. This culminated in the publication of the 2001- 2010 Action Plan for Rural Poverty Alleviation of China. Despite the presence of such capable monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems, the monitoring systems and indicators pertaining to energy and poverty operate largely independent of each other. \u25a0 Limited involvement of women in new energy technologies extension programmes. \u25a0 Use of inefficient energy technology by women in rural households. \u25a0 Insufficient attention paid to the poor and women in energy management and development at the national level. \u25a0 Lack of representation by women in the existing rural energy programme framework; women and gender issues are insufficiently represented in programme formulation. BOX 7: KEY CHALLENGES TO ADDRESSING GENDER ISSUES IN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT \u25a0 The baseline data bank of M&E for rural energy projects has not been well-established, rendering the development of energy-poverty indicators much more challenging. \u25a0 Awareness and recognition of the importance of monitoring energy projects has not been", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "892391aa-be02-46cf-a4d4-14db44012503": {"__data__": {"id_": "892391aa-be02-46cf-a4d4-14db44012503", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe40fc6d534ee5496e626319650dbc94f84ec9f2c9423c6e365ea05e0b53b7c5"}}, "hash": "fe40fc6d534ee5496e626319650dbc94f84ec9f2c9423c6e365ea05e0b53b7c5", "text": "adequately shared by local governments and related departments. BOX 8: KEY CHALLENGES TO AN EFFECTIVE MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK 20 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES Inadequate management and dissemination of energy information China\u2019s energy information is primarily disseminated through three channels: annual reports, such as the Chinese Energy Statistic Yearbook published by the NBS; reports and technical documents from energy associations, such as the China Rural Energy Association (CREA); and energy-related websites, such as the web portal China5e.com, maintained by the consultancy firm Falcon Power Ltd. However, much of the information disseminated in these venues focuses on production and supply of energy, and there is little focus on energy\u2019s linkages with poverty. This hampers targeted interventions in this area. Further, while the MoA and the NBS remain in control of rural energy data collection, the development of the national economy and resultant institutional reform has transferred some data collection functions (including energy-poverty indicators) from the Government to industrial associations. This has weakened data collection capacity at the local level since such associations do not have the services of local administrative units at their disposal. At the national level, China has yet to build an enabling environment for free access to data related to energy, in particular rural energy. Policy formulation for information disclosure has been delayed, and the traditional reluctance to share official information continues to restrict access to energy information. \u25a0 The energy sector lacks an integrated information management system. \u25a0 In some cases, there are no leading organizations to coordinate information collection and processing. \u25a0 Limited access to official information, such as that pertaining to energy. BOX 9: KEY CHALLENGES TO PROPER INFORMATION MANAGEMENT 21 Energy and Poverty in China THE CHALLENGES Strengthening institutional focus on energy and poverty issues he institutional arrangements must include mechanisms to synergize energy development strategies with poverty reduction objectives. A start could be made by strengthening the energy access for poverty reduction agenda of the NPALG. The NPALG could also be linked with the Leading Group for the Comprehensive Development of Rural Energy, thus enabling energy-poverty synergy at the local level. Another way to foster a stronger poverty reduction component in institutional arrangements would involve the creation of a poverty reduction unit within the State Energy Leading Group. This unit could be mandated to serve as the apex energy-poverty institution in China, coordinating the many objectives of various energy-sector players, vis-\u00e0-vis energy-poverty linkages. Specific efforts should be undertaken in the following areas to build the capacity of rural energy institutions: 1. Deepen research into the national energy development strategy Governments and related agencies at all levels should deepen their understanding of the strategic position of rural energy. This needs to be followed by the formulation of a rural energy development plan, in accordance with local conditions. Efforts should be made to make the rural energy development plan a part of the national energy development plan. This plan should then be listed in the finance budget at all levels. 2. Promote harmony among energy-integrated administrative departments Rural energy development is based on national energy management and has a close association with other energy management agencies, especially rural renewable energy development. Other efforts that need to be explored are: a. enhancing synergy among the national energy-integrated management agencies; b. managing conflicts between monopolization and competition in the energy industry; and c. the unfair distribution of energy benefits through reorganization and merging within the energy industry. MEETING THE CHALLENGES T Synergize energy development strategies with poverty reduction. 22 Energy and Poverty in China MEETING THE CHALLENGES 3. Strengthen networking, partnerships and international cooperation Energy management departments and agencies should organize energy- based enterprises to participate in academic activities, support related research, and promote cooperation with the Government and other strategic partners. 4. Monitor and evaluate national and rural energy development processes To measure the implementation of sustainable development, an indicator system should be set up. On the one hand, it could be used to monitor and evaluate development levels, trends and the speed of all aspects in a certain period. On the other hand, it could be used to measure the degree of harmony for all integrated fields. The system would help the Government to master the necessary information so as to decide the priority level of rural energy development processes.

The SERC, in its role as the apex electricity tariff supervisor, is best placed to initiate such a restructuring exercise, with the final objective being to infuse a pro-poor tariff regime within service networks. The cost barrier to electricity access, acute in remote areas, can also be resolved by aggressively pushing independent community electricity networks (powered by locally available renewable fuels such as biomass, solar, wind, and so on). Such off-grid interventions would require the marshalling of research and development skills by the MoST and other technology-focused institutions. At the same time, ground-level implementation and monitoring can be assigned to local governance bodies and community groups. Additionally, given that most of the rural energy service systems are located in developed areas (such as eastern and central China) and that the western areas are facing the difficulties of deficient energy service systems, the cooperation and exchange between eastern and western areas should be promoted. The provinces and counties with sound rural energy capacities, energy construction projects, and enterprises with good Cooperation and exchange between eastern and western areas should be promoted. 23 Energy and Poverty in China MEETING THE CHALLENGES practice on energy production and services should conduct technology exchange and training, and establish cooperative enterprises. At the national level, China could take many steps to reduce regional imbalances in modern energy access and alleviate poverty through: a. integrating poverty reduction goals into energy sector planning and focusing on policies that address the energy needs of rural poor; b. developing integrated and holistic rural energy strategies and programmes; c. establishing financing mechanisms and frameworks at all levels with a focus on microfinance and approaches that support local energy service companies; and d. building local capacity through community-based organizations. Approaches to an effective rural energy programme framework From a policy standpoint, the Government\u2019s rural energy programmes should approach rural energy concerns directly from the local level, building capacity through community-based organizations and enhancing participation. Local governance bodies in provinces and counties could expand their roles in the energy programme framework by initiating energy demand surveys and need analyses among rural households. Such an approach would include energy-related concerns of the poorest sections of rural society, and also the unique challenges faced by women in energy access and use. It could also be useful to draw lessons learned from the programmes and projects supported by international organizations such as UNDP, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB). These organizations supported China in implementing renewable energy projects, in terms of policy development and capacity-building. Many pilot projects were also established for demonstration. Such programmes emphasized how to overcome obstacles relating to policy, technology, market concerns and financing. These programmes have been more likely to produce effective results than programmes which do not consider removing these obstacles. Greater technology intervention for energy efficiency Considering that poor populations cannot afford commercial energy and electrical services due to their low-income level, indigenous energy resources should be popularized and utilized efficiently. Local governance bodies could initiate energy demand surveys and need analyses among rural households. 24 Energy and Poverty in China MEETING THE CHALLENGES As mentioned earlier, IAP claims numerous lives in China. For this reason, improved domestic energy technologies need greater attention in rural energy development strategies. Fuel-saving stoves are beneficial for rural areas and have a wide potential for use. Having already facilitated some degree of efficiency improvements \u2013 achieved with various cook stove designs \u2013 China needs further innovations to cut costs and increase their popularity. The Chinese Government should delegate lead roles in both cost reduction and popularization to institutions such as the National Integrated Rural Energy Programme Leading Group and the MoA\u2019s Energy-saving Appliances Quality Inspection Centre. The Women\u2019s Federation could also play an important role in disseminating knowledge on IAP, with the goal of raising awareness on the dangers of inefficient combustion in houses, and thus raising the demand for new energy technologies. As biogas technology evolves, technology service providers have the ability to design and implement all stages of the projects including pre-process, anaerobic digestion, biogas distribution, fertilizer making and after-treatment of digestive fluid. The biogas technology can be designed according to the types of waste, such as agricultural, livestock, landfill and mixed waste. This 'fuel' is fed into an anaerobic digester to produce biogas. One benefit is that biogas tanks serve as purification devices for waste water. This particularly fits the needs of small- to medium-size cities and population-concentrated villages and towns without a big waste water treatment facility.

More efforts should be made to popularize existing mature and advanced energy-saving technologies in high-energy consumption enterprises among RSMEs in China. To engender energy efficiency in RSMEs, the technology input must be complemented by a strong policy framework that encourages and rewards the efficient use of energy. This could include the extension of the two management methods currently being tested on a pilot scale to RSMEs in China (Energy-saving Voluntary Agreement and Contract-binding Energy Management) and ensuring RSME participation in technical upgrades and training projects. Incentives to rural energy entrepreneurs Having facilitated the emergence of rural, energy-based entrepreneurship, China must now focus on facilitating access to technology, training and finance for rural energy enterprises. This can be achieved by coordinated action from relevant institutions, such as the NDRC, MoST, MoF, and China needs further innovation to cut costs and increase popularity of improved energy technologies. 25 Energy and Poverty in China MEETING THE CHALLENGES industry associations, such as the China Rural Energy Association and China Biogas Association. On the policy front, standardized rules and policies must be implemented to facilitate easier private participation in the rural energy sector. An incentive regime \u2013 comprising targeted subsidies, tax incentives and favourable loan policies \u2013 can also be developed by relevant agencies to encourage private energy entrepreneurship in remote areas. Such incentives are already put in place by provincial governments to spur renewable energy development. For example, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang provinces are exempted from tax for renewable energy enterprises. Sichuan and Guangzhou provinces offer preferential pricing on cement for building biogas tanks at the factory price. Such incentive models can be studied and replicated by all provincial governments. A diversified financing system for rural China In order to improve the financing capacity of rural energy construction, the following measures should be taken: \u2022 Provide fiscal discounting and encourage credit cooperatives to supply micro loans for small energy projects, especially in remote villages, in order to solve the shortage of farmers\u2019 auxiliary funds in energy construction. \u2022 Clarify the property rights of communities\u2019 energy establishments and improve the management. \u2022 Encourage the participation of private enterprises and cooperation between the Government and enterprises so as to facilitate enterprise development and industrialization. Measures to improve supply and efficiency include: a. commercialized operations and management; b. regular competition between private enterprises in the process of construction and operation; and c. participation of users and the public in planning, construction and supervision of the establishments. \u2022 Establish security funds for the construction of energy establishments to encourage financial institutions to provide loans for rural energy projects. \u2022 Extend pilots undertaken for generating demand for the incentives and schemes. \u2022 Provide training to improve the financing capacity of farmers and the whole community. \u2022 Create greater awareness among the banks on potential renewable energy options and financing needs. 26 Energy and Poverty in China MEETING THE CHALLENGES \u2022 Document and disseminate information on profitability of rural enterprises and rural energy enterprises. \u2022 Charge the usage of rural energy establishments. For example, some local governments take protective price measures. Shanghai set a relatively high price for the civil cooking use of biogas as to RMB 1.2 per cubic metre. Such wide-ranging changes would require the involvement of the NDRC, with inputs and assistance from MoC, MoF and provincial governments. Mainstreaming gender concerns in energy-poverty linkages Increasing energy utilization efficiency and improving the indoor environment of rural households \u2013 and thus improving women\u2019s health conditions \u2013 requires the development of energy-saving technologies. Greater effort needs to be made to replace or modify the remaining rural traditional stoves and kitchen ranges. The Central Government should draft a nationwide plan to replace and renovate traditional stoves and kitchen ranges, especially in low-income regions. The construction of the whole rural energy system should be enhanced. Renewable energy technologies should be further developed and utilized. This should be done with consideration to local conditions, participatory approaches, complementary utilization of different energies, combined use of fuels and actual benefits. Any energy initiative for poverty reduction needs to also be seen from the lens of gender. Mechanisms and systems should be evolved for ensuring that gender issues are incorporated into the plan of action and energy programme framework. Awareness-raising and capacity-building on gender tools among policy makers could be highly beneficial.

This new energy-poverty M&E system can be jointly developed by the NBS; the Science, Technology, and Education 27 Energy and Poverty in China MEETING THE CHALLENGES Department of the MoA; and the Technology Development Centre for Energy and Environmental Protection. An information management system for the energy sector The absence of an energy information management system has hindered the effectiveness of China\u2019s rural energy development programmes. It is, therefore, urgent for China to establish a nationwide energy information system through an energy information engineering project. This project should be led by a relevant, competent agency (for instance, the NBS) and could be applied in two phases. The first phase could focus on the establishment of the information system, while the second phase could enable the development of an information resource network at the national, provincial and local levels. Such a system could funnel information into the system. A special focus on generating energy-poverty information is required. For example, the project could address issues such as the percentage of income spent by poor households on energy services, or the acceptable cost of off-grid electricity for the rural poor. The national rural energy information database should be the core of the information exchange on national rural energy. This could be the basis of national rural energy information collection and could make data processing timely, effective and accurate. It could also form the reference point for national rural energy policy formulation and strategic rural energy planning. According to the current Chinese rural energy management system, the national rural energy database should include information from national enterprises, regional enterprises, sectoral enterprises and major energy enterprises. nergy has a deep impact on the nation\u2019s economic development, security concerns and environment. Improved rural energy services can enhance living standards and create a healthier living environment through the application of solar, biogas and energy-saving technologies. Rural energy systems need to be developed to alleviate poverty and improve the role of women in rural development. Some countermeasures in this direction could be enabling policies, capacity- building, increase in investments, strengthening information access and disclosure, promoting technology innovation for the rural energy development, and conducting more research on energy and poverty alleviation.

only limited market-oriented schemes for energy projects are available to RSMEs, thus rural energy construction remains overdependent on government subsidies Due to policy limitations, development of rural cooperative financing (especially micro-credit) is difficult, resulting in the growth of informal finance, which, in turn, increases the financial risks of borrowers Financing Concerns Improved domestic energy technologies need greater attention in rural energy development strategies Further innovations needed with regards to improved cook stoves in order to cut costs and increase popularity Delegate lead roles in both cost reduction and popularization to institutions such as the National Integrated Rural Energy Programme Leading Group and the MoA\u2019s Energy-saving Appliances Quality Inspection Centre More efforts should be made to popularize existing mature and advanced energy-saving technologies in high-energy consumption enterprises among RSMEs Technology input must be complemented by a strong policy framework that encourages and rewards the efficient use of energy Extend good pilot projects and ensure RSME participation in technical upgrades and training projects Further promote growing rural energy-based investment Facilitate access to technology, training and finance Involve relevant institutions such as NDRC, MoST, and MoF and industry associations such as CREA and China Biogas Association Implement standardized rules and policies to facilitate easier private participation in the rural energy sector Relevant agencies to further develop an incentive regime, comprising subsidies, tax incentives and favourable loan policies Existing incentive models can be studied and replicated by all provincial governments Establish a diversified financing and investment system, which includes security funds to enable financial institutions to extend loans for rural energy projects Encourage more commercialized and participatory project schemes; Extend pilots undertaken for generating demand for the incentives and schemes; Provide training to improve the financing capacity of farmers and the whole community Create greater awareness among the banks on potential renewable energy options and financing needs; Document and disseminate information on profitability of rural enterprises and rural energy enterprises The proposed financial mechanism should include the provision of fiscal discounts to solve fund shortage Support credit cooperatives to provide micro loans to small energy projects, especially in remote villages Involve NDRC to work closely with MoC, MoF and provincial governments 30 Energy and Poverty in China SCHEMATIC REPRESENTATION OF CHALLENGES AND MODALITIES TO MEET THE CHALLENGES (CONTINUED...)

Access to affordable modern energy services can improve their productivity and enhance their living standards. Even so, there are no specific targets for the energy sector in the Millennium Declaration, a historic document signed seven years ago by the world\u2019s leaders. Affordable and sustainable modern energy services are a necessity for countries to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Efforts of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet these aims will be hindered unless adequate attention is paid to the crucial role energy services play in the development process. This is particularly true for the economic, environmental, and social well-being of the poor. With fluctuating energy prices, the poor in many countries in the Asia and Pacific region face a daunting future. For them, access to affordable and essential modern energy services, which could improve their living conditions and ensure a means to earn a living, will fall outside their reach. Recognizing the urgency for countries to factor in access to modern energy services, particularly when shaping national poverty reduction initiatives, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided technical and financial support for national-level rapid energy assessments. The primary aim of this work, carried out through UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) and completed in 2006, was to identify gaps and priority needs in linking energy services provision with poverty reduction. The framework for rapid gap assessments linking energy and poverty was developed as a joint effort of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) and UNDP country offices in the region, with the support of experts from the region. The draft framework was discussed at two sub-regional meetings, one held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005), and the other in Apia, Samoa (September 2005). The meetings were helpful in customizing the framework to suit specific needs and circumstances of the participating countries. vi Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES Subsequently, the UNDP country offices held national-level stakeholder consultations to consolidate the findings and recommendations of the assessments. This work benefited immensely from the support of government officials and representatives of civil society. Documented in individual country reports, this work serves as a resource and reference material for programming and planning for access to modern energy services for the underserved, particularly, the poor. This document is a summary of the Country Report on Malaysia and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the country report, summarizes the challenges faced at the national level and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to energy policy, including institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, priority programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support, are highlighted. It offers a way forward, outlining issues and options for the country. Our hope is that this document will be of relevance to national policy- makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organizations and academia in implementing various measures to promote access to modern energy services for the poor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a11d6f8-6101-4384-852c-b82366262f20": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a11d6f8-6101-4384-852c-b82366262f20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f926e21347b93b29a2706ad0e334cc7a2cfd9004d06b6fc8d0e8d8be8de79e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "55db1419-f51b-4191-8c44-1b83ba9bc5c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a883795fa0dd348b5821542b5e7296917225efe6778803f77e72cd6ad6ba750d"}}, "hash": "95bdec97346bc6e5f20c8c1f1ff3d1798ad66ce569612ab09f2b4e3748bd3c1f", "text": "Elizabeth Fong Regional Manager UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok vii Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES PREFACE This report sets out to examine the ways and means for providing affordable, accessible and reliable energy services towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and poverty reduction in Malaysia.

Malaysia is ranked among the most developed and industrialized countries in the Asia-Pacific region. As a result of robust economic growth and substantial wealth redistribution policies, the country has witnessed significant poverty reduction over the past few decades. The country has extensive electricity coverage, including rural areas. Ninety-five percent of the rural population is served through the grid. Even the more isolated areas are serviced through diesel generators, solar, and mini-hydro sources. Nonetheless, these gains have not been matched by the provision of cleaner sources of energy for heating and cooking, especially in the remote areas of Sabah and Sarawak. This study examines critical energy access issues in Malaysia, especially in pockets of unserved or underserved sections, including the institutional structure of the energy sector, policy and regulatory frameworks, and sectoral programmes. It analyses reasons for the narrow reach of energy services to some rural communities, dependence on traditional fuels and inefficient technologies, the restricted supply of energy by rural energy enterprises and inadequate means of financing for energy. Gender concerns are also examined in rural energy projects and programmes. The report highlights the urgent need for key data and indicators to support monitoring and evaluation of energy access for areas that are least served and maintain sustained political commitment to sound energy sector management at national, sub-national and local levels. Malaysia has a well-established institutional structure working towards the targeted provision of energy services for poor communities viii Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES countries. Subsequently, UNDP country offices held national-level stakeholder consultations to chart the implementation of the assessments, guide the process and validate the findings and recommendations of the assessments. This work benefited immensely from the support of government officials and representatives of the civil society. The work has since been documented as country reports, which currently serve as resource and reference material for partners in country- level programming and planning for advancing access to modern energy services for the unserved and, in particular, the poor. This report is a summary of the original elaborate Country Report on Malaysia and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the Country Report and summarizes the challenges faced at the national level, and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to institutional structure, policy and regulatory frameworks, programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support are emphasized. In particular, an attempt has been made to present Malaysia country-specific energy access challenges and way forward diagrammatically in the form of a flow chart to enable the reader a macro view of the issues and options. As an advocacy tool, it is felt that this summary report will be of relevance to national policy makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organizations and other interested persons, including the academia, in preparing and implementing various measures to promote access to modern energy services for the poor and the unserved to support national efforts in poverty reduction. and in meeting the MDGs. Hence, the Government has been reasonably successful in bringing together fragmented energy markets, and removing barriers to efficient functioning of existing and new markets at national and sub-national levels. Central oversight of energy services for poor people not only has implications towards more efficient and cost- effective use of energy, but also serves to address issues of environmental and health hazards. Concurrently, this central coordinating mechanism has been often successful in addressing market failures, and bridging gaps in areas where markets are absent. These include addressing issues of providing energy services in challenging, remote and sparsely populated geographical areas. The report revealed that despite the unambiguous benefits arising from the centralized institutional structure, there remain several challenges that could be addressed for further improved and sustained energy access. As of date, there is limited private sector participation in rural electrification and energy entrepreneurship, especially SMEs (small and medium enterprises), micro-enterprises and local entrepreneurs in rural areas. This is further weakened by the lack of community-based self- help systems. Extensive efforts in the provision of grid-supplied energy have been complemented by attempts to harness renewable energy sources but remain sparse. While renewable energy sources are particularly cost-effective in many rural areas of the country where vast quantities of biomass sources are available, they need to be upscaled by addressing the barriers that limit their spread. The provision of affordable modern energy for cooking in remote rural areas remains a challenge.

However, to succeed in total energy availability and poverty reduction, major constraints need to be addressed. For instance, it is important to recognize and emphasize the involvement of local communities in adopting renewable energy resources. It should also be complemented with promoting renewable energy in the electrification strategy in remote rural areas, such as in Sabah and Sarawak. A well thought out renewable-energy-based rural electrification strategy not only would encourage local community involvement and multi-stakeholder participation in rural energy sector, it would also offer diversification in energy resource mix for the country. The Government\u2019s commitment to rural electrification also needs to be complemented by a programme to deliver affordable modern cooking fuel to remote communities. In addition, major indicators that incorporate rural energy figures in terms of access, poverty and gender ix Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES concerns should be established and closely monitored. Continuous assessment of various programmes is crucial to achieve the targeted goal of poverty reduction, especially in Sabah and Sarawak. We trust that the report is unique in terms of giving insights into bridging the gaps between the access to energy and poverty reduction efforts in Malaysia. Our aim is to provide country-specific information on institutional structures, energy resources, policy recommendations and capacity and financial gaps that can point the way towards improving access to modern energy services, particularly for the poor.

The Development Programme for the Hardcore Poor, which focuses on economic, social, human and physical development, and the micro-credit scheme for women from the lower-income groups have facilitated their access to employment and improved livelihoods. The energy sector witnessed considerable growth in demand, almost parallel to the country\u2019s economic growth. The growth in electricity demand was the highest from the industrial sector (10.7 percent), followed by the residential sector (8.4 percent) and the commercial sector (7.9 percent). As Malaysia became more industrialized and urbanized, electricity rapidly became the main source of energy, with the industrial sector being its largest consumer. There was a positive correlation between the growth rates in annual gross domestic product (GDP) and final energy demand between 1980 and 2002, as shown in Figure 1. The drop in final energy demand between 1995 and 2000 was caused by the Asian economic crisis that affected many Asian countries in 1997. Rural and suburban areas in Malaysia are served by the electricity grid and receive adequate (almost 95 percent) electricity supply. The isolated areas, where the grid does not reach, obtain their supply mostly through the Government support in the form of diesel generators and solar and mini-hydro sources. The Malaysian rural electrification experience has demonstrated that as electrification expands its reach, poverty levels tend to decrease, as shown in Figure 2. Energy access and poverty reduction are, therefore, correlated significantly. In addition to other Government programmes, the rural electrification programme has significantly contributed to this positive impact. However, gains in electricity use have not been matched by the provision of cleaner energy sources for cooking and heating. Fuelwood BACKGROUND There is a significant correlation between access to energy and poverty reduction. 3 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES remains the primary source of energy for heating and cooking in some parts of the rural areas. Despite the reduction in consumption levels from 85 percent in 1950 to 28 percent in 2004, communities in remote areas in the states of Sabah and Sarawak still largely rely on inefficient energy sources, such as fuelwood and kerosene. This issue is closely linked to poverty and poses an enormous challenge to poverty reduction initiatives in Malaysia. This report examines the challenges in harmonizing the energy sector policies with poverty reduction goals in Malaysia.

Supply of commercial energy In 2004, the primary supply of commercial energy grew only by 1.9 percent, as compared to a 7.5 percent increase during the previous year. The growth took place because of higher production of natural gas at 57,768 kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe), an increase of 9 percent from 53,010 ktoe in 2003. At a lesser rate, the production of crude oil increased by a narrow margin of 2.7 percent from 37,026 ktoe in 2003 to 38,041 ktoe in 2004. Despite a smaller margin in production, import of petroleum products registered a positive growth of 26.2 percent. The production of coal in 2004 increased by more than 100 percent, but minimal in quantum as compared to other fossil fuels. Import of coal has consistently increased at an annual rate of 50 percent since 2002. Coal import increased by 52.2 percent, from 5,268 ktoe in 2003 to 8,019 ktoe in 2004.

The share of energy consumption by the industrial sector also increased to 40 percent due to a 10.7 percent growth from the previous year. The growth was largely a contribution of manufacturing activity that also boosted exports and strong demand in the domestic market. During this period, the share of both residential and commercial sectors remained at about 13 percent. An analysis of demand by fuel type showed a marginal hike in petroleum products\u2014from 61.2 percent in 2003 to 61.3 percent in 2004. Of this share, motor petrol and diesel were the major contributors at Demand for energy increased in all sectors, especially transport and industry. BACKGROUND 5 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES about 34.3 percent and 40.5 percent, respectively. The share of natural gas saw a minor increase to 17.3 percent, while the share of electricity reduced to 17.8 percent in 2004 from 18.3 percent in 2003. Electricity generation and consumption Malaysia\u2019s total installed capacity at the end of 2004 was at 20,052.6 megawatt (MW), lower by 0.3 percent from 20,118.7 MW in 2003. Ninety-one percent of the installed capacity is located in Peninsular Malaysia, 5 percent in Sarawak and the remaining in Sabah. Electricity generation registered 89,098.4 gigawatt-hour (GWh) \u2013 an increase of 8.1 percent \u2013 as compared to 82,406.1 GWh in 2003. Peninsular Malaysia recorded the highest demand at 12,023 MW, while for Sarawak the figure was 686.4 MW. Sabah West Coast grid needed 318 MW and Sabah East Coast grid consumed 168 MW. In terms of electricity generation mix, the share of natural gas as energy input in power stations has decreased to 59.4 percent vis- -vis 65.3 percent in 2003. The share of coal, however, increased from 24.6 percent in 2003 to 30 percent in 2004. Hydropower followed next with its share at 7.5 percent, while the remaining constituents were fuel oil and diesel, at 1.5 percent each. The total electricity consumption for Malaysia recorded a growth of 8.3 percent, from 71,160.6 GWh in 2003 to 77,080.8 GWh in 2004. For the next five years (2006\u20132010), the Malaysian industrial and transport sectors are expected to consume more energy, with most of this demand being met by higher use of natural gas and coal. The Government\u2019s commitment towards rapid economic growth, sustainable development of the energy sector and its favourable energy balance (excess supply and varied energy resources) has played a major role towards meeting the energy requirements of most parts of the country. This obligation has also helped reduce poverty incidence between 1970 and 2004. The incidence of poverty reduced between 1970 and 2004. THE CHALLENGES Centralized institutional structure for rural energy development M alaysia has a matured institutional set-up in the energy industries, covering the oil and gas sector to the electricity segment. The Economic Planning Unit (EPU) has the overarching responsibility towards energy policy and planning, both for conventional and non-conventional sources of energy, and poverty 6 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES reduction in Malaysia. The Ministry of Rural and Regional Development (MRRD) and the Ministry of Energy, Water and Communications (MEWC) work in close coordination for the rural electrification programme. In addition, MEWC works in tandem with the Energy Commission (EC) and Pusat Tenaga Malaysia (PTM \u2013 the Malaysian Energy Centre) to coordinate national programmes in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Due to sharp increase in international oil prices, the Ministry of Plantation, Industries and Commodities had launched a drive towards the development of palm bio-diesel1 as a source of renewable energy. Malaysia\u2019s power system \u2013 generation, transmission and distribution \u2013 had historically been a Government responsibility. However, the heavy costs incurred in constructing power plants prompted the entry of the private sector into electricity generation. The Electricity Supply Act (1990) enabled licensed independent power producers (IPPs) to build their own generation plants and sell power to utility companies, under regulation of the then Department of Electricity Supply, now known as the EC.

Malaysia currently produces about 727,000 barrels of oil and 5.8 billion cubic feet of gas per day (EPU 2006). The Government of Malaysia (GoM) recognizes that the availability of adequate and convenient energy is an essential determinant of the socio- economic status of rural households. Understanding the link between energy supply and rural development programmes, the Government has intensified its effort towards the delivery of energy services, especially rural electrification. Figure 3 displays the involvement of different organizations in the electricity sector. Administratively, Malaysia is organized along a three-tier set-up including federal, state and local governments. The federal government 1 Palm bio-diesel is an alternative fuel derived from palm oil. Either directly or blended with petroleum diesel, palm bio-diesel can be used in diesel engines. Power industry is dominated by the Government- owned utilities. 7 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES FIGURE 3 INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR has established a number of ministries, departments and agencies to undertake various social development functions and sub-functions. The Government institutions that coordinate poverty reduction and rural development programmes have energy as a component in their respective mandates. Within the area of rural energy development, although there exist state and local authorities, it is mostly implemented centrally through the federal government. The primary responsibility of determining, initiating and implementing rural development programmes lies with MRRD, which is also responsible for rural electrification. Where grid extensions are not feasible, MRRD uses options like solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. 8 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES Policy and regulatory framework Malaysia is well endowed with energy resources such as petroleum, natural gas, hydro and coal. Its energy policy can be traced to the formulation of the Petroleum Development Act (1974), which paved the way for the establishment of PETRONAS and its exclusive rights of ownership for exploration and production of oil and gas resources. The Energy Policy of 1979, the National Depletion Policy of 1980, the Four Fuel Diversification Policy of 1981 and the Fifth Fuel Policy of 2001 reveal the Government\u2019s intention of sustainable development of energy. The National Energy Policy contains three guiding principles for the energy sector. 1 To ensure adequate, secure and cost-effective energy supply through the development and utilization of alternative sources of energy, including non-renewable and renewable ones 2 To promote efficient utilization of energy and discourage wasteful and non-productive patterns of energy consumption 3 To minimize the negative environmental impacts of the energy supply chain, that is, energy production, transportation, conversion and utilization. The National Depletion Policy, incorporated into the National Petroleum Policy, is aimed at safeguarding national oil and gas reserves by ensuring a control mechanism in production at major oil fields. The Four Fuel Diversification Policy complements the National Depletion Policy as it aims to create a supply mix of oil, gas, large-sized hydropower and coal to reduce the nation\u2019s heavy dependence on oil, particularly in the power sector. In 2001, the Four Fuel Policy was expanded to include renewable energy as the fifth fuel option in the power generation mix. BOX 1: KEY INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES Malaysia has a fairly good institutional structure in place to coordinate various activities related to poverty reduction and rural electrification. However, it would further strengthen the existing institutional structure if the following two specific gaps are taken care of. P Community-based self-help systems are missing. P Private-sector participation in rural electrification is limited, except for a few private diesel generators and solar vendors in the rural areas, as well as contractors of centrally planned programmes. Policies in the energy sector reveal the Government\u2019s intention of sustainable development of energy. 9 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES It is the responsibility of MRRD to determine and initiate appropriate policies and implement rural development programmes. These functions involve basic utilities such as road infrastructure, water and rural energy services. The Ministry\u2019s initiatives include the development of mini hydro plants and the provision of electricity through solar PV systems, where grid-connected supply cannot be extended at reasonable rates. Supporting rural electrification programmes, MRRD plays an important role in identifying rural areas as beneficiaries of the solar home system and the diesel generator and grid-line projects. The Ministry is also responsible for activities such as carrying out maintenance works at sites throughout Malaysia, providing solar equipment, conducting technical visits to the maintenance sites, coordinating the maintenance for solar equipment and so on.

The main objective of this will be to narrow development gaps between regions and states, as well as between rural and urban areas. Measures will be undertaken to reduce disparities in terms of per capita income and household income, incidence of poverty in less-developed states. Further, disparities of infrastructure and utilities between the states in Peninsular Malaysia and between the Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak will also be reduced. The total development allocation for rural development projects for the Ninth Malaysia Plan is 28.4 billion ringgit2 (EPU 2006). The Government is committed towards total rural electrification and this gets reflected in its programme initiatives and development budget allocations, as part of the country\u2019s five-year national development plans (Malaysia Plans). Under this strategy, electricity supply options for the rural population are determined by MRRD, together with the power utilities. Rural electrification continues to be identified as one of the key components of the country\u2019s rural development and welfare programmes. It is promoted as part of an integrated approach to rural development planning and programme developments (including water, telecommunications and roads supply) and recognized as a vital element in the drive towards poverty reduction. The five-year Malaysia (development) plans allocate substantial funding to rural electrification, with funds ranging from 3.78 million ringgit for the First Five-Year Plan to 275 million ringgit for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (EPU 2006). Rural electrification is a key component of the country\u2019s rural development and welfare programmes. 2 Conversion rate: US $1 = 3.7 ringgit 10 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES The rural electrification programme is aimed at supplying electricity to homes and villages, which are beyond the operational areas of the local authorities, including the orang asli (indigenous communities). Rural electrification forms part of efforts to provide social amenities to enhance the quality of life and living standards among the rural communities. Since the 1970s, rural electrification has been incorporated in the New Economic Policy framework to eradicate poverty and increase the quality of life in rural areas, especially that of the rural poor. The increasing use of electricity is expected to raise productivity and income in the agriculture, industry and commercial sectors, as also affect modernization and cause attitudinal change in the rural sector. In the Ninth Malaysia Plan (2006\u20132010), the implementation of the rural electrification programme will be intensified to improve the quality of life of rural communities, especially in Sabah and Sarawak. Towards this end, about 54,680 housing units will be supplied with electricity through the solar hybrid and micro-hydro systems. A larger portion of the Malaysian Electricity Supply Industry Trust Account (MESITA) allocations will be utilized in the implementation of these programmes. By the end of the Plan period, rural electricity coverage (as a percentage of total rural housing units) in Sabah and Sarawak is expected to increase to 80.6 percent (from 72.8 percent in 2005) and 89.6 percent (from 80.8 percent in 2005), respectively. For Malaysia, the national rural electrification coverage will increase from 92.9 percent in 2005 to 95.1 percent in 2010 (EPU 2006). Grid extension has always been accorded priority, especially due to its low costs and established infrastructure. Other decentralized energy systems \u2013 such as diesel generator sets, solar home and solar hybrid systems \u2013 are implemented for use in remote areas that are not serviced by grids. More than 5,000 villages have benefited from the programme since it was first initiated in 1998. However, the long-term plan of the Government is to extend grids, wherever economically viable. MESITA was formally established on 1 January 1997, under a Trust Deed issued by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Major independent power producers, including the Tenaga Nasional Berhad (Generation), which sells electricity to the Peninsular Grid, make annual contributions to the Trust Account to fulfil their national obligation towards electricity supply in the country. The rate agreed by the contributors is pegged at one percent of the total audited annual turnover of the previous year. The total contributions made up to 2002 amounted to 365.5 million ringgit. Projects allowed under the MESITA Trust Deed comprise rural electrification programmes; research and development (R&D) Rural electricity coverage is expected to increase substantially by 2010.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a72cb0e-7877-4255-b5ed-852f299fbc35": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a72cb0e-7877-4255-b5ed-852f299fbc35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8094481292ae9d39d7b456f9c9bebf661a4303b71971a1efa58e43373b2ca6a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7a64693-18b9-415a-becb-a0bf1ab71faa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ab266ef16ece5524a0aced5447eab479c9f2fa3be653237023be08095d2bba0"}}, "hash": "9bafa4854a388104b401ef6259b950443b421ff5b15da7053cfa185e818214fb", "text": "11 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES programme for the electricity industry such as development of new and renewable sources of energy; training and education for human resource development in the electricity sector; energy-efficiency programmes; and the promotion and development of the electricity supply industry.

MESITA, thus, managed to play a catalytic role in carrying out the development programme of the electricity supply industry on a sustainable basis. With strong rural development strategies comprising substantial funding \u2013 both from the Government and through MESITA \u2013 access to energy for the poor in Malaysia has improved. Meanwhile, domestic non-electricity energy resources are generally market-based and sold in many shops in the rural area. Access is further enhanced as a result of the strong, integrated rural development approach of the Government, which includes road access for rural communities. Fossil fuels such as gasoline (for transportation), liquefied petroleum gas or LPG (for cooking) and kerosene (for cooking and lighting) are widely sold even in un-electrified places, such as deep rural pockets of Sabah and Sarawak. The Government\u2019s decision to intensify the development and use of renewable energy as the fifth fuel resource is manifested by the country\u2019s fifth fuel diversification policy, related to renewable energy, energy efficiency and R&D. To encourage energy generation through renewable energy, the Government implemented many incentives, such as investment tax allowance, import duty exemption and sales tax exemption. The Government introduced the National Biofuel Policy in August 2005 to encourage the production and utilization of palm oil as an alternative environment-friendly fuel. MESITA\u2019s rural electrification projects benefited over 40,000 households. BOX 2: KEY CHALLENGES IN THE POLICY FRAMEWORK With concerted efforts backed by strong policy support and focus on the states of Sabah and Sarawak, Malaysia should achieve total electricity coverage by 2020. However, the following issues may thwart the progress. P Lack of strong support from the Government and utilities to implement the renewable energy policy. P Unavailability of mechanisms to encourage private developers to participate in rural electrification programmes. 12 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES However, the implementation of the renewable energy policy has not shown significant progress. At the end of 2005, only 12 MW of biomass- generated electricity had been connected to the national grid. In 2002, Government launched the BioGen Project3 in the Malaysian palm oil industry. Funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Global Environment Facility (GEF), the project aims to remove barriers to facilitate wider implementation of Small Renewable Energy Project (SREP). This is so because most of the biomass energy projects are located in remote areas. Programme framework with varied strategies A programme framework with varied strategies makes the Malaysian experience a success story, as far as energy provision and poverty reduction are concerned. Rural electrification, the cornerstone of Malaysia\u2019s rural development programme, has seen accelerated growth since the First Malaya Development Plan (1956\u20131960) recognized it as a necessary component of the country\u2019s rural growth strategy. An integrated grid extension programme was adopted by Malaysia, with a major thrust on provision of 24-hour electricity to the target groups, along with 100 percent supply coverage for the whole country. In addition to grid-supplied electricity, Malaysia has attempted to harness the benefits of renewable energy (particularly, biomass energy) to provide electricity, especially to remote rural areas. Since this option is cost-effective and biomass energy sources are available in vast quantities, a gradual shift towards renewable energy sources would mean a higher rate of poverty reduction and a corresponding rise in living standards. The SREP scheme was launched by the Government in 2001 to integrate renewable energy into the country\u2019s energy sector. Two new renewable energy projects, located in Sabah (palm oil wastes) and Selangor (landfill wastes), were commissioned in 2004 (EPU 2006). However, the implementation of the SREP scheme has been hampered by the low tariff offered by the utility and high capital investment costs. The Government will also need to introduce a more conducive environment by initiating measures for a more level playing field for renewable energy resources. The highly subsidized natural gas, for example, has become the primary fuel for power generation in the country. The Solar Home System (SHS) Programme initiated in the early 1990s is geared towards supplying electricity to rural areas not connected to The implementation of the renewable energy policy has not shown significant progress. 3 Biomass Power Generation and Cogeneration using wastes from Palm Oil mills Demonstration Project 13 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES High costs of PV systems hinder the expansion of SHS Programme.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc08e8a4-3e60-4194-a1f7-b64dc7b76450": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc08e8a4-3e60-4194-a1f7-b64dc7b76450", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9871e23fbce4de26324a33442d0ff95260c3fd2e2712d3b7aba82cb82f344ae8"}, "2": {"node_id": "338aeb4f-eae3-41ce-91c3-1da2bad927c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5fd6b941a9047346eee56a6993928087b564d08001db9951995697601f35acde"}}, "hash": "c505b9b9aafac907b36e3f01af0550d4b8301b79519d9232ec5e24eec546436f", "text": "BOX 3: KEY CHALLENGES IN THE PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK P The market potential for renewable energy diminishes considerably due to its unattractive tariff structures.

The risks related to the marketing of renewable energy systems are high, primarily due to high initial costs and the lack of appropriate enabling policies. Moreover, there are barriers to be overcome in the implementation of SREP and the SHS programmes. P There is a need to build local capacity to get local communities involved in the programme and explain the limitations of systems installed as well as provide skill-based training to maintain the systems. the grid. These areas, inhabited by indigenous communities, include villages in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. This development has led to a significant enhancement in educational levels and improvements in living standards in the target areas. Further expansion of the SHS Programme is, however, inhibited by the higher costs of PV systems, albeit these costs are expected to decrease in the near future. Moreover, problems of overuse of electricity and vandalism too have to be taken into account. Villagers are disappointed when electricity generated is below their expectation and leads to vandalism in various ways. Batteries are used for purposes other than those advocated and solar panels broken. The system has also failed due to its low maintenance. A systematic programme of building local capacity to maintain these systems and raising awareness of the functionality of SHS has clearly been lacking. Access to energy supply Electricity in Malaysia is mainly provided through the grid, and the Peninsular area is well connected to the grid. Almost all households in rural Peninsular Malaysia have access to electricity. There is limited access to the grid in the remote and mountainous terrains in Sabah and Sarawak\u201485 percent and 90 percent, respectively. Overall, most housing units in Malaysia (93.1 percent) have access to 24-hour electricity supply (DoS 2004). Since grid extension is uneconomical for scattered, low-density loads, most rural parts of Sabah and Sarawak are electrified by local diesel generating sets, SHSs and micro-hydropower systems. 14 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES BOX 4: KEY CHALLENGES PERTAINING TO ENERGY ACCESS P Unfavourable geographical features hinder complete rural electrification in the states of Sabah and Sarawak, and remote orang asli villages in Peninsular Malaysia. P Since the population in Sabah and Sarawak is sparse and spread out, the market for electricity has been limited. Sabah and Sarawak make up a mere 20 percent of Malaysia\u2019s population. P Private developers have been reluctant to take up renewable energy programmes because of reasons such as lack of information and knowledge about the features and benefits of alternative forms of energy, high initial investment, lack of a level playing field against subsidized conventional fuels, lack of adequate fiscal incentives and the absence of standardized equipment and quality control. Rural electrification involves providing heavily subsidized grid extensions and isolated generators. In Sabah, 11.9 percent of households receive electricity supply for less than 24 hours a day, while 16.1 percent of households have no electricity at all. The situation is marginally better in Sarawak, where only 5.75 percent of the households are without electricity supply (DoS 2004). The Government is seeking to intensify the development of renewable energy, particularly biomass, as the \u2018fifth fuel\u2019 resource under the country\u2019s Fuel Diversification Policy. The policy has been reinforced by fiscal incentives such as investment tax allowances and SREP, which encourages the connection of small renewable power generation plants to the national grid. Yet another programme called the Solar Project aims to provide power supply to rural areas that are not connected to the grid especially orang asli villages. These villages are located far from the grid and pose logistical problems for diesel supply due to lack of adequate road access. SHS could easily meet the modest energy needs of average rural households, but not for productive uses. The supply of domestic petro-products in Malaysia is market-based. Gasoline, LPG and kerosene are widely available even in the isolated areas of Sabah and Sarawak, made possible by good road or river transport access. The penetration of petrol-genset has increased from 5 percent in 1960 to 40 percent in 2004; penetration of kerosene has reduced from 75 percent in 1960 to 10 percent in 2004, while the penetration of LPG has increased from 5 percent in 1970 to 70 percent in 2004. In Sabah, about 16 percent of households receive no electricity at all. 15 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES Untapped potential for development of energy-efficient systems It is necessary to ensure that the available renewable energy systems operate with high efficiency for maximum output, bearing in mind the high initial costs.

The impetus towards more efficient technologies, however, has been gaining momentum in recent times. The year 2002 saw the installation of 10,000 domestic solar water heaters (both locally manufactured and imported), though limited to urban households with purchasing power. The increase in the use of such heaters grew annually by 10\u201315 percent since 2002. Solar radiation in Malaysia is high by global standards and, therefore, a PV system can generate 30 percent more energy than its equivalent in Germany. Subject to location, a typical PV installation in Malaysia produces about 900\u20131,100 kilowatt-hour (kWh) annually per kilowatt peak (kWp). Besides remote rural households, PV systems are also currently being used for telecommunication, street and garden lighting, and for dispensing parking tickets. Under SREP, 60 projects comprising landfill gas, biomass (palm oil waste and rice husks), municipal solid wastes and mini-hydro have been approved by the national-level technical committee while more viable tariff structures are being negotiated. The potential for improving the efficiency of solar thermal systems and biomass cook stoves has not been explored. BOX 5: KEY CHALLENGES TO ENERGY TECHNOLOGY EFFICIENCY P The solar thermal market has been slow to take off in the commercial/industrial sector due to the relatively low pricing of electricity in Malaysia, caused by high subsidies to conventional fuels. P Despite the abundance of solar energy as a resource, solar photovoltaic applications in Malaysia are limited to mainly stand-alone systems. P While Malaysia has progressed a great deal in terms of hydropower generation, it still lacks the ability to conduct resource assessment of different fuels. 16 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES Insufficient financial assistance for entrepreneurship in energy service delivery Numerous enterprises in rural areas, including rice and oil mills, weaving set-ups and handicraft establishments, use electricity for lighting and motive power. To support the use of modern energy in productive work, the Government has established funding opportunities for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Loans obtained from these funds can be utilized to purchase farm equipment and machinery that run on electricity. Fish and agro-processing industries in rural areas are potential and actual beneficiaries of rural electrification. For instance, reliable electricity supply enables fishermen in coastal areas to keep their daily catch in freezers. Similarly, provision of electricity allows cottage industries to operate longer everyday, thus enhancing productivity and supplementing income. However, the impact of electrification on SMEs in rural areas has not been documented, making it difficult to identify specific gains in rural income generation resulting from modern energy provision. This is aggravated by the fact that the existing data framework does not identify SMEs by location. BOX 6: KEY CHALLENGES TO ENERGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP P Special funds set up by the Government to promote small and medium enterprises do not target entrepreneurs involved in energy service delivery, particularly in the productive use of energy services. Thus, there is a lack of incentives for these enterprises to operate in rural areas. P There are no policies that highlight the linkages between energy entrepreneurship and poverty reduction. Subsidies and fiscal allowances need to be offered to rural industries that use electricity, similar to the special tariffs offered to energy-intensive industries. Monetary allocation and credit schemes The Government has put in place a subsidy for fuels, providing a reprieve to disadvantaged households. Since early 2006, the consumer price of premium petrol (RON 97) was fixed at 1.92 ringgit per litre. Without the subsidy and tax exemption, the price of RON 97 in Peninsular Malaysia would be 2.46 ringgit per litre. For diesel, the non-subsidy price is 2.07 ringgit, whilst the consumer price is 1.26 ringgit. The impact of electrification on SMEs in rural areas has not been documented. 17 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES The extra cost in the form of taxes foregone and subsidies is borne by the Government and this amounted to 14.7 billion ringgit in 2005.

The Government cannot permit the gap between market and subsidized prices to increase, as this could encourage profiteering. It is seen that irresponsible private agencies make illegal profits by purchasing diesel at subsidized prices and selling it at higher prices to the non-subsidized sector.

The Government also has to spend extra on enforcement personnel and equipment in order to arrest/curb smuggling activities.

Savings from subsidies could be used to build more schools, hospitals and public BOX 7: KEY CHALLENGES TO PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR ENERGY PROJECTS P Electricity tariffs under the rural electrification programme are not standardized. This hampers the drive towards complete poverty reduction. Tariff rates charged by SESB and SESCO for domestic, commercial and industrial categories are higher as compared to those charged by Tenaga Nasional Berhad, primarily because of the power generation costs. With the poverty incidence higher in rural Malaysia, these rates burden rural users with unaffordable energy costs and adversely impact the poverty reduction objective. P The participation of development financial institutions in rural energy financing is not significant. Banks and financial institutions are hesitant to support renewable energy projects, as they are not accepted as viable alternatives to conventional sources of energy, such as electricity. P Energy prices are highly subsidized. Provision of subsidies to oil and gas undermines the efforts to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. 18 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES facilities, which would provide long-term benefits to future generations. Both the rich and the poor are seen to benefit from subsidies, which are actually meant for the latter. Subsidies also risk the ability of the Government to reduce the budget deficit. To reduce energy prices for consumers, the micro-hydro project at Long Lawen (Sarawak) has been beneficial for households, as it helps by helping them set aside savings from their incomes. With 60 households having won access to electricity from the project, the total annual benefit accrued to these households amounts to US $5,644.8, indicating the project\u2019s high net value. As income from the Long Lawen project increases, an excess annual fund of US $2,200 in the project account is expected (Richards 2004). This surplus allows electricity to be supplied at reduced rates to families below the poverty line. Nevertheless, the project will need a survey of households by income to identify those eligible for reduced tariffs. Monitoring and evaluation systems focused on quantitative indicators The energy sector monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems in Malaysia have not been able to incorporate qualitative indicators in project assessments. Primary indicators for energy M&E are gleaned from the national energy balance report prepared on a quarterly basis by MEWC and its key agency, PTM. This report provides data on energy usage and trends. The energy indicators are also taken from EC, which publishes annual statistics on electricity generation, distribution, sale and tariff. These statistics include the performance of IPPs and small renewable energy producers too. MRRD is the authority responsible for implementing and monitoring the progress of projects on rural electrification, but the indicators monitored are quantitative and relate to financial disbursement and implementation only. Additionally, EPU assesses the status of rural electrification and provides annual indicators on rural electrification in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. On the other hand, the population and housing census of the Department of Statistics (DoS) provides information on housing units with electricity in different states. Private contractors are hired to monitor the maintenance of SHSs in the rural households of Sabah and Sarawak (for example, the contractor hired for monitoring SHSs reports to BP Solar Malaysia, which collates the data and information). This information is then put forward to MRRD for further processing and evaluation. In the energy sector, qualitative indicators. are absent in project assessments. 19 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES Policy initiatives on access to information There are several sources of information on energy use and its trends in Malaysia. EC provides information on electricity tariff, sales, generation mix and capacity, transmission and distribution, and system performance of the three regional utilities (TNB, SESB, SESCO), IPPs and other electricity distributors.

P Available data do not incorporate the rural energy sector and its linkage with poverty reduction. 20 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES Gender concerns Poverty among women is a major concern for Malaysia, and the Government has made impressive advances in narrowing the gender gap, in terms of improved income and access to productive resources, education and health care. Economic growth has been accompanied by greater participation of women in the formal workforce as well as through the introduction of a range of other economic activities. However, gender gaps continue to exist. For example, women fare worse in the health and education indicators; wage differentials persist; and women are under- represented in the formal labour market. The Eighth Malaysia Plan (2001\u20132005) noted that the incidence of poverty among matriarchal households had increased from 15.1 percent in 1997 to 16.1 percent in 2001. This was partly because of the financial crisis that hit the country in 1997\u20131998, leading to retrenchment of industrial workers, many of them women. Poverty among Malaysian women takes on serious undertones if the urban\u2013rural divide is taken into account. However, there are positive developments to help women improve their financial status as well. One such endeavour is that of the not-for- profit organization Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM), which provides micro- credit to rural women to set up small, self-owned enterprises. Close to 362,000 women (including single mothers) have benefited from this special micro-credit scheme. Another 1,500 women have received assistance under a micro-credit scheme run as part of the National Savings Bank (EPU 2001). During the Eighth Malaysia Plan (2000\u20132005), women in Malaysia were also included in the energy-based entrepreneurship initiatives. Several financial institutions (national banks and not-for-profit organizations) provided assistance to the women in the lower-income groups. For example, cook stoves were provided to women working in fish and agro- processing enterprises. Overall, the issue of poverty among women- BOX 10 KEY CHALLENGE RELATED TO GENDER CONCERNS P Though the EPU and MRRD have been fairly successful in formulating strategies for rural electrification, energy institutions have not addressed the impact of these strategies (through surveys and monitoring) on rural women. These institutions must take into account gender-sensitive energy service programmes, which perceive women as central to the poverty reduction agenda. The incidence of poverty among matriarchal households had increased to 16.1 percent in 2001. 21 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES headed households has caught the attention of policy-makers and corrective steps are being taken, even though much remains to be done. MEETING THE CHALLENGES Encourage multi- stakeholder participation in the rural energy sector. Ensuring institutional participation in rural energy development A s rural energy service is an issue that cuts across myriad sectors, there is a strong need to establish multi-stakeholder participation in the development, implementation and monitoring stages. This can be achieved through the involvement of different stakeholders and institutions at multiple levels.

Developing community-based programmes There is an urgent need to develop community-based energy programmes that see local communities manage the operation and maintenance of electricity systems. This is particularly needed in the remote regions of Sabah and Sarawak, where local utility service providers are unable to do so. Such programmes, if implemented, will develop and enhance local capacities and reduce operational costs, thereby increasing affordability for lower-income groups and contributing to poverty reduction. The privatization of the rural electrification programme (which can greatly reduce the Government\u2019s burden in funding rural electrification projects) could also offset the high cost of centralized generation and distribution, and set free a host of much-needed resources for poverty reduction. A new policy is needed to promote efficient delivery of energy services for poverty reduction in remote provinces. Among others, the policy could mandate the Government\u2019s support for setting up renewable energy projects, such as SHSs, micro-hydro systems and hybrids in remote and inaccessible areas. MEETING THE CHALLENGES 22 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES In the march towards total energy availability and poverty reduction, it is important to recognize and emphasize the involvement of local communities in adopting renewable energy sources. Their participation is key to the acceleration of rural electrification programmes in remote and inaccessible areas. Adequately trained local communities with high awareness levels would be best suited to exploit energy availability for economic advancement. Making rural energy appropriate for local conditions could prove beneficial in the long run. Spatial, climatic and geographical considerations must be taken into account when deciding on the suitability of energy technologies. This could lead to greater electrification and energy efficiency for states such as Sabah and Sarawak. The two states could also be made the focus of SREPs. Smaller renewable energy projects (less than 1 MW) should also be promoted. These could prove to be truly effective in a country with geographical diversity. Promoting renewable energy, including biofuels and hydropower Biomass, another alternative to fossil fuels, is seen as a viable source of energy in the current millennium. The use of alternative energy has been further strengthened as the Government adopted it as the fifth fuel besides oil, gas, coal and hydro for the country\u2019s power generation sector, starting from 2000. Promoting renewable energy in the electrification of rural areas in Sabah and Sarawak is a viable strategy. A coordinated policy between relevant organizations (MEWC, MRRD, state authorities, SESB and SESCO) for the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency for total electrification of Sabah and Sarawak should be formulated. It may be essential for the Government to focus its SREPs on Sabah and Sarawak. The use of biofuel could contribute to poverty reduction by generating employment and making energy services affordable to the lower income group, especially in the wake of ever increasing prices of petrol and diesel. It will also help address the hardships faced by rural people, particularly in the remote areas of Sarawak. A well thought-out, broad-based biofuel policy for rural electrification could be implemented in order to diversify electrification technology. The biofuel manufactured could be more effective in the operation of generators in areas such as Bario, Bakelalan and Kapit in Sarawak. Hydroelectricity, especially in mini- or micro-hydro form, is already being used as a viable energy option in Malaysia to supplement fossil fuels. MEETING THE CHALLENGES Promote renewable energy in the rural areas of Sabah and Sarawak. 23 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES Incentives for rural energy entrepreneurs Funding organizations, research institutions and academic bodies should treat rural energy systems as a priority area in research, documentation and capacity-building exercises, with the aim to develop suitable policy incentives for rural energy entrepreneurs. The impact of energy on rural enterprises must be highlighted by means of documentation, training programmes and publications. The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation could act as the funding agency for research under the Intensification of Research in Priority Areas mechanism. Funds for SMEs should target entrepreneurs involved in energy service delivery in rural areas and also labour-intensive enterprises in rural and remote regions. The services of national development banks and various other financial institutions could be harnessed for this purpose. It is also recommended that rural industries using electricity are granted subsidies and fiscal allowances, based on a percentage of their electricity consumption.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6470d45-a5ef-4097-97ac-a0cf7136965c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6470d45-a5ef-4097-97ac-a0cf7136965c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e0a86cd08af3834e6869456dac83dbadc2edd0f18e4c95dcae536b61b4bd7bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc1e2646-08b8-4def-944a-a0e8b359b9c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "631288cb4367c0f3005dac3128b169bb8d8a00fd5230510d27448a28bbd337c5"}}, "hash": "ec99cb9da4f2c6a16fb871973b59e245ebfaa5bdd1150c6e4bce5a7225414cba", "text": "This task needs to be taken up by MoF and entities such as TNB, SESCO and SESB, along with IPPs.

It may be relevant here to adapt and replicate experiences of micro-credit schemes targeted at women in rural areas by AIM. The inclusion of fiscal components in renewable energy projects (similar to BioGen and MBIPV projects co-sponsored by UNDP and GEF) could help popularize non-conventional sources of energy in rural Malaysia, especially in Sabah and Sarawak. Further, a system of small- scale lending scheme can be established to provide loans to a non- governmental organization, which can then facilitate lending for village or small-scale projects, similar to the Long Lawen micro-hydro project in Sarawak. Deregulation of the rural energy market and extension of MESITA fund to include Sabah and Sarawak could ensure a higher degree of energy access for the lower-income groups in rural Malaysia. MEETING THE CHALLENGES Put in place innovative financing schemes targeted at women in rural areas. 24 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES Creating monitoring and evaluation indicators for energy and poverty assessments An immediate step is the appointment of a relevant organization to develop a comprehensive database on the rural electrification programme and its impact on poverty reduction. PTM \u2013 as the national energy centre \u2013 is recommended as the focal point to centralize information and develop a database that can be used to assess linkages among poverty reduction, gender and energy availability for rural areas. The community-based approach to M&E, such as in the small hydropower project in Long Lawen, Sarawak, could serve as a model for ongoing and future small-scale hydro projects in rural and remote areas. EC should distinguish between rural and urban electricity transmission and distribution. Such a move will not only aid energy and development with regard to rural electrification, but also be a definitive milestone in the area of poverty reduction, through intensified rural electrification. Proper research and documentation are principal requirements for the M&E process. PTM, the Centre for Training in Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency and local universities should collaborate to incorporate rural energy systems as subjects of research and knowledge dissemination. The Malaysian Energy Database and Information System established by PTM could be assigned projects dealing with rural energy and poverty so that data can be collected, collated and published systematically. Development of indicators for comprehensive monitoring of energy and poverty concerns should also be undertaken by PTM. Greater focus on facilitating access to energy information A range of activities can be carried out to share relevant, timely and important information on Malaysia\u2019s energy and poverty scenarios such as publication and dissemination by MRRD. Data collected through monitoring of SHSs, for instance, could be consolidated, analysed and published, with easy access to stakeholders and those interested. The impact of energy on rural enterprises, incomes and poverty reduction needs to be highlighted through documentation, workshops and publications. For instance, DoS could take on the task of managing data on energy inputs in the micro, small and medium enterprises. PTM can act as a platform for consultation and dissemination of data and information on rural energy systems through periodic workshops, training modules and seminars, and also act as a one-stop centre for all information on rural energy in Malaysia, including the impact on the communities. MEETING THE CHALLENGES Develop a comprehensive database on the rural electrification programme and its impact on poverty reduction. 25 Energy and Poverty in Malaysia THE CHALLENGES Available technologies such as the geographic information system could also be utilized to map energy and fuel sources at the village, district and regional levels. This would simplify the identification of areas and villages not earlier surveyed and facilitate effective planning and implementation. Mainstreaming gender issues The Government funds for SMEs in rural areas must mandate the use of clean energy within their loan portfolios. Such loans could be specifically directed for integrating efficient energy supply to women-owned and operated enterprises. Documentation of gender-specific impact of electricity (and other energy forms) on productivity and income gains in rural enterprises such as rice mills, weaving enterprises, batik and crafts establishments, fish processing and so on would help replicate best practices. CONCLUSION M alaysia\u2019s strong, sustained economic growth has made a positive contribution towards poverty reduction, socio- economic development and provision of basic needs, including access to energy services. Although there is no rigorous study on the direct relation between poverty and rural electrification, there is a strong inverse correlation between the two. Rural electrification has been seen to aid socio-economic welfare of the poor. It has led to improved education, health, employment, agriculture, as well as growth in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a79843cf-b5e6-4ce9-b978-8dc5d6098853": {"__data__": {"id_": "a79843cf-b5e6-4ce9-b978-8dc5d6098853", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b994bd0a7d9ce4b4dc02ff9893d9d0b12be0eecb5c9cdc900c189eb22ffcdd2"}, "3": {"node_id": "cfeba37a-8798-4daf-bd06-2a75a7c43ac2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d2f29e2c43292b9c1d967c946677b1d6d92ce951106df5dbae5248f36f09101"}}, "hash": "c563a42e6c2307f17cd2455acc8b8cc7048fae0755c79375bda803ddde608a18", "text": "rural industries, SMEs and energy-based entrepreneurial activities. Establishing an inter-agency committee on poverty and energy service provision, promoting community-based energy projects and increasing the focus on facilitating energy information have been identified as key activities.

In places where electricity grid extension is deemed impossible, the use of small-scale renewable energy technologies such as micro-hydro, PV and hybrid systems shall continue to be promoted and supported. Continuous assessment of various programmes is crucial to achieving the targeted goal of poverty reduction, especially in Sabah and Sarawak. By surpassing the targets set in the MDGs on poverty reduction, Malaysia is on the right track to fulfilling the goals within the stipulated period.

Access to affordable modern energy services can improve their productivity and enhance their living standards. Even so, there are no specific targets for the energy sector in the Millennium Declaration, a historic document signed seven years ago by the world\u2019s leaders. Affordable and sustainable modern energy services are a necessity for countries to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Efforts of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet these aims will be hindered unless adequate attention is paid to the crucial role energy services play in the development process. This is particularly true for the economic, environmental and social well-being of the poor. With fluctuating energy prices, the poor in many countries in the Asia and Pacific region face a daunting future. For them, access to affordable and essential modern energy services, which could improve their living conditions and ensure a means to earn a living, will fall outside their reach. Recognizing the urgency for countries to factor in access to modern energy services, particularly when shaping national poverty reduction initiatives, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided technical and financial support for national-level rapid energy assessments. The primary aim of this work, carried out through the UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) and completed in 2006, was to identify gaps and priority needs in linking energy services provision with poverty reduction. The framework for rapid gap assessments linking energy and poverty was developed as a joint effort of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) and UNDP country offices in the region, with the support of experts from the region. The draft framework was discussed at two sub-regional meetings, one held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005), and the other in Apia, Samoa (September 2005). The meetings were helpful in customizing the framework to suit specific needs and circumstances of the participating countries. FOREWORD v Energy and Poverty in Nepal Subsequently, the UNDP country offices held national-level stakeholder consultations to consolidate the findings and recommendations of the assessments. This work benefited immensely from the support of government officials and representatives of civil society. Documented in individual country reports, this work serves as a resource and reference material for programming and planning for access to modern energy services for the underserved, particularly, the poor. This document is a summary of the Country Report on Nepal and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the country report, summarizes the challenges faced at the national level and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to energy policy, including institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, priority programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support are highlighted. It offers a way forward, outlining issues and options for the country. Our hope is that this document will be of relevance to national policy- makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organizations and academia in implementing various measures to promote access to modern energy services for the poor.

There is a significant urban\u2013rural divide that dictates a wide range of energy access and types of energy consumed. Only 40 percent of the total population has access to electricity of one kind or another, and only 27 percent of those served are rural residents. Poor communities and households are forever linked to inefficient fuels for cooking, heating, agro-processing, lighting and other end uses. This study examines critical energy issues in Nepal, including the institutional structure of the energy sector, policy and regulatory frameworks and sectoral programmes. It analyses reasons for the narrow reach of energy services to rural provinces, dependence on traditional fuels and inefficient technologies, restricted supply of energy by rural energy enterprises and inadequate means of financing for energy. Gender concerns are also examined in rural energy projects and programmes. It highlights the urgent need for key data and indicators to support monitoring and evaluation of energy access for areas that are least served. This report concludes that the lack of a single institution that can coordinate the entire energy sector is a major constraint to the creation of a comprehensive pro-poor energy strategy. Such an institution could be established or an existing one could be strengthened to enhance and facilitate inter-agency coordination. The proposed institution could PREFACE vii Energy and Poverty in Nepal viii Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES provide a socio-economic vision and a poverty reduction road map to the entire energy sector. It could bring together fragmented energy markets; remove barriers to efficient functioning of existing and new markets; promote the exchange of information; encourage coordination; and avoid duplication of efforts among various isolated players. Promising energy initiatives can and do exist in Nepal. For instance, the Government\u2019s Renewable Energy Policy has enabled the emergence of micro-level energy enterprises such as biogas, solar and wind power. The Rural Energy Development Programme (REDP) launched in 1996 by the Government in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) successfully promotes a decentralized, public- supported and community-led rural energy model. The model offers a viable institutional option complementary to a traditional decentralized approach. The REDP model has emerged in the backdrop of Local Self Governance Act in 1999 by enabling legislation to strengthen the capacity of local government agencies to plan, administer and evaluate energy service delivery to rural areas. Furthermore, Nepal\u2019s main micro-finance institute, the Rural Microfinance Development Centre (RMDC), has been a successful financing model. It operates as a wholesale lender to rural cooperatives and to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing financial services to the poor. It has recently suggested that it will expand it financial services to include the provision of energy services for the poor. The REDP has developed a success model of integrated rural energy programmes and has served as a foundation of national energy policy. Nonetheless, coordination and decentralization of the energy sector and access to finance have been major stumbling blocks in expanding the model. The country urgently needs integration of a strong energy component in the larger rural development programmes that respond to local requirements. By increasing the reach of the REDP\u2019s model, the National Planning Commission could work more collaboratively with the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) to advocate decentralization of energy access. To enhance access to finance at all levels, policy advocacy and restructuring of national financial mechanisms could be addressed. This could include encouraging improved credit mechanisms that would move away from subsidies and grants that provide only one-time financing of renewable energy technologies.

N epal\u2019s strategic location at the foothills of the Himalayas has numerous benefits, as also predicaments. While the country is well-endowed with natural resources, its tough terrain makes equal distribution of resources difficult. As a result, the incidence of poverty is high in Nepal. One-third of Nepal\u2019s population (CBS/MoPE 2003) lives on less than US $1 a day (CBS 2004)\u2014most of them are in its villages, home to 86 percent of the country\u2019s population (CBS 2003). The Nepal Human Development Report 2004 reveals that the human development index (HDI) in urban areas (0.581), is considerably higher than in rural areas (0.452).

More than 87 percent of the total energy consumed in Nepal comes from traditional sources such as fuelwood, agricultural residues and cattle dung. Much of this consumption is in rural areas, where traditional energy is easily accessible and modern energy is scarce. Conversely, commercial sources of energy, such as coal, petroleum and electricity, comprise only about 12 percent of total energy consumed, much of which is restricted to urban areas (MoF 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21d3ccc4-f6d3-4d8c-9cf2-2e194922f11a": {"__data__": {"id_": "21d3ccc4-f6d3-4d8c-9cf2-2e194922f11a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Nepal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f73dd29c07b8c18d359017dc1bafb9498d572db33526e41104489df1660c7258"}, "2": {"node_id": "81ccd83a-fd43-4551-a3b1-ca1a4fad443a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf36ff7e7a2ae885da2bb7c68906517caec7ae362019aeab436adf557c0aebbe"}}, "hash": "fcf85625c6af8c502295e26680d96c36eba64756a0ea7235e8ef7116c739e29e", "text": "Electricity is available to only 40 percent of the country\u2019s population (CBS 2001), while urban residents \u2013 comprising only 15 percent of the total population \u2013 receive 73 percent of this supply. Despite a number of completed and ongoing energy programmes in the country, the linkage between energy and poverty is still found to be weak. The expertise, interest and vision of supply-side actors, including donors and the national government, are responsible for such results. Extending efficient, affordable and modern energy services to Nepal\u2019s rural poor is crucial for the country\u2019s battle against poverty. There have been several national-level statements of intent on expanding the role of energy services for poverty reduction, such as the one by the National Planning Commission (NPC 2002). However, Nepal\u2019s energy sector faces many structural and technical challenges to effectively convert intent into action. An assessment of the country\u2019s energy sector enables an understanding of the specific challenges, which prevent the formulation of visible, well-coordinated and effective initiatives to address poverty through the use of modern energy services. Vertically aligned institutional structure THE CHALLENGES I nstitutional arrangements in Nepal\u2019s energy sector are vertically arranged according to sub-sectors, such as electricity, petroleum and coal, forest and renewable energy.

Instead, the primary focus of most institutional mandates remains confined to generation and distribution of electricity. Poverty reduction is largely an appendage to these focus areas. At the local level, the decentralized, public-supported and community- led institutional model promoted by REDP has proven successful and offers a viable institutional option that can complement the existing centralized approach (Table 1).

Offers subsidies under the Renewable Energy Subsidy Policy to promote renewable energy use in rural and remote areas, and partly funds research on renewable energy technologies (RETs). Activities funded by AEPC are associated with the RETs that serve off-grid areas. Launched the Rural Energy Development Programme (REDP), in association with the Government of Nepal, to facilitate rural income generation and poverty reduction through the development of modern energy sources and services for domestic and productive use; REDP has been upscaled with resources from the World Bank through AEPC; the programme also covers off-grid areas. Play important roles in the implementation of programmes such as REDP, and are key stakeholders in energy and poverty programmes for rural Nepal. CBOs are the main mobilizers of financial resources, the labour for rural energy projects, as well as managers. They also participate in the planning of various renewable energy projects. 4 Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES do not have wide fiscal or executive powers, and rely on government institutions for policy guidance, regulatory frameworks, and financial support. Disagreements and disputes over policies, responsibilities, and power-sharing modalities plague central\u2013local institutional arrangements. As a result, the effectiveness of local forms of government in the energy sector has been limited only to a few donor-funded programmes such as REDP. An evolving programme framework for energy service delivery to the poor Energy sector programmes in Nepal have mainly been initiated by many actors: Government, international agencies and NGOs (Table 2). While most programmes seek to expand generation and transmission capabilities, some have focused on the larger issues of poverty reduction and gender equity through the provision of modern energy services. REDP is one such example that emerged in the backdrop of Local Self Governance Act in 1999. REDP took advantage of this enabling legislation to strengthen the capacity of local government bodies to plan, administer and evaluate energy service delivery to rural areas. BOX 1 KEY CHALLENGES RELATED TO INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS P In the absence of a central organization that guides the entire energy sector towards common poverty reduction objectives, institutions have been unable to look beyond sub-sectoral interests. For instance, they are not aware of each other\u2019s mandates and thus plan in isolation. Such planning has not resulted in resource optimization. P There is duplication of efforts resulting from a lack of coordination among various institutions. For instance, in some areas, the extension of the national grid has made functioning of micro-hydro plants redundant and thus resulted in the loss of national productive assets. P Lack of settlement of power-sharing disputes between local- and national-level institutions has hampered effective local\u2013national institutional partnerships.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a233413d-3b6c-45ae-a5a5-5eb2fe3ddb97": {"__data__": {"id_": "a233413d-3b6c-45ae-a5a5-5eb2fe3ddb97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Nepal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5ae86df10e549b271d2e75db0269c80abd2063a7a527a7e639289832122e4bd"}, "2": {"node_id": "4806e54b-52b7-4a6e-9926-9df958afd746", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff70c1d1fdcfcc246c2134c10f7195cc3091a6987cdafcbe83b0be0d6bde7667"}}, "hash": "ecb74c4e0178e0cfa0164a5c388056f219c2eaf8ae6bab15433ad9f7ca0da594", "text": "The Central Government\u2019s scepticism regarding the capacity of local bodies in exercising their delegated authority has inhibited the spirit of decentralization and put brakes on local rural energy development initiatives. 5 Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES TABLE 2 MAJOR ENERGY PROGRAMMES IN NEPAL WITH LINKAGES TO POVERTY REDUCTION Programmes Rural Electrification Programme (REP) REDP Improved Water Mill Programme", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4067d67d-1199-4990-ad8a-b5c70e37898a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4067d67d-1199-4990-ad8a-b5c70e37898a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Nepal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97e41bfb1ecb559dab4f202659098744c7c7e361b8fbeafebd041579e9aa435d"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5ad5bcc-8d3c-4f32-89fa-4f76d9d3c1b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea304560ff4943ddb90dc6eba703837b13018d7d242bc3ce0dba4ab04c9f1595"}}, "hash": "df5502dcbb9952d24a9b9fa8a554d5f2dda345f434ba7bba4f886cb8e13218da", "text": "(IWMP) Smoke and Health Project Implementing/ partnering agency/ agencies NEA with the support of Danish International Development Assistance and the Asian Development Bank AEPC with the support of UNDP (initially) and World Bank in the second phase to upscale the successes CRT Nepal supported by The Netherlands Development Organization (SNV)1 Practical Action Nepal Poverty linkages By inviting community participation in distributing grid electricity, REP hopes to encourage grass-roots energy entrepreneurship for income generation, and to thereby ease livelihood concerns in rural areas.

The Association of District Development Committee Nepal has been lobbying with the Government of Nepal for the Committee\u2019s rights to take decisions on energy projects within its jurisdiction, since 1991. P Unequal distribution of funds and indifferent central agencies have widened the gap in roles of central and local agencies during programme implementation. P The success and the lessons from REDP are not being adopted and upscaled at a desired pace. P Rural energy needs for cooking and heating are largely ignored. There is no promotional focus on available cooking energy technologies, including gasifiers, bio-briquettes and solar cooking. Constrained access to modern energy services in rural Nepal Only 46 percent of Nepal households receive some form of modern energy service, and about 43 percent of these households receive grid electricity. By August 2005, of the 613.5 MW (megawatts) electricity produced in the country, grid-connected hydropower generated 550.6 MW (NEA 2005). However, access to electricity varies from region to region, with poorer regions having lower access (Table 3). The rural poor and remote areas are straddled with constraints of high tariffs and technical complexities in power transmission, and consequently are tied to inefficient fuels for meeting their energy needs.

Low purchasing power and high cost are major challenges to providing modern energy services. Households consume most of the energy generated in rural areas, leaving rural industries under-serviced by modern energy. For instance, only four percent of micro-hydropower-generated energy is used for productive end uses (WELink/Neha 2003). Dominance of traditional fuels and inefficient technologies The nature of energy use, coupled with the non-availability of modern energy services, makes traditional sources of energy (fuelwood and animal manure) the primary fuel options in rural households. The energy consumption in rural Nepal is dominated by cooking (63.9 percent), livestock feed preparation (16.5 percent), heating (8.5 percent), water boiling (2 percent), agroprocessing (3.4 percent), lighting (1.3 percent) and other end uses (4.3 percent) (UNDP 2005). Most of the energy needs pertaining to agriculture are met by human and animal power. It is only the small commercial agricultural sector that relies on diesel for operating pumps and tractors. Consequently, the share of electricity in agricultural energy consumption is only one percent (WECS 1998). The energy profile of Nepal\u2019s rural industry is better in the context of modern energy services; but even here, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro-enterprises rely primarily on kerosene, diesel and coal for their energy needs. These energy sources are largely used for 8 Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES operating inefficient technologies and together account for 77 percent of total energy consumption in rural industries (Figure 1). A major limiting factor for energy diversification in Nepal is the relatively high cost of alternative energy technology. Due to lack of funds, the state has limited capacity to support energy diversification. Moreover, energy programmes engaging the rural poor lack training on emerging sources of energy. Rural entrepreneurs are not exposed to information about the effectiveness of alternative energy technologies in other rural settings. BOX 4 KEY CHALLENGES TO PROVIDING AFFORDABLE ENERGY SOLUTIONS P High costs of alternative energy along with high electricity tariffs make switching from diesel and other hydrocarbon-fuelled equipment difficult. P Efforts to reduce petroleum imports are rarely discussed at the policy level. P Imported energy raises the cost of energy, rendering it out of reach of most rural households. FIGURE 1 ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE RURAL INDUSTRIES (1997) Source WECS (1998) Capacity and policy neglect of rural entrepreneurial potential Aided by international funding and Government subsidies, modern energy services have played a significant role to help develop SMEs in 9 Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES Nepal. Existing frameworks, particularly the Government\u2019s Renewable Energy Subsidy Policy, have also enabled the emergence of small renewable energy enterprises devoted to developing energy sources such as biogas, solar and wind power. For example, in the renewable energy sector, there were 29 turbine manufacturers/installers in the micro-hydro sector by mid-July 2005 (AEPC/ESAP 2005) and 28 private solar photovoltaic companies by end 2004 (Nepal 2006). Even the grid-electricity sector has seen entrepreneurial activity with the promotion of community-based electrification. Small rural enterprises are considered as avenues of steady income generation and equitable distribution in rural communities. However, rural enterprises face a shortage of energy services. Poor regions of the country, such as the mountainous region, barely have enough energy generation capacity to meet domestic demand and, consequently, the need for energy for productive uses is sidelined. As a result, most SMEs and productive enterprises are dependent on inefficient modes of energy production and utilization and are, therefore, unable to gain competitive parity with large urban industries. Most SMEs are dependent on inefficient modes of energy production. BOX 5 KEY CHALLENGES TO BUILDING ENERGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP P Rural enterprises are neglected at the policy level.

Women are responsible for household production systems such as food processing, cleaning and storing of farm products, kitchen gardening and cooking food for village shops run by male family members.

The existing energy consumption pattern results in high levels of drudgery for women and their vulnerability to several diseases. Moreover, socially prescribed roles limit women\u2019s access to economic resources such as land, capital, skills and know-how. All these have an impact on the energy options available to women. Yet, gender issues and concerns have not been fully integrated in the energy policies and programmes. Many challenges to improving gender equality remain. Despite the increase in the number of women in the paid workforce, gender disparities continue, and the gap in wage rates between men and women is significant. Constrained access to finance Due to the heavy financing cost of operationalizing a modern energy project, Nepal\u2019s energy projects are supported by financial incentives in the form of subsidies, grants, equity or loans. Funds for energy projects come from the Government, donors, microfinance institutions (MFIs), investors and banks. However, the flow of traditional bilateral and multilateral funds is not sustainable or predictable. Moreover, the growth of Nepal\u2019s energy sector may be constrained due to shortage of funds if trade- and efficiency-related global funds remain untapped. The Government of Nepal has a centralized financing system in which all resources are largely controlled and managed by the Government agencies. However, REDP was successful to some extent in operationalizing the concept of community financing. Here, the participating households reach an agreement for collected fees to be deposited in the Community Energy Fund (CEF) managed by the Micro Hydro Functional Group (MHFG) along with the Rural Energy Development Section under the DDC (DDC-REDS) of each district as co- signatory. The fund is used for the administration and management of projects and also acts as a savings scheme. The fund can be used to extend loans for other purposes to initiate income generation and bolster other development activities of the households. CBOs will fix the repayment and interest schedules. Thus, the programme focuses on The existing energy consumption pattern results in high levels of drudgery for women. 11 Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES demonstrating the efficacy of decentralized management of financial resources by passing ownership directly to local institutions. Even though REDP has demonstrated the efficacy of local-level management of financial resources, it has not been able to institutionalize the process of decentralized financing. Moreover, opinion is divided in Nepal over the issue of decentralized funding for energy projects. Those opposed to decentralization worry about local capacities to fairly and effectively distribute funds. On the other hand, proponents of decentralization claim that localizing funding mechanisms leads to better energy projects and ensures genuine commitment to projects, since fund seekers are familiar with local funding institutions, and vice-versa. A middle path proposed by some experts suggests functions of project screening, post-implementation monitoring and supervision, and project operation be retained under local government bodies while the Central Government bodies be made responsible for the final selection of projects. While the Government funds energy projects primarily through NEA, subsidies (usually offered through nationalized banks) for renewable energy have totalled over US $60 million since 1997. The performance of financial institutions in financing micro-hydro projects in Nepal is given in Table 4. Renewable energy operations are not successful due to non- availability of funds in rural areas. BOX 6 KEY CHALLENGES RELATED TO ACCESS TO FINANCE P Finance seekers have developed excessive dependence on grants and subsidies as opposed to credit. P Commercial banks, though mandated by the Government to extend services to rural areas, have generally restricted operations to district headquarters. P Financial institutions are found generally not interested in renewable projects because they are less informed. The perception is that renewable energy projects are not financially viable, and their administrative costs are higher and repayment rates are poor. P National-level MFIs require special funds for mobilization costs for disbursing credit for renewable energy, as they do not prefer to disburse their own funds, and require operational costs for their services. P Local-level MFIs provide small amounts of credit at high rates of interest (20\u201325 percent) for loans associated with income generation activities, and renewable energy is not seen as an income-generating project. 12 Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES Table 4 reveals that apart from the Agriculture Development Bank of Nepal (a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98ca1c82-7e62-4ca9-bce6-8ffd1d27fa79": {"__data__": {"id_": "98ca1c82-7e62-4ca9-bce6-8ffd1d27fa79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Nepal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2eec5f62825b95b5ecf49b26d1b7bcad37bb44698c081c493518426fef43a71f"}, "3": {"node_id": "398140b1-f61a-418b-9967-f51f184466f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-nepal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53ee3f341948cbcdb0607d2cd66c62980599672c4c7b38c147f1b5232fdae8b4"}}, "hash": "2d293211acd98e4c79a6a4dc3abcb484e975ee86775e031a6dcf2c9bd884b58f", "text": "semi-government finance institution), commercial banks and private entrepreneurs have been hesitant investors in rural energy development, partially due to lack of financially viable examples among rural energy projects.

More pertinent for the poor is microfinance, which plays an important role in developing low- cost, cleaner energy sources in Nepal. So far, about 150 MFIs have provided loans for biogas and solar home systems (SHSs). Nepal\u2019s apex MFI, the Rural Microfinance Development Centre (RMDC), has been a successful financing model. It operates as a wholesale lender to rural cooperatives and to NGOs providing financial services to the poor. In a recent development that promises to expand modern energy access to the poor, the maximum sum of microfinance loans has been increased from NPR 30,000 (about US $450) to NPR 50,000 (about US $750) by the Nepal Rastra Bank (Central Bank of Nepal), encouraging the development of small renewable energy projects in rural areas. However, despite the increase, the loans are still small and, hence, microfinance is suited only for household-level credit, and not for electricity generation or small hydropower development.

The National Planning Commission (NPC), guided by the Tenth Plan recommendations, devised M&E indicators, tools and systems in 2004 (NPC 2004). Figure 2 depicts the institutional structure of the monitoring system under NPC. More indicators are being developed to monitor and evaluate the poverty reduction impact of (renewable) energy services by organizations such as the Department for International Development, UK, and AEPC/Energy Sector Assistance Programme (ESAP). Table 5 lists a few energy-related M&E processes. The participation of multilateral and bilateral institutions has infused a certain degree of M&E capacities in Nepal\u2019s energy sector, albeit most of these capacities have not been fully institutionalized by national organizations. While the presence of M&E indicators augurs well for the success of energy projects in Nepal, these have focused on quantitative targets rather than socio-economic impacts or even assessments of the productive use of energy. From the perspective of poverty reduction, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for Nepal has emphasized on expanding M&E procedures from the development of a project to include the impacts of the project FIGURE 2 INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE MONITORING SYSTEM AS PER THE TENTH PLAN Source NPC (2002) 14 Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES on poverty reduction.

P Crucial indicators for energy and poverty are missing, and sectoral and sub-sectoral monitoring tools are not comprehensive enough. P Feedback received through the monitoring and evaluation process is often not integrated into decision-making processes. patterns. It is also noticed that the development role of energy is still narrowly defined by policy-makers. Inadequate dissemination of energy-related information Although institutions such as AEPC and BSP Nepal have good information management systems that are shared with academics and students, the overall information-sharing modalities in Nepal\u2019s energy sector are weak. The knowledge management structures do not generate enough information, and what information is generated is prone to duplication. Citizens, especially those without access to television, Internet or radio, have fragmented and incomplete information about energy. Awareness generation on energy issues is primarily undertaken through mass media platforms, community forums and NGO campaigns. However, these are uncoordinated and isolated individual efforts. Without sufficient dissemination of information on renewable energy or energy efficiency, popular understanding of energy is restricted to electricity. Information on types of alternative energy sources and associated technologies and their costs and benefits is inaccessible, especially in rural areas. It is also difficult to access the limited information, particularly the one generated by the Government institutions. Although the Right to Information, as provided in the Constitution of Nepal, gives every citizen access to all non-classified Government information, it has not been translated into effective structures and procedures that enable easier access to information. Lack of access to information is a problem perceived widely across all sectors of Nepal. Citizens\u2019 capacity to access and comprehend energy data is hampered by the unavailability of a single source of information, as also by the language and terminology used. Understanding of renewable energy and energy efficiency is poor because of lack of proper information- sharing methods. 16 Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES Creating an apex institution R EDP has developed a workable model of a rural energy programme. It has demonstrated that coordination at all levels, decentralized delivery and management and avoiding duplication of efforts are some of the key features for ensuring effective energy service delivery. Some of the main lessons that emerge from the programme are indicated here. A workable model of rural energy service delivery needs to incorporate a decentralized participatory approach that transfers the mandate of delivery to local governance structures. In such a situation, national-level institutions need to be strengthened to support local institutions. The community-based model ensures incorporation of local concerns, facilitates enhancement of livelihood opportunities and minimizes inefficiency of the Government-administered programmes. To overcome the issue of multiplicity of organizations involved in energy service delivery, it is desirable to set up forums working across institutions to develop and strengthen linkages and facilitate inter- agency coordination. To operationalize and streamline institutional arrangements, it is also necessary to develop guidelines within the existing purview of the national legal framework. In this context, setting up of a national-level institution that can provide a socio-economic vision and a poverty reduction road map to the entire energy sector will help. Energy-related inter-ministerial meetings under the leadership of NPC may be a starting point that could lead to the establishment of such a national-level institution. Among its duties, the proposed apex institution will need to devise appropriate legal and practical policies to further the role of energy in human development. However, implementation will have to be decentralized, consistent with the Local Self-Governance Act (1999). As the lead coordinator on issues related to energy and poverty, the proposed institution must also harness institutional capacities for poverty reduction. For instance, AEPC should be enabled to take the lead in devising strategies and action to make renewable energy an important tool for poverty reduction. Integrating and decentralizing the programme framework for energy and poverty Nepal urgently requires integration of a strong energy component into the larger rural developmental programme framework that identifies and evaluates rural energy needs and provides energy services suited to local requirements. In this context, rural development programmes must MEETING THE CHALLENGES MEETING THE CHALLENGES 17 Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES inform and consult local governments.

MLD, with the help of NPC, should also advocate decentralization by lobbying with the Government for facilitating an enabling environment for self-governance. Such decentralization would enable local institutions to address existing gaps in rural energy provision, such as unaddressed rural energy needs for cooking and lighting, as well as provide a sustainable platform for regular feedback. Renewable energy solutions to bridge the energy access divide To increase productive use of energy and reduce poverty in rural Nepal, the potential of renewable energy sources must be exploited to locally generate and distribute affordable power. AEPC, under Ministry of Environment, Science, and Technology (MoEST), should take the initiative to prepare policies and guidelines to rapidly and cost-effectively facilitate access to energy to deprived communities in remote areas. While doing so, NEA\u2019s rural electrification programme should also be part of the process. Research and tariff rationalization for cleaner energy technology At the policy level, efforts need to be made to reduce imports of petroleum products and promote adoption of cleaner, cheaper and more efficient energy sources. NPC, along with the Ministry of Finance (MoF), can prepare a plan for phasing out petroleum products from households and then from the industry and transport sectors. In the rural context, efforts to reduce the use of fuelwood in cooking are more crucial. Additional funds should be allocated to research institutes, such as the National Academy of Science and Technology (NAST), the Research Centre for Applied Science and Technology (RECAST), the Centre for Energy Studies (CES) and the Institute of Engineering (IoE), to conduct research on reducing the price of appropriate technologies. Capacity enhancement on new technologies, such as gasification, bio-briquettes and bio-distillation, should also be undertaken with international assistance. To encourage modern energy use by rural SMEs, NEA has yet to finalize the variable tariff plan. The tariff under this plan should offer the Government a means to encourage SMEs to switch to clean fuels. Strong energy component in rural development programmes is required. MEETING THE CHALLENGES 18 Energy and Poverty in Nepal THE CHALLENGES Promoting rural entrepreneurship REDP has shown a way for promoting energy entrepreneurship in Nepal by supporting micro-hydro, solar and biogas as entry points for the development of rural energy systems to reduce income inequalities and improve rural livelihoods. The programme focuses on integrated and decentralized management of energy services with emphasis on CBOs or private entrepreneurs to manage rural energy development. At the community level, the CBOs \u2013 like the MHFG \u2013 encourage their members to explore potential end uses appropriate to available skills and resources. Thus, the focus has been on promoting diversified end-use enterprises, including agro-processing mills such as rice hullers, grinders and oil expellers. To take forward the benefits of REDP, the Government will need to consider a support package for rural-energy-based entrepreneurs, encompassing capacity building, information sharing and R&D. For this purpose, coordinated efforts of the Small and Cottage Industries Department (SCID), the Industrial Enterprise Development Institute (IEDI), the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) and commercial institutions and MFIs are recommended. The support package for energy SMEs could include the following elements. P Promotion of information management and dissemination. P Creation of a platform for sharing international knowledge and experience through the UNDP, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and bilateral agreements to provide quality training to rural entrepreneurs. P Effective coordination between programmes related to SMEs and national-level training organizations. P Promotion of the Government\u2013SME partnerships that enhance the development impacts of energy projects. Mainstreaming gender issues for meeting concerns of energy and poverty To incorporate gender concerns in energy service delivery for poverty reduction, it is desirable to assess the gender impacts of major energy programmes including the UNDP-initiated REDP, the SNV-supported IWM Programme, being implemented by CRT and BSP. The aim of such assessments and impact analyses should be to develop best practices and guidelines on mainstreaming gender issues into energy programmes. For addressing drudgery-related aspects of existing energy consumption methods, it would be necessary to upscale the national biogas and ICS programmes.

To attract global funds, necessary amendments should be made to policy documents, and relevant ministerial board or steering committee meetings should seriously discuss strategies to tap available international funds. At the national level, moving away from subsidies and grants to finance RETs and pushing the credit mechanism is a viable option to build greater financial strength for rural energy development. Subsidies on SHSs and biogas plants in accessible regions of the country could also be reduced, while simultaneously setting up more stable sources of funds to develop renewable energy, through taxing petroleum products and instituting hydropower royalties. At the local level, fiscal and monetary incentives should be provided to push MFIs into remote and rural and areas. The Nepal Rastra Bank (Central Bank of Nepal) should review the developmental role of commercial banks, MFIs and other dedicated banks, and take necessary measures to enhance this role. The difference between current lending and borrowing rates is significant. This will need to be narrowed with monetary policy intervention. Further, the repayment modality needs should be modified in favour of poor borrowers by matching the repayment time with the income-earning time of the borrowers. Finally, to attract investments in rural energy, NEA and AEPC need to aggressively advocate the viability of rural energy projects for financial institutions. Building a monitoring and evaluation system for energy and poverty Monitoring the parameters that link energy and poverty in Nepal will require sustained efforts from various quarters.

Ensuring the reliability of information and mandating the use of information in decision-making and further planning are equally important. Baseline data of energy programmes need to be generated based on certain mandatory guidelines. Impact evaluation studies need to be comprehensive and should generate data on key indicators that link energy and poverty. NPC can issue orders through concerned ministries for generating such information. Empowering the information provider and the information seeker Nepal\u2019s energy sector requires a unified, easy-to-access source of information that will cater to all information needs. A single-window information system needs to be established at central and district levels. In the interim, AEPC and the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS) can serve as information centres (with shared responsibilities) at the central level, while DDC does the same at the district level. Additionally, awareness and empowerment of both information providers and information seekers are imperative. Training must be provided to middle- and top-level management cadres on the process of evidence-based decision-making and to user groups on how to access information. Using existing development networks with extensive outreach in the areas of primary stakeholders can expedite the information acquisition process. Civil groups need to be supported by multilateral and bilateral agencies in ensuring proper implementation of the constitutional right to information.

Access to affordable modern energy services can improve their productivity and enhance living standards. Even so, there are no specific targets for the energy sector in the Millennium Declaration, a historic document signed seven years ago by the world\u2019s leaders. Affordable and sustainable modern energy services are a necessity for countries to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Efforts of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet these aims will be hindered unless adequate attention is given to the crucial role energy services play in the development process. This is particularly true for the economic, environmental and social well-being of the poor. With fluctuating energy prices, the poor in many of the countries in the Asia and Pacific region face a daunting future. For them, access to affordable and essential modern energy services that could improve their living conditions and ensure a means to earn a living will fall outside their reach. Recognizing the urgency for countries to factor in access to modern energy services, particularly when shaping national poverty reduction initiatives, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided technical and financial support for national-level rapid energy assessments. The primary aim of this work, carried out through UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) and completed in 2006, was to identify gaps and priority needs in linking energy services provision with poverty reduction. The framework for rapid gap assessments linking energy and poverty was developed as a joint effort of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) and UNDP country offices in the region, with the support of experts from the region. The draft framework was discussed at two sub-regional meetings, one held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005) and the other in Apia, Samoa (September 2005). The meetings were helpful in customizing the framework to suit specific needs and circumstances of the participating countries. Subsequently, UNDP country offices held national-level stakeholder consultations to consolidate the findings and recommendations of the assessments. This work benefited immensely from the support of government Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka vi officials and representatives of civil society. Documented in individual country reports, this work serves as resource and reference material for programming and planning for access to modern energy services for the underserved, particularly, the poor. This document is a summary of the Country Report on Sri Lanka and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the Country Report, summarizes the challenges faced at the national level, and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to energy policy, including institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, priority programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support are highlighted. It offers a way forward, outlining issues and options for the country. Our hope is that this document will be of relevance to national policy makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organizations and academia in implementing various measures to promote access to modern energy services for the poor.

The report also offers options for the country to overcome its energy sector challenges. This study is valid in the context of Sri Lanka, where the income gap is widening between the rich and the poor, and the country is heavily dependent on energy imports, especially in the electricity and transport sectors. Biomass is an important source of energy in Sri Lanka, particularly for the rural poor. About 90 percent of energy for cooking in the rural areas comes from biomass sources, the remaining 10 percent from kerosene and LPG. In Sri Lanka, nearly 80 percent of the biomass comes from non-forest resources, namely agricultural and plantation work. Seventy percent of the biomass is collected free from home gardens and plantations, and 30 percent is purchased, mainly in urban areas. Electricity and modern fuels are burdensome on poor households due to affordability, quality of services and supply constraints. This study examines critical energy issues in Sri Lanka related to the institutional structure of the energy sector, policy and regulatory framework, and sectoral programmes. It analyses reasons for the limited reach of energy services to rural provinces; unsustainable dependence on traditional fuels and inefficient technologies; the restricted supply of energy by rural energy enterprises; and inadequate financing for energy. Gender concerns are also examined in rural energy projects and programmes. It highlights the urgent need for key data and indicators to support monitoring and evaluation of energy access for areas that are least served. This report concludes that while strong institutional arrangements and policy focus on electrification enhance conditions of rural households and industries, the exclusion of traditional biomass from considerations limits the creation of a comprehensive pro-poor energy strategy in Sri Lanka. Improved capacities of government entities, especially at the provincial Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka viii level, could enhance rural energy development, thus promoting the provision of energy access for the poor. A comprehensive regulatory framework that includes all significant energy sources needs to be developed, including the renewable energy sector. Renewable energy projects are mainly driven by external agencies, yet there should be more focus on renewable energy technologies (RETs) that can be handled from within. Several NGOs are active in developing these types of RETs that are suitable to local conditions. Promising energy initiatives can and do exist in Sri Lanka. For instance, the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development (RERED) and the Energy Service Delivery (ESD) projects, financed by the Global Environment Facility and the World Bank, have enhanced the adoption of renewable energy technologies for electricity generation since 1997. The RERED and ESD project components have resulted in improvements in local capacities, for example in design, implementation and operation stages of village level projects. In addition, the Government is helping the poor to establish a livelihood through dendro power initiatives. These initiatives have potential in ensuring active participation of the community, building local capacities and the technology base that could support poverty alleviation activities. The policy focus of the National Energy Policy and Strategies (NEPS) of Sri Lanka 2006 to expand the delivery of affordable energy services to a larger share of the population, to improve energy sector planning, management and regulation, and to revitalize biomass as a significant resource of commercial is highly commendable. The establishment of Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA), officially launched in October 2007, is also an important step undertaken by the Government toward a strengthened framework for the energy sector, particularly for renewable energy development, demand-side energy efficiency improvement and energy conservation. Capacity-building for institutional and technical capacities within SEA is also planned with the help of the Asian Development Bank. The Government\u2019s plan to expand the share of grid-electrified households to 85 percent and off-grid electrified households to 8 percent, and the share of renewable energy in total energy generation to 10 percent by 2015, as stated in NEPS 2006, is yet another very positive step. These government-supported targets must be complemented, however, with additional strong efforts towards implementation and the goal of improved energy access for poverty reduction to correct socio-economic imbalances. Equally important is providing poor households with access to alternative sources of affordable modern fuels and efficient energy ix Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka technology. Well targeted pro-poor subsidies and cost-efficient tariffs are therefore imperative. Such policies can have a major impact on the capital costs for rural grid electrification and the development of off-grid solutions. These must be complemented by strengthened and improved schemes for the provision of energy related microfinance for micro-scale enterprises and different income-generating activities.

In addition, the gap between the rich and the poor appears to be widening in the country. The income of the poorest 20 percent of the population has grown only by 5.7 percent while that of the richest 20 percent has grown by 140 percent.

The energy needs of the rural sector are met through means such as animal power, wood and agro- waste for heat generation; electricity for lighting and high-end uses such as television, radio and other electrical appliances; and fossil fuels for transportation. Currently, 90 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s export earnings of all agricultural products are expended on imports of petroleum products, a statistic that is both uncomfortable and unaffordable in the current energy-poverty scenario of the country.

The steadily rising prices of conventional energy and the 100 percent import of fossil fuel based energy place the weaker sections of Sri Lanka in a difficult situation. There have been some improvements in terms of the institutional, legal, regulatory and financial mechanisms to electrify rural areas. In off-grid areas, the World Bank-funded Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development (RERED) project and budgetary grant of SLR 10,000 per household by the Central Government changed the situation to a large extent. However, much more needs to be done. Some of the future tasks are already stated in the National Energy Policy and Strategies (NEPS) of Sri Lanka 2006. Institutional arrangements he primary electricity handling institution in Sri Lanka is the national Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The CEB possesses 85 percent of the generating capacity and distributes electricity to about 2.5 million customers. The fully publicly-owned Lanka Electricity Company (LECO) not only distributes electricity to about 350,000 consumers in the western and southern coastal belts, but also owns the low-voltage distribution network in its territory. Petroleum supplies are mainly handled by the government-controlled Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO). The CEYPETCO is supplemented by the Lanka Indian Oil Corporation (LIOC), the first company to enter into the local petroleum market in early 2003 to supply petrol and diesel to the Sri Lankan consumers. All these utilities are overseen by the Ministry of Power and Energy (MoPE). Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is mainly handled by several private sector companies, including Shell Gas Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd and 3 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES Gas Auto Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. A regulatory structure for all physical infrastructure industries, such as electricity and petroleum, in the form of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is already in place. Ministries dealing with energy issues exist at the provincial level, but they have limited long-term perspective and the mandate to think or work beyond rural electrification. The Ministry of Samurdhi and Poverty Alleviation and the Ministry of Rural Industries are handling poverty and rural industries but rural energy needs are not included in their main activities. The Ministries of Power and Energy (MoPEs) in the Provincial Councils are mainly concerned with rural electrification as far as poverty and energy issues are concerned. Therefore, even at the decentralized levels, the institutional arrangements mainly concentrate on electricity and fossil fuel supply, although nearly half of the energy requirement of the rural people is met by biomass. There is no specific institution designated to focus on traditional biomass since it is considered as part of the informal sector. Nor does the relatively important animal power used in transport and draft work come under the present institutional structure that is handling energy. In addition, many rural activities require thermal energy either for heating, dehydration, or cooling of produce; therefore, having only electricity-focused institutional arrangements limits coordinated action in meeting the demand efficiently. The use of energy in the form of thermal energy in rural economic activities such as in brick kilns, bakeries and other small-scale manufacturing is handled mainly by non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs). The institutional arrangement looking at alternative energy for rural activities is the former Energy Conservation Fund (ECF), which again places significant emphasis on electricity. Institutional responsibilities attributed to ECF were transferred to the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA) that was officially launched in October 2007. SEA is mandated to develop and implement policies for renewable energy development, demand-side energy efficiency improvement and energy conservation. Alternative energy research and development (R&D) has been entrusted to the Alternative Energy Division (AED) of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST), the National Engineering Research and Development (NERD) Centre, and other institutions. Figure 1 presents the main energy sector institutions in Sri Lanka. Even at the decentralized levels, the institutional arrangements mainly concentrate on electricity and fossil fuel supply. 4 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES FIGURE 1 ENERGY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS IN SRI LANKA Policy and regulatory framework Since the late 1970s, successive governments in Sri Lanka have been consistently following the principles of an open economy, with the GDP growing at 4 to 6 percent during this period. Over the years, the Government development policy frameworks have promoted both endogenous and external input based development, yet poverty reduction through rural energy services has not been often clearly stated in development strategies and plans. \u25a0 The institutional arrangement benefits mainly electricity- and fossil fuel-based energy development, also in the rural context. \u25a0 Provincial energy ministries have limited influence on rural energy planning, although they are in better position to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "877e7804-df62-4c93-a76a-3e2b6e38b59b": {"__data__": {"id_": "877e7804-df62-4c93-a76a-3e2b6e38b59b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9697b00b169ba58f8e1ab5e8091fc22788cd92b43c5084ee8cdfe58619cfebd"}}, "hash": "b9697b00b169ba58f8e1ab5e8091fc22788cd92b43c5084ee8cdfe58619cfebd", "text": "assess the needs. \u25a0 There is only limited institutional focus on biomass, other traditional forms of energy and rural thermal energy applications. \u25a0 Limited coordination and capacities across sectors and stakeholders in developing national economic plans and integrating energy into development plans. BOX 1: KEY INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES 5 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES The key pillars of the medium-term macroeconomic framework announced in 2004 include enhancing the effectiveness of private financial management, increasing the technology base and making it a catalyst for economic growth, and reducing poverty through rural sector development and employment creation. This framework places emphasis on local resources and provincial infrastructure, which is conducive to poverty reduction and increased supply of energy in the country. The National Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, announced by the Government in 2005, recognizes the informal \u2018third sector\u2019 that is independent of conventional private and public sectors, and more importantly, its worth in contributing to the national growth. For example, the domestic energy supply and domestic work done by women related to energy supply fall under this third sector. This is a positive statement as far as energy and poverty are concerned. Yet the energy policy emphasis persists in the development and provision of electrical energy. The common assumption is that the supply of electricity would alleviate poverty in the rural areas, although many of the rural activities require thermal energy either for heating, dehydration or cooling of produce. Furthermore, the cost of electricity may not be affordable to the poor. Although the electricity sector regularly carries out elaborate planning about future generation needs, these plans are not implemented as expected for a variety of reasons, such as environmental permits, security situation and project financing. Short- and medium-term proposals outside the long-term generation plans, to meet the changed needs, are often outside the \u2018optimum\u2019 energy mix envisaged in the long-term plans. Power shortages are met, for example, by generating power from auto-diesel which is among the most expensive ways of generating power. Hence, the implementation of these plans has resulted in the cost of electricity rising well above the anticipated values. According to the Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan: 2003-2017, prepared by the CEB, Sri Lanka\u2019s electricity requirement has been growing at an average rate of 7-8 percent annually (MoPE 2005). In 2002, the CEB\u2019s grid access extended to approximately 65 percent of the country\u2019s households but for the rural sector it only reached 45 percent. There are several policies to support the expansion of rural access to electricity. For example, the Sri Lanka Rural Electrification Policy in 2002 stated as its objective to expand access to electricity to 75 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s population by 2007 through the connection to the main grid, and where this is not feasible through off-grid services at the village or household scale. Due to financial and technical constraints, grid electricity cannot be extended to close to 1.5 million households. These mainly rural households are required to depend on off-grid electrical energy. Power shortages are met, for example, by generating power from auto-diesel which is among the most expensive ways of generating power. 6 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES NEPS of Sri Lanka 2006 also states medium-term electrification targets for grid-electrification and off-grid electrification. The Government is aiming at providing 85 percent of households with grid-electricity and 8 percent of households with off-grid by 2015. NEPS 2006 also spells out the policy elements, strategies and specific targets that will guide the development and management of the energy sector in the coming years in order to facilitate the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It introduces specific new initiatives to expand the delivery of affordable energy services to a larger share of the population, to improve energy sector planning, management and regulation, and to revitalize biomass as a significant resource of commercial energy. NEPS 2006 aims at supporting the following fundamental elements that guide the future of the energy sector in Sri Lanka: \u2022 Fulfill basic energy needs of people and provide energy for economic development. \u2022 Ensure energy security via resource diversification and future energy mix rationalization, which takes into account factors such as economic costs, environmental impacts and reliability of supply. \u2022 Promote energy efficiency and conservation in management and operations of energy systems and in energy utilization. \u2022 Promote optimum development of local resources and minimum dependence on non-indigenous resources. \u2022 Adopt an appropriate pricing policy which takes into account factors such as cost reflectivity, targeted subsidies and local competitiveness. \u2022 Enhance local capacities to manage and develop the energy sector effectively, taking into account technological", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce3330ca-1775-4c48-b694-b265c125956c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce3330ca-1775-4c48-b694-b265c125956c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1bc36cf31e1aed342b4dff571be92415f3837b6de23a51428e6a842b1a5afbe5"}, "3": {"node_id": "267f9582-d17e-42ac-b49d-5ee8e76040cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7359ec5192fcfdda824a3cecc4aa3a608083106000eda6364db7f85edcd1956e"}}, "hash": "936c735af5f15a736cc19ba6e00f4018cc462c21b56ebd36e840c6a7ff70fcd6", "text": "developments and good governance. \u2022 Safeguard current and future consumers and ensure a level playing field to all stakeholders, including all energy sector investors. \u2022 Enhance the quality of energy services through standards and regulations. \u2022 Minimize adverse environmental impacts of energy facilities, with special emphasis on electricity and petroleum sub-sector activities. Although NEPS 2006 acknowledges the need to promote and facilitate the commercial biomass as a new rural industry, it also states that biomass remains as a sub-sector that will not be formally organized the same way as the electricity and petroleum sub-sectors, unless new significant developments occur in terms of biomass becoming an important primary energy source for electricity generation. The Government is aiming at achieving a minimum level of 10 percent of electrical energy supplied 7 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES to the grid to be from non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) by 2015 (MoPE 2006). The policy specifically refers to NCRE promoted for grid electricity generation, which includes small-scale hydropower; biomass, including dendro power, biogas and waste; solar power; and wind power. Therefore, traditional biomass use in industries such as brick making and pottery, which forms a vital economic activity in most villages, still receives limited attention, if any. The emphasis on motive power through wind energy for water pumping is lacking as well. Even the plantation industry relies heavily on fuelwood for heat generation needed in the processing. Therefore, the policy and regulatory framework in Sri Lanka aims at improving the access, affordability and engagement of the rural poor; however the focus is too narrow to benefit those who are mainly using traditional energy sources. \u25a0 The energy policy and regulatory framework focuses on the development and provision of electrical energy. \u25a0 Despite the energy policy, electricity costs in Sri Lanka are high. \u25a0 Recognition of NCRE development exists currently, but it will be considered in the regulatory framework only if its share in electricity production increases. Focus on traditional energy sources is lacking. BOX 2: KEY CHALLENGES IN POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK Energy programme framework Over the years government-led poverty reduction programmes have mainly focused on infrastructure development in rural areas and some on electrification. Certain government-led sub-programmes such as Gemi Diriya (Village Strength), Dahasak Vew (Tank Rehabilitation), Maga Neguma (Rehabilitation of Rural Roads), the Dairy Village Programme, and the Gamata Taakshanaya (Technology to Village) focus on issues such as the strengthening of markets, credit, technical support, and implementation capacity of local governments. These are being implemented through the ministries to reduce poverty via infrastructure development in the rural areas. The main government programme, as far as rural energy is concerned, is the supply of electricity through the grid and expansion of rural electrification. The core objective is to supply low-cost electricity by establishing low-cost coal-fired plants and electrify rural areas, whereas renewable energy and biomass options have not been given much emphasis The policy and regulatory framework is too narrow to benefit those who are mainly using traditional energy sources. 8 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES in the government plans. Therefore, the renewable energy programmes in Sri Lanka are mainly donor-driven. The RERED and the Energy Service Delivery (ESD) projects financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank have raised hopes of maximizing the economic, social, and environmental benefits of rural electrification through the participation of the private sector and households, such as in developing grid-connected mini-hydro power and solar home systems (SHSs). The RERED and ESD project components have resulted in improvements in local capacities; for example in design, implementation and operation stages of village level projects.

TABLE 1 THE SUMMARY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM IMWCDTT GIVEN IN JUNE 2005 (CONT\u2019D) Source IMWCDTT (2005) Most rural electricity supply projects are limited in their rural capacity- building potential. This is partly due to the technology involved and the method of executing the projects based on buying and supplying most of the inputs needed. The equipment supplied under a license would also demand maintenance and upkeep to be carried out by the suppliers thus restricting the possibility of technology flow to the village. The CBOs and NGOs with the assistance of private sector participation have faired better in capacity development with regard to alternate energy though it is again confined to rural electricity. The initiative to introduce dendro power at village level has potential in building local capacities and the technology base that could support poverty alleviation activities. The continuous supply of fuel and labour intensive operations of drying, feeding of fuel and routine cleaning of the equipment would ensure active participation of the community. Already existing units have demonstrated how the rural people take up the work involved and adopt their own methods to suit specific requirements. \u25a0 Government-led poverty reduction programmes have mainly focused on infrastructure development in rural areas, while only some have on electrification. \u25a0 Renewable energy programmes are mainly driven by external agencies. \u25a0 Limited emphasis on energy programmes that also focus on improving the livelihoods of the poor. BOX 3: KEY CHALLENGES IN ENERGY PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK Most rural electricity supply projects are limited in their rural capacity- building potential. 10 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES Limited emphasis on energy access for poverty reduction In Sri Lanka, access to energy is constrained by inadequate capacity of electricity generation, inability of distribution agencies to supply electricity, unequal eligibility criteria for consumers and limited affordability. Lack of investments is the prime obstacle in access to energy across the country. At commercial rates of borrowing, renewable energy cannot compete with conventional energy. Foreign investment in the rural energy sector has been limited to transport and the distribution of petroleum and LPG. Alternative energy supplies, even in the area of electricity, have to face unequal terms as a result of the unavailability of foreign investments. Access to electricity has been governed by selected criteria of the CEB based on socio-economic indicators. The CEB places high priority on rural communities, which hold promise in terms of markets, demonstrate low risks, and score highly on economic internal rate of return. Energy-poverty linkages are frequently overlooked in poverty reduction strategies; energy is usually not linked with other pro-poor policies and activities. This often leads to less suitable energy services being supplied in isolation from other energy needs in the community. Electricity is only a part of the rural energy demand available to just about 90 percent of the population after complete implementation of the rural electrification programme in Sri Lanka. It is doubtful whether this supply of minimum electrical energy would support any economic activity to reduce poverty. Energy for cooking in the rural areas comes mainly from biomass, accounting for 90 percent of the total; the remaining 10 percent comes from kerosene and LPG. Energy for lighting, which accounts for 7.5 percent of the energy consumed by the poor, comes from electricity (55 percent) and kerosene (45 percent). Nearly 80 percent of the biomass comes from", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c014fb7d-cb66-4ada-a6f2-1608a3cf26be": {"__data__": {"id_": "c014fb7d-cb66-4ada-a6f2-1608a3cf26be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3df374af097638c43fbe9c873edfeea765546d67d76e18f9bde36db6339aab2"}}, "hash": "c3df374af097638c43fbe9c873edfeea765546d67d76e18f9bde36db6339aab2", "text": "non-forest resources, namely agricultural and plantation work.

There are some instances of biogas use in cooking and lighting. The development and dissemination of these installations is mainly handled by a small number of NGOs. There has been some improvement in R&D activities and technology transfer through Government institutions contributing to the identification of alternative energy sources. The MoPE has identified the main barriers: investment Energy- poverty linkages are frequently overlooked in poverty reduction strategies. 11 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES FIGURE 2 TYPICAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION PATTERNS IN A GRID-CONNECTED VILLAGE costs, availability of resources, and lack of popularization of marginal uses of renewable energy in Sri Lanka. Source Abeygunewardena (2005) Renewable energy supplies through wind energy, solar photovoltaic, etc. are not managed by the Government but by the private sector and NGOs. Fuelwood is not even taken into consideration. The use of energy in the form of thermal energy in rural economic activities such as in brick kilns, bakeries, and other small-scale manufacturing is also handled mainly by NGOs and CBOs; most agencies completely ignore the use of animal motive power. In the near future, the Government expects that hydro-electricity production and biomass-based energy supplies are going to increase only marginally. Much of the large-hydro potential is already developed. This also means that the country\u2019s energy needs have to be met mainly by imported fossil fuels in the medium-term. However, in the longer term, an accelerated development of non-conventional renewable energy and possible development of indigenous petroleum resources are hoped to make a significant change in Sri Lanka\u2019s mix of primary energy resources. (MoPE 2006) In the short and medium term, modern renewable energy is seen to remain out of the reach of the poorer sections of the population. In addition, the oil and gas exploration under way in Sri Lanka, in anticipation of finding reserves to meet the demand of the next 20 years, may not yield expected outcomes. Most agencies completely ignore the use of animal motive power. 12 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES \u25a0 Lack of investments limits access to energy across the country. \u25a0 Poor cannot afford the high cost of electricity. \u25a0 Lack of popularization of renewable energy to enhance poverty reduction. \u25a0 Modern renewable energy is seen as the domain of the elite. \u25a0 Private initiatives towards accessing modern energy services are completely out of the reach of rural masses. BOX 4: KEY CHALLENGES TO ENERGY ACCESS Technology efficiency and fuel options Rural energy options in Sri Lanka that can be met with local resources with minimum external inputs include biomass, solar energy, micro-hydro, wind energy, biogas and waste, and dendro power. Fuelwood is used extensively in cooking and in the processing of many plantation crops, such as tea, rubber, and coconut. The annual energy potential of plantation biomass is estimated to vary from 30 to 150 peta joules (PJ) in 2010. It is projected that the total energy consumption in Sri Lanka in 2010 will be 425 PJ. Thus, the plantation biomass could supply about 7 to 32 percent of the total energy consumed in 2010. Solar cooking is not very common in Sri Lanka but solar drying is becoming very popular. Over 60,000 households have been fitted with solar photovoltaic systems of 25-50 W capacity. These SHSs generate sufficient power to meet lighting and communication needs in rural homes but the cost is particularly constraining. A survey carried out by the ECF for the MoPE has shown that while there are 161 micro-hydro units operating in Sri Lanka providing electricity for 3600 households, there are 24 units with a capacity of 385 kW not functioning due to various reasons. About 40 MW of small hydroelectric generating capacity is already in place and many similar sites are being developed. The potential of developing 250 MW of installed capacity with a plant factor of 40 percent, and an energy output of 875 GWh by 2015 is being considered practically feasible. The use of wind power for lift irrigation, which was common some years ago in the north, has now being replaced by engine- or motor- driven pump sets. Biogas plants, both continuous flow type and batch type, of 1-2 tonne capacity are popular.

The use of wind power for lift irrigation has now been replaced by engine- or motor-driven pump sets. 13 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES The cost of electricity used by the industrial sector in Sri Lanka is one of the highest in the region. The CEB hopes that by introducing large coal- based electricity generation capacities in Sri Lanka, the generating cost could be reduced to 4 US cents per kWh. Though this figure is subject to criticism, renewable energy projects that cost more than the figure for coal are not encouraged. During 1997-2003, the Renewable Energy and Energy Capacity- Building Project funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the GEF provided support to improve R&D capabilities of several institutions and promoted technology transfer and efficient energy options. This was followed by a smaller grant from 2004-2005 to promote development of efficient use of biomass energy in several industries and home-based enterprises. Studies have shown that the net potential benefit from industrial energy efficiency improvements could produce an annual generation saving of about US$45 million. However, investment barriers have hindered widespread commercialization and large-scale implementation of end-use energy-efficiency improvements. Exploring energy-based entrepreneurship Many rural activities are energy-based, and enterprises in agricultural, manufacturing and service sectors make use of energy in some form or the other. The best way to make energy a factor in reducing poverty is by co-opting the poor as partners in the process of energy supply itself. In the context of large power production, whether coal or hydro, or the supply of imported oil or gas for transport or cooking, there is very little scope for employment opportunities for the poor, let alone entrepreneurial opportunities for them. However, there is ample scope for participation at the grass-roots level particularly in terms of the small-scale energy projects. Yet, human power, biomass, and other forms of renewable energy are subsumed under the notion of progress in providing electricity to the poor. Investment barriers have hindered widespread commercialization and large- scale implementation of end-use energy- efficiency improvements. \u25a0 Ineffective policy formulation results in smaller units suffering from lack of scale economies. \u25a0 Indirect benefits of increase in indigenous knowledge and development of linkages with the community at large are ignored unless they have political undertones. BOX 5: KEY CHALLENGES TO TECHNOLOGY EFFICIENCY 14 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES \u25a0 Large power production offers only limited employment opportunities to the poor, let alone entrepreneurial opportunities for them. \u25a0 The tendency to import and supply many items that could be manufactured locally has aggravated rural poverty and increased migration into urban areas in search of work in the cities. Indigenous production has suffered tremendously because of lack of markets and buyers. BOX 6: KEY CHALLENGES TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP OPPORTUNITIES The prospects for income-generating activities that can help break the cycle of poverty often rely on the availability of energy. Apropos to knowledge repositories vis-\u00e0-vis energy-poverty linkages, the Integrated Development Association (IDEA) has published training manuals, and conducted workshops in enterprises such as bakeries, brick kilns, fuelwood stoves, dehydrating food for preservation, biogas, wind generators, water pumps, and tea and tobacco drying. There has been a shift from local manufacturing to more imports from the region to meet industrial needs. The manufacturing of wind turbines for pumping water, a project undertaken by the WRB had come to a halt with the installation of 200 units, which have gone into disuse. Problems encountered in operation and maintenance of these units are reported but there is no central policy or body to address these issues. Highlighting the importance of rural finance through microcredit Poverty is an overwhelmingly rural problem in Sri Lanka. Roughly 88 percent of the poor live in rural areas, which suffer from underemployment, slow growth in agricultural productivity, lack of integration with the mainstream economy, unclear land tenure, and limited access to basic services and infrastructure. The Government\u2019s economic reform programme highlights the role of rural finance in empowering the poor, especially women, and emphasizes the sustainability of rural finance institutions and their integration with the financial sector. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) report on commercialization of microfinance in Sri Lanka (ADB 2002), the microfinance industry in Sri Lanka is at a fairly early stage of commercialization. 15 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES Organizations based on the cooperative model, such as Cooperative Rural Banks (CRBs), Thrift and Credit Cooperative Societies (TCCSs), and some NGOs offering microfinance have made progress towards commercialization, although the performance of individual institutions within each of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5243f5a1-d216-408e-be6c-fbb8053aff87": {"__data__": {"id_": "5243f5a1-d216-408e-be6c-fbb8053aff87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b77e7469e25e0f5fc22f16be52f299dfdc9219f2d9ed295500b44d7fc437152"}, "3": {"node_id": "a9f3af3c-0887-4274-8f47-95fe75fbe8ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c184a9ffbecd930d94e3d836f94edd0e2a6113346a88ea520549adcf3af6a7cc"}}, "hash": "d9c59e0df2f26e2caa163715579eeda192edd2cbd844d9dcf1bac8cf17b5ab42", "text": "these categories has been average. Several NGOs have adopted different methods of promoting microfinance lending. The most commercial of these providers, such as the largest NGO in Sri Lanka, Sarvodaya Economic Enterprises Development Services (SEEDS), has been progressing steadily towards financial self-sufficiency while providing microloans of only SLR 8,000 (US$89) on average. The SEEDS has banking, enterprise services and training divisions and it operates through a large network of banks, village societies and individuals. The Women\u2019s Development Federation is a NGO led by women with over 30,000 members and it operates community-driven banking units known as Janashakthi Bank Societies. It has been successful in promoting women- oriented social and community-based activities and small village-level sustainable banking through broader partnership with the help of several donors. The poor in Sri Lanka have also been able to save more than SLR 7,600 million (US$74.35 million) in the Samurdhi Bank Societies, which are part of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction programme. The concept of Samurdhi Banks was introduced by the Government to improve income levels of the poor by inculcating their savings habit and providing them with credit facilities to commence income-generating projects. The aim of the Samurdhi Movement is to prepare an income-generating project to each Samurdhi beneficiary family within it by utilizing the savings. The non-commercial providers of microfinance include numerous unsustainable Government microfinance programmes, several hundred poorly performing CRBs and TCCSs, and around 200 weak, small- and medium-sized microfinance NGOs. The involvement of commercial banks in the provision of microfinance is limited. The commercial banks are not very interested in the business and the rural people do not seek their assistance either. A few notable exceptions such as the Hatton National Bank \u2013 with the far-reaching Gami Pubuduwa (Village Reawakening) initiative, which deals with decentralization of microfinance at the village level \u2013 and the Seylan Bank and Sampath Bank exist with a combined number of outstanding microloans covered only 1.2 percent of the industry total at the end of 2000. MFIs rely heavily on savings mobilization to fund their loan portfolios, indicating a fairly high level of commercialization in terms of access to funding sources. The involvement of commercial banks in the provision of microfinance is limited. 16 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES Government policies, interventions, and legal and regulatory frameworks discourage new entrants into microfinance and hinder the commercialization of existing MFIs. Microfinance cooperatives \u2013 the largest suppliers of microcredit as well as significant savings \u2013 are not adequately regulated and supervised. Many MFIs suffer from weak governance, lack of clarity in their mission, low levels of understanding of banking and finance, inappropriate accounting practices, and inadequate management information systems. As of now, there is no specific reference to energy or data available on energy-related microfinance, except in the context of the ESD credit programme that promoted financing through banks and microfinance institutions for private sector provision of on- and off-grid renewable energy services. Commercial financing for renewable energy was almost non-existent prior to 1997. The ESD project (1997-2002), funded by the World Bank and the GEF, promoted commercial financing of private sector renewable energy services in grid-connected mini hydro, community- based off-grid village hydro, and SHSs. The RERED project (2002-2007) includes financing of private-sector-owned grid-connected power plants, community-owned off-grid schemes, SHSs, energy efficiency and demand-side management, cross-sectoral energy applications, and technical assistance. Furthermore, the Global Environment Facility/Small Grants Programme (GEF/SGP) \u2013 with a total fund of US$3.5 million (1995- 2006) and 218 projects under biodiversity, climate change, network building and other multi-focus schemes \u2013 has completed three phases of its funding and the fourth phase is planned for 2006-2010. The project has supported a number of initiatives addressing the energy needs of the poor, such as the kitchen stove and the fuelwood plantation programme. It has also been active in promoting small wind generating units made locally, micro-hydro and SHSs to meet rural electricity needs.

Previously, they collected animal waste and disposed of it far away from the sheds, which was a time consuming and tiresome activity. Now the animal waste is being diverted to the nearby biogas units with minimum effort. In addition to the time saving, households using biogas have gained fairly high social status in the villages. The study has also shown that 30 percent of the households who own a biogas unit had earlier used kerosene lamps. Eighty-two percent of them were using bottle lamps which pose severe fire hazards. Also, the very high bio fertilizer value of the slurry is an important determinant in adopting the biogas technology. It can help to reduce the fertilizer budget of the farmer significantly. While energy and fertilizer remain the main uses of biogas at household level, it is being increasingly recognized as a waste disposal technology by the local government authorities for whom garbage is a severe environmental problem. However, women\u2019s participation in capacity development initiatives relating to different energy services is limited, even though there clearly is potential for that. Technical training and discussions pertaining to energy supply are mostly done with men though the main energy users in the rural sector are women. Gender considerations tend to be left out in the energy planning and programming stage. Consequently, gender- and energy-related monitoring and evaluation at the project level tends to be weak, unless more emphasis is directed at the issue. Women's participation in capacity development initiatives relating to different energy sources is limited, even though there clearly is potential for that. 18 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka THE CHALLENGES Limited monitoring and evaluation system To assess the relationship between energy and poverty programmes directed towards poverty reduction and livelihood improvement through access to energy, it is important that these programmes are monitored and evaluated regularly. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of government activities in Sri Lanka has been almost non-existent, and policy implementation has been hampered by indecision. A number of parallel systems have been set up \u2013 including the budget monitoring system of the External Resources Department under the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MoFP) and, as a response to the insurgent of resources for post-tsunami activities, the Government initiative, known as the Development Assistance Database with the support of UNDP \u2013 to improve the monitoring of the use of financial resources and achievement of results. The newly established Ministry of Plan Implementation (MoPI) will set up an M&E system as part of the National Operations Room with cells at different ministries for governmental and non-governmental activities in Sri Lanka. Donor-funded projects are monitored periodically and extensions depend heavily on performance. The ESD project was extended to RERED mainly due to the excellent performance shown in the first phase. The GEF/SGP projects are also monitored by a steering committee, which evaluates proposals and checks progress. Planners hope to reduce poverty by increasing the consumption of electrical energy. Rural energy use, in the form of thermal heat from biomass and motive power from draft animals, is not included in the assessments. \u25a0 When it comes to energy-related programmes, the gender bias is apparent, particularly in capacity-building programmes, even though positive examples exist, such as introduction of biogas. \u25a0 Technical training and discussions pertaining to energy supply are mostly done with men though the main energy users in the rural sector are women. \u25a0 Capacity development should not be seen only in the narrow project specific capacities. \u25a0 Lack of gender considerations in energy plans and programmes, and weak gender- and energy-related M&E.

The energy-poverty linkage is completely neglected. Most of the information available is in English and in text form. MEETING THE CHALLENGES S Institutional framework for ensuring an energy-efficient future ri Lanka requires a committed effort towards regulation of its existing energy sources and provision of price subsidies for the poor. Institutional bodies need to be set up for this purpose and some headway has already been made in this direction. PUCSL, established under the Public Utilities Commission Act, does not currently only regulate the electricity and petroleum industries, but it also regulates other utilities such as water service as well. PUCSL will have authority to execute regulation only when the individual industry legislations are enacted and made effective. In addition to the regulatory arrangement, the energy utilities need to be further strengthened to enhance their financial viability and service quality (MoPE 2006). The Government could also take the leadership to bring about the required institutional changes and capacities that enable decentralized decision-making. Issues relating to sustainable energy technologies are mostly dealt with at the microlevel, and therefore, could be addressed well only at a decentralized level. Furthermore, only rural decentralized energy plans could address the realities of the energy requirements for sustainable livelihoods activities covering cooking, lighting, domestic and rural industries which generate or save income. The utility of alternative sources of energy has already been recognized in the island nation. PUCSL and the recently operationalized SEA have been assigned the responsibility to implement the NCRE strategy and to achieve targets (MoPE 2006).

It is encouraging that the Sri Lanka Rural Electrification Policy 2002 identifies as its key goals maximizing the economic, social, and environmental benefits of rural electrification as well as the leveraging of government resources through the participation of the private sector and the rural society. NEPS 2006 identifies broadly how the energy sector policies can be implemented. These include the enhancement of existing biomass resources, diversification of fuels used in electricity and transport sectors, and implementation of energy efficiency and conservation measures. In addition, it emphasizes the development of indigenous energy sources, in particular, NCRE sources. Certain NCRE technologies require incentives to ensure their up-scaling and contribution to the national NCRE target. These incentives are planned to be technology-specific, based on actual energy generation supplied to the grid, provided on a competitive basis and made available through the Energy Fund. Furthermore, NEPS 2006 stresses regulating the energy sector, including electricity and petroleum sub-sectors, to ensure an effective implementation of pricing policy among other issues (see Table 4). The recent operationalization of SEA and its mandate is in line with the overall strategy to promote clean energy development, energy efficiency improvement and conservation in Sri Lanka.

Since traditional biomass remains as an important source for meeting energy needs, and even though it is not recognized formally in government policies, a mechanism needs to be evolved to regulate it. A system of giving a notional value to traditional biomass (e.g. fuelwood used in the informal sector) to arrive at meaningful energy policies could be developed. The policy advocacy role to be played by the CBOs and civil society is to expand the debate on energy to go beyond electricity. The planners must be asked to take into account the non-formal sector into their reckoning in energy planning. A mechanism needs to be evolved to regulate traditional biomass. 24 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka MEETING THE CHALLENGES Improving livelihoods through dendro thermal initiatives under the energy programme framework In order to arrive at an integrated approach to technology and infrastructure development in the rural areas, energy supply based on biomass, animal power, and alternative sources should be captured in the policy and programme framework. Coordinated efforts and action are needed to bring all these plans to fruition. The development of relevant energy technologies, local capacities and the technology base should be strengthened. The Government envisages the implementation of a programme based on the proposed dendro thermal initiative that helps the poor establish livelihoods through energy supply. The policy also provides for a necessary framework to ensure that all electricity suppliers to rural consumers can compete on equal terms. Subsidies are also to be made available to all parties interested in rural electrification on a competitive basis. The programme also allows for a tariff regime that enables cost recovery at a reasonable return on investment, particularly in isolated mini-grid systems in rural areas accepting the principle of differential pricing. A subsidy mechanism for rural electrification based on the principles of economic efficiency, transparency, and social equity will be established to support rural electrification programmes. Financing for these subsidies is to be facilitated through government and donor assistance. Cultivation of fuelwood to meet the energy needs of rural people, and at the same time meeting soil fertility build up by using nitrogen fixing species, has been promoted by the Coconut Cultivation Board and the Tea Research Institute, in collaboration with the BEASL. Quite recently, the Government has recognized the need to grow fuelwood and has declared a nitrogen-fixing fast growing tree (Gliricidia sepium) as a plantation crop. The development of dendro power in Sri Lanka is primarily through actions taken by the AED. Twelve trial plots were established at different locations in the country to determine the optimum parameters for sustainable energy plantations. Coppice Gliricidia wood was used to demonstrate the feasibility of electricity generation and industrial heat applications. A model is being developed by the AED where an area of 1 hectare of Gliricidia energy plantation with six cows is assigned to a family for improving livelihoods through energy services. Branch coppice wood systematically harvested from the energy plantations is sold to energy conversion facilities. Foliage from these branches is mixed with rice straw and fed to cows. Milk from the cows is sold to the dairy processing industry. Dung from the cows is digested to generate biogas The development of relevant energy technologies, local capacities and the technology base should be strengthened. 25 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka MEETING THE CHALLENGES and effluent from the digesters is used as organic fertilizer replacing imported chemical fertilizer. Biogas is used as cooking fuel or for off-grid electricity generation.

It has also developed efficient wood stoves for domestic application. Ensuring greater access to modern energy for poverty reduction and renewable sources of energy Expansion of access to electricity and petroleum-based fuels in rural areas remains as a priority intervention for poverty reduction in Sri Lanka. The NEPS of Sri Lanka 2006 provides for capital subsidies that have been available for grid-connected households to be extended to households seeking off-grid electricity technologies. It also provides for targeted subsidies for household use of electricity and kerosene. These are targeted at low-income groups (i.e. all Samurdhi beneficiary families in on-grid, off-grid or non-electrified, low-income households). The subsidies will be provided from the savings accrued via elimination of cross-subsidies in electricity tariff. Coupons will be issued to, for example, cover fifty percent of the cost of on-grid electricity supply of the first 30 kWh, or coupons of the same value to pay off the cost of off-grid electricity or the cost of kerosene. The institutional responsibility to prepare and implement the plans has been assigned to PUCSL. Communities need access to a range of energy sources to satisfy their energy service needs in different sectors within the community \u2013 households, schools, medical centres, micro-enterprise development, transport, communication, agriculture, etc. These energy needs of the whole community and their linkage to different sectors need to be well understood and considered in energy planning in order to respond to the energy demands with more efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Even though a beginning has been made, there remain a vast number of renewable resources that need to be tapped to tide over the energy crisis and reduce rural poverty. The use of animal power, abundantly available in Sri Lanka, should also be seen as an energy issue and policies must address the issues of grazing land, access to water, etc. in meeting this need. Communities need access to a range of energy sources to satisfy their energy service needs in different sectors within the community. 26 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka MEETING THE CHALLENGES A regulatory arrangement is needed to integrate development work in the renewable energy sector. The barriers for funding renewable energy projects need to be removed in order to scale up good initiatives. A strengthened microfinance sector can provide part of the solution. Several initiatives have been in progress in recent years. IDEA has developed large-scale wood burning stoves (Amarasekera 2005) and also introduced paddy-husk burning bakery ovens and brick kilns successfully. The NERD Centre has developed a smoke-free wood stove and energy- efficient gasifiers for small and medium enterprises. Such initiatives must be promoted, encouraged and supported. The former ECF already had certain poverty reduction and energy efficiency projects in the pipeline. Resource assessment such as solar, wind, and hydro mapping by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have been conducted. Documents such as the Renewable Energy Policy Compendium, prepared with USAID assistance, and a policy framework for renewable resources-based electricity generation under the RERED project have been developed. Also an Energy Sector Master Plan, with ADB assistance, has been developed and earmarked for implementation. In addition, a National Energy Planning Committee has been appointed and a Renewable Energy Cell has been set up. New improved energy technologies The introduction of the concept of endogenous development based on technology that could be handled from within is the need of the hour. New improved small-scale energy technologies are already in development. A labour-intensive technology such as dendro seems feasible. Apart from meeting fodder and soil fertility needs by growing suitable energy plants as an intercrop with existing farming, technology links to the community are easily established. The BEASL has introduced dendro power as a viable option for village energy supply and sustenance of rural activities. The NERD Centre has been engaged in developing several renewable energy technologies associated with solar, wind, and biomass and has successfully introduced a batch type digester for paddy straw and developed several gasifiers for different uses. IDEA, the national focal point of the Asia Regional Cook Stove Programme and the International Network for Sustainable Energy (INFORSE), is engaged in capacity- building of NGOs in promoting efficient wood stoves (IDEA 2005). The Energy Forum is involved in off-grid power generation and implements promotional strategies for renewable energy technologies supported by 27 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka MEETING THE CHALLENGES the Asia Pro Eco of the European Community.

Besides recommending setting up an agency to act as a repository of knowledge for renewable energy, the IMWCDTT suggested that energy research activities should be coordinated by the proposed agency through an information hub. Information exchanged among stakeholders should be used to manage a national R&D programme on energy in association with the National Science Foundation. Priorities for R&D could be determined at the national symposium, an annual event designed to identify research needs and to monitor progress on ongoing research (IMWCDTT 2005). Energy-based entrepreneurial opportunities Provision of newer and better entrepreneurial opportunities is a challenge that the Sri Lankan policy makers must attempt to overcome. A few initiatives are already in place but much more needs to be done. New technologies suitable for renewable sources, including small applications, are being developed and locally manufactured. As an example, the Organic Rankin Cycle Engines are designed to use any fuel, or direct solar, through concentrators. More promising initiatives should be taken up as national projects and be promoted in a sustainable manner by giving proper recognition and incentives to such programmes. More importance must also be given to disseminating knowledge and imparting maintenance and operating skills at the village level to prevent dependence on external inputs. This will also help evolve a viable technology base in the villages that will sustain other technology needs of the poor. The SARI\u2019s Small Grants Programme for Energy Corporation and Development has granted US$250,000 to the Energy Forum and SLEMA for establishing standards and prices for delivering clean, reliable, and affordable energy to rural families. The Energy Forum has been entrusted with the task of establishing and maintaining standards related to micro- hydro to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the system, in the process putting forth a \u2018National Micro-Hydro Standard\u2019. SLEMA would work on electricity pricing in the region granting subsidies to different consumer classes taking into account financial, social and political issues with respect to electricity pricing. A team of experts has prepared a business proposal, which encourages the establishment of a commercial-scale, biomass-based electricity More importance must also be given to disseminating knowledge and skills at the village level to prevent dependence on external inputs. 28 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka MEETING THE CHALLENGES generating facility located in a rural area and operated by the private sector. This project also incorporates Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) aspects with a view to implement a CDM project in Sri Lanka for the biomass sector. The ADB-prepared pre-feasibility study has been submitted to the MoPE for implementation by an appropriate private sector institution. The NEPS of Sri Lanka 2006 suggests that Sri Lanka\u2019s non-conventional renewable energy resources could be developed also under the CDM. Therefore, there is potential for carbon finance in appropriate projects such as biomass-based projects where land resources and biomass waste are available, with emphasis on rural income generation. Microcredit: the answer to the problem of financial access The microfinance sector should be strengthened to promote investment in rural areas. Policy changes that emphasize good governance and improved operations of rural finance institutions need to be promoted. If microcredit to help meet the poor\u2019s energy needs is to be promoted, a separate database on credit extended to various energy projects must be maintained. This will allow the planners to locate gaps and suggest incentives needed to promote investment in providing energy supplies and energy-based enterprises. As energy to the poor is bracketed in the informal sector, microcredit institutes would fail to take initiatives unless some inducement is built in at the policy level. The ADB is helping establish a more sustainable rural finance system in Sri Lanka through a loan package totalling US$70 million. The Rural Finance Sector Development Programme aims to revive the rural economy and promote private-sector-led economic growth. Greater attention to gender issues The introduction of biogas can be highlighted as a good example, since it can make a positive difference to women\u2019s lives. It can reduce the time women spend in the collection of firewood and in the kitchen cooking and cleaning utensils and enhance their income-generating activities. Therefore, the labour spent in collecting firewood, tending to livestock, gathering fodder, etc., needs to be taken into account in the planning processes. Furthermore, ensuring the involvement of women in the process of selection, implementation and running of most schemes delivering energy is necessary. Women should be able to participate in capacity development initiatives relating to different energy services.

Capacity-building for general capacities that could be transferred to other development projects, and for example, information and communication technology (ICT) and other technical training, would benefit women since they have not been encouraged to participate widely before. In view of the fact that women tend to be left out of energy plans and programmes, the aspects raised in the Gender and Energy Tool Kit issued by the UNDP and questions and issues such as the impact of project evaluation on gender issues and identification of gender gaps and gender-related project successes could be made part of the overall M&E structure. Developing a more holistic monitoring and evaluation system The way ahead includes eradicating extreme poverty and hunger through income-generating opportunities; achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality; improving health by reducing indoor air pollution; increasing access to clean/pumped water; ensuring environmental sustainability through preservation of forest land; and reclaiming eroded agricultural land. There is a need for more balanced and regular energy-related assessments, particularly of the government energy programmes. The M&E processes at institutional and cross-institutional levels should be improved and the existing parallel systems should be linked to capture small-scale initiatives at the local levels. It could also be beneficial to include the traditional rural energy use, in the form of thermal heat from biomass and motive power from draft animals, to the assessments since it remains as a good indicator of rural economic activity. Also, if the programme and project goals are set in collaboration with the participants, then new outcomes and benefits could be assessed in the light of changing situations. This becomes more crucial when poverty and energy are linked as the definition of poverty based on income or consumption may differ widely from one rural setting to another depending on the natural resource base they possess. Besides economic measures, other important aspects such as education, health, environmental sustainability and gender equality need to be assessed. Basic energy needs such as cooking and lighting and labour spent on, for example collecting firewood, need to be included in the assessments. The setting up of a repository of knowledge on the The M&E processes at institutional and cross- institutional levels should be improved and the existing parallel systems should be linked to capture small- scale initiatives at local levels. 30 Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka CONCLUSION CONCLUSION T energy-poverty linkages and all related aspects must be undertaken on a priority basis in order to have meaningful M&E of projects. This would, at least supply the baseline data to evaluate future project outcomes. Harnessing modern technology for information gathering Information gathering and dissemination are key to an energy-efficient future with poverty reduction as a major challenge. Partnerships with the private sector and the civil society are needed to help bridge the gaps. The media needs to be effectively harnessed for proper information gathering and dissemination. An effective participatory medium must replace the existing government-controlled community radio service and other forms of media that are commercially controlled. Radio has been found wanting in promoting an effective participatory communication system due to one-way communication, an inherent lacunae. Policy changes might be needed to address the issue of telecommunication tariffs. The presentation of the material in the vernacular and in more user-friendly interactive modes is essential to help people access the information. Gamata Taakshanaya (Technology to Village), a programme launched by the Government, hopes to establish computer-linked centres in each of the 320 Divisional Secretary areas, and establish Science and Technology Societies at the village level. Regarding the enhancement of the much-needed infrastructure and human capacity, Sri Lanka will have to look for assistance from the International Telecommunication Union and the Asia Pacific Telecommunity. Wireless technologies can enable villagers to access the network at their local temple, school, or Ayurvedic practitioner\u2019s office. This final stage of ICT delivery to the user is referred to as the \u2018last mile\u2019. Radio and ICTs should be used to improve the delivery of and access to basic information on energy and also on services such as health and education. In particular, they should serve as a tool for empowerment of women and children living in rural areas, and to increase transparency, accountability and effectiveness of governments and civil societies. he demand for energy in Sri Lanka has increased over the years and energy-poverty linkages have been mainly neglected.

Improved data and analysis to reflect the differing needs of men and women is essential in order to ensure fair delivery of energy services. It is essential that Sri Lanka explores ways of improving the efficiency of energy use and addresses barriers for the slow growth in adopting renewable and cleaner energy sources. The Government should take the leadership to bring about the required policy and institutional changes, including encouraging decentralized decision-making, continuing to leverage resources and creating effective partnerships to build the foundation necessary for efficient delivery of energy services to reduce poverty. 32 SCHEMATIC REPRESENTATION OF CHALLENGES AND MODALITIES TO MEET THE CHALLENGES THE CHALLENGES MEETING THE CHALLENGES Energy policy and regulatory framework focuses on the development and provision of electrical energy; While biomass remains an important source for meeting rural energy needs, there is no special provision to support, control or regulate it Despite the energy policy, electricity costs in Sri Lanka are high The key issues facing the Government include developing a cost-effective electricity tariff setting, directing targeted subsidies and improving the quality of energy services Institutional Structure Policy and Regulatory Framework Provincial energy ministries have limited influence on rural energy planning although they are in better position to assess the needs The institutional arrangement focuses mainly on electricity and fossil fuel based energy development, including in the rural context All significant energy sources need to be included under the regulatory framework Limited coordination and capacities across sectors and stakeholders A regulatory structure is in place for all physical infrasructure sectors, although currently covers electricity, petroleum and water service; The energy utilities need to be further strengthened to enhance their financial viability and service quality Renewable energy sector development mechanisms also need to be evolved and placed within the institutional arrangements The Government should take the leadership necessary to bring about the required institutional changes that enable decentralized decision-making Rural decentralized energy plans could address the realities of the energy requirements for sustainable livelihoods activities Enhance and sustain capacities of provincial energy planners to enable them to contribute to rural energy and off-grid electricity development The cross-sectoral capacity- building initiatives have identified institutions such as the National Council for Economic Development, SEMA, the Administrative Reforms Committee and the National Procurement Agency that can enhance coordination and capacities in relevant areas Build linkages between the private and state sectors in developing national economic plans; Facilitate and manage strategic enterprises; Promote institutional reforms in the public sector; Oversee procurement monitoring, capacity-building, and other policy-related matters Develop a system of giving a notional value to traditional biomass (e.g. fuelwood) used in the informal sector to arrive at meaningful energy policy The policy advocacy role of CBOs and civil society should be to expand the debate on energy to go beyond electricity The planners must be asked to take into account the non-formal sector when engaging in energy planning Regulate the energy sector, including electricity and petroleum subsectors, to ensure effective implementation of the pricing policy Formulate and update appropriate strategies and ensure that the optimal energy supply expansion plans are implemented in time Develop a mechanism for identifying target groups Develop a framework based on the principles of economic efficiency, transparency and social equity to make a cost- effective tariff regime that enables cost recovery at a reasonable return on investment and targeted subsidies Permit reasonable increases in allowed returns to the utilities in order to encourage enhanced quality Ensure energy sector utilities comply with safety and environmental standards 33 THE CHALLENGES MEETING THE CHALLENGES Programme Framework Limited emphasis on energy programmes that also focus on improving the livelihoods of the poor Lack of a balanced energy and poverty programme framework, and renewable energy programmes are mainly driven by external agencies Coordinated efforts and action is necessary in order to bring the plans to fruition Rural energy supply based on biomass, animal power and alternative sources should receive more attention in the policy and programme framework Strenghten development of relevant energy technologies while building local capacities and the technology base Implementation of a programme that helps the poor establish livelihoods through energy supply by the proposed dendro", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06402249-aa48-4bb5-bfeb-6eb828d0a522": {"__data__": {"id_": "06402249-aa48-4bb5-bfeb-6eb828d0a522", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Sri Lanka", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-sri-lanka", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ada744cabd5d99dcc0760d710c0bc8232da74cbbb26ee553a5adb3425f31fade"}}, "hash": "ada744cabd5d99dcc0760d710c0bc8232da74cbbb26ee553a5adb3425f31fade", "text": "thermal initiatives A model is being developed by AED in which an area of 1 hectare of Gliricidia energy plantation with six cows is assigned to a family for improving livelihoods through energy services The AED model encourages families to: 1)Harvest wood and mixed foliage from the energy plantations to sell to energy conversion facilities and to feed cows, respectively;

lack of scale economies Limited accessibility to information and partnerships for knowledge sharing Capital subsidies that have been available for grid- connected households are to be extended to households seeking off-grid electricity technologies Energy needs of communities and their linkage to different sectors need to be well understood and considered in energy planning in order to respond

several solutions that are feasible at the village level to minimize smoke-induced health hazards, such as improved stoves, improved kitchens, etc. Wood used in a less harmful manner should be advocated instead of simply considering to replace it with LPG or electricity converted from fuels that could be used directly in thermal application at much higher efficiency Enhance partnerships with the private sector and civil society to help bridge the gaps Use Radio and ICTs to improve the delivery of and access to basic information on energy and also on services such as health and

Access to affordable modern energy services can improve their productivity and enhance living standards. Even so, there are no specific targets for the energy sector in the Millennium Declaration, a historic document signed seven years ago by the world\u2019s leaders. Affordable and sustainable modern energy services are a necessity for countries to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Efforts of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet these aims will be hindered unless adequate attention is given to the crucial role energy services play in the development process. This is particularly true for the economic, environmental and social well-being of the poor. With fluctuating energy prices, the poor in many of the countries in the Asia and Pacific region face a daunting future. For them, access to affordable and essential modern energy services that could improve their living conditions and ensure a means to earn a living, will fall outside their reach. Recognizing the urgency for countries to factor in access to modern energy services, particularly when shaping national poverty reduction initiatives, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided technical and financial support for national-level rapid energy assessments. The primary aim of this work, carried out through UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) and completed in 2006, was to identify gaps and priority needs in linking energy services provision with poverty reduction. The framework for rapid gap assessments linking energy and poverty was developed as a joint effort of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) and UNDP country offices in the region, with the support of experts from the region. The draft framework was discussed at two sub-regional meetings, one held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005) and the other in Apia, Samoa (September 2005). The meetings were helpful in customizing the framework to suit specific needs and circumstances of the participating countries. Subsequently, UNDP country offices held national-level stakeholder consultations to consolidate the findings and recommendations of the assessments. This work benefited immensely from the support of government vi Energy and Poverty in the Maldives officials and representatives of civil society. Documented in individual country reports, this work serves as resource and reference material for programming and planning for access to modern energy services for the underserved, particularly, the poor. This document is a summary of the Country Report on the Maldives and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the Country Report, summarizes the challenges faced at the national level, and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to energy policy, including institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, priority programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support are highlighted. It offers a way forward, outlining issues and options for the country. Our hope is that this document will be of relevance to national policy makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organizations and academia in implementing various measures to promote access to modern energy services for the poor.

The report also offers options for the country to overcome its energy sector challenges. This study is especially valid in the context of the Maldives, where income disparities are rising between the urban and outer islands and atolls, and dependency on energy imports is heavy, especially for the electricity and transport sectors. Diesel accounts for more than 80 percent of total primary energy demand and almost all electricity generation. It is then not surprising that imbalances in access to modern energy services also exist. Twenty-four hour electricity is not common on all inhabited islands. Many outer island households still greatly depend on biomass, including fuelwood, for cooking energy. Yet due to depleting biomass resources and restrictions on its use, they are increasingly switching to kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas. Cost of electricity and modern fuels, quality of services and supply constraints, however, are burdensome on poor households, especially on remote islands and atolls. In addition, the geographic vulnerability of the low lying country of small islands was truly exposed during the 2004 tsunami. The Government of Maldives has also identified vulnerability to climate change and sea level rise as a serious concern to the future of the nation. This study examines critical energy issues in the Maldives, including the institutional structure of the energy sector, policy and regulatory framework, and sectoral programmes. It analyses reasons for the limited reach of energy services to rural provinces; unsustainable dependence on traditional fuels and inefficient technologies; the restricted supply of energy by rural energy enterprises; and inadequate financing for energy. Gender concerns are examined in rural energy projects and programmes. It highlights the urgent need for key data and indicators to support monitoring and evaluation of energy access for areas that are least served. PREFACE viii Energy and Poverty in the Maldives This report concludes that the lack of coordination and limited capacities spanning the entire energy sector in the Maldives are major constraints to the creation of a comprehensive pro-poor energy strategy. Public-private partnerships, in addition to other capacity-building interventions can improve energy delivery, promote decentralized economic development and encourage development of cost-effective renewable energy solutions in the Maldives. Private entrepreneurs and Island Development Committees with experiences in modern energy and improved technical capacities can be better suited for developing renewable and non-renewable energy systems on the islands, especially on isolated small islands where demand for energy services is limited. Improved capacities of the government entities can enable strategy formulation that promotes the provision of energy access to the poor. Policies that enable fair market competition with existing monopolies should be formulated and implemented, and incentives should be developed for the private sector to venture into the energy provision business in the rural areas. Promising energy initiatives can and do exist in the Maldives. For instance, the Renewable Energy Technology Development and Application Project (RETDAP) seeks to enhance capacities for renewable energy technologies and related income generation at the island level. RETDAP has succeeded in addressing several gaps in energy access, but sustained resource mobilization to set up capital-intensive physical infrastructure for renewable energy projects is needed. Also, conducting renewable energy resource surveys in selected areas and assessing technical requirements is important in the long run. Equally important are continued efforts to increase the awareness of renewable energy, its applications, potential, and success stories, and to promote energy-based entrepreneurship, which can be supported by feasibility studies and energy data. The Information Exchange Service that was set up under the RETDAP could be replicated elsewhere and expanded from just including renewable energy information to covering the entire energy sector, particularly the electricity sub-sector. The study recommends that a national level coordination mechanism be developed that oversees decentralized energy programmes with livelihood components and island-level, pro-poor energy initiatives. Several assessments of capacity-building needs that reach independent power producers and even the most rural communities can ix Energy and Poverty in the Maldives be conducted. Such initiatives could also build on the experience of RETDAP or other similar efforts. There are several lessons that can be learned from this type of project, and they can serve the up scaling of this potentially successful initiative. The efforts could also be expanded through partnering with existing livelihood programmes to enhance resource mobilization, and through widening the coverage of RETDAP to include productive use of renewable energy projects in other outer islands. Stringent funding conditions for renewable energy projects and financial capacities of entrepreneurs and energy consumers in rural communities need to be assessed and addressed.

The institutional re-structuring of the energy sector is already proving beneficial to some extent in terms of improvements in coordination and regulatory frameworks. The establishment of MEEW and MEA, and formulation of the draft Sustainable Energy Plan of 2004 and the draft National Energy Policy (NEP) of 2005 are important steps toward a strengthened framework for the energy sector. The Government of Maldives aims to expand the share of renewable energy in total energy generation to 12 percent by 2015. These government-supported activities must be complemented, however, with equally strong efforts towards the goal of improved energy access for poverty reduction as a way to correct socio-economic imbalances. Thus, consideration must be given to current policies and regulations on energy generation and imports, as well as to an implementation plan for the NEP. Equally important is providing poor households with access to alternative sources of affordable modern fuels and efficient energy technology. Well-targeted pro-poor subsidy and tax policies are therefore imperative. Such policies can have a major impact on the capital costs for rural grid electrification and the development of off-grid solutions \u2013 such as improved cooking stoves, biomass gasifiers and other such technologies. These must be complemented by a reform of electricity tariffs directed at poor households, and increased and improved schemes for the provision of micro-finance for micro-scale enterprises and different income-generating activities. We trust that the report is unique in terms of its insights into the current functioning of the energy sector and into the options that bridge the gaps between access to energy and poverty reduction in the Maldives. x Energy and Poverty in the Maldives Our aim is to provide country specific information on institutional structures, energy resources, policy recommendations, and capacity and financial gaps that can point the way towards improving access to modern energy services, particularly for the poor.

The country is spread over 859,000 square kilometres (including the sea within territorial waters). Compared to landlocked countries in the region, the Maldives faces unique development challenges due to vast distances that separate its 337,000 people (UNFPA 2006).

The country has achieved literacy rates of over 97 percent for both men and women. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)- funded Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment, carried out from mid to late 2004, placed the poverty level of the Maldives at 21 percent. These indicators, however, do not reflect the skewed nature of development in the Maldives. Income disparities are rising between the urban and outer atolls (Figure 1) and 28 percent of the rural atoll population subsists on less than US$1 a day, as compared to only 3 percent of the urban population (MPND 2004).

However, the tsunami of 26 December 2004 showed how vulnerable small island states are, and it was reported that the Maldives was one of the worst affected countries on a per capita basis. The tsunami affected livelihoods of one third of the population in the Maldives, and total damage was estimated to be US$470 million, equal to 62 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) (WB-ADB-UN 2005). The tsunami also drew attention to and exacerbated other problems that were already in existence. A reflection of the situation in the Maldives is captured in the Human Development Index (HDI), on which the country scored 0.739 in 2004, ranking 98th out of 177 countries (UNDP 2006). Currently, the Maldives is recovering from the devastating effects of the tsunami and regaining development momentum. Despite progress, the Maldives remains vulnerable to external environmental threats such as climate change (MEEW 2007). Sea level rise, one of the most significant effects of climate change, is among the immediate environmental concerns in the Maldives, considering over 80 percent of its land area is less than one meter above sea level. Further impact of climate change would reduce access to drinking water, negatively affect the health of the population and pose a real threat to food security. The Maldives is heavily dependent on energy imports, especially within the electricity and transport sectors. Electricity consumption has increased significantly from 42 million kWh in 1992 to over 97 million kWh Source MPND (2004) 3 BACKGROUND Energy and Poverty in the Maldives in 2004 (NEP 2005). Even for domestic purposes, due to depletion of wood resources and regulations on its use, more households rely on kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking than on biomass. The country is, therefore, vulnerable to the vagaries of international energy prices and supply. The Oil Price Vulnerability Index (OPVI), developed by the Regional Energy Programme in UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok, ranks the Maldives the most vulnerable amongst 24 countries in Asia and the Pacific. The Maldives is a high-OPVI country because of its highly negative balance of payments and budget balance positions as well as its high import dependence (UNDP 2007). It is therefore inevitable that a gradual shift from the fossil fuel based energy system to an environmentally-friendly, renewable or alternative fuel based energy system that uses energy efficient (EE) technologies will take place in the public transport and industrial sectors. The country has recognized the potential of solar, wind and modern biomass resources for meeting energy supply in a sustainable manner. The 6th National Development Plan (NDP) stresses the importance of adopting a sustainable energy policy for the country. The formulation of the draft NEP of June 2005 has been an important initiative undertaken by the Government and it can be used as a guideline for future energy sector development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aea425f1-7311-4661-8dd5-82c4da128087": {"__data__": {"id_": "aea425f1-7311-4661-8dd5-82c4da128087", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Maldives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "635326226e89e8ab043cc62ac7821386e964d676a603dc39bd0a799936559bd8"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca5cdf11-3ded-4dfc-9eff-e7b432e2279d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72d9cbead7f34e76db98aefea741f1e314bc9c84b557023c671418667f302bcf"}}, "hash": "900d30b2a73be97068773937ffc65313bbc5b5ed931d64a4a2f9bd42f02d3ab9", "text": "A framework for energy policy and an institutional re-structuring of the energy sector is envisaged within the overall development policies.

The Government has proposed the following strategies to explore possible sustainable sources of energy for power generation and desalination: (1) strengthen policy-making and regulatory bodies in the energy sector and formulate an energy policy; (2) train technical personnel at all levels of the energy sector, especially at the atoll level; and (3) conduct an awareness campaign regarding fuel consumption and sustainable use of energy sources. 4 THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives THE CHALLENGES F Although targets have been established, their implementation has been constrained by a number of factors. These challenges underscore the inadequacies that prevent provision of equitable access to modern energy services throughout the country. Poor institutional synergies and limited partnerships or a long time in the Maldives, energy issues traversed multiple ministries leading to isolated interventions within the mandated sectors of each respective ministry. In 2005, the Ministry of Communication, Science and Technology (MCST) was restructured into the Ministry of Energy, Environment and Water (MEEW), gaining a better focus on the energy sector and also on the inter-linkages between energy, the environment and water. Furthermore, the Maldives Energy Authority (MEA) was established in April 2006, which was followed by the abolishment of the former Maldives Electricity Bureau (MEB). MEA functions under MEEW (GoM 2006), forming a new regulatory body with a broader mandate for increased effectiveness of energy interventions. While MEEW still formulates energy policies, the regulation of the energy sector falls under the purview of the MEA (MEEW 2007). MEEW promotes energy conservation and efficiency in production and usage and also strives to reduce the dependence on imported fossil fuels (see Figure 2). While the establishment of MEEW has, to some extent, led to the convergence of various players in the energy sector, there is an obvious lack of adequate capacities for developing specific interventions that incorporate poverty reduction. The proposed priorities of the Government and energy institutions lean more towards the creation of uniform regulatory frameworks and the reduction of import dependency than towards the goal of harmonizing strategies concerning energy with poverty reduction in order to correct socio-economic imbalances. That said, there are a number of major institutions in the Maldives whose current or potential work links poverty and energy (Table 1). In the largely centralized institutional structure of the Maldives, there is limited participation by private business, bilateral/multilateral agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the energy sector. In the private sector, while the exact number of independent power products (IPPs) is unknown, most are small family-run businesses that generate power for self-consumption or for their communities. Bilateral and multilateral agencies have many programmes in the rural islands of the Maldives, but they have had moderate impact in terms of In the energy sector, there is an obvious lack of adequate capacities for developing specific interventions that incorporate poverty reduction. 5 THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives FIGURE 2 INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MALDIVES\u2019 ENERGY SECTOR coordination across them. Since NGOs are not actively involved in the energy sector, the potential to reduce poverty through their non governmental expertise and capacities is not realized. At the decentralized level, energy supply and development functions are integrated into the wider social and economic mandate of the Atoll Development Committees (ADCs), Island Development Committees (IDCs), and Women Development Committees (WDCs). Central funds are routed through local institutions for expansion and development of energy services. The IDCs, however, play an important role as suppliers of electricity to islands not covered by the State Electric Company (STELCO) systems. STELCO provides electricity services directly to consumers and industries in Mal\u00e9 and provides 24 hours of electricity to 24 of the 199 inhabited islands. IDCs, community and private providers generate and supply electric power in the rest of the islands. Therefore, the majority of Maldivians have access to electric power from some source. The total installed power generation in the country is 106.2 MW, much of which operates in the resort islands (48.3 percent). That of the outer islands, controlled by the IDCs and some private producers, accounts for 13.2 percent of the total power generation capacity. About 33 percent of the overall electricity generation in the country is through STELCO.

Since it also has the duties of regulating the environment and water sectors, MEEW is in a better position to harmonize the country\u2019s energy priorities with its sustainable development goals. The Ministry has also been able to resolve institutional conflicts between different stakeholders to a great extent. Further, policies such as those formulated in the 6th NDP (2001-2005), the draft Sustainable Energy Plan (SEP) of June 2004, and the draft NEP of 2005 have been introduced to harness sub-sectoral linkages and enable programme coordination in the energy sector. The SEP study was undertaken by the former MCST with support from United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). This national study was undertaken in consultations with all the stakeholders and players in the energy sector (UNESCAP 2004). The SEP sets targets for increased renewable energy capacity. It also proposes the formulation of Transport Energy Policy; to develop and implement programmes to make available energy resources to all the inhabited islands by 2008; and to reduce GHG emissions through the increased use of alternative energy and renewable energy technologies (RETs) (SEP 2004).

BOX 1: KEY CHALLENGES IN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 8 THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives participatory process was initiated as part of the formulation process of the draft NEP between the Government, other stakeholders and relevant groups in order to incorporate views of market actors and energy consumers for addressing the complex nature of the energy sector. The NEP sets a target of 12 percent for the share of renewable energy in the energy mix to be achieved by 2015 (NEP 2005). In the Maldives, the energy tariff structure is normally determined through a process in which the local bodies recommend a price that is then approved by the regulatory body, ensuring that the price is not above a set ceiling. These are then implemented by the local bodies with minor adaptations. Electricity pricing is a little more diffused, since the IDCs determine local electricity rates.

Little attention is given to promoting renewable energy for enabling decentralized access to remote islands in order to meet energy needs. Although they incorporate reduced dependency on imported fuel by exploring sustainable energy sources in the country, most RET programmes have not advanced beyond the pilot stage. Few initiatives seek to enhance decentralized capacities for income generation and sustainable development (Table 2).

BOX 3: KEY CHALLENGES IN ESTABLISHING ENERGY PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK WITH FOCUS ON POVERTY 11 THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives FIGURE 3 DISPARITY IN ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL SOURCES OF ENERGY Source NEP (2005) requirements. The utilization of biomass was approximately 4,626 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) according to the Maldives energy balance in 2002 (ECN 2004), which makes up 24 percent of the accessible biomass resources (NEP 2005). However, biomass (shrub and coconut husks) use is under threat due to rapid deforestation in the outer islands. Communities are, therefore, switching to LPG, but its cost and uncertainty of supply, which is dependent on an inefficient inter-island transport network, are hampering the switchover. In 2005, consumption of biomass had reduced to 2,763 toe (ECN 2007). Almost all households have some access to electricity: 197 of the 199 inhabited islands receive electricity for at least five hours a day, and 82 islands have 24-hour access (ECN 2004). Great disparities exist in terms of affordability, availability and quality of services between the urban areas of Mal\u00e9 and Villingili and the rural outer islands. Diesel in particular dominates the fuel market, accounting for more than 80 percent of total primary energy demand and almost all electricity generation. The reliance on imported diesel for economic activity has placed a considerable burden on the country. Besides, it inhibits income generation and growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the outer islands, which do not have direct access to imported diesel and must purchase it from resellers at a huge mark-up. The reliance on imported diesel for economic activity has placed a considerable burden on the country. 12 THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives Coordination and partnerships, or lack thereof, among different stakeholders and institutions at different levels are closely linked to capacity issues. Technical and managerial capacities in energy transmission and distribution are mainly confined to STELCO, as well as to some private power producers servicing resorts. Limited trained staff members and technical expertise in system operation, repair and maintenance have influenced the performance of private producers. Private producers experience high distribution losses (24 percent) as compared to STELCO (13 percent), which has higher capacities (NEP 2005). At the same time, STELCO is reported to be in financial loss in operating electricity systems in a number of islands due to the prevailing high price of imported fuels and its transportation costs as well as relatively high administrative costs for maintaining increasing staff in the islands. Improved decentralized capacities are needed for enhanced income generation and sustainable development. It has not been possible to widely adopt renewable energy sources in both urban and rural areas, and the use of solar dryers, solar cookers and wind generators has been undertaken only on a pilot project basis. The Government has sought to increase the pace of renewable energy adoption by considering the introduction of a Renewable Energy Portfolio (REP), which would devise strategies to increase the share of renewable energy in the total energy generation to 12 percent by 2015 (NEP 2005). Limited energy entrepreneurship In the Maldives, poverty has not been reduced significantly through livelihood enhancement activities. One of the reasons could be the Private producers experience high distribution losses (24 percent) as compared to STELCO (13 percent). \u25a0 Because all major ports handling fuel imports are concentrated around Mal\u00e9, and inter-island transport networks are inefficient and expensive, the outer islands lack direct access to imported fuel. \u25a0 Most IDC-supplied islands do not receive 24-hour electricity supply, because most local producers lack adequate technical capacities to maintain and operate 24-hour power plants. \u25a0 Lack of awareness about renewable energy and its applications, potential and success stories, prevent its wider adoption. \u25a0 The assistance provided for renewable energy projects covers a small proportion of the costs.

BOX 5: KEY CHALLENGES IN DRIVING ENERGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP 14 THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives TABLE 3 SOURCES OF FINANCE FOR RURAL ENERGY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT against loans and lack of high-return investment opportunities in the outer islands obstruct greater development of the rural energy sector. However, the Government has sought to fill the gap by providing a range of financial mechanisms to develop outer island economies (Table 3). Government-supported microfinance mechanisms such as the Atoll Development Fund (ADF) and Revolving Electricity Fund (REF) have emerged as viable alternative sources of funds to enhance rural energy entrepreneurship and access to energy services. However, effectiveness of the national-level REF has been reduced by a short repayment period and limited credit ceilings. Microfinance for renewable energy development is planned through RETDAP, although the allocated funds are not sufficient to meet the initial hardware costs of most renewable energy systems. Moreover, government sources of finance in the energy sector, such as subsidies and grants, have been slow to reach the disadvantaged groups, especially women.

BOX 7: KEY CHALLENGES IN PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY 16 THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives Dispersed and weak information sharing system The most common form of knowledge sharing and transfer at the national level is through training workshops, seminars and periodic interactions. In addition, research reports conducted by various agencies are available on the Internet. However, at the island and community levels, demonstrations, exhibitions and audio-visual presentations are mostly lacking. Moreover, there is limited public access to studies, and information on assessments related to energy is often not fully documented and disseminated. Centralized and weak monitoring and evaluation system Monitoring of poverty in general, and the impacts of energy services on poverty reduction in particular, have not received due attention. Indicators demonstrating links between poverty and energy services have not yet evolved, though data on disparities in terms of access, affordability and availability of energy services could serve this purpose. This would also help define national priorities in the energy sector. Limited capacities for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) also constrain efforts to implement the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. \u25a0 Annual reports, yearbooks and energy balance reports are the main accessible energy information sources in the Maldives. \u25a0 MEEW has made limited progress in extending access to information on renewable energy. \u25a0 Deficient information in the electricity sub-sector prevents accurate assessment of the country\u2019s energy sector. \u25a0 The electricity generation and distribution information of STELCO is confined to the organization, and private power producers do not readily share such information. BOX 8: KEY CHALLENGES IN INFORMATION SHARING RELATED TO ENERGY AND POVERTY \u25a0 With current M&E procedures concentrated at the central level, decentralized institutions are restricted to completing assessment forms and questionnaires, resulting in a loss of information on the impacts of energy services on poverty, which can be evaluated more effectively at the decentralized level. \u25a0 Energy institutions do not have sufficient M&E capacities to develop a sound M&E system, however, the aim of RETDAP is to build substantial M&E capacities at the national and local levels. BOX 9: KEY CHALLENGES IN STRENGTHENING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM 17 THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives MEETING THE CHALLENGES I Improved coordination, capacities and partnerships for poverty reduction mproved coordination between relevant government agencies and their energy-related development interventions, as well as improved capacities to formulate strategies could significantly enhance the provision of energy access for the poor. It would be desirable to further support MEEW as the nodal agency. Enhancing the capacities of government entities to enable the provision of energy services for the poor, create opportunities for poverty reduction, and improve the coordination of all energy-related policies and programmes of different ministries is desirable. Appropriate further support could be extended in the form of relevant training. The capacity needs of MEEW could be assessed as well as that of other relevant ministries and local government units on energy policy and strategy, information gathering, processing, analysis and management, programme development and implementation, and M&E, which would then be followed by capacity development activities. MEEW could also conduct a review of energy-related socio-economic development programmes of various ministries exploring possible duplications, complementarities and synergies. The aim could be to formulate an integrated action plan that will coordinate and synchronize efforts of relevant ministries towards improving or providing access to energy services for the poor. Improvements in the provision of energy services for poverty reduction also necessitate the development of partnerships between public utilities and private entrepreneurs. The current operational status of STELCO, private sector and IDC/community managed power stations reveals that there are both technical and managerial problems, which could be addressed through joint collaboration and partnership between the public and private sectors in a \u2018business-like\u2019 approach. This would improve energy delivery and promote decentralized economic development. To enhance this, STELCO could transfer some of its distribution and generation capacities to private sectors and local entrepreneurs (distributors only), and in so doing reduce its financial liabilities. Additionally, existing IDCs could be converted into cooperatives, and partnerships between resort owners could be promoted on the mutually beneficial energy projects in outer islands, as part of meeting their corporate social responsibilities. It is also desirable to promote a level playing field for NGOs and IDCs in the financing, implementation and operation of energy projects as a way to harness MEEW could also conduct a review", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "036c48c4-fc79-487d-bdf2-69a679fd5824": {"__data__": {"id_": "036c48c4-fc79-487d-bdf2-69a679fd5824", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Maldives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d2355cac047b199e74942173ee7642dc8922654cdfc181e461d9d1621547b3d"}}, "hash": "5d2355cac047b199e74942173ee7642dc8922654cdfc181e461d9d1621547b3d", "text": "of energy-related socio- economic development programmes of various ministries. 18 Energy and Poverty in the Maldives MEETING THE CHALLENGES their capacities. Furthermore, such public-private partnerships need to be encouraged in developing cost-effective renewable energy solutions through putting clear policy environments in place. It would also be beneficial to identify and analyse the root causes and effects of the lack of private sector participation in the provision of rural energy services, as well as in the provision of energy projects that are specifically aimed at providing energy access to the poor. Also realistic and achievable objectives should be set to address the root causes and effects of limited private sector participation. For developing such partnerships, MEEW, the Ministry of Atolls Development (MOAD), the Ministry of Tourism (MT), and the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MFT) can together find a mechanism to provide guidance and technical expertise to private entrepreneurs in the energy sector and create an enabling environment for fair market competition with existing monopolies. MEEW could also facilitate the utilization of capacities of various national and international stakeholders. Enhancement of capacities would also entail significant investments in R&D, infrastructure and human resources. In this context, the Government and its international partners should consider budgetary support for institutions such as the Environment Research Centre and the Faculty of Engineering Technology, which could be made certified centres for capacity-building on energy and poverty and training of private entrepreneurs. Policy and regulatory framework oriented towards lower income groups Regulatory framework, policy guidelines and other incentives, including credit facilities for investment in the energy sector, need to be enhanced to provide a suitable environment for partnerships and to contribute to socio-economic development, in general, and poverty reduction and livelihood support, in particular. To enhance the provision of energy services for poverty reduction of communities in remote islands, the Government should review current policies and regulations on energy imports/ generation, supply and distribution; assess root causes and effects of the weak regulatory process; and come up with feasible interventions to address these causes and mitigate the effects. Based on the findings, the Government could formulate a comprehensive policy and regulatory framework that sufficiently includes rural energy and renewable energy sectors. Policy support activities should also be developed that will ensure strengthened policy-making and implementation processes. For example, an implementation plan for the NEP (including implementation Public-private partnerships need to be encouraged in developing cost-effective renewable energy solutions through putting clear policy environments in place. 19 MEETING THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives rules and regulations) to ensure proper policy enforcement, M&E and feedback should be formulated. Providing energy to the lower income groups to reduce poverty involves two key issues: access and affordability. It is, therefore, imperative to review the existing tariff policy (including the guidelines for tariff-setting) with a firm focus on the lower income groups and the deprived communities. MEEW could possibly establish tariff-setting and tariff-monitoring guidelines through MEA. The draft NEP should provide appropriate bearing on the basis of its policy guidelines on expediting energy options and financial in- centives for low-income households. Socio-economic development and poverty reduction policies that enable fair market competition with existing monopolies should be encouraged and implemented as well as incentives for the private sector to venture into the energy provision business in rural areas. The private sector can be encouraged to bid for the competitive energy market and support should be given for joint partnership between STELCO and IPPs. More specifically, the established regulations should define the relationship between the IPPs and STELCO. By reviewing and assessing the existing mandates, policies and implementation arrangements in the area of energy (electricity and petroleum) generation, supply and distribution, the Government could come up with feasible alternative options. An evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of feasible options could result in firm recommendations. For example, assessment could lead to the transference of electricity distribution responsibilities of STELCO to private sector and local institutions. Furthermore, financial, technical, logistical and management requirements for the various feasible options should be identified, as well as potential private sector entities, and national and local government agencies that can adequately and satisfactorily comply with the decentralization of energy generation/importation, supply and distribution. The Government also needs to create more awareness and establish more efforts to encourage IDCs to start cooperatives. This would strengthen capacities in energy services both for consumptive and productive purposes, especially for the communities in the outer islands. Perhaps MOAD, the Ministry of Justice, MT and other ministries overseeing the cooperatives could monitor proposed laws.

To incorporate the concerns of the deprived and remote communities, policies must push for a rapid development of renewable energy sources and indigenous resource development. In this context, the Renewable Energy Action Plan (REAP) should be integrated with the draft NEP. In The established regulations should define the relationship between the IPPs and STELCO. 20 Energy and Poverty in the Maldives MEETING THE CHALLENGES other words, the benefits of renewable energy and RETs should be promoted widely to national and local government agencies and private entities. Policies to encourage public-private partnerships in the area of renewable energy should be integrated into the national and local development policies and plans. National and local governments should endorse and support a financial plan for the renewable energy development and utilization plan, as well as a suitable implementation framework (including M&E) for the renewable energy development and utilization plan. After evaluation of the plans, new or revised policies to suit evolving requirements and necessary improvements could be recommended. Enabling energy programme framework A mechanism to mainstream poverty concerns through energy interventions may evolve. One of the major inputs to addressing the poverty concerns of the deprived communities in remote islands is the provisioning of decentralized energy programmes with livelihood components. More attention should be given also to promoting renewable energy for enabling remote islands to meet their energy needs. Potential scope of energy projects that are, among other goals, meant to support socio-economic development and livelihood support activities of rural people in the outer islands should be assessed. These types of projects (using renewable and/or non-renewable resources) should be identified and given priority based on best available and most feasible technologies, and economic and financial viability. Once the plans are made, however, enhanced resource mobilization to set up capital- intensive physical infrastructure for renewable energy projects is needed. Identified energy projects should be promoted to potential funders (bilateral and multilateral), including local banking/financing institutions and the private sector, as a comprehensive package and not just stand alone pilots. Existing livelihood programmes could facilitate deployment of funds towards renewable energy projects as well. Adequate evaluation may be carried out to ensure sustainability and effective utilization of funds. This would enable the mobilization of greater resources than currently allocated, for instance to RETDAP (RETDAP 2004). RETDAP could facilitate provision of all solar energy-based fish dryers and provide low-cost energy equipment. It could also collaborate with tsunami relief operations, which already have a livelihood component (UNDP 2005). Decentralized energy programmes are important in addressing the poverty concerns of the deprived communities in remote islands. 21 MEETING THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives Increased support of energy programmes for R&D and documentation of key pilot projects and prior experiments could be developed with the activities carried out under RETDAP or similar projects that deal with renewable energy resource assessments and assessments of technical and logistical requirements of feasible RET applications. Annual monitoring of renewable and non-renewable energy projects in the country and documentation of each project\u2019s profile, performance and results would be important, as well as information dissemination of materials on the monitored energy projects and information exchange on other applicable projects implemented elsewhere. It would be beneficial if energy programmes included conducting continuous renewable energy resource (wind, solar, biomass and landfill gas) surveys in their activities in selected areas in the country where there are renewable energy resource potentials. The programmes could assess the technical requirements for wind and solar technology applications (e.g., measurements of wind velocities and solar radiation intensities) and for other relevant RET applications. Facilitating access to energy Limited financial resources, shortage of energy supplies, expensive and unreliable transportation of fuels, lack of technical capacities and limited awareness of renewable energy and EE technologies are the key issues to be addressed while aiming to enable equal access to energy. To counter energy supply shortages, especially in remote islands, suitable provisions could perhaps be made to encourage block storage at the atoll level. As for issues related to the transportation of fuels to outer islands, forging public-private partnerships in the fossil fuel supply chain could be the way out. As discussed, it would be desirable to open up the market for the import of fuels through the private sector route. Therefore, direct import by the private sector of commercial energy forms (e.g. remove STO monopoly on petroleum fuel imports) can be assessed. The promotion of feasible alternative energy technologies (e.g., RETs, EE appliances) for households and small industries is also important, because, as mentioned earlier, poverty levels are high in the outer islands", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b4a816f-f4ef-4b7b-a6b9-4dd96c027b46": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b4a816f-f4ef-4b7b-a6b9-4dd96c027b46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Maldives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aef43a956e47685e6465c108fd7e4e8a06527050ad5c0398edcaceff6c755a39"}}, "hash": "aef43a956e47685e6465c108fd7e4e8a06527050ad5c0398edcaceff6c755a39", "text": "where biomass is the main source of energy. These areas would benefit from greater use of improved biomass technology, such as improved cook stoves and gasifiers, in terms of energy efficiency and reduction of indoor air pollution, including carbon dioxide emissions, resulting in improved health conditions. To promote decentralized access for the poor and deprived sections of the community, a donor fund could be mobilized to 22 Energy and Poverty in the Maldives MEETING THE CHALLENGES support the Government\u2019s initiatives. Enabling access to energy for the poor might mean that donor support should be utilized in a manner that also ensures financing of the hardware costs of renewable energy systems and EE appliances. The Fund for Renewable Energy System Application (FRESA) could be expanded to cover financing for the purchase of EE appliances. To further enhance awareness on renewable energy, the information dissemination programmes initiated under RETDAP, or under other projects with similar aims, could be continued and expanded to include awareness-raising in the widespread practice of the efficient and effective use of commercial energy forms. Private entrepreneurs and IDCs with experience in modern/renewable energy and enhanced technical capacities could be better suited for developing renewable energy and non- renewable energy systems in the islands, especially in isolated small islands where demand for energy services is limited. As discussed, through public-private partnerships, some of the STELCO managed electricity systems could be transferred to the private sector and to improve the energy efficiency thereby generating electricity in a profitable manner. Private sector companies or energy service companies (ESCOs) could play important roles in energy production and distribution and should be encouraged to serve as IPPs for conventional, modern and renewable energy systems. However, at present, STELCO dominates in the electricity generation market, as well as in technical know-how, therefore, improving technical capacities of the rural entrepreneurs in electricity generation is crucial for achieving increased efficiency in the energy sector. To improve capacities to manage rural energy and also enhance building of frameworks for incorporating modern/renewable energy sources, several assessments could be conducted: (1) an assessment of the specific capacity development needs of rural communities in the provision of energy services; (2) an assessment of the potential scope of application of modern/renewable energy sources in existing rural energy infrastructures; (3) an assessment of the financial, technical, logistical and operational requirements of potential applications and how these will be provided and supported; and (4) an assessment of how the potential applications can support socio-economic development and livelihood activities of rural people in the outer islands. With the results of these assessments, private entrepreneurs and IDCs working in rural communities could then be provided the necessary and appropriate capacity-building to enable them to operate and maintain improved energy systems that employ modern/renewable energy sources and also given capacity-building on the wise and proper use of energy to operate productive activities. Private entrepreneurs and IDCs could be better suited for developing renewable energy and non-renewable energy in isolated small islands. 23 MEETING THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives Driving entrepreneurship Acknowledging the current energy scenario, the nation\u2019s policy makers are committed to enabling a thriving industry on the generation and distribution of energy services. These commitments are visible in policies such as the recently expired 6th NDP (2001-2005) and the Regional Development Plan. The latter aims to create industrial growth centres outside the Mal\u00e9 region with a focus on energy-based income generation activities. A driving force for reducing poverty and fostering economic development can be created through the integration of SMEs in energy programmes. As such, partnerships should be encouraged and efforts should be directed at developing a fair and competitive market. Eventually, this market could replace or complement monopolies such as STELCO and STO. The Government could also benefit from this on account of restrictions in the scope of subsidies and grants. To enable the formation of such a dynamic market, it is necessary to have a comprehensive National Policy and Action Plan aimed at market liberalization for fair and free competition. Enhancement of capacities for energy entrepreneurship calls for stronger partnerships with centres of excellence within and outside the country. As a first step, the Government could introduce training programmes at the national, atoll and island levels. The Environment Research Centre and the Faculty of Engineering Technology could be the certified trainers for issues related to energy, poverty and policy. The Faculty of Engineering Technology has been addressing this need by conducting a series of short-term and mobile courses for technicians, operators, and other staff. At the local level, IDCs and ADCs need to integrate energy issues into their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50d2a50a-49cb-4138-9bd9-d67372d5c9c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "50d2a50a-49cb-4138-9bd9-d67372d5c9c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Maldives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04be062088515d4c03c76b1005910e52ce7ac1c6ea0b89fc9d233965d3f5bda9"}}, "hash": "04be062088515d4c03c76b1005910e52ce7ac1c6ea0b89fc9d233965d3f5bda9", "text": "short-term training courses on community development, credit management and micro-enterprise development in collaboration with WDCs and NGOs. As part of the support framework, a provision of capacity-building in the marketing of rural products and a creation of market for rural products could be included and implemented. In order to design and conduct appropriate and advanced capacity development programs for energy entrepreneurs in the operation and maintenance of power generation and distribution systems, an assessment of the actual capacities of IPPs in operating and maintaining power (renewable energy-based and/or non-renewable energy-based) generation units and distribution systems should be conducted. Also, an assessment of the operating performance of all power generation units and distribution systems in the country could be very useful. Additionally, identification of feasible measures to improve the performance (e.g., heat rates, load factor, availability) of existing power generation units, as well as the An assessment of the actual capacities of the IPPs in operating and maintaining power generation units and distribution systems could be conducted. 24 Energy and Poverty in the Maldives MEETING THE CHALLENGES performance of the distribution systems (e.g., reduction of technical and non-technical losses) would be beneficial. In general, improved energy data would encourage energy-based entrepreneurship. Furthermore, a programme that would engage the local IPPs and IDCs that have relatively good performance in the operation of power generation systems as a way to assist other IPPs and IDCs in the country should be developed. Programmes for improving power generation performance and reducing loss in distribution systems in the outer islands could be conducted. Facilitating access to finance Finance is critical to bridging the gap between energy and poverty. As noted earlier, at the macrolevel, international donor agencies that can provide support to local banks for energy financing need to be identified, because tapping international funding agencies for REF would be necessary. Also, setting up a fund to support government subsidies for the poor could be considered. These resources need to be more responsive to the local energy and development needs. Strategies may be evolved for effective utilization of these resources for implementation of renewable energy projects. Local banks need assistance in discussing, negotiating and establishing funding for local energy project financing. Efforts similar to the RETDAP that promote the benefits of renewable energy and RETs in meeting socio-economic development goals in all areas of the Maldives should be expanded for greater coverage. For example, the coverage of FRESA could be expanded to productive use of renewable energy projects in other outer islands. The impacts of the existing policy recommendations on financing of renewable energy projects under RETDAP could be reviewed, as could the existing banking/ financing policies regarding the projects that they support. Also, information concerning the benefits and financial viability of RET applications for the provision of rural energy services should be extended to both government and private sectors, including banks and financial institutions. At the microlevel, it is important to consider innovative financing modalities such as micro-credit without collateral but through instruments like group guarantees and WDCs. In this context, a review of the performance of the RETDAP-established FRESA is also important. Based on its performance, FRESA could be either modified or expanded. Another option is to develop a separate, sustainable financing scheme that is based on affordability. Resources need to be more responsive to the local energy and development needs. 25 MEETING THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives A study of various options for financing decentralized energy projects (renewable energy-based in particular) could be conducted, including the potential financing entity for each, and a mechanism (including implementing rules and regulations, considering the requirements of the selected funding entity) could be developed for the most feasible, affordable and accessible scheme. Formulation of policies regarding financial incentives that can be potentially provided to support renewable energy projects could be therefore based on, among other factors, the existing RETDAP recommendations and performance evaluation of the FRESA. Also, regulatory policies concerning the provision of rural energy services should be developed and implemented. An assessment of the financial capacity of entrepreneurs and energy consumers in rural communities and the loan/financing requirements of local banks should be conducted. This would help designing of financing schemes which take into consideration the financial capacities of potential borrowers and requirements of funding organizations. Further, the one-stop-shop financing scheme for energy projects should be scaled up along with other viable financing models. In this context, it would be useful to study and adopt good practices from other countries in the region, such as Bangladesh and Nepal.

The Maldives Monetary Authority and MFT, supported by MEEW, can spearhead and coordinate the process. Tackling gender concerns The 6th NDP (2001-2005) emphasizes gender equality in all socio-economic decision-making processes. This could reduce gender conflicts in areas such as that regarding access to energy where women have generally been at a disadvantage. It would also be desirable to enhance national and local capacities for analysing gender issues as a whole; consolidating disaggregated data; strengthening technical expertise; and assessing energy linkages with health, education and income generation activities at the national, atoll and island levels. There is a need to create more awareness on possibilities for female entrepreneurs and to put emphasis on encouraging women\u2019s entrepreneurship. It would be useful to promote specific gender interventions with the objective of increasing women\u2019s societal roles in productivity related to energy issues. Thus, it is important to promote relevant technologies such as improved cook stoves and solar-energy-run 26 Energy and Poverty in the Maldives MEETING THE CHALLENGES fish dryers which also help reduce respiratory illnesses among women, as well as other specific technologies which help reduce women\u2019s labour and increase their productivity. The primary responsibility to deal with all these issues should lie with the Ministry of Gender and Family, which could collaborate with MOAD, MEEW, UNDP and the United Nations Population Fund to mainstream women\u2019s perspectives on energy. Facilitating access to information Several initiatives could be taken to facilitate faster access to information, especially related to energy and poverty. Formulating and implementing a \u2018right to information\u2019 law could help promote access to government in- formation. MEEW could establish a data collection mechanism and maintain information databases on the Internet related to poverty concerns, energy suppliers and importers, etc. Energy information centres could be set up, preferably at MEEW, and the national library could be encouraged to create an energy section. However, to develop robust systems for facilitating information on energy and poverty and linkages between them, MEEW could extend the experience of a one-stop information shop for all renewable energy information to the entire energy sector, particularly the electricity sub-sector. It should also consider replicating this resource centre elsewhere to generate community enthusiasm and promote participation in renewable energy programmes. With respect to renewable energy information, RETDAP\u2019s initiative has been able to address a few gaps, benefiting communities in remote and outer islands. It has achieved this through conducting a pilot demonstration and publishing awareness material. It would be beneficial to continue the information dissemination programmes and the Information Exchange Service initiated and set up under RETDAP or other efforts with similar aims, with emphasis on the (1) annual monitoring of renewable energy-based energy projects or installations in the country; (2) documentation of the profiles of monitored projects/installations; (3) compilation of information materials on RETs that are applicable and feasible in the country; and (4) preparation and dissemination of abstracts and information notes on relevant articles on RETs. Setting benchmarks for monitoring and evaluation The task of M&E becomes difficult in the absence of appropriate quantitative benchmarks related to energy and poverty and linkages Resources need to be more responsive to the local energy and development needs. 27 MEETING THE CHALLENGES Energy and Poverty in the Maldives T CONCLUSION between them. Thus, it is important to set up a system for primary data collection. For renewable energy, RETDAP could function as the lead in developing the data collection system further. The detailed survey on energy supply and consumption in the Maldives that was carried out under RETDAP for establishing the country\u2019s Energy Balance could be complemented. This could involve the development of an annual energy monitoring and reporting system (EMRS), including support for policy, mechanics, and implementing rules and regulations, and conducting energy monitoring and reporting according to the established system. Other appropriate mechanisms followed in projects funded by international agencies could also be adopted. EMRS data should be regularly collected and data collection processes should be regularly assessed in order to establish reliable sectoral energy supply and consumption data, as well as specific energy consumption, energy demand and energy trends/profiles, and energy forecasts. Also, energy consumption benchmarks could be developed. This data could be disseminated through the Information Center\u2019s Information Exchange Service. The information from EMRS could be then used for national, local and sectoral energy planning. Some specific indicators relating to poverty and energy concerns could be monitored, including the following: \u2022 Number of atoll and remote island-level energy-based enterprises \u2022 Number of decentralized energy providers for remote islands \u2022 Number of schools and health centres in rural areas accessing grid electricity he", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bc12480-1dda-4dc6-b353-12434124c7bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bc12480-1dda-4dc6-b353-12434124c7bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Maldives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-maldives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d073d2dbfc58830a193a8ccf0e41eb6f7d2cc0a6bfd894c51f481bf501747a0c"}}, "hash": "d073d2dbfc58830a193a8ccf0e41eb6f7d2cc0a6bfd894c51f481bf501747a0c", "text": "Maldivian Government\u2019s NDP (2005), the draft NEP of 2005 and current strategies have given high priority to the development of the energy sector.

MEEW is placed in a better position to harmonize the country\u2019s energy agenda with its sustainable development agenda. These initiatives provide for a very strong ground to develop further energy access led development goals. RETDAP and the Atoll Development Project for Sustainable Livelihood, implemented by the Government with UNDP support, have also sought to enhance decentralized capacities for income generation and sustainable development. In spite of these efforts, renewable energy sources have not been adopted widely in both urban and rural areas to meet increasing RETDAP could function as the lead in developing the data collection system further. 28 Energy and Poverty in the Maldives energy needs. The Government has sought to increase the pace of renewable energy adoption by considering the introduction of a REP, which would devise strategies to increase the share of renewables in the total energy generation to 12 percent by 2015 (NEP 2005). To address the issues and challenges related to delivering energy services for poverty reduction, priority should be given to further strengthening the capacity of energy institutions at the national and local levels and their delivery mechanisms. Another area of focus to enhance energy access to the poor necessitates the development of partnerships between public utilities and private entrepreneurs, including removal of barriers to private sector participation. This would improve energy delivery and promote decentralized economic development. Further, such public- private partnerships need to be encouraged in developing cost-effective, decentralized and gender sensitive renewable energy programmes. These will require support for technical assistance as well as increased levels of investment and financing support from the Government, private sector and donor communities.

Access to affordable modern energy services can improve their productivity and enhance living standards. Even so, there are no specific targets for the energy sector in the Millennium Declaration, a historic document signed seven years ago by the world\u2019s leaders. Affordable and sustainable modern energy services are a necessity for countries to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Efforts of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet these aims will be hindered unless adequate attention is given to the crucial role energy services play in the development process. This is particularly true for the economic, environmental and social well-being of the poor. With fluctuating energy prices, the poor in many countries in the Asia and Pacific region face a daunting future. For them, access to affordable and essential modern energy services, which could improve their living conditions and ensure a means to earn a living, will fall outside their reach. Recognizing the urgency for countries to factor in access to modern energy services, particularly when shaping national poverty reduction initiatives, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided technical and financial support for national-level rapid energy assessments. The primary aim of this work, carried out through UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) and completed in 2006, was to identify gaps and priority needs in linking energy services provision with poverty reduction. The framework for rapid gap assessments linking energy and poverty was developed as a joint effort of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) and UNDP country offices in the region, with the support of experts from the region. The draft framework was discussed at two sub-regional meetings, one held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005) and the other in Apia, Samoa (September 2005). The meetings were helpful in customizing the framework to suit specific needs and circumstances of the participating countries. The following 15 countries from the Pacific were involved in the consultative process prior to finalizing the recommendations of the assessment, viz Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua vi Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries New Guinea (PNG), Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. This work benefited immensely from the support of government officials and representatives of civil society. Documented in individual country reports, this work serves as resource and reference material for programming and planning for access to modern energy services for the poor. This document is a summary report on the Pacific Island Countries and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the Country summaries, a Pacific sub-regional synthesis report and a Pacific gender and energy assessment. It summarizes the challenges faced at the national level and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to energy policy, including institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, priority programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support are highlighted.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbba9360-3c48-4743-948c-93aaae974edc": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbba9360-3c48-4743-948c-93aaae974edc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c6ec3fa0564b37d62ebbf66665833e6f64983cb177ed77911f3e0cdf6609dee"}, "2": {"node_id": "b6f2ae15-1073-4550-8d54-f51aad8b5cea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "259a0f2fe11c65b8e816c603361afd13680e65d2fa6647cbdc53e7a4bb4e2e49"}}, "hash": "9373fd2db056e8860c80ed6307ea3220d4f7430e71b3ee225695fa11c877a0b3", "text": "It offers a way forward, outlining issues and options for the country.

The report highlights that access to affordable and sustainable sources of energy has strong linkages with the reduction of poverty/hardship, i.e. if poverty/hardship reduction is an objective, then the provision of energy is an essential prerequisite. In the PICs, where poverty/hardship is often viewed as the lack of access to basic services, opportunities and adequate resources, the case for energy provisioning and access is particularly strong. Provision of essential social services such as health and primary education require energy services. In addition, energy services have positive impacts on gender, the environment and provide an improved quality of life. Furthermore, in many cases the provision of modern energy sources increases the opportunities for income generation. In the context of development, the report stresses the special and demanding situation that confronts the PICs. The issues that typify the energy sector arise substantially from the specific characteristics of island economies and cannot be separated from the wider development challenges that these economies face. PICs have traditionally contended with remoteness and geographical isolation. In the 21st century, they are faced with complex challenges including increasing globalization, the vulnerabilities of being economically peripheral and the threat from climate change. Rising oil prices have added another critical dimension. The PICs are amongst countries that are most vulnerable to increases in oil prices in the Asia-Pacific region. The negative impact of the extremely high exposure to international oil prices faced by PICs (both at the macro and micro level) has become clear over the last few years. The poor are being pushed further into poverty/hardship as a result of this situation. The challenges that these countries face vary in form and intensity across countries; and some of the key challenges are outlined in this report. The most compelling challenge and an area where equitable and efficient access to energy services can make the most difference is poverty/hardship. Poverty and hardship are indisputable issues in PICs for many people, in viii Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries both urban and rural areas and on the outer islands. In this context the report makes a case for special attention to the \u2018Melanesian three\u2019 \u2013 the countries of Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, which dominate the PICs in terms of land, population and in measures of poverty/ hardship. These countries require urgent attention both for their own energy and development needs; and if any significant impact on poverty/ hardship in the Pacific region is to be achieved. Another key challenge is the very limited human and institutional capacities that not only constrain the delivery of energy and related services, but also impede the development of strategic and medium term interventions to address these issues. In addition, the lack of institutions that focus on rural energy access has kept the pace of rural development slow. Dependence on traditional fuels, inefficient technologies and inadequate availability of finance for energy are other key challenges. The report also points out that in most countries energy is not a priority concern and therefore limited national resources and programmes are directed to address energy access issues. It is also clear that there is a blind spot as far as gender issues are concerned, in planning as well as in programme implementation. The critical need for key data and indicators to support proper analysis of issues and problems, monitoring and evaluation of energy access and its impact on areas and groups that are \u2018least served\u2019 are other aspects that merit attention. Limitations in the institutional structure of the energy sector and the policy and regulatory frameworks will also need to be addressed in the coming years. The report points out that what may work for many countries in the rest of the developing world (including Asia) may not be applicable in the PICs, due to constraining factors such as location disadvantages, scattered islands, dispersed populations, high transportation costs and \u2018missing markets\u2019. In addition, the diversity of the region and the specific characteristics and nature of individual PIC precludes the possibility of across-the-board solutions. Nevertheless, a useful starting point is regional and national programmes that investigate energy-poverty linkages in a specific PIC context, as there is a need to establish improved energy services in a manner which impacts positively on poverty/hardship. A key input to addressing poverty concerns is the enhancement of the reach of energy institutions to rural and remote areas.

On the other hand, PICs need to scrutinize and choose only those projects that can benefit them in the long term.

the Pacific region due to its large size and large population, when compared to the other PICs. Development context he Pacific islands region encompasses about a third of the earth\u2019s surface, but less than a thousandth part of the world\u2019s population lives in this vast area, scattered over hundreds of islands. This report focuses on a sub-region of this immense area, consisting of 14 Forum Countries (excluding New Zealand and Australia) and the New Zealand dependency of Tokelau. These entities are in turn divided into three cultural groups: Melanesia \u2013 Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji; Micronesia \u2013 Palau, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Marshall Islands, Nauru", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36fdb9b0-474f-4d90-a423-45f1b63b1080": {"__data__": {"id_": "36fdb9b0-474f-4d90-a423-45f1b63b1080", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publi
