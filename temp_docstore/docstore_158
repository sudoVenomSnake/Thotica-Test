Climate-sensitive planning and management measures are necessary in order for MPAs to continue to meet the conservation objectives for which they were created. This solution centres around the development of a framework which combines climate vulnerability analysis of MPA conservation targets, formulation and implementation of priority adaptation actions (e.g. \u00bbno go zones\u00ab, restoration) and integration of these actions with existing planning tools. This new framework has enabled climate-smart conser- vation in Gorgona National Park in northeast Colombia.

The conservation goals shall be achieved by creating new marine protected areas, expanding existing terrestrial ones and implementing more effective manage- ment and monitoring systems. Despite the great efforts undertaken towards these aims, the country faces enormous challenges in ensuring the sustain- ability of conservation endeavours. Problems such as the lack of administrative tools, ineffective ecological monitoring, a weak system of control and surveillance and a shortage of sustainable finance continue to exert pressure on protected areas. To address these issues and ensure the long-term funding of the programme, SINAC, together with several philanthrop- ic foundations, created the public-private conservation initiative, Forever Costa Rica. This non-profit association aims to complement state and private efforts to preserve biodiversity whilst guaranteeing a source of long-term funding. In coastal areas, Forever Costa Rica assists in the development of proper- ly funded management plans. These provide concrete actions to reduce threats to marine biodiversity, e.g. through improved control and surveil- lance in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) or through marine resource regulations. To date, Forever Costa Rica has contributed US $ 1,600,000 towards the implementation of management plans for fourteen MPAs.

Furthermore, the plan identifies potential risks and difficulties and pro- vides indicators for monitoring and evaluation. 38 39 Mangroves, seagrasses and salt marshes capture atmospheric CO2 and store it. This \u00bbblue\u00ab carbon, found in large quantities in aquatic plants and sediments, is far more effectively stored than in terrestrial forests. The continued loss and degradation of these coastal environments causes the release of carbon back into the atmosphere. Protection and restoration of such coastal ecosystems can provide cost-effective carbon storage relevant for national government policies. These efforts also offer significant benefits to local fisheries and tourism, in addition to other services. However, limited design and implementation guidance is available for blue carbon initiatives that integrate climate mitigation and adaptation actions with improved coastal livelihoods. Working with national and local institutions, this solution addresses these needs through- out the Americas with a cohesive package of scientific research and political advice. A combination of carbon stock inventories, policy dialogue, capacity building and assess- ment of livelihoods, land-use dynamics and historical emissions enables project leaders and practitioners to address local development needs and climate commitments alike. In the Gulf of Nicoya (see also solution on page 48) we successfully integrat- ed our building blocks: local organisations understand the importance of mangrove resources for climate change mitigation and adaptation and are empowered to conserve them.

This provides decision makers with economic terms for mangrove losses. National policy frameworks Government consultations are held to share information, map actors and rally support. Design and implementation of blue car- bon initiatives are facilitated by robust national policies detailing government backing, institutional roles, and alignment of ideas with other policies. Geospatial and emissions modeling Geospatial analysis assesses coastal area land use dynamics over time. Emissions are estimated from the conversion of mangrove forests into other land uses. These are modeled to quantify carbon stocks and natural capital losses over time and to iden- tify suitable areas for restoration. 40 41 In the nearshore waters of the Costa Rican Pacific coast, fishers from the Coyote and Bejuco communities harvest snap- per year-round from small vessels with bottom-longlines and market them domestically. However, the Nicoya Peninsula artisanal snapper fishery is experiencing diminishing returns due to unsustainable and illegal extraction by industrialised shrimp trawlers along with low earnings caused by long chains of custody. Villagers have formed artisanal fishing associations. These mandate local regula- tions and best fishery practices to safeguard coastal community heritage. Pretoma and ARCAE supports these interests by combining a product certification strategy with marine protected area development to create sustainable seafood markets and improve coastal resource governance regimes. Since 2008, we have established 35,000 hectares of multiple-use area Marine Protected Areas prohibiting destructive fishing practices but allowing low impact gear types. We also developed a sustainable snapper marketing strategy, im- plemented Costa Rica\u2019s first artisanal fisheries management plan based on environmental sustainability indicators; and increased the project\u2019s scope to potentially involve all bottom longline snapper fisheries on the Peninsula,\u00ab says Andy Bystrom, ARCAE\u2018s co-founder and Execu- tive Director. At the heart stands the sustainable fishery certification, now in its final assess- ment stage. When approved, this initiative will have produced the first Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified fishery in Central America and the first for snapper globally. This can boost the fishery\u2019s economic development through innovative marke- ting strategies and better its governance through the use of community based management systems. Already there is growing interest in certified snapper and awareness of its economic potential,\u00ab he adds. \u00a9 Erick Lopez, PRETOMA solution certification of artisanal snapper fishery \u00a9 Andy Bystrom, ARCAE Spotted rose snapper (Lutjanus guttatus) \u00bb Initial sale of snappers between fishers and Product C, a gourmet seafood restaurant. \u00bb The solution is being implemented by PRETOMA (Sea Turtle and Shark Restoration Program) and ARCAE, the Costa Rican Envi- ronmental and Educational Network.

Critical conservation gaps have been identified in its buffer zone, which has both high biodi- versity values and high potential for the implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation strategies. If these gaps are not addressed, they can weaken effective management of the entire Refuge. There are limited human and financial resources to abate these threats, causing en- vironmentalists to call for prioritising actions around \u00bbfocal management targets\u00ab. GMWR is a mixed-use protected area and almost entirely privately owned, implying that the effectiveness of conservation depends heavily on the quality of participa- tion processes. Thus, resources have been channelled towards efforts to better link GMWR buffer zone communities and other stakeholders. The combination of technical information and decision making, along with boosting social connectivity among local stakeholders, supports the generation of less vulner- able and better prepared communities in the face of climate change. Interactions among persons and traditions determine the manner in which decisions are taken solution coastal communities combat climate change The work around GMWR confirmed that there is an evident relationship between local communities and protected areas. This is most visible when considering the benefits these areas generate, positively affecting local livelihoods and reducing vulnerability to climate change,\u00ab says Melissa Marin, Technical Officer at IUCN. In costal zones in particular, the management, rational use and efficient conserva- tion of natural resources is highly dependent on whether or not decision-making mechanisms are inclusive, orderly and able to address the social realities of local communities. What communities have to say and how they link up with one an- other can make a real difference.\u00ab \u00a9 IUCN \u00bb \u00bb Ecosystem services are part of an overall strategy in the face of climate change \u00a9 IUCN This solution is being implemented by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC) and the Conservation Area La Amistad-Caribe (ACLAC) in collaboration with Costa Rica\u2019s Marine Protected Areas Consolidation Programme (UNDP and SINAC). Focal management targets Conservation actions in buff- er zones are identified and prioritised using both bio- logical data and social per- ceptions. This process serves as a guide for resource desig- nation while simultaneously integrating local concerns into buffer zone management. Communication and coordination networks Robust and responsive participation strategies consider the quantitative and qualitative analyses of existing communication and coordination networks and propose the means to strengthen and consolidate these relations. This builds social connec- tivity and thus resiliency. Social indicators Local and global indicators, derived from the social role of each actor, are developed. These help identify strengths, weaknesses and gaps in the communication and coor- dination of local networks, both formal and informal. costa rica building blocks Solution components for replication 44 45 The coastal and small scale fishing population in Costa Rica is closely tied, culturally and economically, to life on the seashore.

The desig- nation helps to conserve both the marine biodiversity and the cultural identity of the local community. Fishery database Each fisher records their daily fish catches, methods and site locations and feeds the infor- mation into a database. This information aids in monitoring the abundance and diversity of key species and serves as an important management tool. Responsible fishing Code of Conduct The fishers adopt voluntary standards for responsible fishing based on FAO recommendations. The Code of Conduct for Respon- sible Fisheries helps to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine resources. Participatory local governance The local community develops a Fisheries Management Plan based on their traditional know- ledge. A commission, compo- sed of members of the fishing cooperative and governmental authorities, is responsible for the further management of the area. Legal recognition Regulations for a Community-based Marine Area for Responsible Artisanal Fishing were established. This form of community governance in marine areas is recognised by Costa Rican law and can be applied in other coastal communities. Sustainable ecotourism Cultural tourism provides an additional source of income for the local community.

Adjacent commu- nities, highly dependent on these ecosystems\u2019 continued productivity, have limited alternatives for development and lack adequate incentive or compensation to shift to alternative and environmentally sound production. Guided by the GIZ Biodiversidad Marino Costera y Adaptaci\u00f3n al Cambio Clim\u00e1tico (BIOMARCC) project, the Costa Rican Pacific coast non-profit FUNDECODES has established an innovative finan- cial mechanism for forest and mangrove conservation in the Tempisque Conservation Area. The Global Conservation Standard (GCS) is targeted to install a private sector financed system of payments for ecosystem services. Companies buy conservation credits which enable sustainable ru- ral development activities including tourism, farming and the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems. The intervention area, approximately 5,000 square kilometres, includes 2,000 square kilometres of private forest and state protected land. This acreage is directly managed and can generate 51 million conservation credit units annually. It is surrounded by a commercial buffer zone where local sustain- able production activities for the rehabilitation of mangroves and their services are promoted. For the next thirty years, the mechanism will empower landowners and rural communities to co-ben- efit from their conservation efforts through the cooperative management of public and private are- as alike. Up to 100 hectares of mangrove and coastal forests are now in the process of rehabilitation.

Coastal livelihoods rely heavily on fisheries that are directly linked to the health of mangroves. In addition, as they store up to five times more carbon than terrestrial forests, mangroves are of increasing national and international economic importance. Conservation International is empowering local communities on the Gulf island of Chira to lead a science-based mangrove restoration project. It addresses both the root causes of mangrove degradation and resulting threats to local communities. The project\u2019s scientific assessments (see also solution on page 38) proved instrumen- tal for national policy making \u2013 all putting the project at the forefront of innovative blue carbon action. To date, villagers have successfully nursed and replanted +8,000 mangroves, with a successful ninety per cent survival rate. Locals received micro- entrepreneurship training in sustainable mangrove use and livelihood diversification, while area schools provided an education programme to 260 students. Community members move mangrove seed- lings into a degraded forest solution mangrove restoration for secure livelihoods and carbon storage Twenty-three female volunteers from Chira started our pilot project on mangrove reforestation. For five months they tirelessly cleaned the mangrove area of rubbish, planted seeds in bags and watered them twice a day \u2013 while still taking care of their family duties\u00ab says Marco Quesada Alp\u00edzar, Director of Conservation International Costa Rica. On an island with few employment opportunities and traditional gender roles, the women recognised the project\u2019s potential to attract external attention and hoped it would eventually provide an alternative source of income. Through- out, the women had to overcome opposition by their husbands and community but held onto their vision of bringing home alternative income from tourism and tree nursing. We had always known our mangroves were very important,\u00ab says Aparicia, their strong and charismatic leader.

Scientific assessments identified important yet vulnerable sites for conservation. At the same time, multi-sectorial stakeholder dialogues addressed local marine spatial planning. The stakeholders discussed area delimitation, zonation and governance using mediation, collaborative facilitation and alternative dispute resolution. They negotiated a consensus governance model and formulated management rules for future marine protected areas. Although multi-stakeholder processes can be time demanding and costly, they have proven vital to promote good gov- ernance of marine resources in Costa Rica. The dialogues increase clarity, transparency and social cohesion across sectors. A legally-binding resolution legitimises the pro- cess by promoting local empowerment, and confidence and credibility of communities and authorities. In addition, participants strengthen their negotiating, organising and leadership capabilities. Consequently, the resulting agree- ments enable further cooperation for nego- tiation regarding and governance of marine resources. Every day, fisherfolk from Cabuya on the Nicoya Peninsula have been returning home with progressively smaller catches. Compressor divers and shrimp trawlers in nearby fishing areas have increased pressure on local fish stocks. Fishers, wishing to avoid the hardships caused by scarcity, are eager to create rules that protect their marine resources. Many see the dialogue platform as an opportunity: We want to be part of that process, not have someone from outside come and tell us what to do. It has been difficult for everyone involved to understand what we want with the process, but we managed to reach an agreement that ben- efits all our communities. Now we need more government support from different institutions so our proposal becomes a reality,\u00ab says Dianney Chac\u00f3n, a fisherwoman representing the community of Cabuya. solution multi-sectoral coastal and marine management vision Regulated resource use in the managed area \u00bb \u00a9 BIOMARCC-GIZ This solution is being implemented by five communities on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica, in collaboration with the Costa Rican Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE), National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC) and GIZ\u2019s project Biodiversidad Marino Costera y Adaptac\u00edon al Cambio Clim\u00e1tico (BIOMARCC), on behalf of the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB).

ICAPO works directly with traditional egg poachers to find, collect and protect hawksbill eggs at several sites in El Salvador and Nicaragua. The organisation works to protect the species while supporting poverty stricken local communities through an innovative egg incentive collection programme. This programme pays local residents to monitor the beaches at several sites in El Salvador and Nicaragua. Once a resident finds a turtle nest, they carefully bring the eggs to hatcheries where they are re- buried and monitored until turtles emerge. Participants are paid for every egg brought to the centre and again for those that hatch. This incentive en- courages residents to take special care of the eggs while transporting them. The egg collection programme has allowed coastal residents to earn income for protecting the eggs\u2014 as opposed to selling them on the black market. It is a key source of income in areas with high unemployment and low wages. Our egg incentive approach contrasts that of most turtle conservation programmes which have historically attempted to push out local poachers, leaving them embittered and with limited options to generate incomes,\u00ab says David Melero, ICAPO Alternative Livelihoods Programme Director. \u00bbOur innovative, inclusive approach is largely responsible for our unprecedented conservation successes, which include a reduction in egg poaching from 100 percent to almost zero!\u00ab \u00bb David Melero with a young hawksbill \u00a9 ICAPO Hawksbill turtle hatchlings \u00a9 ICAPO This solution is being implemented by The Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative (ICAPO), fiscally sponsored by The Ocean Foun- dation.

Decades of extensive shrimp farming and weak enforcement of policies, however, have critically depleted mangrove ecosystems, negatively impacting the livelihoods of thousands of subsistence users. Recognizing the problems associated with mangrove degradation, the Ministry of Envi- ronment (MoE) implemented sustainable use agreements as an innovative coastal ma- nagement policy. The rights of \u00bbancestral\u00ab artisanal fishers are recognised by providing associations of mangrove users with a concession for a 10-year mangrove stewardship. This government-granted common property arrangement promotes the conservation and restoration of degraded mangrove areas, sustainable use of marine resources, and empowers local communities to guard their mangroves against further destruction.

After five years of implementing the activities that are required to obtain a concession, including no longer using traps or chemicals, I see that the state of the resource has improved.

In February 2012, a group of fishermen who were not involved in this conservation agreement started harvesting the recovered lobster populations without respecting minimum sizes or area closures. Armed with machetes, sticks, and stones, Arte Langosta members tried to defend the resource they had so carefully managed for more than two years. Despite their efforts to stop the exploitation, they could not prevent the lobster stock from collapsing again. After that conflict, we feared for our personal safety and had to stop the project and leave the area for a while,\u00ab said Mar\u00eda Cecilia Ter\u00e1n. \u00bbHowever, we were surprised to see that the fishermen who participated in our programme did not return to fish lobster in the meantime.\u00ab In retrospect, the conflict was a good learning opportunity. More area fishermen became engaged in responsible fishing activities, sharing their experiences and know- ledge to inspire others. This led to increased interest in joining the initiative. Today, even the fishermen who once caused the armed dispute realise that the sustainable use of marine resources is key to guaranteeing long term socio-economic benefits. The Galera-San Francisco Marine Reserve features an outstanding variety of wildlife and is one of the most important zones for biodiversity conservation in coastal Ecuador. Local residents are heavily dependent on natural resources for their subsistence, with artisanal fishing as a core activity. The spiny lobster (Panulirus gracilis) is traditionally harvested in this area. However, the use of non-selective fishing gear, resource overexploitation and lack of enforcement of marine regulations have severely depleted this resource. In cooperation with the fishing association Arte Langosta, the Nazca Institute for Marine Research and Conservation International created a participatory management system which promotes the protection of biodiversity and sustainable local development. In this system, stakeholders and authorities join together to develop a governance model with specific, effective management actions and fair economic alternatives.

Like other small island nations in the Eastern Caribbean and beyond, Grenada is on the front lines of climate change. It is already experiencing hotter temperatures, more frequent and intense storms, flooding, rising sea levels and degraded coral reefs, which in turn threaten lives, property, food, fresh water, livelihoods and overall economic stability. Faced with these urgent matters, decision makers must make choices that will save lives today and improve livelihoods into the future. This solution addresses the problem of climate change impacts such as increased coastal erosion threatening coastal communities. The project builds social and ecological resilience with strong community engagement. Implemented solutions include the installation of artificial reef structures to attenuate wave energy, restoration of coastal vegetation and community resilience planning. solution at the water\u2019s edge: enhancing coastal resilience in grenada When I was a child I remember going to Grenville and picnicking with my family on the wide sandy beach in the area known locally as Telescope.

When I returned to Grenada in 2013, my first visit back to Grenville shocked me. As I walked along the shore in Tele- scope nothing looked the same. The beach and all coastal vegetation had been lost to the sea. In January 2015, divers installed reef enhancement structures, designed to break wave energy and provide new habitat. I asked one of them about his feelings about the project. His response made all my months of hard work and frustrations worthwhile; for the first time in many years he had hope for the future of his community. He could see that the structures were already breaking waves as designed and that he was satisfied that the project was guided by local knowledge and used local labour. He had already seen fish, octopus and lobster moving onto the structure, and said that his community was embracing the project as their own and were now committed to become better stewards of their environment, knowing that by caring for nature, nature would care for them.\u00ab \u00bb Building the artificial reef one rock at a time \u00bb Erosion on Telescope Beach, Grenada \u00a9 Marjo Aho \u00a9 TNC This solution is being implemented by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in collaboration with Grenada Fund for Conservation and the Grenada Red Cross Society. grenada building blocks Solution components for replication Integrated vulnerability assessment (VA) A spatially explicit VA includes indicators to capture social, ecological and economic vulnerabilities.

The Grenada Bank (which includes both Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) is the site of the Marine Resource Space-use Information System (MarSIS), a Participatory Geographical Information System (PGIS) adapted for the marine realm. This unique information system integrates a variety of social, economic and environmental information (drawn from both scientific and local knowledge) to provide a more complete information base for coastal marine planning and management. A high level of stakeholder engagement provides useful information and creates a strong sense of ownership in the information produced, increases understanding within and between stakeholder groups and validates the critical role of stakeholder participation in research and governance. MarSIS, alongside the development of a transboundary marine multi-use zoning plan, strengthened conservation efforts and sustainable livelihood initiatives in the two countries. In addition it enabled the application of the Grenadine Islands for designation as a transboundary UNESCO marine mixed (cultural/ ecological) World Heritage Site (WHS).

It is one of the last remaining coastal and marine protected areas in the country. The reserve is highly affected by three main watersheds. Although floods have always been common inside Monterrico Reserve, their frequency and adverse effect on important habitats, agricultural lands and infrastructure have increased during recent years. Often these floods are fueled by activities outside the reserve, including changes in drainage patterns, deforestation of riparian forests and water canalization works. Inhabitants of the reserve therefore asked the Center for Conservation Studies (CECON) of the University of San Carlos, which manages Monterrico Reserve, for new approaches to solve these problems. In order for relevant stakeholders to understand the causes behind the flooding, CECON organised a series of field trips along the watersheds. It became evident that the current scale of actions taking place inside the Reserve was not enough to address flood issues in the area. Therefore, the existing management scheme was revised towards a more integrated approach, taking into account the ecological, social and economic links between the reserve and its surrounding land- scape. During the revision process, new and more stakeholder groups were engaged.

Primarily an attempt to counteract threats to Leatherback and Olive Ridley turtle populations, these efforts aim to stop over-harvesting of eggs by local collectors. Despite their endan- gered status, virtually all sea turtle nests in Guatemala were poached and their eggs sold as an alleged aphrodisiac. Nests are monitored and the freshly laid eggs collected and transferred to a hatchery in Hawaii Park to protect them from poachers. ARCAS manages the hatchery with the support of mostly international volunteers who participate in beach patrols, facility maintenance and data collection. To reach conser- vation goals, the hatchery follows a strict, research-based protocol on the fulfilment of physical para- meters and best practices in hatchling release. Turtle reproduction, population status and migration patterns have been continuously monitored since 1997. This long-term data is incredibly valuable for turtle conservation. Environmental education activities in schools inform the local children of the importance of nature protection, while incentives and alternative livelihood options help to ensure long-term sustainable community development. To achieve true success with a conservation programme, we need the support of the local communities and children,\u00ab says Luc\u00eda Garc\u00eda, director of ARCAS\u2019 Hawaii project. Implementing a community development strategy is therefore always the first phase of the project in order to attain the most sustainable, long-term efforts. In 2013 and 2014 one of the most effective and popular educational programmes carried out in the Hawaii and El Rosario hatcheries was the Rally Parlama, named after the targeted species (\u203aParlama\u2039 is the local name for Olive Ridley turtles). This programme encouraged local children to donate Parlama eggs to an ARCAS hatchery. In exchange for eight dozen eggs, we rewarded the children with a four day, all-inclusive cross-country tour to visit other national parks and protected areas. As most residents of the Hawaii region live below the pover- ty line, many of them have never left their home area. The trip was an incredible opportunity for these children to visit some of Guatemala\u2019s most beautiful, natural and iconic sites. The Rally Parlama pro- gramme helped to create a lasting impression, boosted the children\u2019s sensitivity for the importance of nature conservation and created stronger support for ARCAS\u2019 conservation efforts within the local communities.\u00ab solution integrated approach for turtle conservation \u00a9 ARCAS Guatemala \u00bb Children visit Tikal Na- tional Park in Peten, during the Rally Parlama \u00bb Volunteers taking care of the turtle hatchery in Hawaii Park \u00a9 ARCAS Guatemala This solution is being implemented by ARCAS Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Association in Guatemala.

Mitch, in a movement pattern very unusual for hurricanes, remained over Guanaja for three and a half days. Local people survived by hiding in the hills and crowding into the few structures that remained standing. An estimated 95 per cent of the once abundant mangroves were destroyed. Due to geographic isolation from other mangrove areas, natural recovery was very slow or even impossible. In 2008, The Bay Islands Conservation Association Guanaja (BICA-Guanaja) started its multi-year resto- ration project with the goal of planting 400,000 red, black and white mangroves to restore a self-sustaining healthy forest on Guanaja Island.

Collecting them in an isolated canal where a fewtree re- mained and then trudging through the mud to plant them by the thou- sands. Right after spending months planting many tens of thousands of seeds, hurricane Wilma brushed by Guanaja with enough force to kill the seeds he had planted which were just sprouting their first leaves. Hearing Baldhead\u2019s story I felt a great inspiration to help out. Together with a volunteer biology student, Toby Jacobs, I returned to Guanaja and began helping Baldhead plant Red Mangrove seeds. We had no funding and no real plan; we just got out there in the knee deep mud and got to work. That was in 2008. Toby and I founded the Guanaja Mangrove Reforestation Project, which is now part of The Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA Guanaja). In 2011, we established three mangrove nurseries growing white, black and red mangroves, to rear the seedlings up to a specific size, increasing the restoration success. Since then, we have planted more than 200,000 mangroves, assisting the recovery of 100 hectares.\u00ab \u00a9 BICA-Guanaja \u00bb This solution is being implemented by BICA-Guanaja in collaboration with The Ocean Foundation. On-the-ground mangrove planting On-the-ground hand planting of seedlings from nurseries ef- fectively helps restore the eco- logical balance when mangroves cannot recover naturally. Con- sidering the right timing, season and location in which the man- groves are planted is crucial for restoration success. Environmental education The project reaches out to stu- dents and local communities in order to teach the importance of mangroves as critical components of the global environment. Volun- teers and students plant thousands of mangroves; even school children are encouraged to start peat pot nurseries for black and white man- groves in their classrooms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90d2ba47-e78c-4724-8713-319a9c3144ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "90d2ba47-e78c-4724-8713-319a9c3144ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ae26a4a1c95b8a7755cb6e9f947fee448240af81451228b0c2daef543c7f31b"}, "2": {"node_id": "26346b25-9549-4629-a2b6-5300d9cbb7d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4df17c37f219b0fd30fbc08eb889dfda759fa9415780e3edb1f2fbabd7c4802e"}}, "hash": "d598cec1d559c482e14daa6f40ad39cfe70a725ba09f7cce17d32bef20975e68", "text": "Monitoring restoration success Mangroves flourish in some micro environments more than others.

This species is the fourth most valuable marine resource in the area, providing a livelihood to more than 9,000 people. However, unsustainable resource use has led to the overexploitation of this species, including market satu- ration and a critical drop in market prices. Through Catch Shares (Manejo Compartido por Cuotas (MCC) in Spanish), a framework for sustainable fisheries management, it has been possible to reduce overfishing while improving the economic wellbeing of those fishing communities dependent on healthy and resilient marine ecosystems. This type of Rights Based Management framework unites fishing communities, fisheries managers, academia and civil society organisations via a quota- based programme in order to maximise economic returns while main- taining the sustainability of the resource. solution catch shares: a framework for sustainable fisheries Chaos\u2013that is the best way to describe the curvina fishery some years ago,\u00ab says Francisco Dominguez, a fisherman for more than 40 years in the Gulf of Santa Clara. Every year, between February and May, corvina gather in the Colorado River Delta to reproduce at the full or new moon. At this time, the sea becomes a hive of fish and boats are in a competitive race to catch them. Back then we used to fish just for the sake of it\u00ab, remembers Francisco. There were no incentives to decrease harvesting, regardless of the market saturation and price breakdown. Since the implementation of Catch Shares in 2012, those days are gone. Now, fishermen like Francisco have secure access to their resources, al- lowing them to plan in advance, reduce costs and increase incomes while keeping the fishing harvest at sustainable levels. With Catch Shares, chaos is no longer the reality of the corvina fishery: \u00bb Now we have more fish in the water, more food on the plate and a more prosperous community.\u00ab \u00bb Francisco Dominguez, fisherman in the Gulf of Santa Clara. \u00bb \u00a9 EDF Mexico Fishermen of Gulf corvina \u00a9 Carlos Aguilera This solution is being implemented by Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) Mexico.

They assure fishermen stable fishing over time and exclusive benefits from sustainable management, increasing their stewardship and compliance. Unconventional strategic partnerships To promote sustainable fishing, it is necessary to create partnerships that promote behaviour change, even if they are at opposite ends of the market. A partnership of fishermen and buyers brings mutual benefits such as better prices and higher quality products. This incentivises fisher- men to respect catch limits and no-take zones. Collaborative science Accurate and updated information is crucial for resource management. Forming Technical Groups enables collaborative science for decision making. These groups consist of participants from public and academic institutions who meet regularly to share information relevant to the fishery\u2019s man- agement. 70 71 Rural communities located along the Mexican coast heavily depend on natural resources for their subsistence, with artisa- nal fishing as one of their main activities. The lack of stable organisational frameworks within the fishing sector, however, has led to the overexploitation of marine resources, causing severe conflicts between local stakeholders. To effectively address this problem, COBI (Comunidad y Biodiversidad) has developed a participatory approach to strengthen the overall governance of marine ecosystems that includes measures to restore fisheries and marine ecosystems. Techniques range from capacity building and the intro- duction of international standards for fishing to the establishment of fully protected marine reserves. The method has been implemented in three regions: the Mesoamerican Reef, Baja California and the Gulf of California. solution community-based management for artisanal fisheries The 250 fishermen of Puerto Libertad, a village located on the north coast of the Gulf of California, have traditionally fished commercially important species such as grouper, snapper and squid to sustain their livelihoods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec810299-3692-4bf1-98ba-dae55d8ddbf5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec810299-3692-4bf1-98ba-dae55d8ddbf5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59898aae0069ebfa11528651488f372a45f30d5d1086dd3c0ac3896d806c4f72"}, "2": {"node_id": "22cf80bb-0a54-489c-91ac-5a783e1e4025", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a05eb7376ee951f231b71798907675ae0b67d11be484b20f05f51f1731052b4"}}, "hash": "4c0e14a5f88bc12fd2c5c97e83e844467afb33ae7b7365ffdfbeceea168ca8ac", "text": "Before COBI started its activities in this village, there was no regulatory framework in place to control fishing activi- ties.

This stewardship might take many forms, such as the voluntary designation of fishers\u2019 community reserves, or the en- dorsement and adoption of specific existing reserves. Other efforts could include the adoption of new or improved log books for better fisheries data collection, establishment of market connections for improved sales of fisheries products and adoption of alternative income activities. Campaigns have also promoted the voluntary use of sustainable and non-dam- aging fishing practices. They demonstrate the power of community-based marine conservation. Organised fishers are better able to maintain fishing rights, incre- ase their compliance with fishing regulations and gain better access to special markets and value added activities. Besides Mexico, marine pride campaigns have been implemented in Honduras, Guatemala and Ecuador. In the rural communities of La Encrucijada, Mexico, fishermen are getting organised. The sea provides the main source of income, yet overfishing is a major problem. A pride campaign aimed to bolster the six fishing cooperatives\u2019 organi- sational capacity and help them establish no-take reserves to let fish stocks replenish themselves.

Formative research Both quantitative and qualita- tive data feed into baselines, which enable the assessment of social and conservation impacts following a campaign. Both data sets are used to target audiences and, ultimately, guide campaign objectives, activities and mes- sages. Theory of Change (ToC) The ToC serves to create a common vision of long-term goals, how to reach them and how to measure progress along the way. It is the basis for stra- tegic planning. As such it clearly articulates how shifting behav- iour and social norms will re- duce threats to biodiversity. 74 75 Protected Areas (PAs) are a powerful tool for biodiversity conservation. In Mexico, more than 170 federal PAs are to protect over 25.6 million hectares of important habitats and landscapes. Due to the remote location of many PAs, however, their function as adminis- trative frameworks for local governance is often impaired. Some PAs lack the economic, human and material resources to ensure sufficient and effective surveillance and regulation enforcement. In addition, local communities, e.g. fishing communities in the state of Baja California, observe insufficient pres- ence and low levels of inter-agency coordination which is required to inform users about the current regulations for the area. A conceptual model to support PA enforcement was developed. This model, currently being implemented in marine and coastal protected areas of north-western Mexico, is designed to increase regulation compliance and facilitate fisheries and biodiversity recovery and conservation. The model includes: diagnosing the current status of the PA\u2019s administrative framework; multi-agency coordination; planning and evaluation; personnel, capacity building; financing, equipment/ infra-structure; joint operation; data systematisation; and legal follow-up. The Mexican government established the \u00bbBah\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles, Ballenas and Salsipuedes Channels\u00ab Biosphere Reserve in 2007. Since then, Pronatura Noroeste has devoted itself to develop tools to guarantee the effectiveness of protection measures. Once the Management Plan for the Reserve was published, we signed a set of agreements with PROFEPA to increase the presence of inspectors in the area, acquire equipment, and inform users about the current regulations within the Reserve,\u00ab says Gustavo Danemann of Pronatura Noroeste. Thanks to these agreements, surveillance in Bah\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles was increased by 1580 per cent between 2007 and 2013, and 81 per cent of the boats observed within the Reserve in 2013 were reported to fully comply with the existing legal framework. To date, Pronatura Noroeste, in conjunction with multiple partners, is expanding its surveillance and enforcement experience to 12 MPAs in northwest Mexico. Now, more than ever, actions are being taken to increase compliance within marine protected areas in the country.\u00ab solution compliance in protected areas Meeting of the Surveillance and Enforcement Com- mittee for the Bah\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Region \u00a9 Abraham Gonz\u00e1lez/ Pronatura Noroeste \u00bb \u00bb This solution is being implemented in several Protected Areas by the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP), the Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (PROFEPA), the National Commission of Aquaculture and Fishing (CONAPESCA), Secretar\u00eda de Marina (SEMAR) and the Office of the Mexican Attorney-General (PGR) and other federal and local government agencies in collaboration with Pronatura Noroeste. building blocks Solution components for replication Interagency working group An inter-institutional surveillance and enforcement com- mittee creates an interagency work programme which includes overall surveillance, formation of objectives and goals, the legal framework, individual competencies of the agencies, action protocols, institutional commitments and an evaluation matrix.

However, its marine ecosystems, and therefore the livelihoods of many coastal communities, are threatened by over-fishing. Coastal development has led to the decline of key habitats which sustain a variety of interlinked species. Since artisanal fishermen were not involved in fisheries management, they took little responsibility for marine conservation. To address these challenges and facilitate collaboration for the management of fishery resources, the Kanan Kay Alliance was founded as a coalition of 41 institutional members and includes governmental agencies, fishing cooperatives, civil society organisations, academia and philanthropic foundations. The Alliance\u2018s most important task is the establishment of a network of so-called fish refuges where fishing is banned. Such shelters are a powerful tool to recover the biomass of overfished species within a short time period. Today, these refuges cover 16,000 hec- tares of the region\u2018s coral reefs, seagrass meadows and coastal wetlands. Recognising the importance of involving local fishermen in responsible fisheries manage- ment, the Alliance aims to further empower these stakeholders. Participatory manage- ment processes help to strengthen their sense of ownership and support the sustainable use of fishery resources in the long-term. solution empowering fishermen through co-management At one General Assembly, Kanan Kay Alliance members discussed which terminology to use when referring to \u00bbfish refuges\u00ab. For some governmental representatives, changing to a different term that was both technically correct and easy to understand made a lot of sense. For the fishermen, however, changing the term would have been synonymous with betraying the overall goal of the Alliance. The discussion reached a point where the fishermen were prepared to exercise their power of veto and leave the assembly if the term were to be changed. In the end, the Alliance decided to keep the term, as it was of great importance to the fishermen.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b31f06e-9dd6-43a9-bb84-091be1d9fa12": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b31f06e-9dd6-43a9-bb84-091be1d9fa12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7505a0f65b6e9f6dea3d5e58c988278c9b16edc95aacd0d1560ee93a50878904"}, "2": {"node_id": "5fec1912-0bc4-4f1a-8432-d62f31c96cd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6da2a389500c56ca7ccfa8ff82ba65dc49934122967678c919b0ee0df223253a"}}, "hash": "a82b6321310c53aa645497558944038b76d13ff3795366913140cfc22a59f1bb", "text": "This incident helped increase the fishermen\u2018s confidence in a joint management ap- proach and its successful implementation.

Our coastal watershed conservation project encourages public institutions and civil society organisations to implement the project at the state and local levels by joining together to form working groups. Public agencies hold dialogues about how to better invest within the watersheds, and local civil society organisations work together with public institutions. It also encourages collaboration between different branches of the public sector. For example, the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC), a federal institution responsible for conducting scientific research and shaping public policy, requested that the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) redesigns its soil conservation strategy, based on scientific evidence of erosion impact. A public fund was created to support the resulting watershed conservation actions.\u00ab Cross-sector collaboration can be crucial for the success of nature conservation. Thus, in Mexico, the integrated management of coastal watersheds, especially those which drain into the Gulfs of Mexico and California, is promoted and implemented as a means to achieve biodiversity conservation benefits, increase climate change resilience and en- hance sustainable land use. Through coordination between key institutions and the application of a landscape ap- proach to watershed management, the effectiveness of protected areas is ensured. In addition, conservation and sustainable management increases the connectivity of area watersheds. These efforts are financed by encouraging and aligning investments of public and private agencies, especially to address the severe impacts of climate change in vulnerable coastal environments (such as hurricanes and persistent droughts leading to wildfires). Specific strategies for each watershed are identified with the participation of public, private and local stakeholders, in order to contribute to their recovery or maintain their functionality. The maintenance and recovery of watershed functions benefits cities and rural commu- nities alike.

Public-private collaboration Federal agencies and private organisations are joining efforts for the state-level conservation of watersheds through the creation of a Technical Committee. The Committee includes representatives of those institutions and ensures transparency and adequate implementation. This is replicated at the local level in every watershed, engaging diverse local stakeholders to make decisions regarding activities. Diverse financing mechanisms Financing stems from a combination of endowment funds, public sinking funds and grants for specific activities as well as innovative finance options such as payment for ecosystem ser- vices schemes.

There is an urgent need to reduce the vulnerability of people and infra- structure to the effects of climate change and extreme weather events. Climate change adaptation plans identify a variety of strategies to minimise vulnerabilities. However, municipalities, communities and resource managers need to identify which specific land use, construc- tion and ecosystem management practices they should implement. Measures such as building on poles, behind the dunes or using tradi- tional construction methods; maintaining healthy coral reefs as natural barriers; and leaving natural flows undisturbed have all been proven to successfully prevent or reduce climate change-related damage to coastal areas. A core team of experts from Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Chetumal, Mesoamerica Reef Tourism Initiative, the Amigos de Sian Ka\u2018an and The Nature Conservancy reviewed and systematised relevant experiences of Mexican Caribbean hotel staff, coastal dwellers, architects and engineers. They identified over 35 climate change adaptation measures, resulting in a comprehensive catalogue of good practices. This catalogue lists climate phenomena and corresponding impacts; measures which can address those impacts and what is needed for their implementation; and how relevant com- ponents of the selected practice interact. While dissemination of this information to and training of coastal development professionals and related business sectors is underway, the approach is already proving popular.

Due to its rich biological diversity, in 1980 the island was designated as a National Park. High levels of marine productivity in the surrounding waters have attracted fishermen, who have been using the island as a temporary camp site for almost one hundred years. However, a steadily growing number of fishermen camping on the island and a lack of organisation have tremendously increased the pressure on the island\u2018s natural resources. In 2000, the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) initi- ated a participatory process to improve the management of the fishing camp of Isla Isabel.

It stretches over 1,000 km along the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. Its ecosystems are in a critical condition due to a combination of local and global threats: land-based pollution, severe overfishing, unsustainable coastal and tourism development and climate change. To accelerate the conservation of the MAR in its entirety, the MAR Leadership Program (MAR-L) is supporting high-impact replicable projects while boosting the expertise and leadership skills of young practitioners in these four countries. To date, 60 interdisciplinary fellows have been trained to develop, lead and scale up innovative conservation activities which can turn into models for sustainable resource management and development in the region.

In many cases, however, improper disposal of fisheries waste pollutes the surrounding environment and presents hazards to human health. To address the need for proper management of fisheries waste, members of the fishing community El Caracol in Guasave, Sinaloa state, founded Grupo Crustil, a small-scale processing enterprise, in 2007. Grupo Crustil utilises discards from artisanal fisheries to produce fish meal. The process creates opportunities for alternative income generation, maximises product utilisation and mitigates environmental impacts. To date, approximately 600 metric tons of fisheries waste are processed per month, producing up to 35 metric tons of fish meal for sale in local and regional markets. The commitment of the staff is crucial for the success of this enterprise. The staff dedicates themselves to reducing costs, further improving their products and diversifying the product range. For example, they plan to further reduce waste by converting protein-rich water (a by-product of the production process) to an organic liquid fertiliser which will be marketed to the regional agricultural industry. The small factory thereby contributes to an improved quality of life in the local community, creates jobs and helps to raise awareness on the need for proper management of fisheries waste. solution making money from scraps Equipment and raw material for the production of fish meal \u00a9 APFF Islas del Golfo de California \u00a9 APFF Islas del Golfo de California Project staff and a representative of the Mexican National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) This solution is being implemented by the Mexican National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP).

It is sold in local and regional markets. mexico building blocks Solution components for replication Business plan for fishmeal production A business plan for processing fish and shrimp waste into fish meal is developed, defining the enterprise\u2019s design and determining its costs. The plan incorporates the concept of operations, organisational structure, system design, production processes, training modules, marketing and sales as well as a feasibility analysis. Dissemination and training The enterprise helps to raise community awareness on the need for proper management of fisheries waste. Training is provided to increase staff com- petency. The enterprise is also presented to other communities in the area to facilitate its replication. Government seed funding To receive federal government funding, the enter- prise must demonstrate its environmental and social benefits alongside the ability to be self-sustaining within a given period of time.

Such high visitor numbers, however, are placing immense pressure on the natural coral reefs in the area. For instance, they have suffered critical damage from inexperienced divers or people kicking or touching corals and reef formations. In order to alleviate pressure on the reefs and allow them recovery time, an underwater art museum called MUSA (Museo Subacu\u00e1tico de Arte) was es- tablished in 2009. The museum is world-renowned for two reasons: it is one of the largest underwater artificial art attractions in the world and it draws visitors away from the natural reefs while creating new artificial habitats.

Strict management plans are necessary to restore these fisheries to sustainable levels. SmartFish International is a for-profit social enterprise based in La Paz, Mexico. It supports fishermen in their efforts to deliver and sell better-quality fish to the docks and in premium markets, respectively. SmartFish establishes relation- ships with and between reputable co-ops, NGOs, fisheries and fishermen who promote sustainable fishing practices. To support and protect the efforts of fishermen, SmartFish connects them with interested markets and assists in the design and implementation of proper fishery management. These efforts promote ecosystem conservation and help end the vicious cycle of overfishing while sustaining livelihoods and ensuring food security. solution rescuing value in the fish market In 2009, we began experimenting with entrepreneurial approaches to incentivising higher sustainability fishing in Mexico,\u00ab says S. Hoyt Peckham, founding director of SmartFish International. \u00bbCertain visionary fishermen wanted to try switching to more selective gear to reduce megafauna bycatch, as long as they could find a way to do so more profitably. We realised that we could probably align fishing with sustainability objectives and thus overcome the cycle of overfishing. In 2010 we conducted a market study and plan with leading fishermen, in partnership with five fishing cooperatives of the Bahia Magdalena region which form the social venture Productos Marinos Sustentables (ProMar). Local fishermen don\u2019t have the capital or the capacity to bring their fish to market, which puts them at the mercy of aggressive buyers. They end up receiving very poor prices for their fish, so every time they fish they have to make up for the low prices with higher quantities. We piloted how we could rescue the value lost in some of their undervalued fisheries. Strong demand for ProMar\u2019s zero bycatch, higher sustainability seafood enabled ProMar to generate impressive social, environmental and economic outcomes. However, that same demand also presented ProMar\u2019s greatest challenge: maintaining catch rates which are high and consistent enough to meet that demand.

The mangrove trees function as a natural coastal protection barrier, a biological water fil- tration system and a refuge for wildlife. They thereby help buffer natural or human impacts on adjacent ecosystems while sustaining diverse marine and coastal life, supporting subsistence and commer- cial fisheries and providing recreational opportunities. These mangrove stands have been chronically stressed due to deg- radation and pollution associated with coastal development and tourism infrastructure, reducing the resilience of the mangrove ecosystem to disturbances such as hurricanes. The devastating effects became obvious in 2005 when category-five hurricane Wilma hit the area, degrading large areas of mangrove bordering the lagoon and adjacent reef formations. To support the recovery of the mangrove ecosystem, in 2008 the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) began to implement restoration and conservation activities including hydrology, restoration and refor- estation and invasive species elimination projects. The restoration of degraded mangrove areas demands personnel and professional commitment. Working under extreme conditions in the mud while trying to achieve not only the technical project objectives but also to inspire others to do so was not an easy task,\u00ab states Teresa Patricia Santos Gonz\u00e1les, Head of Department at the \u00c1rea de Protecci\u00f3n de Flora y Fauna Manglares de Nichupt\u00e9. The results, however, have made our efforts worthwhile. Databases and graphs of the monitoring results and pictures taken before and after the project\u2018s implemen- tation phase indicate the recovery of the mangrove cover \u2013 and the survival and growth of reforested individuals with an average survival of more than 89 per cent, as well as returning local mangrove fauna.

In order to generate the desired conservation outcomes and social benefits, however, this network of MPAs must be adequately staffed and managed. Unfortunately, the budget growth of the National Commission for Protected Areas (CONANP) has not kept pace with the expansion of the protected area system and as a result the MPAs are chronically underfunded. Thus, supplementary funding from private, bilateral and multilateral donors is crucial for their effective operation. In order to address these needs and to ensure long-term and sustained funding, a public-private partnership between CONANP and the Mexican Fund for the Conservation of Nature (FMCN) was created. FMCN, in close collaboration with the Mexican government, has financially strengthened 24 federal protected areas. These funds provide sustainable financing and help to ensure that MPAs have the financial and human resources ne- cessary to guarantee the long-term conservation of the coastal and marine ecosystems network. solution sustainable financing of marine protected areas Bah\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles Biosphere Reserve and San Lorenzo Archipielago Nation- al Park are MPAs located in the Midriff Islands region of the Gulf of California.

Trust fund revenue has enabled protected area staff to triple the number of marine patrols and reduce illegal fishing.

Due to its rich marine biodiversity, the park has become a main tourist destina- tion. Coral damage and loss resulting from inexperienced divers and snorkelers, anchoring boats, tourism coastal development and pollution from recreational craft, however, seriously threaten Cabo Pulmo\u2019s fragile ecosystem. To minimise the impact of unregulated recreational activities on the park and its marine life, a collaborative partnership has united local citizens, conservation groups, tourism service providers and park staff in developing and implementing a Public Use and Recreation Programme (PURP). The first step of this process was to determine the actual level of touristic use and carrying capacity of the environment. Based on the results of this study, the stakeholder group limited water sports in the park. The related public use guide- lines help regulate visitors more effectively and involve local tour operators in low-impact tourism activities. In addition, permanent surveillance and monitoring programmes have been implemented. They allow for constant assessment of the state of the park and thus enable improved decision making and timely adaptive management actions. The programme has shown to promote long-term economic benefits for the local community while, at the same time, increasing the satisfaction of visitors and preserving park habitats. solution tourism as driver for change Among the local population, the PURP has created a joint understanding of the importance of an organised and regu- lated use of natural resources.

The waters off the coast of San Fernando are among the most productive marine areas in the Humboldt Current Large Marine Ecosystem, home to Humboldt penguins, sea lions and a multitude of marine and shorebirds. The extensive kelp forests along the rocky shore are of great ecological and economic importance. These huge macroal- gae are harvested by local artisanal fishermen, so-called \u00bbalgueros\u00ab, for the commercial production of alginate. In 2009, when the price for kelp increased, macroalgae harvesting in- tensified and San Fernando was declared a protected area at the same time. Local fishermen were initially against giving the area protected status because they feared restrictions on their use of coastal resources. These artisanal fishermen banded together through Comunidad Pes- quera de Marcona (COPMAR), an umbrella organisation of sixteen area fishermen associations. Using a participatory process, COPMAR and its members were able to be involved in the establishment and zoning of the National Reserve. Both the association and fishermen themselves became active partners in the Reserve\u2019s Management Committee. During the process, the importance of macroalgae harvesting for the fishers\u2019 livelihood security was ac- knowledged. Today, the fishermen help avoid macroalgae overexploitation through control and surveillance of its har- vesting, and the minimising of uncontrolled and illegal activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bb3f3ab-c8b6-48cf-94ba-b722f17ab317": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bb3f3ab-c8b6-48cf-94ba-b722f17ab317", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7afe784a4b2911a490701b18e7b96f1b96eb73fb41d8f5a315bd2df516efc456"}, "2": {"node_id": "95ea86d4-9fb6-4f2f-b8c6-abecbb83adb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f5336956ccda9d0d5d119bc59cb11f37989995f6a779c242c9909aa481e45b1"}}, "hash": "5b8b187def580bbb12bacd330828a861d9295394c7d1d2695c676c6d1ee64454", "text": "The co-management approach brought together different associations of fishermen and other stakeholders.

Yet in the Caribbean small island states, as in many places around the world, they face threats from overfishing, pollution, human development and climate change. The government of St. Maarten recently advanced conservation of these ecosystems when it established the country\u2019s first national park in 2010. Until then, the benefits and services provided by the coral reef \u2013 and the impor- tance of its health for the local economy \u2013 were not sufficiently acknow- ledged. An ecosystem valuation analysis quantified the economic value of the propo- sed park\u2019s tourism and fishery. Alongside broad stakeholder involvement, this study demonstrated the strong link between ecosystem conservation, sustain- able management of resources and economic benefits to the community. The results of this analysis were used to identify the significance of individual species and implement or enforce ma- nagement actions for their conservation. Furthermore, a resiliency programme was set up to respond to climate change impacts. solution coral reef valuation supports the establishment of a marine protected area Our reefs face serious threats by the expansion of the tourism sector and climate change impacts. We needed susta- inable management of the reefs and its resources and not another paper park,\u00ab says Tadzio Bervoets, marine park manager at Nature Foundation St. Maarten. In 2010, the Foundation was asked to establish a well-managed marine park with a strict no-take zone to address those threats. The Foundation surveyed St. Maarten\u2019s reefs and identified high priority areas for conservation. An economic valuation analysis of the marine ecosystem, using the Coastal Capital methodology (see also solution page 12),revealed the importance of a healthy marine ecosystem to St. Maarten\u2019s economy. Based on the results of both the ecological assessment and economic valuation, the Man of War Shoal National Marine Park was established. A mooring system for dive boats was designed, preventing further damage from anchoring directly on the reef. Prior to and during the establishment of the marine park, the Foundation conducted wide-scale outreach to explain how anchors damage coral reefs. Small businesses in St. Maarten paid for the construction of a mooring system drilled into the substrate once the park was inaugurated. \u00bb The coral reefs of St. Maarten host diverse invertebrate fauna \u00a9 Nature Foundation St. Maarten This solution is being implemented by the Nature Foundation St. Maarten in collaboration with the Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance. st. maarten building blocks Solution components for replication Economic valuation study A stakeholder survey, based on the Coastal Capital methodology, collects relevant data for a valuation which determines ecosystems value.

The three-day workshop, which will be held from November 9 to 11, will focus on introducing Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) to participants. FLR is an integrated approach that seeks to ensure that forests, trees, and the functions that they provide are effectively restored, conserved, and employed on a landscape-scale to help secure ecological integrity and sustainable livelihoods. The workshop opened today with keynote speeches to set the context, followed by a high-level panel on FLR in Myanmar and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc3b87a3-9d8a-43b3-9ab1-20bc60a7e532": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc3b87a3-9d8a-43b3-9ab1-20bc60a7e532", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/workshop-report-workshop-restoring-myanmars-degraded-and-deforested", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Workshop report : workshop on restoring Myanmar's degraded and deforested landscapes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/workshop-report-workshop-restoring-myanmars-degraded-and-deforested", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "712cdd07a65b484c9bc22aa233a8fdb6f624ecce21036f2c233b3a73b60105f3"}, "3": {"node_id": "e53117d0-90dd-4acf-8434-7a77fc56657e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/workshop-report-workshop-restoring-myanmars-degraded-and-deforested", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da960bcf16f78aed9eaaf6208460fdeab42e85f4f20b8d2c52c0acaa6b5b293f"}}, "hash": "9c0e3b0ca06ef383396cdbf03bef10d745f13e97766003e62da5edfdcc28b16f", "text": "a plenary discussion. The participants were also introduced to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM). ROAM is a tool that provides a framework for countries to rapidly identify and analyse areas that are primed for FLR, and to identify specific priority areas for restoration at a national or sub-national level. Myanmar has one of the highest percentages of forest coverage in Asia, with over 45 percent of the country covered with forests. However, in recent decades, the country has experienced significant deforestation and forest degradation due to unsustainable logging practices, high demand for fuelwood, as well as agricultural conversion. Myanmar also has limited data on how its forested lands are being used. \u201cSuccessful implementation of approaches like FLR and ROAM would not only increase carbon sequestration and capacity to adapt to climate change through low-emission development strategies, but also create other benefits. This includes expanding habitats and migration corridors for biodiversity, enhancing food production, reducing soil erosion, and yielding clean water supplies,\u201d said Mr. Jake Brunner, Head, Indo-Burma Group for IUCN. On the second day of the workshop, participants will visit Yedashe Township in Taungoo District to learn from Myanmar\u2019s experiences with reforestation and discuss best practices for FLR opportunities. The sessions on the final day are dedicated to developing a restoration planning roadmap for the country using the ROAM methodology. \u201cTo reverse the significantly increasing trend of deforestation in Myanmar, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has called for a new policy to promote reforestation and forest restoration,\u201d said His Excellency U Ohn Win, Union Minister of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation, in his speech addressing all participants during the opening of the workshop. \u201cWe need to build on your vast experience and knowledge when developing a roadmap for restoration planning in Myanmar. We must engage all relevant stakeholders including those whose activities may directly or indirectly impact the forest estate.\u201d \u201cThe Forest Department has also been generating lessons from reforestation efforts in Myanmar over several years,\u201d said Dr. Tint Lwin Thaung, Myanmar Country Program Director, TNC. \u201cWe believe that the time is right to reflect and build on this experience and to work with Myanmar stakeholders to define a future for Myanmar\u2019s forest estate in which it is able to support sustainable and equitable development. 49# Taking a landscape approach to restoring the country\u2019s prized forests is going to be a critical part of that process.\u201d# Workshop participants were also introduced to The Restoration Initiative (TRI). Funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), TRI supports effective restoration and conservation of degraded landscapes to help secure ecological integrity and sustainable livelihoods for the future. Senior policy-makers and technical staff from various government agencies, as well as representatives from civil society are attending the workshop. The workshop is co-funded by TNC and UK aid from the UK government through its Knowledge and Tools for Forest Landscape Restoration project (KNOWFOR) implemented by IUCN.

This ministry is responsible for the country\u2019s forestry and logging sector\u2019s. Myanmar is a strategic country in terms of biodiversity conservation. Because of Myanmar\u2019s size and geographic position, it is influenced by three distinct bio-geographical regions: the Himalayan to the north and west, the Indochinese to the east, and the Sundaic to the south. As a result, Myanmar is blessed with an extraordinarily rich natural heritage and global conservation value \u2013 it is home to 10% of the world\u2019s freshwater turtles and tortoises on just over 1% of the world\u2019s land area.

In the same year, 17,689 ha of flooded crops and a production loss of about 13,500 tonnes were recorded in Burkina Faso. It is worth noting that most flood-related damages have occurred in areas where natural ecosystems have been destroyed by human settlement and activities. There is increasing recognition that ecosystems can play an important role in disaster risk reduction. The reforestation of degraded forest or woodland ecosystems with specific species screened for particular capacities/abilities (i.e. drought tolerant, flood resistant, salinity tolerant), or the management of mangroves to reduce the impacts of floods can reduce the risk of disaster. However, these Eco-DRR activities are not well known and implemented in the region.

The assessment therefore suggests the following: 1. Regional and national institutions should be strengthened to better plan and implement climatic resilience for both ecosystems and people, and also climate risk management; 2. Joint capacity building initiatives for ecosystem, DRM managers and other actors should be implemented in order to help them better understand the links between DRM and ecosystem management; 3. Ecosystem managers should collaborate with all stakeholders including researchers, NGOs, communities and decision makers to effectively implement a long term strategy on resilience, disaster risk reduction that integrate ecosystem and biodiversity aspects; 4. Researchers should develop the appropriate tools (including maps) for collecting and analysing data on damages and Eco-DRR to highlight the links between DRM and ecosystem management; 5. Government institutions should develop and facilitate the implementation of integrated disaster risk management and environment/ biodiversity conservation management policies. Executive summary 6 The West and Central Africa region faces several hazards especially droughts and floods since many decades. The Sahel is the most affected part of the region, and this is exacerbated by the climate change threat (Boko et al., 2007). In the past, these hazards have affected people and ecosystems, and continue to do so as extreme weather events become more frequent due to the complexity of climate change and variability. During 2005\u20132015, West Africa counted not less than 17 drought events with almost 32 million affected people. Flood events have been more severe during the same period with a total of 132 events, with more than 14 million people affected, 2,000 dead and almost 400,000 homeless. Economies were also affected as it caused US$ 830 million of economic losses (EM-DAT, 2016). There is a need for effective solutions to such hazards and disasters. It is also important as a means to contribute to sustainable development: indeed 85 percent of people exposed to hazards such as cyclones, earthquake, floods and droughts live in developing countries, including African countries; the direct costs of damages from disasters have multiplied by 13 between 1960 and the last decade; and reducing disaster risks will guarantee the availability of enough food (UNDP, 2004). Some of the recommended approaches to address these issues include ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) and Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) approaches as well as nature-based solutions. Such solutions use the benefits that nature can provide to mitigate the negative effects of natural hazards on people and ecosystems. These solutions therefore imply that ecosystems are healthy enough to cope and resist to natural hazards and other environmental disturbances, including climate change. Solutions based on ecosystem and species diversity, through mangrove or forest rehabilitation, exist in the region even though they are not directly linked to disaster risk management. At the international level, policies and programmes support and promote the implementation of ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation and disaster risk reduction; at the regional level, the implementation of such approaches and related programmes remains low; as a result, people continue to be affected through the loss in income generated from the ecosystems and ecosystem services that have become exposed, sensitive and unable to adapt to extreme weather events. In this regard, protecting livelihoods is crucial. By restoring degraded land or forests, we can restore and strengthen the ecological foundation for food security. In order to reduce the gap in implementing Eco- DRR initiatives in the region and worldwide, IUCN is implementing the RELIEF-Kit (Resilience through Investing in Ecosystems \u2013 knowledge, innovation and transformation of risk management) project, which aims to contribute to knowledge dissemination and capacity development for the effective implementation of Eco-DRR. This will be achieved by, among others, assessing biodiversity and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR). The current assessment covers the West and Central Africa region with eight focal countries namely: Burkina Faso, Togo, Senegal, Mali, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The main objective of this regional assessment is to collect and review regional information and experience on ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and its linkages with biodiversity. The assessment will help respond to the following questions: how Eco-DRR can contribute to biodiversity conservation? How biodiversity contributes to Eco- DRR outcomes? What are the trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and Eco-DRR. Specific examples, where they exist, will be provided to illustrate responses to the different questions. The results of the assessment will help design programmes and plans to better take into account ecosystems when implementing adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies in the region, and with the ambition to inform future policy decisions. 1.

The document includes: scientific articles, technical papers, policy documents, selected national examples/case studies, project documents and other information sources such as newspapers and web information. Furthermore, the literature was searched and analysed using the following key words: adaptation, resilience, hazards, disasters, droughts and floods (which are the main hazards in the region), risk management, risk reduction, ecosystem- based adaptation (EbA). Most of the documents consulted can only be accessed online. The assessment includes information from the sources below: - Fifth National Reports to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) - National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) - Review of EbA and Eco-DRR projects funded by international, regional or national donors - National Disaster Management Plans - National Adaptation Programmes of Actions - Africa Environment Outlook - Case studies from a broader literature review - Project documents and reports/case studies - Published articles on ecosystem- based adaptation related issues. The desk review was complemented by structured interviews based on a questionnaire targeting stakeholders from the focal countries in order to gain more information on experiences on the ground and on ecosystem-based related activities. Stakeholders included government agencies, (mainly from the environment sector), international organisations, non-governmental organisations, research institutes, and other stakeholders involved in Eco-DRR and biodiversity activities. A total of 28 questionnaires were sent with 14 responses received from the following countries: Mali, DRC, Senegal, Nigeria, Togo and Ghana (six countries out of eight focal countries). The list of institutions contacted is available in annex 1. While the topic is relevant to all countries in the region, an assessment for all countries is beyond the scope of this project. Therefore, countries were selected based on the following criteria: \u2022\ufffd Availability\ufffdof\ufffdinformation\ufffdon\ufffdDRR\ufffd and Eco-DRR for the country \u2022\ufffd Countries\ufffdwhere\ufffdthere\ufffdis\ufffdan\ufffdEPIC\ufffdproject\ufffd i.e. Burkina Faso and Senegal \u2022\ufffd Experience\ufffdand/or\ufffdcurrent\ufffdor\ufffdpast\ufffdprojects\ufffd in DRR or Eco-DRR in the countries \u2022\ufffd French/English\ufffdspeaking\ufffdcountries\ufffdand\ufffd West/Central African countries In order to expand on the theoretical concepts, the report contains examples and case studies from the above-mentioned focal countries, some of which have been compiled from questionnaire responses. For countries where data is lacking or not accessible, regional information has been used to elaborate. 2. Methodology 8 Central and West Africa has a variety of ecosystems (savannas, forests, deserts, mangroves, oceans, wetlands...), which confers its great biodiversity. The forest ecosystems of Upper Guinea, the Congo Basin, the Afromontane forests between Nigeria and Cameroon and of the Albertine Rift are considered areas of high biodiversity. These ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services, which the population depend on for their subsistence, are facing many pressures and threats including poaching, bush fires, land conversion for agriculture, as well as climate change. The Sahel region and its population, is especially exposed and vulnerable to natural hazards because of the climate conditions, its location and its social, economic and demographic characteristics. It has to cope with the increase, over the last decade, in the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods. In West Africa, between 1900 and 2015, 170,012 people were killed as a result of drought (EM-DAT, 2016). 3.1. Climate, ecosystems and biodiversity in West and Central Africa Climate West Africa covers a climatic gradient characterised by annual precipitation varying from 250 mm to 3,000 mm. West Africa has wet and dry seasons resulting from the interaction of two migrating air masses: (i) hot, dry tropical continental air mass of the northern high pressure system, which gives rise to the Harmattan winds (dry and dusty) which blow from the Sahara over most of West Africa from November to February; (ii) the moisture- laden, tropical maritime or equatorial air mass which produces southwest winds. These two air masses meet at the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

West Africa is projected to experience unprecedented and increasingly variable climates with respect to current climate conditions much earlier in the century (Janes and al., 2015). Central Africa\u2019s climate varies from tropical-dry to humid equatorial (UNEP, 2013). Rainfall is relatively high and reliable over the central and coastal parts of the subregion but tends to diminish and become more variable towards the north. The city of Douala in coastal Cameroon, for example, has an average rainfall of 3,850 mm/year while the city of N\u2019Djamena in Chad only receives 500 mm/ year, and suffers periodic drought. Temperatures in the low-lying coastal forests vary little because persistent cloud keeps mean annual temperatures between 26\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C. In the high-relief mountainous areas, mean annual temperatures are low, between 19\u00b0C and 24\u00b0C (UNEP, 2002). The variability of rainfall patterns confers a great diversity of ecosystems, fauna and flora species. Expected changes in climate Scientists have performed high-resolution regional climate modelling experiments to assess the potential changes in temperature and rainfall across West Africa. These experiments all suggest a general warming trend, in agreement with wider global climate experiments. There is also an increase in variability within the regional climate results, which could result in a greater frequency of unusually hot events. The high level of agreement across global and regional climate models for West Africa strongly suggests that a projected increase in temperature is very likely to occur. The projections of rainfall patterns with both regional and global climate modelling experiments are highly variable, and contain little to no consensus on either the direction or magnitude of potential changes in rainfall. (Janes et al., 2015). The greater frequency of hot events may also lead to an increase in the frequency of droughts, with impacts on ecosystems and livelihoods in the region, with low levels of productivity of ecosystems and crops (UNFCCC, 2007).

Of the 400 million hectares constituting the Congo basin, nearly 200 million are covered by the forest, including 90% of dense tropical forest. More than 99% of the forest surface consists of primary or naturally regenerated forests. The distribution of the various types of forests is strongly correlated with annual precipitations. Figure 2: Hotspots of West and Central Africa (Conservation International, 2011) The forests of the north are subject to a severe, hot dry season while the rest, in particular the forests of the west, experience milder dry seasons (Megevand, 2013). African wetlands are among the most diversified habitats in the world in terms of animal and plant species, including endemic species, and migratory species such as the West African manatee and many waterbird species that depend on this important ecosystem for their survival. They also play an important role in the regulation of greenhouse gases as they store carbon, thus contributing to climate change adaptation as an important carbon reservoir. West Africa alone contains 30% (80 sites out of a total of 275) of the wetlands of international importance present on the African continent (Ramsar, 2007). Mangroves are coastal forests particularly found in tropical and subtropical regions; these areas are frequently inundated with salt water. They are among the most productive ecosystems on the planet. African mangroves are home to very diverse Figure 3: Forest ecosystems in the Congo Basin and their biodiversity (Megevand, 2013). Legend Hotspot area Regional assessment on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity in West and Central Africa 11 fauna. Their roots and mud are home to molluscs, such as bivalves and oysters, and crustaceans. Live and decaying mangrove leaves and roots provide nutrients that nourish plankton, which in turn are food for many of these species. With this abundance of food, mangroves function as nurseries for many fish species; many commercially caught fish have spent part of their lives in mangroves. Their capacity to protect against storms and sea level rise make them indispensable for coastal communities in their fight against climate change. The African country with the largest mangrove area is Nigeria with 1 million ha1. The forests of the Congo basin host a rich biodiversity with a very high level of endemic species. Forests of low altitude consist of more than 10,000 species of higher plants, of which 3,000 are endemic. The forests are also home to elephants and buffaloes, as well as endemic species such as the okapi, the bongo, the bonobo, the gorilla, and many endemic bird species. The flora and fauna are, however, unequally distributed, so that the wealth in species varies from one area to another. The areas that are home to the largest variety of species are the forests of Low Guinea to the west (Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon) and those of the Albertine Rift in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (Megevand, 2013). The Democratic Republic of Congo is part of the Great Lakes region (GLR); the lakes of this region host a great diversity of fish fauna with at least 1,419 freshwater fish species recorded. Most of these species are endemic; they are also globally threatened (40% of the African total of fishes mentioned in the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM). The GLR also hosts an important number of terrestrial (168) and freshwater (108) Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) (Birdlife, 2016). Protected areas are one of the approaches recognised to protect this important biodiversity. They are defined by the IUCN as \u201cA protected area is a clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\u201d.

Protected areas play an important role in carbon regulation. It is estimated that approximately 15% of carbon is stored in the world\u2019s protected areas (UICN/WCPA, 2007). Ecosystem services and livelihoods The goods and services provided by the ecosystems can be classified in four main categories: \u2022\ufffd Provisioning\ufffdservices\ufffdsuch\ufffdas\ufffd food, water, wood, fibre. \u2022\ufffd Providing\ufffdservices\ufffdsuch\ufffdas\ufffdclimate\ufffd regulation, water flow, disease control, waste decomposition, and water purification. \u2022\ufffd Cultural\ufffdservices\ufffdsuch\ufffdas\ufffdspiritual\ufffdbenefits,\ufffd recreational and aesthetic values. \u2022\ufffd Supporting\ufffdservices\ufffdsuch\ufffdas\ufffdphotosynthesis,\ufffd soil formation and nutrient cycling. (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). West and Central Africa ecosystems, including those that are in protected areas, provide such goods and services and the population benefit from them. In West Africa, cereals and tubers constitute the staple diet of the rural communities. The small wild game also often constitutes an important source of animal protein. Other resources, particularly non-timber forest products (NTFP), are a source of income for people and their families; they include for instance honey, shea butter and wild fruits. Culturally, certain species of animal are used during ancestral rites in villages or during ceremonies (weddings, funerals). 1 http://africa.wetlands.org/Africanwetlands/Mangroves/tabid/2938/language/fr-FR/Default.aspx 3. Regional overview (cont.) 3. Regional overview (cont.) 12 The majority of the population living in the Congo basin forest is still indigenous, and directly depends on the forest products. The non-timber forest products include the products of the hive (honey, wax, propolis), wild mango, the pygeum, gum arabic, nuts, fruits, larvae, mushrooms, raffia and bamboo. Their use varies according to the culture, socio-economic status, access to the forest, markets and prices and, to a certain extent (in particular for bush meat), on whether the harvest is legal or not (Megevand, 2013). The ecosystems also provide other services such as regulation of rainfall, protection against strong winds and flood control especially in Central Africa where rainfall is important, and providing raw materials such as timber for construction and firewood, fruit, seeds, animal fodder and medicinal substances. Other additional advantages include climate regulation at the regional level, which increases climate change resilience. Indeed, the forests of the Congo basin have the ability to sequester great quantities of carbon. The tropical forests store a quarter of the world\u2019s terrestrial carbon stock present in the vegetation and ground (Megevand, 2013). Even if the figures vary, total carbon stored in the Congo basin is estimated at approximately 60 billion tonnes, the greatest part being in the Democratic Republic of Congo. But deforestation and degradation of the forests constitute a major source of carbon emissions. It is estimated that 10% to 25% of global anthropogenic emissions result from the loss of natural forests (Megevand, 2013). In terms of socio-economic importance, protected areas constitute a source of employment for local communities as they may find jobs as tour guides for instance or trackers. Threats to biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem functions African ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services, which have significance for the people living in the countries of the region, are unfortunately facing many pressures and threats including: poaching, illegal fishing, uncontrolled bush fires, illegal grazing, over-use of timber, mining, land conversion for agriculture, and climate change.

The Guinean forest is an important sanctuary of West African biodiversity but is also one of the most vulnerable regions of the planet Regional assessment on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity in West and Central Africa 13 because it is critically fragmented. In 2010, only 15% of the original forest cover of this hotspot remained intact (Thiombiano & Kampmann, 2010). In particular, climate change is considered as the main threat to biodiversity (IPCC, 2002). The rise in air temperature, change in rainfall patterns and increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods are some of the manifestations of climate change. In the Sahel region, for example, average rainfall has decreased by 25% (UNFCCC, 2006) in the past 30 years. Wetlands can be negatively affected by climate change through rising sea level, and the intrusion of salt water into freshwater resources. Likewise, climate change has negative impacts on the composition, diversity and functioning of freshwater ecosystems. Warming and hence the increase in water temperature will alter communities\u2019 composition including the composition of fungi, with a direct consequence on rates of organic matter decomposition. This has impacts on food webs; as a result, some species on the trophic chain may no longer be available (migration or death) with changes in prey and predator distribution, composition and diversity (Woodward et al., 2010). Increasing demographic pressure, poor knowledge of the law and poor law enforcement, poverty as well as climate change exacerbate these threats. With the many threats affecting biodiversity and ecosystems, resilience becomes an important concept as it concerns the ability of ecosystems to resist and recover from these disturbances. There are different sorts of environmental changes that should be considered: they may be rapid-onset (e.g. disease), chronic (e.g. habitat loss), or transitory (e.g. drought) perturbations. Of course, the impacts of environmental perturbations on ecosystem functions will depend on the presence of ecosystem characteristics that confer resilience. Oliver et al. (2015) described some of the mechanisms that characterise an ecosystem as resilient including: species sensitivity to environmental change, adaptive phenotypic plasticity, genetic variability, local environmental heterogeneity and landscape connectivity. 3.2. Hazards in West and Central Africa and most vulnerable countries In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of disasters has considerably increased in frequency and intensity especially regarding extreme climate events such as droughts and floods. During the last four decades, more than 1,000 disasters occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, among which 300 disasters between 2005 and 2010 affected more than 330 million people. Drought and floods together account for 80 percent of loss of life and 70 percent of economic losses linked to natural hazards in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2010). Main hazards in West and Central Africa include: floods, droughts, landslides, sea level rise, invasive species and locust invasion, extreme temperature (heat waves), windstorms (violent winds) and gullies erosion. In addition to the above, there is strong coastal erosion along the whole West Africa coastline, from Mauritania to Nigeria. At the same time, soil erosion and desertification, which also threaten food security, continue to develop due to these extreme weather events. These hazards are a consequence of climate change, and they sometimes lead to disasters. Geological disasters, such as earthquakes and volcanoes, occur to a lesser extent (World Bank, 2010). The most vulnerable and poor people are more severely affected, especially people that depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Indeed the climatic risks lead to deficits in production, loss of cattle, and reduced availability of fisheries and forest resources (FAO, 2011). Droughts have particularly become more frequent since the late 1960s in the Central African Sahelian zone, leading to food insecurity and crisis, particularly among the poor (UNEP, 2002). Flooding is common in the more humid areas of Central Africa, especially where forests and natural vegetation have been cleared for cultivation or human settlements. Indeed, forests, including forest protected areas, play a very important role in protecting the ecosystem from floods because they provide space for water to disperse (Dudley et al., 2010). Almost bare soils without proper vegetation cover will therefore become more vulnerable to floods.

The graph above shows that the two main hazards in West Africa are droughts and floods. Droughts are particularly important in the Sahel region because rainfall tends to be reduced in this region (see section 3.1 above). From a recent study which analysed the links between climate change, protected areas and communities in different sites in West Africa, the main climate hazards identified by the local communities interviewed and in the literature review are: drought, flooding, strong winds, heatwaves, irregular rainfall, and sea level rises for coastal areas (Masumbuko & Somda, 2014). West Africa has experienced droughts since the 1970s. This is due to climate variability. Rainfall variability, for instance, is considerable and often reaches 40\u201380% (African Studies Center, 1999). The region is also exposed to rising sea levels in the coastal countries. In West Africa, the areas that are most vulnerable to sea level rise or extreme oceanic events (extremely high tides) are the most populated areas, sometimes the most urbanised given that the capital cities and greatest urban centres of countries like Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Togo, Benin, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, etc., are located on the coast. In the Gulf of Guinea, sea level rise could submerge (even destroy) immersed land in coastal lagoons, whereas changing precipitation patterns could affect the flow of rivers which supply them (UNEP, 2002). This situation also affects many rural communities on the coast that rely on land and water resources for their subsistence: in particular, increased salinisation due to sea level rise will affect the ability of the surrounding land to produce, for instance, vegetable products. The region experiences the risk of landslides, which is high in countries with hilly terrain, high levels of rainfall, soil erosion and deforestation due to unsustainable land management (World Bank, 2010). Soil erosion, especially gully erosion, an advanced level of land degradation that can irreversibly affect the soil\u2019s productivity is seen in northern Cameroon as well as in southern Nigeria. In this part of Nigeria, there are an estimated 3,000 gullies, which can be up to 10 km long with multiple fingers spreading through the rural or urban landscape. In southeastern states, gullies and areas exposed to erosion tripled; the total area affected by rill, sheet or gully erosion has increased from about 1.33% (1,021 km2) in 1976 to about 3.7% (2,820 km2) in 2006 (World Bank, 2011). Figure 5: Number of countries affected per type of natural hazard in West Africa, 1900-2015 Source: EM-DAT Database (2016) Regional assessment on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity in West and Central Africa 15 In West Africa there are important areas of seasonal breeding sites of pests such as the desert locust, the Senegalese locust, seed-eating birds and rodents; these areas are vulnerable to epidemics and to invasions on a large scale in favourable ecological conditions. The seasonal breeding sites in the subregion are mainly in Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. The presence of these devastating pests, as well as their distribution depends on the climate. For example, increased rainfall, especially beyond the usual season, and consequently the expansion of the wetlands, can be favourable to the development of the desert locust and the red bug of the cotton plant. Regular surveillance in the breeding zones allows control at an early stage before these zones grow wider and are difficult to contain. The graph below shows the number of countries of West Africa affected per type of natural hazard from 1900 to 2015. Figure 6: Vulnerability of countries to floods in West and Central Africa, 1900-2015 Source: EM-DAT (2016) Here again, drought and floods are the most important hazards affecting the countries of West Africa. All the countries of the subregion have been affected by floods, and almost all of them have been affected by droughts.

The Nyiragongo volcano contains an active lava lake; this activity is regularly monitored at Rusayo seismic station http://www.volcanolive.com/ nyiragongo.html (5 April 2016). Africa is considered the most vulnerable region to the effects of climate change in the world (Boko and al., 2007). This vulnerability is aggravated by the high dependence of large populations on natural Figure 8: Vulnerability of countries to disasters, 1900\u20132015 (EM-DAT, 2016) 3. Regional overview (cont.) 3. Regional overview (cont.) 16 resources, including marginalised communities, who are affected through reductions in income and unavailability of food from agricultural production. The fact that agriculture in Africa is mainly dependent on rainfall means that small changes in rainfall patterns can significantly jeopardise the livelihoods of most producers (UNEP, 2013). Countries located in the Sahel are the most vulnerable: among the countries selected for this study, Mali for instance has a Sahelian climate, characterised by great inter-annual rainfall variability, leading to recurrent dry years which have become increasingly frequent since 1968 (Masumbuko and Somda, 2014). The figure below shows the vulnerability of the focal countries to natural disasters by showing the number of disaster events during the period 1900\u20132015. All focal countries are almost equally affected by natural hazards, but not necessarily the same ones. For instance, countries like Burkina Faso and Mali will mainly suffer from droughts, whereas Nigeria, Togo and Senegal will be affected by sea level rise or erosion. Cameroon and DRC have to face other hazards (geological) related to volcanoes. Wildfire is not considered a natural hazard in West and Central Africa because it is managed by people for agropastoral activities and hunting activities. Wildfire becomes uncontrolled in this region when it spreads due to environmental conditions that increase the risks of uncontrolled fire and stimulate its spreading. For instance, extreme temperature, strong winds and drought conditions are the triggers of uncontrolled wildfire, which can destroy large areas of forest. Drought periods (due to climate variability), especially if they are severe and successive can exacerbate the risks and occurrence of wildfire. This was the case in Chad that experienced two great droughts in 1984/1985 and in 1993/1994, and which caused drying of ecosystems making it more vulnerable to wildfire. As a result, it caused widespread wildfire and destroying the habitat of certain wildlife species (Boulanodji, 2014). 3.3.

In addition to the decline in animal and plant biodiversity used by people, the reduction in grazing land, drop in crop yields and animal production may led to decreased household income, food insecurity, health problems and increased poverty in general. This has been reported in West Africa (Masumbuko & Somda, 2014). During the past ten years in West Africa, several extreme climatic events have caused major damages that have affected infrastructure, people and biodiversity. In the Gambia, for instance, most affected by flooding were houses, communications (roads and telephone lines) and crops. More than 18,000 people were affected by food insecurity due to flooding, violent winds and forest fires in 2009. In 2010, 34,990 people were affected by flooding, the most affected areas being those with the highest population densities (Tanji, Tanbi and the area of Banjul) (Sonko, 2013). In West Africa, in 2009 the irregularity of the rains in Niger and Chad, and in the north-east of Mali, the north of Burkina Faso and the extreme north of Nigeria, caused severe shortages in food production, and fodder and water for cattle. This situation directly contributed to the food and nutrition crisis of which more than 10 million people were victims in 2010. Table 1: Number of people killed in West Africa as a result of disasters, 1900-2015 (EM-DAT, 2016) Number of people killed (West Africa) Natural hazards 170,012 drought 3,319 flood 82 landslide 540 storm 78 extreme temperature In 2010 with the abundant rainfall, food availability was improved but the rain also caused serious floods that caused severe damages to crops. In total 1.8 million people were affected and more than 141,000 hectares of food and cash crops were destroyed, in particular in Benin (more than 73,000 hectares), Chad (52,600 hectares), Burkina Faso (6,500 hectares), Niger (5,000 hectares) and to a lesser extent in other countries like Ghana, Mali, Gambia, Guinea, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Livestock were also affected by the floods that caused the death of many cattle by drowning or because of water-related diseases (more than 70,000 heads of cattle lost in Niger and 3,000 in Mali) (FAO, 2011). In 2010, floods in the White Volta River Basin in Ghana affected hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed many of their livelihoods. Major cities in the country are regularly affected by urban floods2. The graph below gives an idea of the economic damage of natural hazards. Here, floods are the most costly hazards, followed by droughts. Given the different data presented in the graphs we can easily state that droughts and floods in West Africa are: the most common hazards found, the hazards affecting more people and countries, and the hazards that cost the most in terms of economic damage. There is therefore an urgent need to enhance and optimise the resilience and recovery (including restoration of ecosystems affected) of both people and the ecosystems. Figure 9: Total damage in West Africa as a result of disas- ter (in US$). (EM-DAT, 2016) In south-east Nigeria, gullies create damage to infrastructure including roads, highways and pipelines, houses and buildings that collapse, and silted waterways, reservoirs and the Calabar (major city) port. Damage to natural resources includes loss of productive farmland and forest. Forest and farmland 2 https://www.gfdrr.org/sites/gfdrr/files/region/GH.pdf. 3. Regional overview (cont.) 3. Regional overview (cont.) degradation also compromise watershed functions. This process exacerbates erosion downstream and siltation, compromises biodiversity important for livelihoods, and weakens natural buffers against climate and erosion risk. It is important to note that in West Africa, women are particularly affected by disasters, and therefore are more vulnerable than the men to the crises and impacts. Women represent more than 43 percent of the employed population of the agricultural sector in the subregion. Given that agricultural production dedicated to subsistence in this subregion is almost exclusively based on rainfed agriculture, women are therefore vulnerable because they depend on climate conditions and environmental factors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4be2711e-37ba-4b41-a30b-d3ae5933b92f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4be2711e-37ba-4b41-a30b-d3ae5933b92f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional assessment on ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and biodiversity in West and Central Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc3874fdb59a130f1d9e969eb0b013042d4ba9a5c2b30adf73bee1533b1dd647"}, "2": {"node_id": "2fc834dd-9d28-4f03-9109-8a8c0654a879", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b78367b1668cb405042d5e76c82c02723a004263e9a0ffe724416a9a71d2f5c2"}}, "hash": "172f20554d96694cfc26d051d319f4211e877c0382f98e6406dee6ab1ac881c1", "text": "The vulnerability of women is also related to the fact that their access to the means of production, in particular to credit, inputs (seeds, manure, plant health products) and to farm equipment, is limited.

According to the Imeama-Ngwo community, the drainage channel for the reservoir should have been directed into the stream running down the hill, but was not. Instead, the channel ended close to the reservoir, resulting first in rill and sheet erosion, but which quickly grew into a large and expanding gully. Since the erosion occurred, this has affected the community sacred forest, and the trees of several families where many residents have their cashew and oil palm trees as well as other cash crops. This land is now cut off from them, requiring them to travel long distances to reach their farms. The community is also cut off from other communities, affecting their social linkages. To address erosion, the community has planted cashew trees and grasses along one gully finger, but the gully continues to expand. An additional problem has been the silting of the stream where residents used to get their water. The residents complained that although the reservoir is on their land so that other people can have a good water supply, the community itself does not have adequate drinking water. To overcome this, the residents practise water harvesting during the rainy season or now have to buy their water. The situation continues to worsen (World Bank, 2011).

Implementation of Eco- DRR in the region Vulnerability to disasters and to climate change depends on three factors, namely: exposure, sensitivity and adaptability (GIEC, 2001; GIEC, 2014). Therefore, in the context of disasters, reducing vulnerability involves looking for solutions to reduce exposure and sensitivity and increase adaptability. Reducing exposure to disasters will consist of trying to relocate human settlements and economic activities out of the high risk-prone areas (i.e. coastal areas, areas that are subject to flooding and landslides, or areas exposed to strong winds). Other nature- based options are, for instance, the rehabilitation of mangroves to reduce coastal flooding, thus reducing their impacts on ecosystems and people, or tree plantation to increase infiltration rates and reduce runoff, especially in urban areas. Indeed trees have the ability to intercept rainfall with their leaves, reducing at the same time the volume of runoff. Trees (tree root growth) play an important role in stormwater management: in urban areas, where subsoils are often impermeable and compact, tree roots can penetrate compacted subsoils and increase infiltration rates and improve groundwater recharge (Kazemi & Sepaskhah, 2016; Bartens et al., 2008). An example of actions to reduce sensitivity is the support for the development of alternatives to sand harvesting along the beaches of the West African coastland, such as in Senegal. Indeed, in such a situation, a coastland where the sand has not been harvested is less sensitive to erosion for a certain degree of exposure to sea level rise, than one where sand has been harvested (Diop et al., 2014). Several tools and methodologies as well as several activities have been developed over the years to mitigate and reduce vulnerability to natural hazards, by strengthening adaptive capacity. They include activities that promote access to information and technologies, natural infrastructure building, natural resources and ecosystem management, and strengthening institutional capacities. Restoration is one of these tools. It is about \u201cassisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed\u201d (Keenleyside et al., 2012; Dudley et al., 2010). It is therefore an intervention to re-establish the structure (e.g. species composition), and functionalities of the ecosystem (e.g. productivity). Restoration also contributes in responding to climate change challenges, especially adaptation, by strengthening/enhancing resilience to climate change, and climate change mitigation through increased carbon storage by ecosystems. Restoration of habitats or of populations of particular species in a landscape restoration approach provides the opportunity to prevent and/ or recover from damage, and enhance ecological and social resilience to environmental change. Forest landscape restoration may reduce the risk of floods and erosion by increasing the ability of forest to control floods. Likewise, mangrove restoration may reduce the risks of floods in coastal areas. Mangrove restoration has been implemented in many parts of the region as a management strategy to improve the capacity of mangrove to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects and to protect coastal zones from strong winds and floods (serve as windbreak and buffer zone). These areas are also host to many edible species, thus they help fight hunger and malnutrition. It is important to note that all initiatives described below are not necessarily being implemented from a DRR perspective, but they may show clear links with and contributions to Eco-DRR outcomes. 4.1.1 West Africa In Nigeria, the Living on the Edge Project implemented by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) is a four-year project covering the Jigawa, Yobe and Sokoto States in the northern part of Nigeria. The objective is to restore and conserve natural dryland and wetland habitats and improve peoples\u2019 livelihoods. In this area, the proliferation of Typha weeds has negative impacts on water resources. The project will, among others, reduce the negative impact of this weed on water resource use by the fishers and farming communities. Clearing of invasive typha weeds will improve habitats for fishes and enhance fishing navigation on the extensive water system. It will also improve the water resource for 4.

This project will contribute to Eco-DRR outcomes as it will address the issue of a natural hazard (erosion) by looking at an ecosystem approach (FLR approach). In Senegal and Burkina Faso, the Ecosystems Protecting Infrastructure and Communities (EPIC) project, implemented by IUCN is documenting the role of and improving ecosystem management for disaster risk reduction. Since its inception in 2013, the project is working with local communities to respond to climate change impacts and restore arable lands that have been degraded by droughts, salinisation, floods and soil erosion. Community resilience is being built through two main activities: 1) strengthening of local capacities to understand vulnerabilities and taking action by using best practices and 2) promoting effective policies for integrated approaches to disasters, climate change and environment management. Endogenous land practices to restore the land and increase agricultural output are implemented in six villages in each country. For example, anti-salt bunds that reduce salt intrusion and contribute to retain freshwater have been installed to recover more than 180 ha of cultivated land in villages in Senegal. In Burkina Faso, traditional practices like stone lines and Za\u00ef that conserve water resources have been established to restore 150 ha of land. In both countries, assisted natural regeneration and reforestation is also carried out to increase tree cover and improve soil quality. One of the species that is used in Burkina Faso to improve soil quality is Faidherbia albida, also used in Mali and Niger. In these countries, this species planted through assisted natural regeneration has improved yields of millet and sorghum (Raffaello & Morris, 2015). In Benin, the Alliance mondiale contre le changement climatique (AMCC) is implementing since 2012, an 8 million euros project targeting forests. The project has promoted the conservation and sustainable use of open forests in the lower Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River Valley, to reduce the effects of floods in downstream areas, thus contributing to Eco-DRR outcome. The project also supported the collection of new GIS data and new maps covering the whole country in order to, among others, improve capacities in land management and disaster risk reduction. The project further recognised the importance of mapping and of early warning systems to improve the capacity to respond to disasters, the involvement of communities, and the promotion of local forest management based on forests to ensure their sustainable management. In Mali, the Programme de D\u00e9veloppement Durable du Delta Int\u00e9rieur du Niger (PDD-DIN) (Programme for the sustainable development of the Inner Niger Delta), was implemented between 2013 and 2015 in three regions of Mali (Mopti, Tombouctou, Segou), with the objective of improving the resilience of beneficiaries through increasing awareness about the integrated management of natural resources, including the root causes of climate change, and their implications and adaptation measures. As a wetland, the Inner Niger Delta, will be severely affected by the impacts of climate change given that climate change affects water resources and water cycles (IEPF/UICN, 2008); these effects will include: the modification of breeding periods, the modification of species migratory periods, the modification of the duration of the growth season, and the modification of species distribution and population density. Therefore, the protection of this ecosystem remains a priority. Here, the activities related to Eco-DRR included restoring forests and the protection of forest areas to protect the landscape that supports the whole ecosystem from natural hazards such as floods, which can occur in the flood-prone areas. In Ghana, the Wildlife Division is implementing a project titled \u201cRehabilitation and conservation of 13 Nigeria Erosion and Watershed management project 14 The Bonn Challenge is a global aspiration to restore 150 million hectares of the world\u2019s deforested and degraded lands by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030 Regional assessment on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity in West and Central Africa 33 degraded mangroves\u201d. The objective is to restore ecological functions of mangroves (spawning grounds of fish, shrimp, flood control, shoreline stabilisation, sustainable supply of fuelwood to local fisher communities, and enhancement of carbon stocks) and improve local well-being.

For instance, the project developed management plans for protected areas that consider the possible effects of climate change, and activities under these plans are implemented taking into account the changing climate. Therefore, with such management plans, protected areas will be better prepared to cope with erosion, floods and droughts, provided that adequate species (resistant to these hazards) are also protected within the protected area system. 4.1.2 Central Africa The five-year project entitled \u201cR\u00e9duction des risques des catastrophes et li\u00e9es aux conflits\u201d (Reducing disaster risks and conflict related risks) is being implemented in the Eastern DRC (North and South Kivu). Its objective is to enhance the resilience of the communities to disasters and conflicts. Some of the activities related to Eco-DRR include the plantation of trees and installation of devices to protect against soil erosion. The project has produced community-based disaster risk reduction action plans in some localities (Kibumba, Mutaho, Kingi, Luhonga, Bweremana, Minova and Kalungu) and a contingency plan for Nyiragongo volcano. The capacity of forest to cope in a changing climate is important when we conduct forest restoration activities for disaster risk reduction; risk reduction depends on the coping capacity of the forest if the climate changes in the future. Therefore, management plans for such ecosystems, including protected areas, that are used for DRR must take into account climate change and future climate scenarios and projections, to make sure that they will effectively continue to reduce the risk if the climate changes. The PARCC project mentioned above could be replicated in the Central Africa region, and the tools adapted to be used in this subregion. 4.2. Eco-DRR for biodiversity Eco-DRR activities also contribute to biodiversity conservation, even if it is not specifically mentioned as a project primary objective. The protection and/or rehabilitation of mangroves to protect the whole ecosystems from floods and salt intrusion, for instance, will also provide habitats for wildlife species biodiversity especially migratory birds and their nesting areas. Mangroves are very productive ecosystems that might suffer from climate change effects unless they are sustainably managed; that way, they will conserve their ability to host specific bird habitat including that of endemic bird species. When Eco-DRR activities are implemented to combat invasive species (biological techniques), this protects both the biodiversity of the plant species already present in the ecosystem and the other organisms (mutualistic partners and predators) they interact with to determine their competitive performance: by reducing the competition from the invasive species, the native species can therefore survive. 4.2.1 West Africa The Living on the Edge Project is implemented in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal and Mauritania. It aims to restore and protect the habitats of birds 15 Mali, Togo, Chad, Gambia, Sierra Leone. www.parcc.protectedplanet.net 4. Eco-DRR experiences in the region (cont.) 4.

In Nigeria, the project (see above) is contributing to biodiversity through the improvement of habitats for both fish and waterfowls. Also the project has generated a database of the bird population and it serves as a policy and advocacy tool in conserving the bird population in the area. There is also improvement in the vegetation cover as a result of establishing community plantations. The trees were planted to reduce the incursion of sand dunes and create a suitable habitat for birds. All these results therefore contribute to biodiversity conservation16. In Burkina Faso, the project restored the natural landscape along the birds\u2019 flyway. They used local seeds to naturally regenerate the landscape.

Some of the results contributing to biodiversity conservation include: - The establishment and management of conservation areas around Oti-Keran National Park in the north of Togo - The management of a sacred forest (Godjin-Godj\u00e8) within the Biosphere reserve of Delta du Mono - The management of fisheries resources and the conservation of the manatee (threatened) in lake Togo - The conservation of marine turtles and marine mammals in Togo with full participation of fisher communities living on the coast and creation of an MPA. While working on improving the resilience of communities by putting in place community-based management planning, the project will at the same time conserve the biodiversity of the ecosystem. 4.2.2 Central Africa In DRC, a project entitled \u201cAm\u00e9nagement du Bassin versant par le reboisement des esp\u00e8ces anti\u00e9rosives et agro-foresti\u00e8res \u00e0 Mwenda- Ruwenzori\u201d, implemented in the province of North Kivu in the Virunga area, for the protection of the watershed system will also reduce logging in the 16 http://www.ncfnigeria.org/projects/the-living-on-the-edge-project 17 Bombouaka reservoir is a small reservoir primarily for supplying drinking water to Bombouaka and nearby villages.

Biodiversity case for Eco-DRR 4.3.1. Ecosystem and ecosystem services Ecosystems play an important role in DRR measures provided they are maintained in good conservation status, healthy and functioning. Mangroves and other coastal vegetation stabilise shorelines, thus reducing the impacts of storms. Lakes and marshes reduce peak flooding, and in arid regions wetlands provide relief from droughts (Dudley et al., 2015). Mangrove forests provide protection and shelter against extreme weather events, such as storm winds and floods, as well as tsunamis. Mangroves absorb and disperse tidal surges associated with these events. Mangroves can reduce wave height by 66% over 100 m of forest, and a mangrove stand of 30 trees per 0.01 hectare with a depth of 100 m can reduce the destructive force of a tsunami by up to 90%18. Conserving forests to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration can reduce the risks of soil erosion or landslides by stabilising slopes. Protected areas are one of the tools to conserve biodiversity (a means of conservation). The Biosphere reserve of Delta du Saloum in Senegal is managed to provide resilience against climate change. Indeed communities themselves are involved in restoration activities of the degraded lands of the reserve in order to increase their resilience in the face of climate change. Restoring the capacity of the protected area to fight against climate change will also enhance its capacity to be fully functional and act as a buffer against coastal erosion and flood risks. It will also improve its capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services for people\u2019s livelihood.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a8ffd3e-cb40-4132-9293-df833b8da167": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a8ffd3e-cb40-4132-9293-df833b8da167", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional assessment on ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and biodiversity in West and Central Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6187060a22469b586d74619e866007fe6a9473ef576b04864fe5bcf458d2bcb6"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc813dd5-57ff-4410-b31a-68085fd41edd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8c61abc20b8e9c0996d827d22c036b1e987bc08d3ec197b270a990f1099fd38"}}, "hash": "d58315e1f4210ec30e151e3c930104b5e50fbc4c9d271ad9f284f365887fe6be", "text": "It will also improve its capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services for people\u2019s livelihood.

Biodiversity Likewise, biodiversity can play an important role in Eco-DRR measures, including enhancing the resi- lience of farming systems to natural hazards such as drought. Oliver et al. (2015) have described some of the mechanisms underpinning the resistance and recovery of ecosystem functions to environmental perturbation. They include species-level mechanisms, community-level mechanisms and landscape-le- vel mechanisms. The contribution of biodiversity to Eco-DRR concerns species-level mechanisms; they relate to the specific biological or ecological traits of a species that might confer a resistance to environmen- tal changes. The authors provide hypotheses for the effects of these mechanisms on the resilience of eco- system functions. These hypotheses are as follows: - Sensitivity to environmental change: such species possess traits that increase or reduce their capacity to persist in the face of environmental perturbation. Species with reduced sensitivity to environmental change will provide higher resistance of ecosystem functions. As an example, trees and plants vary in their sensitivity to drought depending on nonstructural carbohydrate levels, which will in turn affect the resistance of the ecosystem functions that they provide. - Intrinsic rate of population increase: capacity of species populations to grow rapidly. Species with a high intrinsic rate of increase will recover more quickly from environmental perturbations. 4. Eco-DRR experiences in the region (cont.) 18 http://africa.wetlands.org/Africanwetlands/Mangroves/tabid/2938/language/fr-FR/Default.aspx 4. Eco-DRR experiences in the region (cont.) 19 http://books.openedition.org/irdeditions/556?lang=fr 36 - Adaptive phenotypic plasticity: this applies for species that have the capacity to respond to environmental changes through flexible behavioural or physiological strategies that promote their survival and the resistance of ecosystem functions. For example, species that have the capacity to regulate temperature will increase their chances of surviving in extreme temperatures. - Genetic variability: species that have a high adaptive genetic variation will likely resist in the case of environmental disturbances; they will not be impacted along with their ecosystem functions. - Allee effects: this effect makes populations more susceptible to environmental perturbations. Those species that have an inability to find mates or avoid predators will be more susceptible to allee effects. In West Africa, millet tolerates particularly difficult conditions of production: drought and acidity of soils. Thus, it is generally admitted that millet will continue to play a significant role in this part of the world, especially with demographic pressure, the marginal lands of the arid and semi-arid regions will be exploited for the production of cereals. Genetic diversity of plant and animal species guarantees a diversified production for a rich and diverse diet, in a world where there is an urgent need to ensure food security given increased population and the increasing effects of climate change and variability. Crop wild relatives are a source of resistance genes to diseases, pests, droughts and extreme temperatures. They are also a source to maintain food security. They are used by farmers for their subsistence. Increasing the diversity of varieties of a given crop improves the chances that the crop will better cope with the hazards mentioned above because they are likely to be the most adaptable (as a consequence of diverse cropping systems) (Engels et al., 2014). The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has been working on improving millet for farmers in Niger, using participatory selection: farmers participate in the selection process in order to better target the demand and propose the best varieties adapted to climate change, and to crop conditions. By protecting the wild relatives of modern cultivated species like millet or sorghum in protected areas, the productivity of the species and their availability to be used for DRR purposes are increased.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c70d1402-1886-4e23-b68d-e37b8359e121": {"__data__": {"id_": "c70d1402-1886-4e23-b68d-e37b8359e121", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional assessment on ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and biodiversity in West and Central Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f37d9370e8701955ba23c367eec192abb54edb5d99706ed3ddb6247650d4871c"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b1d3b32-aa5e-4d01-89a8-a7675ff32e71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a50e68221a611d8e2ec88e7e2dc51af41456a834f4ede102f0ae0560b7ce2ba7"}}, "hash": "ad7f6c466890cc4cb675737f0b6117e658663185c08ed2583ede02eb5c7d2ae5", "text": "This has been the case in Mali and in Burkina Faso where agrobiodiversity of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench) is preserved in situ (Vom Brocke, K et al, 2016).

However, it should be noted that the practice of using crop wild relatives as a possible response to disaster reduction is not well developed in West and Central Africa yet and hence, there is a lack of information on the issue. There is an opportunity to develop this further in the region. Forest regeneration can also be used as a mechanism for Eco-DRR. By using genotypes that are resistant to droughts or artificial regeneration with specific tree species, or by controlling invasive species, biodiversity can contribute to Eco-DRR. For instance, Ziziphus mauritiana is a species of sahelo-sudanian to sudanian savannas. It grows in areas with rainfall varying between 250 and 2,000 mm a year. It can establish at up to 600 m of altitude. It is a very hardy species that tolerates severe droughts (from 6 to 12 months a year), and can grow in poor soils. Its deep and twisting root system enables it to tolerate long periods of droughts and combined crops. The species Vitelaria paradoxa (shea tree) is also a drought tolerant species. Its deep and twisting root system enables it to tolerate long droughts and combined culture can also resist to long periods of droughts. Forest ecosystems in Burkina Faso and Ghana are vulnerable to climate change, which manifests in these countries mainly through intense and frequent extreme climate events (high rainfall variability, Regional assessment on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity in West and Central Africa 37 leading to droughts or floods, high temperatures, windstorms, and forest fires). Sustainable forest management in Burkina Faso and Ghana under climate change will be highly dependent on successful natural regeneration and agroforestry measures such as artificial regeneration through reforestation and afforestation activities. However, reforestation and afforestation programmes in Burkina Faso and Ghana historically focused on large-scale projects without paying too much attention to small-scale natural and artificial regeneration at family farm and community levels. The countries have therefore promoted reforestation activities through both large- scale plantation development and small-scale on-farm regeneration activities. Species with high market value like Tectona grandis (teak) were planted in Ghana and other species used for reforestation activities include Cedrela species, Ceiba species, Khaya senegalensis (mahogany), and Triplochiton scleroxylon (wawa). Plant diversity has an important role to play in restoration activities and their success. Some species may be better adapted to a specific region and more resilient to climate change. And some species possess specific characteristics that are desirable for some restoration projects, for example, they may be resistant to drought or tolerant to salinity or have root structures that can contribute to prevent or reduce soil erosion. As mentioned earlier, assisted natural regeneration and reforestation is carried out in both Senegal and Burkina Faso as part of the EPIC project, to increase tree cover and restore the land. Deforestation driven by local demand for firewood further exacerbates land degradation brought about by salinisation and droughts in the two countries. The approaches and species used for the restoration activities are key factors here. Assisted natural regeneration (ANR) is a \u201clow-cost forest restoration method that can effectively convert deforested lands of degraded vegetation to more productive forests. The method aims to accelerate, rather than replace, natural successional processes by removing or reducing barriers to natural forest regeneration such as soil degradation, competition with weedy species, and recurring disturbances (e.g. fire, grazing and wood harvesting) (Shono et al., 2007). ANR provides an opportunity to integrate biodiversity in restoration activities as it focuses on restoring the existing pool of native species in the targeted area to be restored and these are also already adapted to the local climate. Using this method, the restored forest will support more biodiversity and provide more resources for subsistence (Shono et al., 2007). Tree seedlings are also produced by communities for reforestation in the two countries. In Senegal, due to salinisation, plant species that are salt-resistant are used in reforestation activities. In northern Burkina Faso, 12,000 local plants have been planted by 2015 to restore the land in six villages. A participatory approach using local knowledge was used to identify resilient local plant species that are being used in the reforestation activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdbb322b-d8ce-489d-8c70-8fe39d9667eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdbb322b-d8ce-489d-8c70-8fe39d9667eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional assessment on ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and biodiversity in West and Central Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6eb539204ca665036355c999a92c2e6299731e98ca9a9a8959fd9d532971b245"}, "2": {"node_id": "25bbedbd-d157-45e9-9aa6-9c84a1e7519a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47787987bc8716556ecb5e11b7ebeb01a7f7d0c1d7e629a699e75f7dd1cc8681"}}, "hash": "842d4338f556cc6e9d8fc0de267b7824846ff797d81af7357bc3992a8afd1394", "text": "In Senegal, in the areas of the Niayes, because of movements of the sand dunes caused by wind erosion, the dunes have invaded the houses and land used for vegetable production.

It should be noted that the majority of vegetable products for the whole country comes from this area. There are no examples of soil bioengineering and erosion control for the region. It should, however, be noted that the Vetiver System (VS) is a system that can reduce soil erosion, landslides, mudslides, road batter instability, and erosion (riverbanks, canals, coastlines, dikes, and earth-dam batters). Vetiveria zizanioides (L.) Nash. Vetiver, part of this system, is a densely tufted, awnless, wiry, glabrous perennial grass. It has a deep and rigorous root system that helps stabilise the slopes structurally while its shoots disperse surface run-off, reduce erosion, and trap sediments to facilitate the growth of native species. Furthermore, it is a fast growing species, has the ability to become quickly established in difficult soil conditions (hardpan, and rocky layers with weak spots), so it might even be more suitable than other plants for stabilising slopes. The main disadvantage of VS applications is the vetiver\u2019s intolerance to shading, particularly within the establishment phase. Vetiver also requires protection from livestock during its establishment phase. This species finds its origin 4. Eco-DRR experiences in the region (cont.) 4. Eco-DRR experiences in the region (cont.) 38 in Asia; however, there is an opportunity to find a species with the same characteristics in Africa in order to address the issue of slope stabilisation. Forest fires affect biological diversity. On a worldwide scale, they are an important source of carbon emissions and contribute to the warming of the planet, which could involve changes in biodiversity. At the regional and local levels, they modify the volume of the biomass, deteriorate the hydrological cycle with consequences on marine systems such as coral reefs, and influence the life cycle of plants and animals. New fires may occur in the following years, since vulnerable zones without vegetative cover will have been created by previous fires, and the species vulnerable to fire, like fire-dependent grass, proliferate. Wildfires are not a natural hazard in West and Central Africa (refer to section 3.2). However, land users can still control it naturally and therefore prevent the damages related to its extent. To avoid uncontrolled fires, voluntary bush fires are usually practiced in areas of savanna and in the Niger Delta. Farmers create fires in savanna and on the flooded plains with perennial grass to allow regeneration of a nutritive green grass of high quality for the cattle. But sometimes uncontrolled fires occur in the south sahelian area and destroy the herbaceous carpet thus depriving the cattle of pasture. Each year Senegal is also affected with bush fires, around the months of January and February. The fires destroy hundreds of thousands of hectares of Methods Description Market-based valuation quantifies the value of environmental goods and services traded in open commercial markets (e.g. direct use values of environmental tourism through the direct sales to tourists that may include expenditures on lodging and meals, entrance fees, concessions, etc.) Contingent valuation quantifies the value of an environmental good or service by asking people what they are willing to pay for it or willing to accept for its loss (concepts of \u201cwillingness to pay\u201d and \u201cwillingness to accept\u201d) Hedonic pricing uses existing markets \u2013 such as the property or labour markets \u2013 to determine the value of an environmental good or service Travel costs also uses existing markets to determine the value of an environmental asset from estimating the costs incurred when travelling to the environmental asset in terms of time, travel expenditures and entry fees Changes in productivity can be used to estimate the change in the value of production of a good or service that occurs as a result of the change in land use (e.g. if a protected forest provides a watershed service and is considered for logging, the change in land use would result in a change in the productivity of the farmers, which could be estimated as an indicator of the value of the forest\u2019s watershed service) Loss (or gain) of earnings evaluate the change in human productivity resulting from environmental deterioration or improvement Opportunity costs provide an estimate of the value of a natural ecosystem based on the foregone income of the next best alternative use of the area. Measuring the opportunity cost of the protected area, for example, can give the manager an idea of the competitive threats to the area.

Those of 2006 destroyed more than 400,000 hectares of farming lands. Thus, the government of Senegal has developed a project for the management and prevention of bush fires in eight rural communities on the periphery of the Niokolo Koba National Park, which is also a World Heritage site. This site of high biodiversity is threatened by recurrent bush fires. The objective of the project is to protect the biodiversity at risk in an area on the periphery of the Niokolo Koba National Park and participate in the mitigation of climate change. Activities include: preventing bush fires and the management of biodiversity and creation of open and green firewall protection (over a distance of 40 km); reduction of human pressures in the park; reforestation of the limits of the park and village territories; introduction of energy saving technologies (improved woodstoves, biogas, etc.). The aim of the firewalls is to create a break in the forest to reduce the intensity of fire and effectively fight the fire at specific areas. There are different types of firewalls; the selection of the firewall depends on the soil, financials means and the needs of the populations. Firewalls that could be used include: - open firewall: completely cleared, sometimes efficient to protect small areas; - firewall under natural vegetation (annually burnt with early fires): it borders an open firewall of five metres over a width of 30\u201340 metres, where the vegetation is burned at an early stage; - the cultivated firewall: located on the best grounds, the cultivations must be made up of early species and the residues removed after harvest (a fast reduction in productivity of the cultivations is generally noted in this type of firewall); - The wood firewall: the goal is to create a permanent and dense cover that prevents grass from growing. The species that can meet these requirements in West Africa are, among others, Anacardium occidentale Azadirachta indica, Khaya senegalensis, Ziziphus mauritania, Z. mucronata or other species with dense foliage (Gmelina arborea, Mangifera indica). It is recommended to choose species with small leaves, because the carpet of leaves that fall on the ground (litter) is less combustible than that formed by large leaves (FAO, 1997). However, some of the species used to fight fire, like the neem tree (Azadirachta indica), are invasive so here there is a need for trade off. 4.4. Economic case for Eco-DRR Ecosystems provide many goods and services (see section 3.1.). Forests, for example, provide wood and fibre, purify water, control the climate and constitute a reservoir of genetic resources, mitigate the effects of droughts and extreme temperatures, are used as areas for leisure and eco-tourism. Coastal wetlands mitigate the effects of floods and are sites for essential reproduction and nursery sites for fisheries. Ecosystems are thus important for society. However, these ecosystems are degraded, because of a combination of several factors including anthropogenic, and are likely to lose their capacity to provide the services mentioned above, with sometimes dramatic consequences for the direct beneficiaries. Indeed, the loss of certain species of medicinal plants, of timber for construction and the unavailability of drinking water can contribute to diminishing household incomes and to degrading wellbeing. Protecting ecosystems and the services that they provide is thus economically and socially important. In order to highlight the importance of biodiversity, of ecosystems and the abundant services and their important roles in conservation, it is advisable to quantify them. This will help to integrate the costs and the advantages related to the conservation of biodiversity (cost- benefit analyses) in decision-making processes. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) is an international initiative to draw attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity, to highlight the growing costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation and to draw together expertise from the fields of science, economics and policy to enable practical actions moving forward; it implements the ecosystem as well as the ecosystem services approach20. Environmental economists have developed techniques for quantifying various types of values.

Furthermore, they play an important role in DRR as they protect coastal areas from natural hazards such as erosion and flooding. The total economic value of mangroves has been estimated at US$ 9,900 per ha per year by Costanza et al., (1997) or US$ 27,264\u201335,921 per ha per year by Sathirathai and Barbier (2001). A study has been carried out to assess the carbon pools, ecosystem services and benefits of the mangroves in the Central African countries of Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo (RoC) and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). There are mangrove species of economic importance and the dominant species is Rhizophora racemose. Other associated species are Avicennia germinans, Conocarpus erectus, Laguncularia racemosa, Rhizophora harrisonii, Rhizophora mangle, Rhizophora racemosa, Hibiscus sp, Phoenix sp. Unfortunately, these mangroves are threatened by deforestation, overexploitation of timber, and pollution. As an example, from 2000 to 2010, they were cleared at a rate of 1.77 percent per year (77,107 ha)21. However, if we consider the net mangrove cover loss it was only of 6,800 ha which is the equivalent to the emission of 8,833,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted between 2000 and 2010. Losses are high, including in protected areas: Conkouati-Douli National Park contains 78 percent of the country\u2019s mangroves but at the same time the park records 40\u201350 percent deforestation in some areas (Rao et al., 2013). As well as carbon benefits, mangroves also provide other multiple benefits to communities living in their vicinity. The multiple benefits of mangroves can often exceed the value of carbon, and this study has shown that mangroves could provide values up to the equivalent of: - US$ 7,142 per ha in benefits for protection of rural infrastructure against shoreline erosion (US$ 151,948 per ha for urban mangroves): it is estimated that between 25 and 50 percent of the value of infrastructure is currently protected by mangrove ecosystems; - US$ 545 (49.53 tonnes of wood) per ha per year per household in wood consumption: harvesting of wood destined for fuelwood for fish smoking, construction material, etc.; - US$ 12,825 per ha per year in fisheries benefits in the four countries: mangroves provide suitable habitats for nurseries and for fish development. Many tonnes of fish are produced in mangrove ecosystems. Gabon has the highest quantity of fish production per ha and per year (109 tonnes) (US$ 12,932). The mangroves are therefore highly important to maintain the livelihoods of communities and ensure food security in the region. Protecting the mangroves also protects and maintains their capacity to protect the coasts from flooding. The study has also conducted a cost analysis of building a sea wall within mangrove areas of Central Africa, replacing the protective function of mangroves. This cost amounts to US$ 11,286 per ha for the region (countries assessed). The most costly would be in Cameroon with US$ 18,000. It is important to note that seawalls can reduce sediment availability and thus affect the health of adjacent coastal ecosystems, whereas with mangroves, we only need to invest in protection and management; they are therefore cheaper while providing other values. Mangroves can therefore be considered a solution to adapting to storm and coastal erosion related to climate change in the future in Central Africa (Ajonina et al, 2014). In Waza Logone floodplain, Cameroon, scientists evaluated the economic effects of floodplain degradation in the Waza Logone region by evaluating the economic benefits of wetland restoration. The degradation had severe impacts on the floodplain ecologies, and the fisher and pastoralist populations who rely on these resources. The study looked at the economic costs of flood loss and the potential benefits of re-inundation with a view to influencing the decision on investment in flood relief measures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e10b6a0c-b120-4ec1-8e85-8fddfcfe252f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e10b6a0c-b120-4ec1-8e85-8fddfcfe252f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional assessment on ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and biodiversity in West and Central Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bbd8a31774553666f78ff22798dad37c93f160ba6af8b9d426d516b4b702e3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "d246a224-2323-46f5-a991-351cd03faea3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34f2779dfadca141d3b3720247f6f06d5e234fccbe237ad3531804200b281ff0"}}, "hash": "c7cc2c344fc2d1b032597ebae05eb1a9ede5d5eca69098397b52b541943fbed8", "text": "In their questionnaire, the Communaut\u00e9 Baptiste au centre de l\u2019Afrique, (CBCA) a community resources management institution based in Eastern Regional assessment on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity in West and Central Africa 41 DRC has estimated the economic valuation for engineered infrastructures for DRR at US$ 200,600.

Eco-DRR experiences in the region (cont.) 42 4.5. Effective Eco-DRR implementation in the region: why is there a bottleneck? The present study shows several initiatives that could be considered in Eco-DRR and EbA approaches to mitigate the impacts of natural hazards on people and on the ecosystems that they rely on for their subsistence. These initiatives deserve greater interest from all stakeholders given that they could improve the lives of people that might be affected by environmental disturbances, and reduce in the long-term human losses as well as social, economic and environmental consequences. If these initiatives do not experience more success in their implementation as shown in this study, this has several reasons, some of which to consider could be: Lack of awareness, knowledge and information on DRR Awareness raising, information and knowledge of the key concept of DRR for all stakeholders, including communities are important to better understand and hence develop relevant projects accordingly. In addition, this study gives examples of projects that do not necessarily make the link between the objectives and expected outputs and Eco-DRR outcomes, whereas the results could be clearly linked to Eco-DRR. Better knowledge of the relationships will help highlight this link. In addition, awareness could help increase communities\u2019 engagement, hence, information dissemination. Lack of capacities to reduce the risks, including inadequate funding This is crucial and many countries affected by natural hazards and disaster do not have sufficient capacities to prepare themselves for possible disasters and to cope with them when they arise. A recent evaluation (CADRI, 2015) on capacities for disaster risk reduction conducted in seven countries of West Africa, including Burkina Faso and Nigeria, between 2012 and 2015 highlights the weakness of legal and institutional frameworks for DRR, especially in the Sahel region, even where human, technical and financial capacities exist. However, the study highlights the need for harmonised methodologies and adequate human, technical and financial resources to efficiently process the data that will serve as a basis for risk analysis. Another study on the conditions and capacities for disaster risk reduction was conducted in six West Africa countries (DARA, 2013). The analysis led to the estimation of an RRI (risk reduction index), which was obtained from qualitative analysis (local perceptions of risk factors through site visits to obtain a detailed picture of these conditions and capacities at the local level), and a quantitative analysis that used the data from public databases in order to compare countries. From the analysis, scores were calculated and a map of risk in West Africa was elaborated: a score of 0 indicating that conditions and capacities of a country are the least favourable. The study shows there are still efforts to be made on disaster risk reduction by governments as no country in the whole West African region obtained a score higher than 6. Lack of integrated policies and coordination Mechanisms to integrate sectoral policies and effectively promote inter-ministerial collaboration should be strengthened as well as the coordination with multi-partners, including the private sector. This will encourage all concerned parties to work together towards the same objective of reducing damages from disasters and increasing the resilience of populations and ecosystems, including the most vulnerable ones. It will also enhance and foster the implementation of joint activities between ecosystem management actors and disaster risk management actors. Emergency responses, especially those aimed at managing food crises caused by disasters, may be well in place in most countries because of the frequency of such events. However, working together to reduce and prevent the risk of disasters can also reduce the costs associated with emergency responses. Disaster risk managers can help develop a disaster preparedness plan based on the specific risk identified by ecosystem managers in a specific ecosystem; this will be even more effective if both managers understand the stakes and concepts of the other discipline (ecosystem management and disaster risk management). This would require that joint training sessions are organised", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c12e216-ded5-4d84-8f04-b29b6638fd3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c12e216-ded5-4d84-8f04-b29b6638fd3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional assessment on ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and biodiversity in West and Central Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4de98320b57925c6ac6f6a6389555677723c147def28269bedbc2d202595cf9"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d018f1d-fd2d-48e0-9b41-474b930f45f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c50c438f6e4562dced5d7f3ca0da97e68cffd73e5b814ee9200b6c86109cffba"}}, "hash": "70abdbe88de450400ab6065f5b87f1697ff93ae637ff53ef2fd3bc284a31d107", "text": "to better understand these concepts but also, and more importantly, to interact with each other. Regional assessment on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity in West and Central Africa 43 In light of the impacts that disasters are causing on people and their livelihoods, regional, subregional and national strategies and programmes have been put in place to address the issue in order to mitigate these impacts and increase the resilience of the affected communities. 5.1. Biodiversity related policies and programmes National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) are the principal instruments for implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity at the national level. The Convention requires countries to prepare a national biodiversity strategy (or equivalent instrument) and to ensure that this strategy is mainstreamed into the planning and activities of all those sectors whose activities can have an impact (positive and negative) on biodiversity22. Countries that are part of this regional assessment have included Eco-DRR or EbA concepts in their NBSAPs as follows: Burkina Faso: Action 7 of the strategy promotes a better management and protection of wetlands against siltation, pollution and invasive species, through the elaboration and implementation of operational programmes to combat these hazards and programmes to restore and protect sites and manage river basins. Ghana: The fifth national report (December 2015) and the draft NBSAP developed in 2012 highlights nine targets for biodiversity conservation and mainstreaming. Among these targets are the following: \u2022 Invasive alien species: integrated control on important water bodies (e.g. Volta); \u2022 Appropriate technologies for agro-biodiversity conservation for climate change adaptation and mitigation identified and adopted. Mali: Objective 14 of the strategy and action plan 2015\u20132020 will address the issue of ecosystem resilience through climate change adaptation measures and actions to combat desertification. Activities will include the restoration of degraded areas and vulnerability assessments. Senegal: Under strategic direction 2, Senegal will restore and conserve biodiversity by restoring degraded ecosystems, strengthening the adaption and resilience capacities of stakeholders and managing and protecting ecosystems. The issue of invasive species will also be addressed in Senegal River where more than 100,000 ha are infested with species such as Typha domingensis. Togo: Objective 6 of the strategy will consist of addressing the issue of wildfires by implementing efficient measures by 2018. Nigeria: the country will establish a National Forest and Vegetation Recovery Programme, including mangroves and other coastal areas, and support the implementation of the Great Green Wall Initiative. DRC: the country will protect habitats by: restoring mangroves, setting up an observatory of coastal erosion and stabilising the coastline. It is also expected that by 2020, all relevant sectoral strategies and the development plan integrate biodiversity aspects. Cameroon: some of the actions will consist of: \u2022 Identifying and replicating good ecosystem- based lessons-learnt on climate change adaptation and mitigation projects; \u2022 Promoting the establishment of a community-based Montane ecosystem; \u2022 Managing and incorporating management of endangered species and disaster hotspots; \u2022 Rehabilitating degraded flood and drought zones with high biodiversity. Intensify programmes for the rehabilitation of drought and flood zones in semi-arid ecosystems. Despite the fact that these countries have included Eco-DRR and EbA approaches in their NBSAPs, on the ground we are yet to see more concrete and successful examples of initiatives that use biodiversity and ecosystems for DRR and vice versa. 5.2. National disaster risk management (DRM) policies As stated above, the Convention on Biodiversity requires countries to ensure that their strategy on 5. Policies 22 https://www.cbd.int/nbsap/ 44 biodiversity is mainstreamed into the planning and activities of all those sectors whose activities can have an impact (positive and negative) on biodiversity23. However this is not always the case as DRM polices do not always include biodiversity aspects. At the regional and subregional levels The African Union established an Africa Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction in 2004, which aims to contribute to the attainment of sustainable development and poverty reduction by facilitating the integration of disaster risk reduction into development. A Program of Action for the implementation of this Strategy was adopted in 2006, then replaced by the Extended Program of Action for the Implementation of the Africa Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (2006\u20132015) in 2010. The overall goal of the Extended Program of Action is a substantial reduction of social, economic and environmental impacts of disasters on African people and economies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d018f1d-fd2d-48e0-9b41-474b930f45f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d018f1d-fd2d-48e0-9b41-474b930f45f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional assessment on ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and biodiversity in West and Central Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4de98320b57925c6ac6f6a6389555677723c147def28269bedbc2d202595cf9"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c12e216-ded5-4d84-8f04-b29b6638fd3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70abdbe88de450400ab6065f5b87f1697ff93ae637ff53ef2fd3bc284a31d107"}}, "hash": "c50c438f6e4562dced5d7f3ca0da97e68cffd73e5b814ee9200b6c86109cffba", "text": "The African Union also established a disaster risk reduction programme and set up and operationalised the Africa Working Group on DRR with a view to providing coordination and technical support to Regional Economic Communities (RECs), Member States, and other stakeholders for the implementation of the Program of Action (African Union, 2004).

The AU has a specific strategy to achieve each objective mentioned above. However, these strategies do not include Eco-DRR aspects; they do not specifically mention the use of biodiversity or ecosystems to address the issue of DRR. The Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative was launched in 2007 by the African Union. It seeks to reduce the effects of desertification and climate change. The aim of the initiative is to: \u2022 tackle the issue of land degradation and desertification in Sahel and the Sahara \u2022 improve food security \u2022 support communities to adapt to climate change The current focal countries for the initiatives are Algeria, Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. The Great Green Wall (GGW) will contribute to improved local incomes; it will thus be a global answer to the combined effect of natural resources degradation and drought in rural areas. The Sahel and West Africa Programme (SAWAP) is the World Bank and GEF contribution to the GGW. In this programme, Eco-DRR issues will be addressed mainly through sustainable land and water management. The FAO Strategy of disaster risk management in West Africa and Sahel (2011\u20132013) aims to safeguard and rebuild agricultural and rural livelihoods as quickly as possible when the capacity of adaptation of the communities in the post-disaster phase is exceeded. The strategy envisages the elaboration of disaster risk reduction plans and adaptation plans in the sector of fisheries and forest specifically. This is the only passing reference to biodiversity in the plan. The Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) \u2013 Coordinating Bureau for the Environment and Natural Resources, with technical support from UNISDR, drafted a DRR policy and outlined a process to develop and validate this policy among a broad range of regional stakeholders in 2009. A regional policy on preventing disaster risk was adopted by the Heads of State of ECOWAS in 2007, as well as an Action plan (2010\u20132015) (ECOWAS, 2013; AU, UNISDR and World Bank, 2008). The \u201cPRC\u201d24 Division of ECOWAS worked out and validated new guidelines for the reinforcement of national platforms in the Member 23 https://www.cbd.int/nbsap/ 24 Preventing Disaster Risk Regional assessment on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity in West and Central Africa 45 States. One of the strategies envisages supporting the efforts of integration of disaster risk reduction strategies into adaptation to climate change, in particular the management of drought and the fight against desertification. However, this strategy does not include specific biodiversity aspects. At the national level Not all countries being assessed have DRM Country Plans. Ghana has a Plan of Action for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation coordinated by the National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO). Senegal, Nigeria and Cameroon do not have their DRM plan yet. However, Senegal has set up a Commission in charge of preventing and managing disaster risks (CPGRC). This initiative is supported by IUCN-Senegal. The Commission has main missions of: (i) contributing to the sustainable development and the eradication of poverty by the integration of the reduction of disaster risks in political instruments, (ii) ensuring the coordination of interventions on prevention and management of disaster risk at the departmental level, (iii) drafting and validating a departmental strategy of disaster risk reduction with stakeholders, (iv) setting up a departmental plan of prevention and management of disaster risk, and (v) ensuring information and communication to the actors on the risks of natural disaster. In 1999, Nigeria established the NEMA (National Emergency Management Agency), which has a DRR unit since 2009. This unit has been created to monitor the implementation of the national strategy for DRR developed in 2006. NEMA also coordinates the national platform. In addition, countries have a national platform for disaster risk reduction, as a means to increase resilience through coordination of interventions, advocacy, awareness raising and the facilitation of integration of DRR in the different sectors. However, most of these platforms are not operational; the development of an action plan could help revive them. 5.3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a782254-80b1-4a90-8000-dda559f7c48c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a782254-80b1-4a90-8000-dda559f7c48c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional assessment on ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and biodiversity in West and Central Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b50fb1313c8a698d47582b03e1a62c5060d34bde39016431e1fceb8b30ab9a97"}, "2": {"node_id": "11284e5c-02ad-4584-814e-b6d79054ac0f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0c5ca0a21d1facd0dc7888b4a4c8ea98b5a90e532da8442cf6ea43a38dbaa0e"}}, "hash": "0b93b9c2c06038ebd8ab8891fa3ddecf6c44d6c450ce309374cc146d4e68f554", "text": "5.3.

However, climate change-related action plans and programmes in particular do exist. For example: \u2022 A subregional action programme to reduce West Africa and Chad\u2019s vulnerability to climate change was developed by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the International Standing Committee on Combating Drought in the Sahel (CILSS), the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the African Centre of Meteorological Application for Development (ACMAD). The overall objective of the programme is to develop and build resilience and adaptation capacities in the subregion to manage climate change and extreme climatic phenomena. \u2022 The African Development Bank (AfDB) also developed a climate change action plan (CCAP) for 2011\u20132015. This plan should help countries in the Africa region to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects. The plan aims to help African countries to build their capacity to manage climate change and mobilise resources. This plan does not include Eco-DRR aspects. \u2022 The Sahel and West Africa Programme (SAWAP)25 is jointly funded by the Global Environment Fund (GEF), the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF). This programme encompasses 12 national projects in the following countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan and Togo. The projects aim, among other things, to reduce vulnerability and increase the capacity for adapting to current or potential effects of climate variability. Many of these countries will use ecosystems to reduce the disasters caused by natural hazards. This programme includes biodiversity 25 This programme is also supported by an umbrella project called BRICKS Building Resilience through Innovation, Communication and Knowledge services 5. Policies (cont.) 5. Policies (cont.) 46 and Eco-DRR aspects through sustainable land and water resources. For example, the Nigeria SAWAP project will address the issue of gully erosion through restoration activities. At the national level National Adaptation Plans of Action (NAPAs) identify priority activities that respond to the urgent and immediate needs to adapt to climate change. The main aim of the NAPA is to identify priority adaptation activities as well as the projects\u2019 profiles to facilitate the development of proposals for the implementation of NAPA. Several countries have developed NAPAs: 14 countries in West Africa26 and four27 in Central Africa. Many countries do not include biodiversity and Eco-DRR in their plan, with only a few doing so: for instance, the Sierra Leone NAPA includes a project for the establishment of new forest reserves, protected areas and national parks; in Gambia, the NAPA proposes adaptation strategies regarding forest protection as regards habitats and species. Ghana has not submitted a NAPA yet but is putting in place a national climate change adaptation framework, aimed at: strengthening national resilience to disasters, and proactive and effective risk reduction measures. In this regard, in 2012, Ghana launched its national climate change adaptation strategy (NCCAS), in which it identified temperature increase, rainfall variability and decrease, sea level rise, extreme weather events and climate related-disasters as key elements of vulnerability. The Democratic Republic of Congo plans to include biodiversity aspects in the strategies and plan to mitigate and adapt to climate change. For Senegal, the NAPA includes mangrove restoration activities as well as activities to reduce coastal erosion, through plantation of filaos over the offshore bar, over a 10 km length (between Djif\u00e8re and Palmarin) and an average width of 100 m.

No Table 11: Overview of regional policies, strategies and frameworks related to EbA and Eco-DRR 5. Policies (cont.) 48 This section will address the challenges in conducting such an assessment and opportunities to develop or initiate actions towards the gaps identified during the assessment. One important challenge relates to the availability of information on biodiversity, ecosystems, natural hazards and disasters. Information on biodiversity and ecosystems usually exists although is not always up to date; however, programmes in the region are trying to improve the data availability, reliability and accessibility through, for instance, the establishment of an observatory that will collect, process and manage these data in order to make them available to stakeholders. Information on natural hazards and disasters also exist, but again, their reliability and accessibility should be improved. The above has to be done with the collaboration of the countries themselves through the relevant ministry and data providers so that the best up-to-date and available information is used to process analyses that will lead to policy recommendations. Countries should also be willing to support the cost of data collection, data processing and analysis and the dissemination of best practices, rather than relying on international projects. Many countries do not implement Eco-DRR activities/projects per se. A project may appear to be responding to a DRR outcome but it is not the main expected outcome. Often, the link between biodiversity and Eco-DRR is missing. So one main challenge was to identify in each relevant project where an Eco-DRR outcome is \u201celigible\u201d. Countries do not have many examples of biodiversity/ ecosystem cases for Eco-DRR or initiatives that protect biodiversity using Eco-DRR activities. If Eco-DRR is to be achieved for a specific country, group of countries or the region, this will require more thorough research including field visits. Likewise, the assessment was also challenging in terms of finding information on policies and programmes that integrate biodiversity and Eco-DRR. In most cases, this information currently does not exist because such policies are yet to be formulated and implemented. Knowing all these gaps, this assessment is a great opportunity to engage in many aspects of Eco-DRR issues, such as: \u2022 Better understanding and perception of the issue/concept: sensitisation and awareness raising, information sharing, training including on Eco-DRR tools. \u2022 Testing some of the methods that use biodiversity to address Eco-DRR: especially examples were lacking regarding crop wild relatives, and soil bioengineering. Another aspect that could be explored is how we could use the biodiversity from the soil (biodiversity of microorganisms) to reduce the effects of natural hazards; for instance those microorganisms that participate in soil formation, nutrient cycling and therefore play an important role in maintaining the structure of the soil that supports ecosystem services. \u2022 In addition to plant species, explore how animal biodiversity can also play a role in Eco-DRR. For instance, species like mountain gorillas, which are endemic to eastern DRC, Uganda and Rwanda disseminate specific seeds in their excrement, thus participating in the natural regeneration of specific tree species that might play an important role in Eco-DRR. \u2022 Enhancing the use of protected areas tool as a way to reduce disaster risks and minimise the effects of hazards.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80a64631-3d40-4812-a167-7c7cc8c2614e": {"__data__": {"id_": "80a64631-3d40-4812-a167-7c7cc8c2614e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional assessment on ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and biodiversity in West and Central Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e3e507055ecb2230887d793bdff80cf39c37e27e3cc5acccab9d4bca820b8e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8d7083c-4e9e-406a-b2e9-9a9f9d1e75cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-assessment-ecosystem-based-disaster-risk-reduction-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71af9399691c340ca7ad8f8b566b84a10501c4c4db9f3a1f84b1e9ba066de271"}}, "hash": "5b97e09c71951637cecd6025be5e79d0a80f23c7cce983a55e49c223712ec67c", "text": "Protected areas, if well managed, are powerful buffers against storms, erosion, strong winds and floods.

Mapping is an important way to identify risks to some hazards such as landslides and erosion, and will inform on vegetation cover, vegetation cover types, and the dynamics of plant communities in a landscape. Some species are less resistant to fires than others. Maps will inform on the likelihood of a fire to occur in a specific area according to the species present. They are powerful monitoring tools. Finally, early warning systems are important tools to increase the resilience of local communities to natural hazards. Such systems exist already but they should also integrate biodiversity and ecosystems concepts. 6. Challenges and opportunities Regional assessment on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity in West and Central Africa 49 This assessment conducted for West and Central Africa reveals that few projects and/or initiatives make the link between ecosystems or biodiversity management and disaster risks reduction strategies. This is probably because the concept of Eco-DRR is still new to some stakeholders and therefore has not yet been fully adopted by the community of practice. Even if there is a clear link between project activities and Eco-DRR outcomes, it has not been identified as a possible outcome of the project. There should be increased engagement between the scientific community and project managers in developing and implementing EbA and Eco-DRR activities. In this way, scientists will develop tools and strategies that are useful to practitioners on the ground, and will also directly respond to the needs of local communities. Policies (regional and national) are not integrated. Disaster risk management plans and strategies do not integrate biodiversity conservation and vice versa. This does not facilitate the full and efficient implementation of Eco-DRR activities. The analysis of the questionnaires reveals the following: \u2022 Many institutions currently implement or plan to implement Eco-DRR projects (71% of the respondents). However, from the projects the institutions mentioned regarding DRR, they were not always specifically linked with DRR or if there was a link, the project did not look at this (not main objective and expected results of project). \u2022 For those countries/institutions that are not implementing Eco-DRR activities, it is mainly due to lack of capacities and financial constraints. \u2022 The current capacity development needs with regards to the implementation of Eco- DRR cited by the respondents include: - More training and capacity building on issues in disaster risk management, including: data collection methods and analysis, identifying risks, DRR early warning systems, disaster preparedness, community-based climate change adaptation, disaster/emergency response, tools to analyse economics of DRR, assessment methods and analysis; - Improve institutions\u2019 capacity in terms of equipment and financial capacity; - Capacity building in Eco-DRR project formulation and on networking on Eco-DRR. Hence, some of the recommendations/ key messages from this study include: \u2022\ufffd Regional\ufffdand\ufffdnational\ufffdinstitutions\ufffdshould\ufffdbe\ufffd strengthened to better plan and implement climatic resilience for both ecosystems and people, and also climate risk management; \u2022\ufffd Joint\ufffdcapacity\ufffdbuilding\ufffdinitiatives\ufffdfor\ufffdecosystem\ufffd managers, DRM managers and other actors should be implemented in order to help them better understand the links between DRM and ecosystem management; \u2022\ufffd Ecosystem\ufffdmanagers\ufffdshould\ufffdcollaborate\ufffdwith\ufffd all stakeholders including researchers, NGOs, communities and decision makers to effectively implement a long-term strategy on resilience and disaster risk reduction that integrates ecosystem and biodiversity aspects; \u2022\ufffd Researchers\ufffdshould\ufffddevelop\ufffdthe\ufffdappropriate\ufffdtools\ufffd (including maps) for collecting and analysing data on damages and Eco-DRR to highlight the links between DRM and ecosystem management; \u2022\ufffd Government\ufffdinstitutions\ufffdshould\ufffddevelop\ufffdand\ufffd facilitate the implementation of integrated disaster risk management and environment/ biodiversity conservation management policies. 7.

Eaton TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops iv EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Singapore has a long history of involvement in the bird trade. Recent analysis of the trade in CITES Appendix I and II-listed birds from over 30 countries between 2005 and 2014, highlights that Singapore issued commercial import- and export permits for a total of 225 561 and 136 912 birds respectively.

In both studies, attention was drawn to the illegal sourcing of birds, and Singapore\u2019s role in moving these birds into the legal global market. To understand further the bird trade industry in Singapore, TRAFFIC undertook a rapid assessment of the open bird trade in Singapore\u2019s pet shops. Surveys of 39 pet shops, listed by AVA as licensed to sell birds, were conducted over four days in November and December 2015. A full inventory of the species and volumes in trade was documented, excluding domesticated species. This report provides a snapshot of the current composition and availability of openly traded birds in Singapore\u2019s AVA-licensed bird selling pet shops. Of the 39 shops visited, 28 were found to be selling birds.

The most heavily traded CITES Appendix I-listed bird was the Yellow-shouldered Amazon Amazona barbadensis with at least 16 recorded individuals. Overall, 41 CITES Appendix II species were recorded, totalling 350 individuals. A majority of the species, 97% (n=60) found in trade are currently not listed in CITES. Of the total number of species in trade, 70% involved seven species that were flagged as immediate concern at the first Asian Songbird Crisis Summit in 2015 From the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, only one Critically Endangered species was observed; Yellow-crested Cockatoo Cacatua sulphurea (two individuals). Two Endangered species were encountered, namely Lilac-crowned Amazon Amazona finschi (n=3) and Sun Parakeet Aratinga solstitialis (n=16), although two further species, Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus (n=15) and Straw-headed Bulbul Pycnonotus zeylanicus (n=1), were subsequently (December 2016) uplisted to this category (from Vulnerable). Eight Vulnerable species (excluding Grey Parrot and Straw-headed Bulbul, but including the December 2016 uplisted Greater Green Leafbird Chloropsis sonnerati and Javan White-eye Zosterops flavus) were found, totalling 66 individuals. Sixty-seven percent (9452 individuals of seven species) of the total number of encountered birds were flagged as species of immediate concern at the first Asian Songbird Crisis Summit, held in Singapore in 2015. About 70% of these involved seven species that were flagged as immediate concern at the 1st Asian Songbird Crisis Summit two years ago. The most commonly encountered species in trade, accounting for a remarkable 46% of the total seen, was the Oriental White-eye Zosterops palpebrosus (n=6473). Three other species exceeded the 1000-mark of number of birds on sale: Red-whiskered Bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus (n=2811), Zebra Dove Geopelia striata (n=1227) and the Red Avadavat Amandava amandava (n=1030). Of these, only Zebra Dove is native to Singapore. Significantly, 73% of all species (n=80) and 80% of all individuals (n=11 222) observed in trade were not native to Singapore. Of these non-native species, 35% occur on the Indian Subcontinent and in Southeast Asia, while another 31% originate from Central/South America. Recent bird surveys in TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops v other Southeast Asian countries found fewer birds for sale from Central/South America, making Singapore\u2019s involvement in the trade in such species unique in the region. This is in contrast to other prominent bird markets in the region, including Jakarta, Malang, Surabaya and Yogyakarta in Indonesia, as well as Bangkok in Thailand that was dominated by species native to the country or elsewhere in Southeast Asia. The high number of birds recorded in trade over a four-day survey in a small city nation like Singapore confirms the popularity of the bird trade in this country. However, a considerable lack of access to trade records (beyond CITES import- and export records) and other regulatory information concerning the harvesting, breeding, and trading of animals in Singapore has rendered a comprehensive assessment of the state of the bird trade impossible. Consequently, it has not been possible to draw any conclusions regarding the sustainability of the industry. Access to such information would aid research, enable the determination of legal and illegal trade levels and provide clarity into the sustainability of the bird trade. In November 2016, Singapore\u2019s Agri- Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA), the country\u2019s CITES Management Authority, found that 14 of 27 pet bird shops surveyed by the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) did not comply with the government\u2019s licensing conditions on welfare.

This would allow consumers to make a conscious decision on whether to buy sustainably sourced pets or not. TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops vi Awareness and Reporting Crime Members of the public who suspect that any illegal activity is occurring are encouraged to report suspected crime directly to AVA, or through TRAFFIC\u2019s Wildlife Witness App, which can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play for free. Pet Shop Monitoring Regular monitoring of the bird trade in Singapore by the AVA with the support of local NGOs and conservation partners will be important to enable law enforcement support and the discovery of emerging trends and issues. Such monitoring should include the bird trade which occurs in pet shops, and parts of which may contravene licences and captive breeding quotas. Additionally, international trade data should be assessed. Also, monitoring of indicator species (including the species suggested in this report) that face high conservation threats from the bird trade will enable the assessment of their (over-)exploitation. Studying turnover rates to extrapolate the estimated number of birds sold per year, and determining the conservation implications of these findings, is of high importance. Consistent monitoring has also been identified as a need at the Asian Songbird Summit 2015 to support the regulation of bird trade. Controlling Invasive Species Several non-native species have been introduced into the Singaporean landscape as a result of the bird trade, with escapees of some species having established feral populations. These populations may have detrimental impacts on native bird populations and may require costly control measures. TRAFFIC recommends research into which native Singaporean species are threatened by these invaders and to what extent. Managing Merit Release Species used for merit release need to be controlled and tested, with regular monitoring of pet shops to confirm that only native species (including correct subspecies) are used for such purpose, until this practice comes to an end. Ending merit release can be achieved by further promoting \u2018Operation No Release\u2019; an initiative by the Singapore National Parks Board, Public Utilities Board and AVA, and supported by local conservation organisations, to raise public awareness about the detrimental effects of animal release on natural areas. In line with this campaign, the Government has highlighted the detrimental ecological impacts of these practices on the natural environment, and has warned that first offenders may be prosecuted under the Singapore Parks and Trees Act and be fined up to SGD50 000 (USD36 789), jailed up to six months, or both. TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops 1 INTRODUCTION The unregulated and excessive exploitation of wildlife and their parts poses a serious threat to global biodiversity and has proven to be a particularly serious problem in the Southeast Asian region. Here, inadequate monitoring efforts, insufficient enforcement, corruption and complacency within governments, as well as a general lack of awareness and concern for conservation amongst the public, has allowed the illegal trade in wildlife to flourish (Nijman, 2010). Among the most frequently traded animals in Southeast Asia are birds. Popular for their singing qualities and colourful plumage, birds are predominantly sold as pets, and for traditional purposes (for example, bird derivatives are sometimes used as headgear in traditional dancing). Observations from market surveys and from seizures of birds in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand provide a first indication of the worrying extent to which birds are currently being traded in some parts of the region (Shepherd et al., 2013; Chng et al., 2015; Shepherd et al., 2015, Chng and Eaton, 2016). These studies serve as an alert to the potentially dire consequences this trade may have for wild populations. To illustrate, Shepherd et al. (2013) highlight that the heavily traded Straw-headed Bulbul Pycnonotus zeylanicus has seen tragic reductions in its population sizes throughout the region, with the species now considered extinct in Thailand and on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra and recently (December 2016) uplisted to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.

The bird trade in Southeast Asia has long been recognised as a major conservation concern (Basuni, 1989; Nash, 1993; Bennet et al., 1996; Shepherd, Waltert, 2005; 2007; Shepherd, 2010; Shepherd et al., 2013; Eaton et al., 2015). A study on the trade of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I and II-listed birds from over 30 countries between 2005 and 2014 highlights that Singapore issued commercial import- and export permits for a total of 225 561 and 136 912 birds respectively (Poole and Shepherd, 2016). Another study on the import and export of CITES-listed birds from the Solomon Islands in 2011 emphasized that 72% of the 68 000 wild-caught and reportedly captive-bred birds from the Solomon Islands were imported by Singapore, with the country then re-exporting a vast majority of these birds (Shepherd et al., 2012). Claims of captive breeding, particularly those involving species that are extremely difficult to breed in captivity, have raised questions about the legality of wildlife trade throughout the entire region, including Singapore (Shepherd et al., 2012). Additionally, the online bird trade in Singapore appears to be extensive, with a recent Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) study finding 655 online bird advertisements between June and August 2016. Of these advertisements, 273 concerned CITES Appendix I or II-listed species (18 and 255 advertisements respectively) (ACRES, 2016). The Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) and ACRES are currently engaged in further investigation of these advertisements. While studies have highlighted Singapore\u2019s role as an important transport hub and an end-use market for selected wildlife commodities, much of the country\u2019s bird trade remains to be extensively documented. Historically, only two comprehensive bird shop studies in Singapore have been published \u2013 the first was conducted between January 1992 and May 1993 and the second between August 2005 and January 2006 (Nash, 1994; Lee, 2006); both studies found considerable numbers of birds for sale (the results from these studies are described in further detail in the sections that follow). With this in mind, TRAFFIC undertook the current study to explore the nature and scale of today\u2019s open bird trade occurring in Singapore\u2019s pet shops. TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops 2 SINGAPORE\u2019S WILDLIFE LEGISLATION International trade \u2013 The Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act 2006 Singapore became a signatory to the CITES in November 1986. The AVA, a statutory board of the Ministry of National Development, is the lead agency governing the protection of wildlife in Singapore. It functions as both the national CITES Management Authority and the national CITES Scientific Authority and is responsible for the country\u2019s implementation and enforcement of the Convention (CITES, 2015). The Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act 2006 (ESA) was first enacted in 1989 to give legal effect to the implementation and enforcement of CITES. The three schedules to the Act list the endangered species. Under the Act, a permit is required to import, export, and re-export a scheduled species and/or any of its parts and derivatives (Lye, 1999; AVA, 2015). Furthermore, the Act renders the possession or sale of specimens that were acquired without the appropriate permits illegal. In an effort to strengthen CITES implementation in the country, the ESA underwent several revisions between 2000 and 2013. The most notable revision came into effect on 1 March 2006, when penalties for unauthorized import, export and re-export of CITES- listed species were increased ten-fold (Singapore Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers, 2013). Fines for any illegal trade or possession constitute SGD50 000 (USD36 789) per species (but are not to exceed in the aggregate SGD500 000 (USD367 893) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.

Wild Animals and Birds Act 2000 Not to be confused with the above, Singapore\u2019s wild bird populations are also protected under the Wild Animals and Birds Act 2000. This law prohibits the capture, keeping and/or killing of wild birds without a license. It also forbids netting. Violation of this law may result in fines of up to SGD1000 (USD736). Under this law, only six bird species are exempted from licensing requirements: the House Crow Corvus splendens, Feral Pigeon Columba livia, Purple-backed Starling Agropsar sturninus, Philippine Glossy Starling Aplonis panayensis, Common Myna Acridotheres tristis and White-vented Myna Acridotheres javanicus. TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops 3 CITES Appendix No of species No of Individuals I 7 42 II 41 350 III 1 4 NC 60 13 689 Total 109 14 085 METHODS Field surveys were carried out on 4-5 November 2015 and 6-7 December 2015. During these surveys, 39 pet shops were visited, each one time. The selection of shops surveyed was based upon AVA\u2019s list of Pet Shop Grading (a system the AVA introduced in 2007 to raise the standard of animal welfare and professionalism in the pet retail industry). This list contains 41 shops that are licensed to sell birds. Two of these shops were not visited due to time constraints and locality. A full inventory was carried out in each shop, with individuals of each species counted and where possible recorded to a subspecies level. Each surveyed shop has been provided with an identification number, allowing for analysis between shops and comparison with earlier surveys, while retaining the shops\u2019 anonymity. Domesticated species (Budgerigars Melopsittacus undulatus, Cockatiels Nymphicus hollandicus, lovebirds Agapornis spp., canaries Crithagra spp. and Serinus spp. and mutant plumaged parrots Psittaciformes spp.) were excluded from the inventory. Price data were obtained by asking dealers and/or observing openly advertised prices. These data were largely obtained opportunistically, and only in those cases in which it was possible to engage with dealers. Most pet shops in Singapore are open to the public every day and birds for sale are usually openly displayed. Therefore, no covert investigation or research methods were employed. Observers only counted the birds that were on open display. Taxonomy and vernacular names used follow Gill and Donsker (2014). Birds were defined to the species level for the analyses in this study, except for analyses on origins for which the subspecies level was used. Individuals that could not be identified to a species level were omitted from analysis. Mentioned prices are based on a conversion rate of SGD 1.36 = USD 1 (http://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/, viewed 7 July 2016).

However, at one of the closed shops, birds (including White-rumped Shama Copsychus malabaricus, Red-whiskered Bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus and Oriental White-eye Zosterops palpebrosus) could clearly be heard calling inside, proving that live birds were present, and most likely available for sale. In 28 of the 36 open shops, birds were openly for sale. In these 28 stores, a total of 14 085 birds of 109 species was recorded (a full inventory of species observed in trade is provided in Annex 1).

Eaton DISCUSSION CITES and International Bird Trade Involving Singapore As noted, Singapore has a long history of trading in birds. A study carried out by TRAFFIC reported that in 1988 an estimated 700 000 birds were exported (Nash, 1993). Between 2000 and 2010, it was found by TRAFFIC that Singapore had reported the import of close to 50 000 birds from the Solomon Islands, which constituted 72% of all imports during this period (Shepherd et al., 2012). A more recent study by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and TRAFFIC on the trade in CITES-listed birds in Singapore found that the country imported and exported birds from and to at least 35 and 37 countries respectively over a ten-year period, confirming its role as a trade hub in the global aviculture industry (Poole and Shepherd, 2016). The online bird trade, including the trade in CITES Appendix I and II-listed species, also appears to be extensive in Singapore (ACRES, 2016). Singapore\u2019s bird trade history extends to the trade in various species of Psittaciformes (parrots) from across the globe.

Of particular concern was the trade in Grey Parrots Psittacus erithacus, with Singapore accounting for almost 10% of the world\u2019s CITES-reported trade. More than 90% of these birds were declared as wild-caught and originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In March 2016, the CITES Secretariat suspended the trade in Grey Parrots from the DRC owing to a long-standing concern regarding trade threats to the species (CITES, 2016), meaning countries are requested to inform enforcement- and customs authorities in order to avoid the inadvertent acceptance of specimens from the DRC. This four-day survey recorded 15 individual Grey Parrots from eight shops. One shop advertised the sale of this bird for SGD1900 (USD1398). Grey Parrots were voted to be uplisted to CITES Appendix I during the CITES Conference of the Parties in September \u2013 October 2016. Figure 3: A Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus observed in trade in Singapore in November 2015 TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops 7 While it is interesting to note the large number of non-native species for sale in Singapore, it must also be noted that the native species found on sale during this study were all protected under Singapore\u2019s Wild Animals and Birds Act 2000. Capturing, keeping or killing these birds is prohibited. Unfortunately, details on what species pet stores were licensed to sell (this includes details on imports and exports of CITES-listed species and quarantine regulation checks) could not be determined in the current study, as this information was unavailable from the AVA. It also remains unclear how many of the Appendix I-listed birds were captive-bred, and if any of the encountered specimens had been in circulation since before CITES was implemented in Singapore (which could be the case for some long-living species, such as Psittaciformes). The lack of transparent data impedes any effort in determining whether (and to what extent) the trade is legal. We should consider the possibility that the encountered birds that belonged to species that are not exclusively native to Singapore, were not caught in Singapore but in any of their other range countries, and were subsequently imported into Singapore. More detailed import and export analysis for CITES-listed species involving Singapore is currently not possible as the CITES trade database lacks 2015 import and export data. Figure 4: Origins of non-native species and individuals The fact that the majority (73%) of the bird species found on sale were non-native, confirms Singapore\u2019s role as a transit hub in the international bird trade. Of all non-native species, 35% (n=28) occur on the Indian Subcontinent and in Southeast Asia. No less than 31% (n=25) originate from Central/South America (Figure 4). While a vast majority (84%) of the Central/South American species recorded are currently listed in Appendix II of CITES, three species; Yellow-naped Amazon Amazona auropalliata, Yellow-shouldered Amazon Amazona barbadensis and Lilac- crowned Amazon Amazona finschi, are listed in Appendix I. All three species are widely collected for the pet trade, and especially for the Yellow-naped Amazon and Lilac-crowned Amazon, poaching for the pet trade remains a serious threat to its survival (BirdLife, 2016). A total of 23 birds from the three species were seen during this survey. Both the Central American Lilac-crowned Amazon and the South American Sun Parakeet Aratinga solstitialis are considered Endangered by IUCN (Table 2). The number of bird species from the Central-/South American region documented in trade is remarkable because recent bird surveys in other Southeast Asian countries found very few birds of Central-/South American origin (Shepherd et al., 2004; Chng et al., 2015; Harris et al., 2015; Chng and Eaton, 2016).

Additionally, some businesses may have undergone a name change. In this assessment, shops that were not surveyed during the first two surveys are treated as new businesses. Two shops not present in previous studies (shop number 42 and number 48) remarkably had the largest numbers of individual birds on sale (6481 and 1085 birds respectively) (numbered shops are listed in Annex 3). Furthermore, twelve shops that used to sell large quantities of (individual) birds, now sold considerably less (shop number 2, 4, 6, 21, 26, 27, 30, 33, 38, 64, 66 and 71). Finally, five shops were found to have more individuals on sale than during previous survey(s) (number 43, 49, 51, 59 and 73). However, in these shops, the range of species on sale was found to be significantly smaller than before. This could be due to reductions in availability or demand for certain species, or because these shops changed their sales strategies, focussing on larger numbers of birds from a narrower selection of species. A detailed comparison on the diversity of species offered and number of individuals for sale is provided in Annex 3 and 4. Ten shops were surveyed in all three studies and therefore lend themselves to comparison. However, it must be kept in mind that the previous studies were conducted over a considerable period of time, while the current study\u2019s survey was carried out in a total of four days. Nevertheless, the 1993 study bases itself on average numbers of birds sold in each shop, and in the 2006 study, shops were only visited once. Comparison between the two studies and the current study is therefore possible. The results of the respective studies suggest that the assortment of species for sale in the ten shops increased sharply between 1993 and 2006, and then decreased between 2006 and 2015. When it comes to the number of individuals for sale, a different trend can be observed. Over the years, the quantities of birds on offer seem to have decreased in almost all of the ten shops. In 2006 then, the number of species had remarkably increased, while the number of individuals had dropped. Currently, both the number of species and the number of individuals have decreased (in both cases by more than half) compared to the previous surveys (Figure 5). TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops 9 Species of Concern A selection of priority species in the Greater Sunda region was identified at the first Asian Song Bird Crisis Summit in 2015 \u2013 these species are considered to be most at risk from trade and have the highest conservation priority. Those priority species that were found during this study are listed below. Straw-headed Bulbul Pycnonotus zeylanicus The current study found just a single bird in the pet shops. None were encountered during the 2006 survey by Lee. Personal ad-hoc observations have occurred on two separate occasions in February 2015, with a total of three individuals being found on display in shop number 21 and two in shop number 31 (Chng, pers. obs., 2015). The species was recently (December 2016) uplisted from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The species has been extirpated from much of its range; Myanmar, Thailand and Java, and no records of its presence on Sumatra have been published since 2009. It is now only found in Malaysia, Singapore and remote areas of Kalimantan (Bergin et al., in prep). Generally, the population in Singapore is considered stable. However, the Singapore Annual Bird Census 2016 suggests a near 50% drop in numbers (from 60 in 2015 to 34 in 2016) (Singapore Bird Group, 2016) and further, more thorough research into this is needed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1791d3cc-d065-471b-9e67-d76128539b58": {"__data__": {"id_": "1791d3cc-d065-471b-9e67-d76128539b58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/songsters-singapore-overview-bird-species-singapore-pet-shops", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Songsters of Singapore : an overview of the bird species in Singapore pet shops", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/songsters-singapore-overview-bird-species-singapore-pet-shops", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7e3bbe4ae62f5286744ff2374abbaee34786819ea113e2448ec72a0fa31bcf4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f86900ff-9946-4442-8a63-7de69098551d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/songsters-singapore-overview-bird-species-singapore-pet-shops", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97a956c58a21894e99abab6613bb15c09245190749ec9a9bfdeb3e5d0cae186a"}}, "hash": "f5d081b233f154281345db35ba7f7ae53e3e2157348a4d9cc1a3e1139e8710fd", "text": "The quality of the Straw-headed Bulbul\u2019s 2015 1993 Ranking Species Scientific Name Number Number Difference 1 Oriental White-eye Zosterops palpebrosus 6473 10 800 -40% 2 Red-whiskered Bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus 2811 12 050 -77% 3 Zebra Dove Geopelia striata 1227 28 950 -96% 4 Red Avadavat Amandava amandava 1030 not recorded N/A 5 Scaly-breasted Munia Lonchura punctulata 699 23 350 -97% 6 White-headed Munia Lonchura maja 494 12 550 -96% 7 Bronze Mannikin Lonchura cucullata 220 not recorded N/A 8 White-rumped Shama Copsychus malabaricus 155 3200 -95% 9 Monk Parakeet Myiopsitta monachus 96 not recorded N/A 10 Rose-ringed Parakeet Psittacula krameri 89 not recorded N/A A comparison between the 1993 survey and the current study\u2019s survey for the 10 most commonly traded non-CITES species", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9db4abe-8fbd-4916-a139-1d93540d7234": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9db4abe-8fbd-4916-a139-1d93540d7234", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/songsters-singapore-overview-bird-species-singapore-pet-shops", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Songsters of Singapore : an overview of the bird species in Singapore pet shops", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/songsters-singapore-overview-bird-species-singapore-pet-shops", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ba0c697d299aeb312801385f16d44d0eccaf633b1ced15c56445b15705932cf"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2ca62aa-01a0-4ab2-812e-1b11ca92cb75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/songsters-singapore-overview-bird-species-singapore-pet-shops", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcd1bf43bd827a01703ce8398ab0c21dece12524f352a46ae801771f114be985"}}, "hash": "93f2886fb32ee2c20bdf66303469a67495b4545e16fdfa87b3e502ba63d9b323", "text": "shows some commonalities in the species composition. Six of the species were recorded in both surveys (Table 4), with two African species surprisingly in the 2015 survey, while Pin-tailed Parrotfinch Erythrura prasina availability had declined markedly in other regional bird markets, compared to past years (van Balen, pers comm., Chng et al., 2015, Chng and Eaton, 2016) (Table 4). This survey also reinforces that Singapore\u2019s bird market has been active for more than two decades. Indeed, the volume of birds observed over a four day period is comparable to the volume of birds recorded in TRAFFIC\u2019s past surveys in Java, Indonesia, where between 19 000 and 22 000 birds were recorded over a three-day period (Chng et al., 2015; Chng et al., 2016b). Further, a majority of the birds recorded here were native to Indonesia, in contrast to the non-native species that dominated the Singapore bird market. Table 4. Nash 1993 and current study\u2019s top 10 most frequently encountered birds compared TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops 10 songs makes it a prized species and forms the main reason behind the extensive trapping of the species for both the domestic and the international cage-bird trade (BirdLife, 2016). Information from Singaporean bird dealers and bird enthusiasts in the past highlight that occasionally this species is smuggled into the country from Malaysia, claiming a preference for birds from there that are thought to be larger, with louder singing capabilities (Shepherd et al., 2013). Asian Pied Starling Gracupica contra jalla The current study found a single individual of the race jalla; the first account of this species in trade in Singapore (Luis Neves in litt). Classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Although a widespread species, with a range extending from Pakistan to Indonesia, the subspecies jalla, endemic to Indonesia (Java and Bali), is now feared extinct in the wild (Eaton et al., 2015). This taxon is of particular concern due to its distinctive plumage, and could be split as a separate species in the future (Eaton et al., 2015). Common Hill Myna Gracula religiosa The current survey found only four individuals for sale in two shops, all appeared to be of the widespread subspecies religiosa. It is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. This is a widespread species, found throughout Southeast Asia, though some taxa of Common Hill Myna are nearing extinction in the wild (Eaton et al., 2015). The Common Hill Myna is one of the most popular avian pets in Asia. From 1994-2003, over 170 000 wild-caught individuals were exported from range states (Birdlife, 2016). From 2000-2010, 2900 Common Hill Mynas reported as originating from the Solomon Islands (where they do not naturally occur) were imported by Singapore and Malaysia. In Singapore, this species was popular in the bird trade, with an estimated 4700 wild-caught birds observed in trade between January 1992 and May 1993 (Nash, 1993). White-rumped Shama Copsychus malabaricus A total of 141 individuals were recorded in 12 shops, all of which appeared to be the expected taxon tricolor from Peninsular Malaysia to Java. The species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The White-rumped Shama is a widespread species. It is found (Kalimantan, Sumatra and Java), with several Indonesian subspecies already in severe decline and possibly even extinct due to capture for the bird trade (Eaton et al., 2015). In four shops, nestlings were observed, in dimly lit areas at the back of the shops, indicating some form of captive breeding or removal of chicks from the wild is taking place. Sixty-nine individuals were recorded by Lee (2006). In addition, seven White-crowned Shama Copsychus stricklandii (a taxon often subsumed within White-crowned Shama and endemic to the East Malaysian state of Sabah and adjacent Kalimantan in Indonesia) were found in two shops.

Oriental White-eye Zosterops palpebrosus The Oriental White-eye was the most encountered species in trade, with almost 6500 recorded individuals. This compares to the 4884 individuals recorded in 2006 by Lee, who also found it to be the most abundant species in trade at the time. With massive numbers elsewhere in trade (Chng et al., 2015; Chng and Eaton, 2016b), the species requires closer monitoring due to potential taxonomic rearrangements and implications, as identification to subspecies level is very difficult due to poorly understood plumage differences. While this species is currently regarded by the IUCN as Least Concern and is not listed in CITES, the staggering number encountered during this relatively small-scale survey is reason for concern. There are no records of extensive captive breeding programs for this species in Singapore, or anywhere else in the world, suggesting that the individuals on sale were extracted from the wild. Several shops advertised the species as originating from Malaysia. In fact, the species was previously native to Singapore but has been considered extinct in the country since THE 1970s and is now seen as a non-native resident (Jeyarajasingam, 2012, Birdlife International 2012). It appears to have been replaced by Japanese White-eye Zosterops japonicus, derived from escapees in many areas (Jeyarajasingam, 2012; BirdLife International, 2012). The price of the species was widely advertised and varied between SGD80 (USD59) and SGD200 (USD147), with one shop advertising birds from Malaysia at SGD120 (USD88), while birds not marked with an origin cost SGD150 (USD110). Another shop selling the species at SGD120 also had birds advertised as \u2018new\u2019 at SGD200. White-eyes are commonly used in singing contests (Chng et al., 2015). Red-whiskered Bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus The Red-whiskered Bulbul is the second most numerous species encountered in this study, with 2811 recorded individuals. This species was also among the most numerous in Nash\u2019s (12 050) and Lee\u2019s (1907) studies. It is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The species range stretches from southernmost Thailand to China and India, though it has now been extirpated from much of Thailand due to capture for the bird trade (Techachoochert and Round, 2013). In Thailand, there are over 100 Red-whiskered Bulbul clubs dedicated to the keeping of the species, with over 50 000 members at one club \u2013 the captive population of the species in Thailand is likely to number in the millions (Techachoochert and Round, 2013). There are also Red-whiskered Bulbul-dedicated clubs in Malaysia, who regularly meet up for singing contests (Eaton, pers. obs., 2015). The status of this species as a songbird in Singapore is highly revered. It was depicted on the SGD5 notes between 11 Figure 6: Over 1000 Red-whiskered Bulbuls Pycnonotus jocosus were observed in one shop TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore \u00a9 James A. Eaton TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore 12 1976 and 1984, despite not even being native to the country. However, the bird is now a non-native resident throughout the country, not helped by continued introductions, such as part of the 1002 individuals confiscated from an unlicensed pet shop, being donated to Jurong Bird Park by the AVA, whom, along with government agencies agreed to release them (and Oriental White-eyes and Zebra Dove) into the Singapore countryside (Wildlife Reserves Singapore Year Book, 2009/2010). Captive Breeding A number of nestlings and fledglings were observed for sale. Most of these were Psittacines, which were likely to have been captive-bred or ranched.

TRAFFIC was also not able to obtain any information regarding the captive breeding of birds in Singapore to enable analysis with results from this study. However, this issue is worthy of further investigation, considering the recent accounts of wildlife laundering practices. As illustrated in a recent report on the export of birds from the Solomon Islands (Shepherd et al., 2013), traffickers may exploit legal trade channels to launder illegal wildlife products. Only by comparing annual captive breeding quota with the actual amount of birds on offer, can such practices be detected. Captive-bred individuals can usually be identified by the closed rings around their legs.

Questions about captive breeding practices (in Singapore and in range countries) relating to the latter species have been raised in a recent study (Poole and Shepherd, 2016). Songbird Contests Compared to other countries in the region, Singapore\u2019s bird keeping culture has only recently developed. Bird keeping started to become popular after World War II, and around 1956 the Singapore Cage Bird Society was formed by families of British Armed Forces (Yim, 2008). The regular species on show then were Budgerigars, canary species, Java Sparrow Lonchura oryzivora, Oriental Magpie Robin Copsychus saularis and Zebra Dove, followed by several parrot species (Yim, 2008). Figure 7: Buyers waiting for the perfect song to seduce them into making a purchase \u00a9 James A. Eaton TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops 13 Songbird contests in Singapore started in 1964, a year after the Kelab Burung Singapura was formed, and bird fighting was outlawed. Instead, people started to gamble and place bets on the loudness, and variety of the songs, and stamina and posture of birds (Yim, 2008). This went from strength to strength with a greater number of species and competitions being held across the country (Yim, 2008). Today, the competitions still thrive in areas such as Ang Mo Kio Town Garden, where the Kebun Bahru Bird Singing Club holds regular songbird contests, accommodating more than 1000 cages (http://kebunbarubirdsingingclub.weebly.com/index.html). The current study found older Singaporean men of Chinese ethnicity, aged (estimated) between 50-75 years old to be the predominant visitors to these shops. Often, rows of chairs or stools were placed in front of cages, where these men sat patiently observing songbirds with the intention of picking out the best singer. During the course of this survey, at least two posters in different locations were observed advertising a songbird singing contest and prices to enter the competition. They specifically targeted five species: \u2022 White-rumped Shama at SGD20 (USD15) per individual \u2022 Oriental Magpie Robin at SGD20 (US15) per individual \u2022 Chinese Hwamei Garrulax canorus at SGD20 (USD15) per individual \u2022 Red-whiskered Bulbul at SGD12 (USD9) per individual \u2022 White-eyes and at SGD12 (USD9) per individual Events like this emphasize and popularize the entertainment value of certain species and are likely to increase the demand for these species. Indeed, as shown above, Oriental White-eye and Red- whiskered Bulbul were the most encountered species in trade. Merit Release Large numbers of birds, primarily munias Lonchura spp., weavers Ploceus spp. and Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica, are released in East and Southeast Asia for the purpose of merit release - in Buddhism, liberating animals from captivity is thought to be an important way to earn spiritual merit (Gilbert et al., 2012). In Hong Kong, this occurrence has resulted in 15% of the breeding avifauna being non-indigenous; these invasive populations are likely to have a negative impact on the native bird populations (Leven and Corlett, 2004). Furthermore, tests on birds trapped for merit release conducted in Phnom Penh detected 43/415 (10%) birds carrying influenza A virus, 1/97 (1%) carrying Chlamydophila psittaci, and 4/97 (4%) carrying Mycobacterium genavense, posing a risk to both public health and wild bird populations (Gilbert et al., 2012). During the current study\u2019s survey, munia species were advertised for \u2018merit\u2019 release in two shops. Three non-native munia species, totalling 286 individuals, were recorded.

Request for information on trade records and other regulatory information concerning the harvesting, breeding, and trading of animals in Singapore was not made available. This has rendered a comprehensive assessment of the state of the bird trade in Singapore impossible. Consequently, it has not been possible to draw any conclusions regarding the sustainability of the industry. In light of this, and of this study\u2019s findings, TRAFFIC makes a number of recommendations below, primarily targeted at the regulatory bodies in Singapore, to aid in a better understanding of Singapore\u2019s bird trade.

This can only be done if the following information is made available: \u2022 The quantity of CITES species and individuals registered for import and export, and disclosure of any quotas set by the Government for trade. \u2022 Captive breeding activities within Singapore, including information on registered breeders and the volumes of species meant for domestic and/or international trade. \u2022 Processes and protocols in place to regulate non-CITES, non-protected species that are being imported and exported from Singapore. The Animal Welfare and Control Division of AVA, which issues licenses to pet shops, should conduct regular inspections to ensure that shops have the correct permits for all imported and captive-bred species, and when applicable, CITES-permits for CITES-listed species. In order for consumers to make wise purchasing decisions, AVA should introduce a regulatory requirement (including penalties for ITS violation) for shop owners to provide information on the name of the bird, its CITES status (if it involves a CITES-listed species), and its source (wild-caught/captive bred). This would allow consumers to make a conscious decision on whether to buy sustainably sourced pets or not. Awareness and Reporting Crime Members of the public who suspect that any illegal activity is occurring are encouraged to report suspected crime directly to AVA, or through TRAFFIC\u2019s Wildlife Witness App, which can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play for free. TRAFFIC Report: Songsters of Singapore: An Overview of the Bird Species in Singapore Pet Shops 16 Pet Shop Monitoring Regular monitoring of the bird trade in Singapore by the AVA with the support of local NGOs and conservation partners will be important to enable law enforcement support and the discovery of emerging trends and issues. Such monitoring should include the bird trade which occurs in pet shops, and parts of which may contravene licences and captive breeding quotas. Additionally, international trade data should be assessed. Also, monitoring of indicator species (including the species suggested in this report) that face high conservation threats from the bird trade will enable the assessment of their (over-)exploitation. Studying turnover rates to extrapolate the estimated number of birds sold per year, and determining the conservation implications of these findings, is of high importance. Consistent monitoring has also been identified as a need at the Asian Songbird Summit 2015 to support the regulation of bird trade. Controlling Invasive Species Several non-native species have been introduced into the Singaporean landscape as a result of the bird trade, with escapees of some species having established feral populations. These populations may have detrimental impacts on native bird populations and may require costly control measures. TRAFFIC recommends research into which native Singaporean species are threatened by these invaders and to what extent. Managing Merit Release Species used for merit release need to be controlled and tested, with regular monitoring of pet shops to confirm that only native species (including correct subspecies) are used for such purpose, until this practice comes to an end. Ending merit release can be achieved by further promoting \u2018Operation No Release\u2019; an initiative by the Singapore National Parks Board, Public Utilities Board and AVA, and supported by local conservation organisations, to raise public awareness about the detrimental effects of animal release on natural areas. In line with this campaign, the Government has highlighted the detrimental ecological impacts of these practices on the natural environment, and has warned that first offenders may be prosecuted under the Singapore Parks and Trees Act and be fined up to SGD50 000 (USD36 789), jailed up to six months, or both. \u00a9 James A.
