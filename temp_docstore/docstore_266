UNAIDS and WHO data estimate a total of 78,000 cases, and the Government of Pakistan\u2019s National AIDS Control Programme reports 80,000. However, there is significant variance in the number of reported cases of people living with HIV/AIDS. UNAIDS cites 210 reported cases of HIV/AIDS, whereas the government reported 231 cases of AIDS and 1,942 cases of HIV. In 1996, estimates of the total number of people with HIV/AIDS in Pakistan ranged from less than 35,000 to over 60,000. At that time, the number of reported cases was 55. The first case of AIDS in Thailand was detected in 1984. Recent statistics (January 2003) show The possibility of using ICTs for educating people to adopt better practices and ensure immunization as well as to monitor the availability and quality of social services to combat such causes of infant and child mortality is also substantial 42 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals the prevalence of HIV/AIDS cases in Thailand to be 285,517,of which 65,469 patients had died.64 The incidence of HIV infected patients rose steadily to its peak level in the year 1998 (44.27 cases in 100,000 of the population, after which the rate has declined each year to 14.56 cases in 100,000 of the population in 2002. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has a disproportionate impact on children.The child mortality rate has been estimated to be 13 per cent higher than it would have been in the absence of AIDS. An estimated 14,000 children under the age of 15 years were living with the HIV/AIDS at the end of 1997, and 48,000 children have become orphans due to AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic. The AIDS epidemic has hit Thailand very hard, with prevalence among some groups reaching 50 per cent or more during the last decade of the 20th century.However,the Thai AIDS control campaign has achieved international recogni- tion as the first in the developing world to halt the growing incidence of new cases of HIV and to sustain a steady decline. The current overall prevalence is about 2.2 per cent of the adult population. Although Thailand has succeeded in its malaria control effort over the past two decades, lead- ing to a considerable reduction in the incidence and mortality rates, the disease is endemic along the international borders, making it one of the major public health problems in the country.During 1996-99,the incidence of malar- ia climbed from 1.5 to 2.1 per 1,000 in the pop- ulation.65 Most of the cases were found along the Myanmar, Cambodia and Lao borders with Thailand. This was due to the high malaria receptivity in the border areas, particularly, Thailand-Myanmar, where the malarial parasite is predominant because of the nature of the geographical terrain.In addition,health facilities are inadequate and housing conditions and sanitation poor. According to the WHO Global Tuberculosis Control Report for 2003,Thailand is ranked 16th among the 22 high-burden countries for tuber- culosis. Over the past 40 years, the incidence of tuberculosis had decreased until 1991 after which it showed an upward trend. Currently, there are approximately 100,000 new TB cases (of all types) per year.Although mortality due to tuberculosis has shown a declining trend from 1990 to 1994, the reported figure for smear- positive TB has increased from 34 per 100,000 to 50 per 100,000 in the 12 years since 1990. The resurgence of TB has been marked in areas of HIV prevalence and HIV is the most important epidemiological factor contributing to the increase of TB in several parts of the country.It is estimated that approximately 1 million Thais have been infected with HIV and in 2001, there were 695,000 people living with HIV. Hence, there is a large pool of people that are at risk of being infected with tuberculosis.Not surprising- ly,TB has become the number one killer of peo- ple living with HIV, many of whom are in the 20-35 years age group. Of the communicable diseases, pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children under five years.In 1994,16.72 deaths per 100,000 chil- dren under five years were reported.Acute diar- rhoea is also an important cause of death, with a rate of 1.56 per 100,000 children under five years. Currently, the importance of malaria as a cause of mortality has declined, with only 856 deaths reported in 1995.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e21e79d2-3005-4aa2-a609-cacd5f490bb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "e21e79d2-3005-4aa2-a609-cacd5f490bb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46001e8e3425916df628d619df3b8a92bdadb173c13406b7ca50b6ef34b65266"}, "2": {"node_id": "24994bfb-963a-4bba-8444-bc6d13f7287b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2f7cdf8b577410be8cc7f5e250aa734e9599a7fcac206d892618eb2e84f254f"}}, "hash": "0aa41b2517c9f9d5562ab52a83546617e2dbb12a01d6af86459ebd415aa77514", "text": "In Vietnam too, HIV/AIDS is a potentially explo- sive challenge.

Quang Ninh, Hai Phong and HCMC all project more than 200 HIV cases per 100,000 people, whereas the 12 provinces least affected by HIV/AIDS project less than 10 cases per 100,000 people.However, even in these latter provinces, the rate has been growing fast in recent years.66 Malaria remains an important public health issue in the remote areas of Malaysia too. Approximately 70 per cent of cases occur in the state of Sabah. According to WHO statis- tics, the incidence of malaria per 1,000 of the population in the year 2000 was 0.559. Until recently, tuberculosis was kept under control. However, TB has re-emerged as a major dis- ease following the influx of migrant workers into Malaysia. In the 1970s and 1980s, an aver- age of 10,000 TB cases was reported annually, but in 1999, the number of cases reported went up to 14,150.67 A total of 51,256 cases of HIV infection were reported between 1986 and December 2002. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has a disproportionate impact on children. The child mortality rate has been estimated to be 13 per cent higher than it would have been in the absence of AIDS 43 Asia\u2019s march towards the Millennium Development Goals During this period, 7,218 AIDS cases were reported while the number of deaths caused by AIDS totalled 5,424. Malaysia has put in place specific policies and programmes that will work towards the MDG target of halting and begin- ning to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. Given Malaysia\u2019s pace in implementing these programmes throughout the 1990s, it has been acknowledged that it is likely that the MDG tar- gets will be achieved within the specified time, particularly with the current level of political commitment towards wiping out HIV/AIDS. Mongolia is unique amongst the countries studied. In 2003, it had only four officially reported cases of HIV detected in 1991, 1998, 2001 and 2002 and acquired reportedly through contact with foreigners. However, the situation is changing. The number of cases of sexually transmitted infections has increased sharply, consisting of 40.8 per cent of the total number of infectious diseases reported in 2002. Between 48-52 per cent of the cases of sexually transmitted infections are among teenagers and youth below 25 years of age. Poverty, a large adolescent and youth population,and the epidemic situation in border countries con- tribute to the potential growth of sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS.The threat is great also because, despite high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections, condom use is low in Mongolia.68 In these areas of health discussed above, ICTs can be shown to have an impact both within the context of the formal healthcare system as well as in facilitating knowledge-sharing, awareness-raising and co-ordination. ICTs can help in identifying affected populations and individuals.The possibility of using ICTs for edu- cating people to adopt better practices and ensure immunization as well as to monitor the availability and quality of social services to combat such causes of infant and child mortal- ity is also substantial, as discussed later in this Report.In particular, since HIV/AIDS tends to be concentrated among certain vulnerable groups and segments of the population,ICTs,including radio and television, can play a major role in targeting these groups. This would help empowerment of and advocacy by stakehold- ers and contribute to mitigation of impact in health emergencies. ICTs can be used to enable governments, NGOs and the health establishment to increase access to reproductive health, childcare and AIDS pre- vention information,by making available locally- appropriate content in local languages. Also, they are able to support the networking of healthcare workers, vulnerable groups and civil society organizations engaged in advocacy aimed at behavioural change. In addition, ICTs can facilitate intra-government co-ordination on healthcare planning and service delivery. They can also enhance the delivery of basic and in- service training for health workers, and increase the access of rural care-givers to specialist sup- port and remote diagnosis. Lastly, they can increase mapping, tracking and information- sharing on HIV/AIDS and other infectious dis- eases, with a view to enhancing support in the most vulnerable regions and countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "196bd871-db1d-40c7-9aa4-107772ecb676": {"__data__": {"id_": "196bd871-db1d-40c7-9aa4-107772ecb676", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80fdec796a04975145a6a838c6754a2e23552ae4ab947b94d0902272b31c559e"}, "2": {"node_id": "8339767b-c63e-42ee-ab0c-74d92d878524", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ed8059079bc5a4d6fd3f406421f2f5857f4b6fe19e16d5f478a98feeb6615c0"}}, "hash": "b9a9ebc4c0589f0d74474628b00cc00e466311389fad68becabc75dd2800adbc", "text": "Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability The environment refers not to a single entity or issue, but rather a range of economic and social resources and interactions that shape the physical surroundings of human beings (water, air, soil, natural resources, plant and animal species), possessing a number of possi- ble uses on which humans are dependent in all of their activities.

While there seems little hope that the environ- mental degradation in Asia resulting from deforestation, industrial pollution, domestic wood burning and human waste can be reversed in the near future, progress is under- way in some countries to meet some targets under the sustainable environment head. Reforestation in some instances has been help- ful; for example, forest cover in China and Vietnam appears to have increased slightly, between 1990 and 2000. However, losses in forestry continue to occur in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka.69 According to a senior government official, Pakistan\u2019s economy suffers a loss of over US$ 1.8 billion annually due to environmental degrada- tion.70 Pakistan\u2019s environment therefore has a profile that is similar to many developing countries, but far below the world average. A variety of IT applications \u2013 such as GIS \u2013 have long been used to enhance sustainable development. The focus is now shifting to more powerful mapping and monitoring tools in the context of a networked environment 44 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals The environmental indicators show deforesta- tion and freshwater resources to be two pivotal areas of concern. Freshwater resources, in par- ticular, present a major challenge to the formu- lation and implementation of viable policies, indicated by Pakistan\u2019s position among the top 20 per capita freshwater using countries in the world, as well as the top 15 freshwater with- drawers in the world. At present, the most pressing environmental problems in Thailand are forest degradation, water pollution and lack of effective waste man- agement, especially industrial and hazardous waste. Air pollution was a serious problem in Bangkok, but the situation has improved con- siderably due to the switch to lead-free gaso- line. Energy efficiency and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission are also becoming a concern as the country struggles to balance the need for fur- ther growth and to protect the national and global environment. Deforestation is a problem everywhere leading to desertification. Desertified lands in North China total 334,000 square kilometres, of which 176,000 square kilometres are already encroached upon by sands and another 158,000 square kilometres are at risk from potential sand encroachment. Desertification affects 212 coun- ties in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other provinces.71 After a period of substantial deforestation, which still continues in some areas, around a fifth of the land in India is under forest cover and has been so for the last two decade. It is estimated that dense forest cover has stabilized at around 36 million hectares. Indonesia is facing a major environmental chal- lenge as a result of forest fires, which have become a yearly problem in the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan during the dry season. The fires result in the spread of dark clouds of burnt particles that cover a wide area in a num- ber of provinces in Sumatra and Kalimantan, as well as in the neighbouring countries of Singapore and parts of Malaysia. The clouds have caused health consequences such as lung and eye irritation problems, and hamper the operation of air transportation due to lack of visibility. Once started, the fires are difficult to put out due to the vastness of the fire area,inad- equate personnel and equipment, and because these provinces are sparsely populated and do not have a wide network of roads. The fires, partly caused by land clearing for farming by the indigenous people, are princi- pally the result of the activities of large forest concession companies. Indonesia is a major exporter of logs and wood products such as ply- wood and paper. Logging is therefore a major industry and source of employment in provinces that have large tropical forests. The woods are inadequate to meet even the legal requirements of factories with forest produc- tion concessions. In addition, illegal logging flourishes to meet demands from these facto- ries and the international market. Unprocessed logs are smuggled to meet international demand. Illegal logging is done by local people and, occasionally, by foreigners along the Indonesia-Malaysia border. In Malaysia forest management efforts have helped marginally increase the permanent forest reserve to 14.33 million hectares in 2000 from 14.29 hectares in 1995.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec3bdceb-fcac-4a26-a741-b7585e59660d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec3bdceb-fcac-4a26-a741-b7585e59660d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb3e97fb62d909ab0b1ef201a83567bc295cff91b48cc298ab0c665833236f07"}, "2": {"node_id": "917148e3-8d76-4da9-9380-cb31405befe8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45af89c2023cc4563ec3b258e66095efba3d0e345cf25b694f3e3c6c7822d19e"}}, "hash": "d58c9777a2ebfd2421235a6546cccc92cae165115ab3eae0be06e25ed4cee43b", "text": "Malaysia had also committed itself to the International Tropical Wood Organization\u2019s Year 2000 objective whereby all timber in international trade must be from forests that are sustainably managed.

Thanks to serious efforts by various parties and a variety of meas- ures including a forest logging ban since 1989, forest land has expanded from 28 per cent of the total in 1990 to 33.4 per cent in 2000.During 1991 to 2001, natural conservation and recre- ation areas, namely national parks, forest parks, wildlife conservation areas, no hunting areas, wildlife parks, botanical gardens and arboreta have also increased from 13.5 per cent to 17.6 per cent of the total land area. However, during the first half of the 1990s, the country lost a sig- nificant amount of mangrove area due to com- mercial shrimp farming and coastal pollution. In Vietnam,forest cover has begun to increase in recent years,but still remains low at some 34 per cent. At the same time, there is a high risk that the quality of reforestation is reducing biologi- cal diversity. The environmental treasure in Vietnam, including some 700 endangered species, is at high risk of being lost forever unless meaningful policy and institutional actions are taken soon. The next target in the environmental area is to halve the proportion of people without sustain- able access to safe drinking water by 2015. It is estimated that, for Asia as a whole, urban water supply coverage is 93 per cent but rural cover- age is only 75 per cent.73 Thus, the most serious problems regarding clean water access arise in the rural areas, where millions lack water from protected sources. There has been some progress in individual countries; for example, in India, rural coverage went up from 61 per cent in 1990 to 79 per cent in 2000.74 However,based on current trends, it is likely that the region as a whole will miss the target. Sri Lanka is the only country that has \u2018achieved\u2019 the target while China is rated as \u2018far behind\u2019and Vietnam is \u2018lag- ging\u2019 in terms of the share of the population using improved water sources (Table 2.12). Water scarcity and deteriorating water quality, particularly in north China,increase the compe- tition between urban, industrial and agricultur- al consumers, and between upstream and downstream users. Rivers, lakes and groundwa- ter are heavily polluted because most industri- al, municipal and agricultural sewage and drainage waters are discharged untreated. The main problems are regional disparities in water access, improper water usage, water pollution, sinking ground water tables, coastal and marine pollution, and discontinuous river runoff in some rivers in north China,such as the Yellow River. In all areas, an effort to raise consciousness with regard to alternative intervention possibilities, best practices and a greater degree of monitoring are a must to ensure progress.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0884170a-57d6-4135-897b-67305499324b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0884170a-57d6-4135-897b-67305499324b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "517d8cc0a1706c8e045adb430224e25d140361a2fb0e42e4e22ab22df9891970"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c119948-25a5-4ef0-8547-5ac9a5b9aa7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d045933f676cfe54d94308bfaba06c4877efb17bd1fd95f9c6f97148c3e65e77"}}, "hash": "f2ea2fa58efd19b4f07d160c41304bfa2d956790bb1cd3d966e0465b7ec955f6", "text": "The role that ICTs can play here is obvious Country Achieved On track Lagging Far behind Slipping back China \u25cf India \u25cf Indonesia \u25cf Malaysia (NA) Mongolia (NA) Pakistan \u25cf Sri Lanka \u25cf Thailand \u25cf Vietnam \u25cf Source: UNDP", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e30eb16-eb5b-467b-bb5d-0f79637ef1f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e30eb16-eb5b-467b-bb5d-0f79637ef1f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f603ba6e0dad70157820b0c532e468f06a7663a41f59b5e113d961e77a85143"}}, "hash": "8f603ba6e0dad70157820b0c532e468f06a7663a41f59b5e113d961e77a85143", "text": "Human Development Report, 2002.

Table 2.12 Progress towards MDG 7 by nine Asian countries Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability Target 10: Halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water Indicator 30: Population using improved water sources (%) 46 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals Water is the central environmental issue in India too, with major public health ramifications in the form of the twin, related problems of safe water and sanitation.While organic and bacter- ial contamination of water can occur through many routes, inadequate sewage treatment facilities and improper disposal of industrial effluents constitute the principal sources of contamination.There are large flows of untreat- ed municipal sewage and industrial effluents into the main water bodies that monitoring and regulation by the Central Pollution Control Board has not been able to arrest. While official statistics claim that 90 per cent of the popula- tion in urban areas has access to safe drinking water,only 49 per cent has access to proper san- itation facilities, which results in a very real threat of continued and increasing contamina- tion. Further, while there are some instances of State and community action against the release of untreated effluents, a large number of indus- trial units in the country get by without ade- quate investment in the proper treatment and disposal of effluents. Indonesia also has the problem of fresh water pollution due to irresponsible and illegal dumping of unprocessed industrial waste into the rivers by factories.This is aggravated by the tendency among city dwellers to flush domes- tic waste into the open sewage that ends up in the river. Water pollution is especially a major problem in the industrial and densely populat- ed areas of big cities such as Jakarta and Surabaya. Major water pollution is also present around mining and quarrying areas. Illegal miners do not adopt safety standards and release heavy metals and (as in the case of gold mining) dangerous and toxic materials into the rivers.The government has been work- ing to clean up the rivers through a project called Prokasih (Proyek Kali Bersih \u2013 Clean River Project) for years.The result has not been satisfactory. Water quality in Malaysia, reflected in terms of the percentage of clean rivers, deteriorated from 53.5 per cent or 48 rivers out of the total 90 rivers monitored in 1990 to 28.3 per cent or 34 rivers in 2000.75 This has been attributed to sewage from households and livestock farms, effluents from the manufacturing sector and agro-based industries, suspended solids from soil erosion and heavy metals from factories as well as the occurrence of drought in parts of the country. The share of the population with access to safe water in Vietnam has increased to 53 per cent, growing at 13 per cent per annum in recent years. However, disparities remain dramatic. While the average share of population with access to safe water is 96 per cent in the better- off areas, this compares with only some 28 per cent in the 12 weakest provinces.Effectively tar- geted assistance appears especially needed in Dong Thap,Vinh Long, and Ben Tre.76 In most countries, while legislation is usually adequate, enforcement in remote areas poses a great challenge to the authorities and is compli- cated by corruption. ESCAP has rated the progress for this target in the Asia-Pacific region as poor so far,with few countries giving this tar- get sufficient attention. A variety of IT applications \u2013 such as Geographical Information System (GIS) \u2013 has long been used to enhance sustainable devel- opment. The focus is now shifting to more powerful mapping and monitoring tools in the context of a networked environment. For example, ICT and GIS tools are able to assist in areas like the management of village resources such as water wells and tube wells, and to create thematic resource maps of vil- lages for sustainable development. Also, GIS mapping has been carried out in the field of arsenic contamination in ground water. Remote sensing technologies and communi- cations networks also permit more effective monitoring, management and mitigation of environmental risks. In addition, ICT tools can increase access to and awareness of sustainable development strategies in areas such as agriculture, sanita- tion and water management, and mining. Another potential result of ICT use is greater transparency through monitoring of environ- mental abuse, and better enforcement of envi- ronmental regulations. Lastly, they can be used to facilitate knowledge exchange and net- working for policy makers, practitioners and advocacy groups.

Because of this, the fact that ICTs can play a major role here needs to be stressed. ICTs are increasingly being used to streamline, aggregate and organize relevant \u201cglobal\u201d and local information, facilitating easy dissemination in developed and developing countries. As a result, ICTs have substantially increased the strength of previously voiceless NGOs. This, in turn, has led to their growing international presence and a major role for them individually, collectively and in partner- ship with other organizations in influencing policies and implementing strategies in many of these areas. ICTs can also be used to manage information needed to effectively provide offi- cial development assistance (ODA) as well as to level the playing field in terms of the availability of international and regional market informa- tion among all countries. Some implications Thus, assessments of Asia\u2019s march towards achieving the MDGs point to a mixed and varied performance. Countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and even China show significant progress and are \u2018on track\u2019 to achieve most of their goals and targets. Sri Lanka\u2019s performance with reference to most of the goals and targets is also commendable.Pakistan,India and Mongolia lag behind the other six countries in almost all the MDGs, while Indonesia stands between the successful countries and the laggards with a very mixed record overall. Similarly, progress in certain areas such as combating extreme pover- ty, overcoming illiteracy or reducing infant mor- tality has been faster than progress in other areas, even if not always adequate. This increases the significance of using an enabling technology such as ICT to support the effort to realize the MDGs. In all areas, an effort to raise consciousness with regard to alternative intervention possibilities and best practices,and a greater degree of monitoring are a must to ensure progress.The role that ICTs can play here is obvious.\u2020 In addition, in specific areas the technology can directly contribute to the real- ization of the MDGs, as discussed below. Our assessment of the current use of ICTs for devel- opment and the potential for harnessing the technology to yield benefits in these areas needs to distinguish between these general purpose and specific uses, in order to maximize the returns from investment in the area. Moreover,while ICT opportunities can be identi- fied for each of the MDGs, there is a need to pri- oritize the Goals where ICTs can be demonstrat- ed to have the greatest impact, for example, education and healthcare as opposed to addressing the hunger reduction Goal. This is not to suggest that ICT solutions should not be developed to enhance the responsiveness and effectiveness of relevant agents in addressing other development priorities and challenges but to identify major MDG priorities for national e-strategies.Similarly,there is a need to cost and prioritize alternative ICT opportunities within the context of each of the MDGs. \u2020 The discussion on ICTs and the MDGs in this chapter has benefited greatly from UNDP 2003 Working Paper:The Role of ICT in Enhancing the Achievement of Millennium Development Goals. The wide availability of enhanced computing power and the consequent ability of networked individuals, to process and execute a huge number of instructions in imperceptible time spans can have revolutionary implications Developments in ICT during the last quarter of the 20th century are widely seen as having her- alded an information age in which economic and social activity has been widened,deepened and transformed.

As a result, in the three decades starting 1971, the number of transistors on a chip increased from 2,250 on the first Intel 4004 microprocessor to 42 million on the Pentium 4 processor.The cost of a MHz of computing power has fallen from US$ 760 in 1970 to 17 cents in 1999.1 This has helped PC makers and those incorporating computer chips into their products deliver far more pow- erful systems at the same or declining prices. The growth in computing power has triggered a veritable race in the development of digital devices that can exploit that power,and periph- erals that extend that capability. These devices acquire, record, organize, retrieve, display and disseminate information. Here too technologi- cal change has reduced costs substantially. The cost of a megabit of storage has fallen from US$ 5,257 in 1970 to 17 cents in 1999.2 Computing devices also help manipulate and modify stored information, by searching through the informa- tion, displaying it in a chosen format, perform- ing simple and complex scientific and engineer- ing calculations, and solving a range of non- numerical problems. The power that this offers is considerably enhanced by the growing possi- bility of linking computing devices and allowing them to communicate with each other, based on some common protocol. This process has been aided by improvements in communica- tion technology that have reduced the cost of transmitting a trillion bits of information from US$ 150,000 to 12 cents over the last three decades.

The global, albeit uneven, spread of networks brings change for those who can participate easily and fluidly in the electronic sphere and for those who cannot.The importance of promoting an increasingly central place for the use of advanced ICTs is acknowledged today to a much greater degree than it was a decade ago.However, there is a great deal of controversy over the priority that should be given to different kinds of ICT expenditure and about the specific contexts in which these technologies can play a positive role. For some, the principle priority for investment is in ICT applications that can foster \u2018knowledge-driven\u2019 economic growth.For others,service applications in support of health,education and other public services are the highest pri- ority. Investment priorities shape the deployment of networks and ICT applications and there is growing evidence that the new technologies are being applied in distinctive ways around the world. The ways in which businesses, governments and citizens are taking advantage of the potential of the new technologies when they are able to access them are enormously varied.The greatest need is for initiatives that encourage learning and capability build- ing in different local contexts and that which facilitate exchanges of these experiences. The prices of ICTs are declining, but the construction of new kinds of knowledge societies comes at a high cost.The exclusion of some people is a persistent feature of recent development. Those who are already marginalized may be further disadvantaged when they are bypassed by the new e-services.This feature of the \u2018digital divide\u2019is about more than simply accessing e-services. It is about being able to draw upon a whole range of resources from online and offline places in order to function in today\u2019s world.

More attention needs to be given to supporting initiatives that can be sustained financially. It must also be recognized that although digital information can be replicated and circulated within global networks at very low cost, the costs of creating information in the first instance (the \u2018first copy\u2019costs) remain high.This raises issues about the scope of the public domain for information sharing that is encouraged alongside markets for information \u2018commodities\u2019. SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION to innovation in sectors completely outside the computing business itself, resulting in the emergence, creation and servicing of a host of new needs, makes the employment conse- quences of the new technologies virtually impossible to calculate. Third, it can substantially transform industrial processes, since firms can now use the capacity to store information and execute instructions to automate and change the manner in which they conduct and manage their operations. Information technology is, in part, revolution- ary because it ensures and necessitates the transformation of productive capacity in almost all sectors. Finally, the computing revo- lution leads to a dramatic expansion of the size and scope of the services sector (across a wide spectrum including finance, banking, trade, entertainment and education). This results from associated technological devel- opments that find new uses for the massive computing power that is cheaply available. It also comes from the huge market that devel- opments in communications and networking technology create, and from the fact that the increasingly ubiquitous PC becomes the vehi- cle to deliver a range of services,besides being a device in its own right.The microprocessor is not just the core of the IT revolution, but stands at the centre of the convergence of the information, communication and entertain- ment sectors. When all of these benefits are combined with developments in communication, individuals, 53 ICT for enhancing human development: potential and promise The prices of computing hardware and the proprietary software that dominates the sector still remain extremely high Careful consideration needs to be given to stimulating investment in local knowledge within any framework of strategies for promoting access to knowledge resources. \u2018Digital divides\u2019 cannot be overcome purely by relying on market forces. Public, private and civil society coalitions and partnerships play a crucial role in influencing ICT diffusion and the extent to which people find creative ways of applying the new technologies. These coalitions are essential if there is to be a realistic chance of applying ICTs to address problems of poverty and to enabling greater participation in a globalizing world. A very important observation is that social and economic development priorities must come first. ICTs must be seen as enablers, not as investment targets in their own right. \u2018ICT for Development\u2019 initiatives must not be allowed to overwhelm a country or region\u2019s absorptive capacity or to distort the goals of social and economic development initiatives. New coalitions of resources and partnerships must be encouraged in line with each country\u2019s and region\u2019s development priorities.This message needs to be heeded by all those who actively promote the emergence of knowledge societies. \u2018Digital divides\u2019are manifestations of much deeper social and economic inequalities.ICTs on their own will never be sufficient to address the deeper problems.Fundamental issues that hinder social and economic development must be addressed as a first priority.The lesson of the past decade\u2019s experience with new ICTs, including the Internet, is that they can be valuable enablers; they are not the solutions. The prevailing \u2018knowledge society\u2019vision often privileges economic goals of competitiveness and market-led devel- opment.However,evidence is accumulating to show that failures to experience the potential benefits of ICT invest- ment stem from ignoring non-market issues.These issues involve governance and institutions at all levels.A variety of social capabilities must be developed and these cannot be left to the market.Investment in ICTs must be accom- panied by measures to strengthen skills and capabilities, and to foster the kinds of changes that people can accept and welcome.This means ensuring the participation of all stakeholders in shaping their own knowledge societies. This presents real challenges because there is a tendency to assume that ICT issues are too technical for non-spe- cialists to understand. However, knowledge society services must be responsive to people\u2019s needs and preferences if they are to be accepted and widely used.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "341b056e-1487-4aa4-88ce-33607f841a02": {"__data__": {"id_": "341b056e-1487-4aa4-88ce-33607f841a02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b1b4034dd9b4f730840be581b1039aa1681e87c2f6986b6f852bfe420680fc6"}, "2": {"node_id": "74456340-f65a-4200-8163-089df31e4b77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5032efed44ff70f139f122e2731bfab1522900ba82889315d65266bb70d9b266"}}, "hash": "430c50e6db847354d3fd7da2a71f06271eb4f350932b5e315f3653edbfa80377", "text": "This means a commitment to encouraging a reasonably equitable distribution of capacities for living in technologically mediated societies.This is much more than a simple ICT skills issue.It is a matter of human rights and entitlements to the capacities for improving livelihoods.There", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a3b3012-0d48-4ba0-b064-a0f336a6949d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a3b3012-0d48-4ba0-b064-a0f336a6949d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f5fda0b4e2de65a62127a844a3340ed7d2d4b4856a636aaa6a266c6ea61d6a8"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a17c9a7-00ca-4cb0-ad7c-c5a5dfd59d57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f455b37618f8d5815204b37c17664ae082a43ff774b2e599ad030f0913262ec"}}, "hash": "e01ba5b45c73605ccaf8d34abbd0191c92dd4234f9d573125c4818623f3f950e", "text": "is an increasing need be proactive in creating awareness of the potential of knowledge societies, in building up technical and policy capacities, in strengthening institutions and processes, and in provide access to information about international developments.The foundation for capability building for knowledge societies in all these areas is the understanding that development priorities must lead investment in ICTs. organizations and corporations are able to both secure a presence on the Web as well as easily traverse cyberspace. This creates the basis for establishing links between individuals, individuals and government agencies,individu- als and business, business and government, and business and business. The full conse- quences of this compacting of economic and social space are even now only being absorbed and analysed. One area where the effects are tangible is electronic commerce which allows for trading in virtual space, reduces transaction costs, cuts down on retail infrastructure and slashes retail margins. This revolution in ICTs and the widening of economic and social space that it has wrought, have given rise to widespread spec- ulation and debate on the potential of ICTs to enhance human development. Proponents of the view that ICTs can, in fact, have a powerful positive impact on human development focus on the important role the technology can play in areas such as dissemination of health and reproductive information, training of medical personnel and teachers, provision of equitable access to education and training facilities, opening up of opportunities for women, and expansion of the scope for citi- zen participation.Through these means, it has been argued, ICTs provide developing nations with an unprecedented opportunity to meet vital development goals such as poverty reduction, provision of basic healthcare, and improving access to quality education, far more effectively than before.3 54 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals Based on these and other features of the tech- nology, international institutions and many developing-country governments, businesses and citizens\u2019groups are pushing ICTs as a means to transcend the structural and historical weak- nesses of developing nations in the economic, political and social spheres. They argue that ICT offers the developing world the opportunity to \u2018leapfrog\u2019several stages of development and join industrialized nations in the information age.This is possible, they feel, given its wide ramifications and the fact that it is less expensive, is accessible from knowledge in the public domain and,there- fore,is characterized by lower barriers to entry. The principal problem with this argument is that the decline in computing and connectivity costs notwithstanding, the prices of computing hard- ware and the proprietary software that domi- nates the sector still remain extremely high.Thus, the cost of a computer has only come down from around US$ 800 20 years ago to about US$ 300-400 today. This does appear small, when compared with what has happened with mobile phone costs, for example. A mobile phone that cost around US$ 1,000 10 years back is today available for US$ 50-60.Very often the decline in hardware costs is notional, in the sense that it involves a similar or slightly higher price for much more powerful equipment.Since most users and most applications do not need such power,what would have been of use is if less powerful equip- ment remains available at a lower price. But with manufacturers of microprocessors and support- ing hardware phasing out production and sup- port of earlier technologies and rendering them technically obsolescent,even if not economically and socially so, there is a considerable degree of \u201cdownward stickiness\u201d of entry-level equipment prices.This makes the cost reduction substantially notional rather than real. This problem is aggravated by the fact that lib- eralization involving easier entry of transnational firms into developing country markets as well as the reductions on imported components and peripherals is seeing a decline for non-branded PCs offered by low cost domestic assemblers. For example, in 2003-04, India\u2019s domestic IT market, which includes a INR 8,750 crore (US$ 1.94 billion) market for PCs, registered the best growth in 10 years of 24 per cent, with desktop volumes registering a rate of growth of 21 per cent. However, in that year, the share of assem- bled PCs in the total reportedly fell by 7 percentage points from 65 per cent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a17c9a7-00ca-4cb0-ad7c-c5a5dfd59d57": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a17c9a7-00ca-4cb0-ad7c-c5a5dfd59d57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f5fda0b4e2de65a62127a844a3340ed7d2d4b4856a636aaa6a266c6ea61d6a8"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a3b3012-0d48-4ba0-b064-a0f336a6949d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e01ba5b45c73605ccaf8d34abbd0191c92dd4234f9d573125c4818623f3f950e"}}, "hash": "5f455b37618f8d5815204b37c17664ae082a43ff774b2e599ad030f0913262ec", "text": "Industry analysts expect this trend to continue so that by the end of 2004-05, the assembler segment\u2019s share may move below even the 50 per cent level.\u2020 The consolidation in the PC market implies that a growing dominance of branded PCs led by transnational brands is likely to increase the stickiness of entry-level prices and dilute the benefits that cost reduction can deliver.

In addition, software producers exploit the rapid increase in computing power to add on new features into higher versions of specific soft- ware. Many of these features are unnecessary for the ordinary user. Additionally, they result in downward stickiness in entry-level prices and in an increase in the costs of the upgrade necessi- tated by compatibility problems and network effects. This makes the success of the open source software (OSS) movement crucial as a means to keep software costs low directly, and through its indirect effects on the pricing poli- cies of proprietary software producers. All these issues are of relevance because our concern here is with the possible human development implications of the ongoing ICT revolution in poor countries. If the costs of hardware, software and connectivity are brought down substantially, ICT use can advance human development through a vari- ety of routes.To start with, the technology and product offshoots of the phenomenon can directly contribute to the creation of new pro- ductive employment.Many new products gen- erated by the technology, such as cellular tele- phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and forms of digital infotainment do not displace exiting products and jobs but create new ones, releasing new demands because of the felt need they cater to. The production and distri- bution of such products obviously create new employment opportunities, and thereby improve economic well-being.

The consequent growth in demand and production has had significant employment effects. Government policy has been crucial to this, as in Thailand (Box 3.1). In other instances, such as in India, there has been a substantial increase in the employment generated in the provision of a range of software and IT-enabled services, linked to or facilitated by the ICT revolution. However, such employment opportunities directly benefit the middle classes, whose improved well-being has only a marginal impact on various human development indica- tors. Its effect on the poor is more a result of the indirect, demand-generating conse- quences of such employment and income increases, the extent of which cannot be easily estimated. The second way in which ICT use can improve the quality of life is through its productivity- enhancing and cost-reducing effects that increase the returns accruing to small and medi- um producers from productive activity.A striking case of such effects is the introduction of ICT devices into the management of operations of the National Dairy Development Board in Gujarat, India. (Box 3.2) The third way in which ICTs can contribute to improved welfare is to provide access to infor- mation as well as help impart skills and devel- op capabilities. Interviews with focus groups and pro-poor activists reveal that there is sub- stantial demand for information that has a sig- nificant economic content, e.g., real-time infor- mation on prices, weather and pests; advice on agricultural technology, water use, soil man- agement, livestock management and livestock diseases (agricultural extension); and availabil- ity and conditions of bank credit, micro-credit, and governmental grants and subsidies. In the social domain, health-related information is particularly valuable. In the political arena, access to government forms, information on government projects and personnel,and activ- ities of NGOs have a market. To these one may add a possible final cluster, even if the demand for it is still tacit, and diffuse information on: \u25cf export opportunities in small industry, crafts production, and horticulture \u25cf changing requirements in global markets, and \u25cf the opportunities provided by information technology itself.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e881437-1da3-40e4-ba86-f569ef15c205": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e881437-1da3-40e4-ba86-f569ef15c205", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a82cb84fc0401558395d1a0f276ec0a7faa8a16ae48a6cf21a1ecaed7c6461a"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0ddd590-23b3-4181-81f4-5151e75e2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8548a0e27366fda071244c9af5e77ba9fb1cdcef1aa74771a4a776e10ee0fc9f"}}, "hash": "41737d1ff92c2c404ee2cbd758b4dc6374299ddff33b221bb8fc4b99ecaece3d", "text": "Besides, provision of straightforward access to information, ICTs can be used for skill and capa- bility development, with significant effect.

This increases the returns accruing to small and medium producers from productive activity In early May 2003, the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (MICT) of Thailand launched a project named \u201cComputer ICT\u201d. It aimed to offer Thai citizens the opportunity to acquire their own PCs at a low cost relative to the then prevailing open market prices (US$ 261 for a desktop and US$ 467 for a notebook) and under easy payment conditions. The sales target was first set at 100,000 PCs but a new target of a million PCs was set due to the overwhelming response. The project was initiated when MICT teamed up with local brand PC manufacturers and commissioned them to make low-cost PCs. As for software, MICT opted for open source software, using Linux Operating System TLE 5.0. The project\u2019s aim was to increase PC penetration in Thailand,particularly among the low income earners.It also hoped to generate \u201cspin-off\u201deffects,by further inducing demand and competition in the low-end PC segment. Other PC manufacturers, dealers and resellers have also come up with strategies to reap the benefit of the market boom. For instance, a group of provincial PC resellers joined forces and launched a new product called \u201cSME PC\u201dat a price of US$ 333.

Poverty persists in conditions where the human resource is under conditions where it is under-valued and material resources are over-valued. An old Chinese saying goes: If you are thinking one year ahead,plant rice; If you are thinking ten years ahead,plant trees; If you are thinking hundred years ahead,educate the people. Several countries in our region have experienced rapid economic and social development only because of educa- tion and the acquisition of skills relevant to market-driven enterprises.This Report which brings together the expe- rience of Asian countries in harnessing ICT for achieving the MDGs is timely. Such sharing experiences will help nations to purchase time in mobilizing ICT for accelerating the pace of human, social and economic development. The M S Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) has been working in this field for several years. Our pro- gramme has been based on Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Antyodaya principle, i.e., ensure that the poorest person in the vil- lage gains from the technology and that technology does not further enlarge the rich-poor divide. Based on this principle, we have recently established a Virtual Academy for Food Security and Rural Prosperity (VARP). This Academy will help to spread demand-driven and user-friendly information through the integrated mobilization of the Internet, cable TV, community and Ham radio and vernacular newspapers.The Fellows of the Academy, chosen by a peer review process,are semi-literate or literate rural women and men who have shown extraordinary capabil- ities in mastering new technologies and applying them for the common good of all the families in the village.The first Fellows of the Academy (four women and two men) come from very poor families and are products of the day- to-day struggle of women and men belonging to small farm families in meeting their livelihood needs. Therefore, their leadership of the Rural Knowledge Centres carries a high degree of credibility and acceptability. It is our hope that by 2015, there will be a million Fellows of the Academy comprising at least one woman and one male knowl- edge manager from each village.This will enable the emergence of a Farmer Participatory Knowledge System.

SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION 57 ICT for enhancing human development: potential and promise ICTs can contribute to improved welfare by providing access to information as well as helping impart skills and develop capabilities and diverse terrain to provide schooling and improve its quality are being tackled with a large range of distance education programmes that exploit the potential of ICTs (Box 3.4).In addition to the use of computers and the Internet, radio and TV are also deployed to promote education. For instance,there are 2,735 radio and TV univer- sities at national, provincial, prefecture and county levels and the number of total classes is 18,136. In 2001, 174,300 people completed their college programmes in these universities and 216,600 new students were enrolled,thus taking the total number of students in all these univer- sities to 562,900.4 According to incomplete sta- tistics, over 10 million students have graduated from all the radio and TV universities. It is to be expected that, soon, information technology would become an important tool in the func- tioning of these organizations. Malaysia\u2019s Telehealth programme is an example of the use of ICTs for provision of a range of health services. Telehealth is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Health and the private sector using ICTs to deliver, among other things, high quality health content to the public. The initia- tors of this project believe that empowering individuals with medical knowledge will enable them to make informed decisions and take care of their own health. This is the \u2018wellness para- digm\u2019, which is envisaged by the Ministry of Health to be the future of health care in the new millennium. Telehealth (www.telehealth.com.my) has four components:Teleconsultation, Mass Customised/ Personalized Health Information and Education (MCPHIE), Continuing Medical Education (CME) and a Lifetime Health Plan (LHP). The major advances made by the cooperativization of milk production and processing at Amul Dairy in Gujarat,India,have been widely recognized.Village-level primary producers are organ- ized under a supervisor from the district-level Cooperative Dairy Union which owns a pro- cessing plant. Milk is sold only to the cooperative at local collection centres. ICT is being used to improve collection and payment, substantially improving the prices received by farmers. Earlier, the quality and quantity of the milk was computed through manual calculations made by the cooperative staff.This not only led to allegations of underpayment, but resulted in sub- stantial delays.The fat content in the milk supplied by the primary producers was calculated a few hours after the milk was received and farmers were paid every 10 days or so. With the introduction of ICT, each producer is provided with a card that is read electronically at the col- lection centre and his/her ID sent to a personal computer.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be4f30fc-5e9b-4d8a-9f2b-8050d35762e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "be4f30fc-5e9b-4d8a-9f2b-8050d35762e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "101e990aa8e8086159626cd4a707406221c28b033f61344a34eb8f05479b5aa0"}, "2": {"node_id": "d31088bc-0347-4ff3-89c1-fd489c5aed15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c88b033d26ad42c354696db32b48431754550c298c6a5ba3d8600fd0515a2c4"}}, "hash": "9d8a2d7a88010cafde904a2613de44cd1958310691c933f4b0bfe223cc5a0fba", "text": "Milk is poured into a steel contain- er on a weighbridge that displays the weight and transmits the information to the PC.An oper- ator takes a small sample of the milk and a fat testing machine reads the fat content electron- ically in three seconds.With this information being displayed and transferred to the PC as well, the computer calculates the payment due to the producer and provides him/her with a pay- ment slip using which he/she can immediately collect his/her payment.The milk vending sys- tem costs around US$ 2,000 per centre.

Its objective is to work closely with the communities inhabiting the Karakoram area in the northern mountainous region of Pakistan. KADO has three programmatic areas that employ ICTs: \u25cf an e-commerce initiative called Threadnet Hunza (http://www.threadnethunza.com) \u25cf an ICT training and capacity building programme for villagers, and \u25cf a website for information sharing called the Karakoram-Hunza Cybersite. Both Threadnet Hunza and the ICT training programme have yielded important lessons on the benefits of using ICTs for poverty alleviation. Threadnet Hunza is an e-commerce website that offers the products of local handicrafts, such as carpets and household accessories, for sale over the Internet.With technology support from KADO\u2019s staff,the website has established a small and loyal clientele in Europe and the US (figures on the sales from the site were unavailable,although KADO claims that the website is self-sufficient and provides significant premiums to villagers on their products). The ICT training programme of KADO assisted the local community in establishing 10 village training centres,training master trainers and providing seed funds to entrepreneurs.These train- ing centres provide access to new technologies (such as basic computing and the Internet) for a nominal fee that sustains their activities. As in the case of Threadnet Hunza, the training centres are financially feasible small enterprises.The village training centres thus meet two complemen- tary objectives: \u25cf the generation of sustainable incomes for the poor, and \u25cf the establishment of mechanisms for ICT capacity building among the rural poor. Box 3.3 Capacity building in the Karakorams: KADO \u2020 Information from http://www.tenet.res.in/Press/digi_partners.html, accessed 30 December 2004. Teleconsultation provides a platform for spe- cialists to make decisions without physically examining patients. MCPHIE involves creating and delivering high quality health content to equip individuals with medical knowledge to allow them to make informed decisions and take care of their own health.CME increases the knowledge and skills of healthcare providers while LHP delivers a network-based personal- ized health plan for each individual, based on medical records. As part of the Telehealth initiative, two IT-based specialist hospitals in Selayang, Selangor and Putrajaya were commissioned in 2000. Currently, six hospitals are being built incorpo- rating the computerized Total Hospital Information System (THIS). They are located in Ampang, Serdang and Sungei Buloh in Selangor, Alor Setar and Sungei Petani in Kedah and Pandan in Johor. In addition, 25 small and medium-sized hospitals including 12 in the states of Sabah and Sarawak, incorporating the Health Information System, are now in various stages of planning and development. Currently,selected health clinics and health cen- tres in Johor, Negri Sembilan, Kuala Lumpur, Sabah and Sarawak are also being equipped with teleprimary healthcare networks which are connected to state and district hospitals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dc5d496-d5be-4b8a-b43e-d0cd9375c0d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dc5d496-d5be-4b8a-b43e-d0cd9375c0d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "093d8387b6a1639c22d9fbbc09163163dcf1bd2fbba2e715d712ce238f3a1a44"}, "2": {"node_id": "e95fd12a-5867-45fa-b11c-41d7019bd994", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30a55226bda0a8a2bef4932a6d9f8b1abdf89f8f169b4e7f61d057c36ed68103"}}, "hash": "0c3645513f2165a6ad32d1b4a9ae2a088d32d15816530787107cc5a3a4e3696b", "text": "This will facilitate teleconsultation and access to spe- cialized diagnostic services such as radiology and pathology.

As part of its effort to commercialize cheap WLL- based connectivity in underserved rural areas, TeNet has set up nLogue,which seeks to develop a network of local entrepreneurs to provide front-line implementation and services to local subscribers.These Local Service Partners (LSPs) will be in the business of setting up Access Centres in small towns and rural areas, which will provide simultaneous Internet and teleph- ony access to subscribers within a 30 km (19 mile) radius.

In rural areas, conveniently located kiosks will service surrounding villages. In addition to local and long-distance telephone service, these vil- lage kiosks will offer residents information on commodity prices, land records, certificates, weddings, etc., all of which is collected and stored at the Access Centre. Governmental efforts have also been important in this area. In India, for example, e-governance initiatives are at the centre of the ICTs for devel- opment agenda.The concern of governments at national, state/provincial and local levels to incorporate ICTs into their development agenda is visible in the large number of \u2018e-governance\u2019 projects that have been initiated in the country. These projects constitute by far the most numerous and include the largest and the most noticed of ICTs for development projects in the country. An early and relatively large-scale example of an e-governance project is the com- puterization of the Mandal Revenue Offices (MROs) in the state of Andhra Pradesh.As part of the project, all the MROs (totalling 1,124), the revenue divisional offices (78), the collectorates (23), the Office of the Commissioner of Land Revenue, and the Directorate of Economics and Statistics at Hyderabad have been computer- ized.This involves data collection, development and implementation of appropriate databases and developing human resources through intensive training.

One noted e-governance project is the Bhoomi project in the state of Karnataka. The Government of Karnataka launched the Bhoomi initiative in 1998, which has been described as a major initiative to computerize land records to ensure a more secure title and decrease rural graft. According to reports, all of the 177 Talukas in the state have already been computerized, and the information transferred from the pre-existing manual registers to a computerized database. Besides providing access to land records, that database is expect- ed to be used for a number of other develop- mental applications including better agricul- tural and financial planning for farmers in col- laboration with the Centre for Knowledge Societies, Bangalore. The Maharashtra Emergency Earthquake Rehabilitation Project (MEERP), being imple- mented in the state of Maharashtra, is an exam- ple of an e-governance project that has a more targeted objective, but infrastructure from which can support many other activities. It is aimed at minimizing the adverse effects of nat- ural disasters.Complete with a disaster manage- ment centre located at the Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (YASHADA), computerized control rooms across the state, a VSAT- and VHF-based communica- tion network and area-specific GIS-based disas- ter-management plans, the system provides critical support for the disaster management functions of the administration. It can help plan exit and evacuation activities in case of natural or man-made disasters, locate resources that could be easily and quickly deployed in the affected areas and identify potential disaster management facilities in case of need. Supported by the World Bank, the Department for International Development (DFID) and UNDP,the project is now reportedly complete in all districts across the state. Given the resources available with the govern- ment,the international support for these projects and the government\u2019s own desire to computer- ize operations, these are the projects that are relatively large in scale and are likely to be sus- tained. There can be little doubt that these do provide the necessary interface for more citi- zen-friendly and transparent governance. However, unless practices and mindsets in the 60 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals The concern of governments at national, state/ provincial and local levels to incorporate ICTs into their development agenda is visible in the large number of \u2018e-governance\u2019 projects that have been initiated in India 61 ICT for enhancing human development: potential and promise The storage of a wide range of information, including documents relating to property rights in computerized databases and providing public access to these databases is seen as promoting transparency of a kind that strengthens democracy, empowers people and speeds up decision-making bureaucracy and the state administration them- selves change, the difference this interface can make would be marginal. Finally, ICTs are powerful tools for human devel- opment since they provide a platform for build- ing networks,exchanging information and ideas, launching campaigns and lobbying for change. One area where this is visible is in the struggle for redressing the sharp gender inequalities that characterize all societies, independent of level of development or institutional features. Perhaps the most significant positive impact of ICTs on women\u2019s empowerment is the enhanced capac- ity of women\u2019s advocacy and support groups to exchange information, coordinate action, and undertake concerted advocacy campaigns. For example, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has been able to extend its outreach pre- cisely because of email and the Internet. One ini- tiative that was critical in making such interaction possible is the construction of email lists and list archives on specific issues by the Sustainable Development Network of Pakistan (SDNP).

The literature on the role of ICT in promoting economic development, despite its short his- tory, makes its generalizations based on the large number of ongoing experiments with using the technology and is characterised by some diversity in the opinions it reflects. The Final Report of the Digital Opportunities Task Force6 highlighted the transformational impact of ICT by examining over 300 ICTs for development initiatives from around the world.These initiatives illustrate the role of ICTs in generating new economic opportunities, delivering improved healthcare and educa- tion, promoting sustainable environmental management, fostering democratic gover- nance by empowering people and organiza- tions,and making government processes more efficient and transparent. Although such studies have suggested that ICT spread has a positive impact on income and employment growth,much of the evidence per- tains to the developed countries. In the case of developing countries where non-ICT invest- ments could have a higher pay-off than ICT investments, the positive relationship could be weak or absent. Hence, there are some who have argued that ICT should not become a \u2018techno-quick-fix\u2019 for solving development problems as there may be unacceptable trade- offs with realization of specific MDGs in less developed countries. According to this view, we are only beginning to understand how the application of ICT affects economic growth and the achievement of specific social goals and there are still serious doubts as to \u2018whether the benefits truly outweigh the costs\u2019.The evidence suggests that ICTs have a strong positive effect on the process of socio-economic development only when governments create and maintain a conducive, enabling environment. In this report,the development effects of ICT are traced through four channels: \u25cf ICT as a sector of economic activity \u25cf ICT as an enabler or input for enhancing human productivity \u25cf ICT as a means of improved provision of better quality services, and \u25cf ICT as a means of enhancing capabilities, especially by increasing access to informa- tion and knowledge that directly enlarge people\u2019s choices and by facilitating the for- mation of groups and networks that con- tribute to human development advance. First, and this is perhaps where the impact of ICTs is immediately visible, attention is paid to 62 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals ICTs are powerful tools for human development since they provide a platform for building networks, exchanging information and ideas, launching a campaign and lobbying for change. One area where this is visible is in the struggle for redressing the sharp gender inequalities that characterize all societies independent of level of development or institutional features the contribution of the ICT sector to the overall economic growth of a nation or even to the global economy. According to the third-quarter 2003 version of the industry-standard IDC Black Book, worldwide IT spending was set for a 5 per cent growth to US$ 916 billion in 2004, while spending on telecom services was expected to show 4 per cent growth to US$ 1 trillion.7 The ICT sector and industry have witnessed unprecedented growth in the past decade. In the mid-1990s, the ICT sector became the world\u2019s first industry to surpass leading industri- al sectors such as automobile and steel. In the latter part of the 1990s, the average annual growth rate of the world economy was around 3 per cent, while the growth of the ICT sector was two or three times that of the growth rate of the world economy. These rates of growth have been sustained despite the growing role of the ICT sector in major economies. Developing countries such as India have also benefited from rapid growth in IT and related sectors. The growth of India\u2019s ICT sectors, espe- cially IT components, has attracted attention for a number of reasons. To start with, the pace of that growth has been rapid, albeit from a low base,tallying with the dynamism seen as typical of the industry and captured by the oft-quoted Moore\u2019s Law.Thus,according to data collated by Dataquest, over the 14-year period from 1990- 91 to 2003-04, the annual compound rate of growth of output was above 35 per cent.8 The area where the ICT revolution has opened up whole new opportunities for developing countries such as India is in the services sector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cea9565-5aae-46d9-b82c-edb10e094f1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cea9565-5aae-46d9-b82c-edb10e094f1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee480a445c3fecd68181ea7a372402a414ec55a5636aee5a9a6ae0c215ed9eb6"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff7bd2bf-31b9-4fc3-b243-e75977823b33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf5044e84cbfaac311ea4b4489f53b3c6d7b97f3da3d137fbb3846f00d70603a"}}, "hash": "3f9f0ba94b15b696d19db2af6e95edaef055b3a076dc69118af5a55b8b346fd3", "text": "Prior to the digital revolution\u2019s transformation of service activity, the provision of most services required the presence of a service provider at the point of delivery of the service.

The digital revolution has changed all that.Now there is a range of services being provided by workers located in a country different from the one in which the service is actually delivered. These services are delivered via telecommuni- cation or data networks, and are either out- sourced or organized by agents in the country of origin of the service to whom the provision of these services are contracted out or outlocated by subsidiaries of corporations from the country of delivery of certain services. Examples of serv- ices outsourced/outlocated include customer interaction services; the processing of credit card accounts, insurance claims and business payrolls; the creation and maintenance of infor- mation bases in the form of networked data centres and their use in the provision of infor- mation services such as help desks;and the gen- eration of digitized records as in the case of medical transcription. Other examples of outlo- cation include investment in design subsidiaries and back-office facilities. The possible range of IT-enabled services in an environment where the service sector\u2019s role is growing worldwide is immense. The reasons why such relocation occurs are obvious. It sub- stantially reduces the cost at which such services are obtained or provided, and so long as an appropriate location in terms of the availability of manpower with the requisite skills (say, basic computer literacy) and the necessary character- istics (e.g., knowledge of English) is chosen, the quality and efficiency of the service is also ensured. Estimates made by the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), India, during the period 1990-91 to 2003-04, indicate that IT software and services exports have been growing at 50 per cent per annum or doubling every 18-24 months.There has been a trend shift in the rate of expansion of IT sector output since 1996-97, driven by exports. While the trend rate of growth of output valued in dol- lars rose from 23.7 per cent during 1990-91 to 1996-97 to 35.7 per cent during 1995-96 to 2002-03,the rate of growth of exports rose from 32.5 per cent to 51.9 per cent during these two periods. As a result, the share of IT software and services exports in India\u2019s total exports is esti- mated to have risen from 3.2 per cent in 1996- 97 to 21.3 per cent in 2003-04,and the ratio of IT software and services revenues to GDP rose from 0.72 per cent in 1997-98 to 1.81 per cent in 2000-01 and 2.64 per cent in 2003-04.\u2020 Second, ICTs enhance the process of human development because of their impact on eco- \u2020 Based on data collated from www.nasscom.org 63 ICT for enhancing human development: potential and promise There are some who have argued that ICT should not become a \u2018techno-quick-fix\u2019 for solving development problems as there may be unacceptable trade- offs with realization of specific MDGs in less developed countries nomic growth through productivity gains that it generates in every sector. ICTs are increasingly being used as the means to design and control processes and operations in the resource extraction industries, manufacturing sector and services. ICTs have, in fact, become indispensa- ble ingredients in all forms of economic activity ranging from design and manufacturing to maintenance of inventories, provision of prod- uct and service information and marketing. They have become vital to the conduct of national and international business transac- tions, facilitating stock market operations, inter- national trade and the functioning of global currency markets.They also play a critical role in computational activities supporting scientific and technological research, and thereby con- tribute to the generation of productivity enhancing technologies and processes. Along these channels, however, quantitative assess- ments of the impact of ICTs become difficult, as they are embedded and integrated into the functioning of almost all industrial and services sectors.This makes it difficult to isolate and then quantify the contributions made by ICTs alone.

Fourth, perhaps the most significant and long- term impact of ICTs lies in their ability to directly expand human choices through increased access to information and knowledge. Knowledge plays a critical role in people\u2019s ability to process, inter- pret, evaluate and deploy information in their own context and in the pursuit of their own inter- ests.Knowledge empowers individuals,organiza- tions and communities by providing them with choices far beyond those that may be available to them otherwise. These choices generate oppor- tunities for increased participation \u2013 economical- ly, socially, politically and culturally. ICTs enable the flow of knowledge across geographical,polit- ical, economic and social borders, thereby break- ing earlier forms of knowledge monopoly which led to the marginalization of large sections of the world\u2019s population. Its role as a carrier technology allows ICT to break barriers to human development in at least three ways not possible before or with other forms of technology: \u25cf Breaking barriers to human knowledge. Access to information and education is indispensable in building human capabili- ties. The Internet and other ICTs are increas- ingly becoming the key delivery mechanisms for information and education to sections of the population that did not have access to educational infrastructure and content. Moreover, these new delivery mechanisms provide access to global and diversified sources of information and educational content thereby enhancing, dramatically, the quality of educational inputs that are available to even the most remote and deprived populations. ICTs are also being actively used in promoting life-long learn- ing and continued education as well as reintegrating unemployed people into the workforce through re-education and retooling of skills.Women and other exclud- ed groups stand to benefit particularly from this. \u25cf Breaking barriers to participation. The world has witnessed innovative uses of the Internet and other ICTs in enhancing politi- cal participation as well as in bringing about greater transparency and accounta- bility.In many parts of Asia, where the mass media have been and continue to be strictly controlled by governments, the Internet has offered a new medium of political mobilization and participation. In Malaysia, the emergence of alternative news and online websites such as Malaysiakini have provided a channel for opposition groups and parties as well as critics of the govern- ment to express dissent, thereby creating a new space for political debate and expres- sion. The Internet has also become a major means for interaction between civil society groups and for raising awareness and run- ning campaigns that lobby for change. Such Internet- and ICT-based news and information groups have contributed to the creation of a more vibrant public sphere. They increase social, political, economic and cultural participation, which enhances 64 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals networking and social mobilization and can make governments more accountable and transparent. \u25cf Breaking barriers to economic opportunity. Since the ICT sector requires less initial investment than the more traditional sec- tors of industrial activity, it lowers the bar- riers to entry into the economy for people who could never break into the industrial sector.ICT provides new and unprecedent- ed opportunities to whosoever has profi- ciency in handling ICT tools and has an idea or service to sell. This is what helped people with ICT skills in countries such as India, China and Malaysia to overcome the traditional barriers to employment and wealth creation by joining the computer software industry or related ICT industries. ICTs have also created new outsourcing opportunities whereby services are pro- vided in one country and delivered to another country. The large and rapidly expanding global software and IT-enabled services outsourcing market provides an array of opportunities to developing coun- tries with labour that is proficient in ICT and relatively cheap. These new avenues of employment have benefited some hith- erto less privileged sections as well; for example, in India, women constitute a large section of the workforce in call and transcription centres. In 1997, there were 173 fixed lines and mobile telephones per 1,000 people. Over a five-year period ending 2002, the figure more than doubled to 364 fixed lines and mobile telephones per 1,000 people.

Although wireless communication is still considered a recent innovation in the evo- lution of telecommunications,adoption rates in developed and developing countries have been astounding. Analysts of diffusion process- es and their determinants have correctly argued that wireless communication will expe- rience exponential growth to surpass landline diffusion, due to faster deployment, lower costs and greater ease of use. On a global scale, the penetration rate for mobile telephones in 2002 was 19.07 per 100 inhabitants, overtaking the penetration for main telephone lines which stands at 17.90 per 100 inhabitants. Most regions such as Africa,Asia,Europe and Oceania have a higher mobile telephone penetration rate compared to their main telephone line penetration rate (Table 4.1). Gartner believes that by 2007, 60 per cent of people aged 15 to 50 in the EU and the US will carry or wear a wireless communications device for at least six hours a day.1 Diffusion rates for relatively newer ICT innova- tions like the Internet are also fast catching up.\u2020 The Internet first began as ARPANET (Advance Research Projects Agency Network) in 1969, which linked US scientific and academic researchers and consisted of four host comput- ers. In 1980, there were 213 host computers in less than 12 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. In the mid-1980s, the ARPANET took its first step out of the US Department of Defence and became the Internet. By the end of the 1980s, connectivity had spread to more than 20 countries with 100,000 host computers.The millionth host was connected in 1992 and, in 2003, more than 200 countries had full TCP/IP (Transmission Control 67 Status of ICT diffusion and the digital divide in Asia MDGs C h a p t e r 4 Main telephone lines Cellular mobile phone (per 100 inhabitants) subscribers (per 100 inhabitants) Global 17.90 19.07 Africa 2.77 4.59 Americas (North and South) 34.73 29.90 Asia 11.99 12.42 Europe 41.34 51.26 Oceania 40.40 48.87 Source: International Telecommunication Union, World Telecommunications Indicators 2004: Access Indicators for the Information Society, electronic version, updated October 2004 and downloaded 2 January 2005.

ICTs can provide new and more efficient methods of production,bring previously unattainable markets within the reach of local pro- ducers, improve the delivery of government services, and increase access to basic social goods and services.There need therefore be no trade-off between investment in ICT and the achievement of development objectives\u201d.1 A hierarchical view of MDGs As many analysts have underlined already, Goal 8 (which covers both ICT and partnerships) can increase the effi- ciency with which the international community will pursue Goals 1 to 7, considering the fact that Goals 2 to 7 are actually fundamental components of a concerted strategy to achieve Goal 1 (poverty eradication). Schematically, this \u2018hierarchy of MDGs\u2019can be represented as follows: Efficiency cum equity From the hierarchy suggested above, one can easily deduct that investing in ICTs will be an important way to: \u25cf increase the efficiency of investments made in sectors such as education or health (e.g.,by increasing the range and lowering the cost of delivering such services), and \u25cf accelerate the fight against poverty.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35784a3e-6d4a-452e-91cd-ffb4f06289bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "35784a3e-6d4a-452e-91cd-ffb4f06289bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4a08e2611abff02ef82f644b9cd99233276df924fae53dbc8d3b27156c7989f"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0a10b6e-0f1c-4d42-94b3-332931aca397", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b3cfa5c395999f1173bf5f0136f3e51c57bc28504c927013f992822afc19766"}}, "hash": "c01ad5f8e490117af306be4fa7875239fa0133827c7fb063a91593a84d699197", "text": "Efforts (resources) from local and international communities to reach MDGs Goal 1 Poverty eradication Goal 8 ICT & Partnerships Goal 2 Primary education Goal 3 Gender equality Goal 4 Child mortality reduction Goal 5 Maternal health Goal 6 HIV/AIDS, malaria, other disease Goal 7 Environment Scorecards and monitoring (tracking 48 indicators) Target 1,2 Target 3 Target 4 Target 5 Target 6 Target 7,8 Target 9 Target 12 to 18 SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION Protocol/Internet Protocol) connectivity with over 500 million users.2 The pervasiveness and growth of ICT is also seen in the number of personal computers (PCs) owned by people.

A recent report reveals that, in 2004, the num- ber of Internet users worldwide had risen to a staggering 935 million (Table 4.3).3 Though the US topped the country-list with 185 million users, China with close to 100 million users was fast catching up. In fact, according to Egil Juliussen, the author of the report, most future growth in Internet users would come from 69 Introduction In other words, when considering efforts to be made to pursue a particular MDG, one needs to keep in mind that the ultimate effect on that particular sector (and its relevant MDG) will be a combination of two factors: \u25cf the resources allocated to the sector, and \u25cf the increased efficiency with which the services appropriate to that particular sector will reach their beneficiaries. Graphically, this can be represented as follows: If one regards ICTs as a significant tool through which efficiency gains can be realized in the delivery of services such as education and health, it becomes useful to consider that any allocation of resources (T) can usefully be shared between direct allocations to the relevant sectors, on the one hand, and support to ICT infrastructure and services, on the other.Using the same type of graphical representation as above,we now have a slightly more complex chain of causalities: Since the realization of MDGs 2 to 7 will ultimately be necessary to the realization of Goal 1 (poverty reduction), investing in ICT should indeed be considered as a tool through which both efficiency and equity concerns can be addressed while pursuing the MDGs.

These countries are also expected to registerk strong growth of wireless Web usage and the cell phone will be the only Internet access device for many new Internet users. The Human Development Report (HDR) 2001 predicted that, by 2005, there will be well over a billion Internet users with access to more information than ever at a rapidly decreasing cost. At that time, there were 2.5 billion unique and publicly accessible Web pages on the Internet with 7.3 million new ones being added every day. As a result of such diffusion, Asian nations are well placed to leverage the use of ICTs for socio-economic and human develop- ment. In just over a decade, several Asian nations have emerged as global leaders in terms of ICT use and penetration. Telephone availability, PC ownership and Internet access are increasing rapidly, pushed by 70 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals A recent report reveals that, in 2004, the number of Internet users worldwide had risen to a staggering 935 million. Though the US topped the country- list with 185 million users, China with close to 100 million users was fast catching up growing government support with pro-ICT policies and regulations as well as much lower start-up costs than those developed countries experienced initially. This evidence is heartening because ICT avail- ability and connectivity are crucial to exploiting the benefits of the technology for human devel- opment. Overall, the promise that the ICT revo- lution holds for development in poor countries takes three forms.First,it is expected to result in the growth and diversification of the ICT sector itself, leading to the rapid expansion of output and employment in the production of currently available ICT products as well as myriad new products the technology is expected to deliver. The consequent income and employment growth, it is argued, cannot but have positive human development implications. Second, the use of ICT in the agricultural, non- ICT manufacturing and services sectors is expected to fundamentally transform the nature of production in these sectors with major implications in terms of labour productiv- ity, growth and employment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6968fcdc-1f3d-4890-86b3-b1d9ba756a71": {"__data__": {"id_": "6968fcdc-1f3d-4890-86b3-b1d9ba756a71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39aa1549dd4da9b0bf07dbf0589e773718f49595edd0d452ecadda9e6fdbc3ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7f7a6be-c5c7-4c13-871a-a53cecc9a247", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05bdcf42610466dee07de5fe6295dfb351cdaba231d2b8e122bf4d36be0667b1"}}, "hash": "3747cd2bef754de17783b4bd24a63bb44e88360923475d0859ca77e42a903612", "text": "Third,the penetration of ICT into activities outside of production is expected to reshape the way work, markets and leisure will be organized, and the way in which individuals and communities can", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d014678-9add-4bfe-a08e-6d4ee13d36b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d014678-9add-4bfe-a08e-6d4ee13d36b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2af1bb6e4270dc541b27b3f2f4514d24d00f4f716f8ee6fe0875084f19a40e6"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9612eab-1b4a-467a-96bf-85e8a6482aa7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6eaa988bc739daf8e1a872fb14a4b5840cb1913364b55f2c9ce1297cb16fd592"}}, "hash": "3b3372e437477fde389a80d4b1356ff13d2653cb3fb269a21cdb80ab50c7ad70", "text": "trade and access information and services. This, in turn, will lead to changes in the structure of markets, improvements in the quality of life, a deepening of democracy, and major advances in terms of human development indicators. Needless to say, each of these routes through which ICTs are expected to affect development is predicated on a certain kind and degree of diffusion of the technology within the country. The first presumes a process of cross-country diffusion, whereby the technologies and the industries that constitute the ICT sector move from early to late entrants.

In just over a decade, several Asian nations have emerged as global leaders in terms of ICT use and penetration on a horizontal intra-country diffusion process. ICT use in the manufacturing sector, it is pre- dicted, will transform the production process and organizational structures of firms,and raise productivity, investment, growth and employ- ment. Similarly, in the services sector, it is expected to change the structure of markets, and the extent and ease of access to and deliv- ery of a range of services. The third route by which ICTs are anticipated to impact development is crucially dependent on a vertical intra-country diffusion process that results in an increase in the level of penetration of the technology,leading to increased commu- nity and individual access to the benefits of the technology. This impacts human development by making these devices the means of service delivery, of ensuring transparency and of enhancing participation. One simple indicator of diffusion is the rate of increase of ICT-related expenditure. Expendi- ture on ICT, which includes external* and inter- nal\u2020 spending on information technology, is on the rise for some Asian countries (Table 4.4). In all countries where data were available (except Indonesia), ICT expenditure is seen to have increased both in absolute terms and as a share of GDP between 1995 and 2001. The extent of increase has varied, with a high absolute increase of around 227 per cent in China and a low increase of a little over 6 per cent in Thailand. India also shows a remarkable increase, more than doubling its ICT expendi- ture over this period.Indonesia is the only coun- try that actually experienced a decline of a little over 18 per cent.In terms of GDP shares the vari- ations recorded are lower, with all countries showing increases including, interestingly, Indonesia. ICT related infrastructure development has also been diverse across Asia. Between 1997 and 2001,the Asian region (East Asia and the Pacific, and South Asia) recorded the highest percent- age increases in tele-density (fixed and wire- less), PC penetration and number of Internet users as compared with the world as well as Europe and Central Asia (Table 4.5). The per- centage increases were exceptional, with East Asia and the Pacific recording around 342 per * External expenditures include information technology products purchased by businesses, households, govern- ments and education institutions from vendors or organizations outside the purchasing entity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9612eab-1b4a-467a-96bf-85e8a6482aa7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9612eab-1b4a-467a-96bf-85e8a6482aa7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2af1bb6e4270dc541b27b3f2f4514d24d00f4f716f8ee6fe0875084f19a40e6"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d014678-9add-4bfe-a08e-6d4ee13d36b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b3372e437477fde389a80d4b1356ff13d2653cb3fb269a21cdb80ab50c7ad70"}}, "hash": "6eaa988bc739daf8e1a872fb14a4b5840cb1913364b55f2c9ce1297cb16fd592", "text": "\u2020 Internal spending on information technology includes spending on internally customized software, capital depre- ciation, and the like.

However, within the Asian region, fixed and mobile phone penetration varied from 45 to 273 per 1,000 people in South and East Asia, respectively, in 2001. Over time, rates of growth in East Asia and the Pacific also exceeded those of South Asia. The access to personal computers has also risen; although not so dramatically. Across the world, the numbers for all regions have doubled with the highest penetration level of 73 computers per 1,000 people recorded in Europe and Central Asia.In East Asia,computer access levels rose from 7.5 to 26 computers per 1,000 people between 1997 and 2002. In terms of technology diffusion and take-up rates, Internet users clearly recorded exponential growth in all regions of the world. However, here also,the growth in the Asian region was the high- est. Asian Internet users have also increased exponentially.In East Asia,the number of Internet users for every 1,000 people has grown from four in 1997 to 44 in 2002.The same story is repeated in South Asia, which had only one Internet user per 1,000 people in 1997 but recorded a jump to 14 users per 1,000 people in 2002. Even though South Asia lags in terms of con- nectivity status relative to the other Asian sub- regions, it has been showing signs of rapidly catching up. In 2001, South Asia, with 43.7 mil- lion operative fixed lines and 8.5 million mobile subscribers, accounted for 4 per cent of the world\u2019s fixed lines and less than 1 per cent of cellular subscribers. Average fixed-line tele- density in the sub-region stood at 3.2 in that year and mobile tele-density was 0.63.However, during 1996 to 2001, the sub-region recorded compound annual growth rates of fixed lines and mobile subscribers of 20 and 78 per cent, respectively, as compared to the world average growth rates of only 7 and 48 per cent during the same period. Thus, relative to the other regions of the world,South Asia emerged as one of the fastest growing markets despite its low telephone penetration. It is not just that the rate of growth during the 1990s has been higher than the world average.In fact,the pace of expansion of the telephone net- work in South Asia has accelerated over time from 7 per cent between 1976 and 1981 to 11 per cent between 1986 and 1991, and 20 per cent between 1996 and 2001. According to Minges and Simkhada4, this acceleration in network growth rate is beginning to impact a long-estab- lished correlation between GDP per capita and fixed-line tele-density. The correlation would have predicted that South Asia\u2019s fixed tele-densi- ty would be 1.2 in 2001. Yet it was almost three times as high, at 3.2.They see this is as evidence that old assumptions about telecommunications development no longer apply. Taking per capita annual investment in telecommunications as an indicator of trends in connectivity in the nine countries in this Report, we find that it has seen explosive increases over the 1990s in China, Malaysia and Thailand, and more moderate increases in Indonesia (Table 4.6) .However,in the case of Indonesia,Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand, there appears to have been a decline in per capita investment by 2002, reflecting possibly the after effects of the finan- cial crisis of 1998. The level of investment has also grown (even in nominal dollar terms) at a relatively slow pace in India and Sri Lanka. It is to be expected that these wide variations in investment would influence the level of connec- In terms of technology diffusion and take-up rates, Internet users clearly recorded exponential growth in all regions of the world.

From being virtually non-existent in 1995 in all the countries covered in this study excepting Malaysia and Thailand, mobile phones are now catching up with fixed lines tivity,which is crucial for the use of ICT for human development purposes. A simple measure used to assess the degree of such diffusion is,of course, tele-density or the number of telephones per 100 inhabitants in the country.In 2002,fixed-line den- sity varied from 2.33 per 100 inhabitants (in Pakistan) to 19.58 (in Malaysia). In terms of tele- density rates (Tables 4.7 and 4.8) in 2001, Malaysia,China and Thailand are the top perform- ers, both in telephone mainlines and mobile phones per 100 inhabitants.While levels of fixed- line penetration were much lower in the other countries, the rate of growth of tele-density was significant in all of them,except Pakistan.The low- est penetration rates are observed for Pakistan for both telephone mainlines and mobile phones, followed by Vietnam, with India and Indonesia coming next for telephone mainline penetration. In most countries, the increase in overall tele- density is being driven by mobile phones. From being virtually non-existent in 1995 in all the countries covered in this study, excepting Malaysia and Thailand, mobile phones are now catching up with fixed lines. In developing countries, where even basic communication infrastructure is a problem, mobile telephony is proving to be a boon.Operators no longer have to invest heavily in hardware and, in countries that are geographically vast or where laying landlines is a difficult process, user rates of mobile telephony are on the increase. However, of the nine countries, it is only in Indonesia,Malaysia,Mongolia and Thailand that mobile phone penetration exceeds that of mainline telephones. The reasons for this are likely to be quite different in these four coun- tries, given that they stand at very different lev- els of economic development. It is likely that, in Malaysia, mobile telephone demand was driven by higher purchasing power whereas, in Mongolia, the absence of fixed-line infrastruc- ture as reflected in its low mainline tele-density of a little more than 5 per 100 inhabitants,is the possible explanation for high mobile take-up rates. In Mongolia, all aimags or provinces (except for Huvsgul), are connected with microwave digital lines, with some aimags hav- ing satellite connections. As for the other coun- tries, India follows Pakistan from the bottom, in terms of the mobile phone penetration rate. However, since 2002, mobile telephony has boomed in India, taking the mobile phone pen- etration rate to 2.4 at the end of March 2004.\u2020 So the picture has changed substantially. 1990 1995 2002 China 1.08 9.67 19.5 India 1.87 2.73 3.4 Indonesia 3.20 8.48 8.1 Malaysia 16.69 85.64 49.4 Mongolia 8.32 1.54 2.1 Pakistan 1.23 3.87 1.2 Sri Lanka 0.90 1.38 1.8 Thailand 7.02 23.68 21.15 Vietnam NA NA NA Table 4.6 Per capita annual telecommunication investment (US$) 1995 2000 2002 China 3.30 11.18 16.69 India 1.29 3.20 3.98 Indonesia 1.69 3.23 3.65 Malaysia 16.57 19.92 19.58 Mongolia 3.50 4.95 5.18 Pakistan 1.67 2.16 2.33 Sri Lanka 1.18 4.14 4.43 Thailand 6.06 9.23 9.87 Vietnam 1.05 3.19 3.76 Table 4.7 Main telephone lines per 100 inhabitants Source: International Telecommunications Union,Telecommunication Indicators Database, various issues. \u2020 Based on figures from the Department of Telecommunications of the Government of India, available at http://www.dotindia.com/networkstatus.htm, accessed on 21 May 2004.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7875de0-5317-478b-b98c-476ebabc762f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7875de0-5317-478b-b98c-476ebabc762f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "432442fae6b2947fc9797b7afa1daf1e239f594508180be9eb185e22e466a2a6"}, "2": {"node_id": "107d5ef6-d40a-4fb6-b095-64791649694d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45c426f089d04ac381b48bf4b8b4e6efc239cb67269dbd44b504b78b585610dc"}}, "hash": "24cbeb17b0aafebdbff9152b806aec894a2234ff3b722718a8fd8e54d7023e2f", "text": "1995 2000 2002 China 0.29 6.58 16.09 India 0.01 0.35 1.22 Indonesia 0.11 1.78 5.52 Malaysia 5.00 21.32 37.68 Mongolia 0.00 6.51 8.89 Pakistan 0.03 0.25 0.85 Sri Lanka 0.29 2.32 4.92 Thailand 2.26 5.04 26.04 Vietnam 0.03 0.99 2.34 Source: International Telecommunications Union, Tele- communication Indicators Database,various issues Table 4.8 Cellular mobile telephone subscribers per 100 inhabitants 74 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals The rise in telephone density as a result of an increase in cellular telephone connections may not be fully indicative of the diffusion of telecommunications technology Source: Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission From John, K.

Pricing is a key factor in this development. Internet access calls are not multi-metred or charged separately for telephone and Internet usage, mobile phones operate on the caller party pays (CPP) princi- ple. Bandwidth prices for an E1 connection (2,048 kb/s) have been reduced from US$ 87,000 in 2000 to US $3,500 in 2003. An interesting feature is that, whether in rich or poor countries, a sharp increase in mobile telephony has been accompanied by a decel- eration in the rate of growth of fixed line pen- etration. In Malaysia, as Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show, the trend in the penetration rate for fixed lines has reached a plateau after 1997 even as the mobile phone penetration rate rose sharply. The same pattern is repeated in Mongolia where national telephone density per 100 peo- ple is 5.4 while mobile phone density is 9.21 per 100 people for the whole country (Figure 4.3). The mobile density in Ulaanbaatar reached 20 while in rural areas this number ranges from 0.35 to10.3. Most aimags have been connected recently with mobile communications and the number of users is rapidly growing. In Sri Lanka too, the numbers of landline con- nections, pay phone booths and radio paging services have been on the decrease since the late 1990s.This has been attributed to the grow- ing popularity of cellular phones, with cellular tele-density surpassing that for all other forms of communication. As a result, Sri Lanka\u2019s tele- density has changed significantly over the past 10 years both in different modes and as an aggregate (Figure 4.4). Despite this,the presence of mobile telephones makes aggregate tele-density an unsatisfactory measure of the extent of diffusion. A very large proportion of cellular phone subscribers are those who subscribe to the service in addition to holding a regular landline. Hence, the rise in telephone density as a result of an increase in cellular telephone connections may not be fully indicative of the diffusion of telecommunica- tions technology among those who were thus far marginalized from the network. Further, there are other features of telephone distribution that point to the fact that tele- density is not an adequate index of diffusion. To start with, the aggregate figure conceals the low penetration of telecommunications capacity and a high degree of urban and regional concentration. As Table 4.9 shows, in the countries for which data is available,urban areas account for more than 50 per cent of fixed lines, with the urban share going up to 90 per cent in the case of Pakistan.

The ratios are far lower in large countries such as India and China, but this is more due to the presence of a larger number of metropolitan cities. But, even there, the metropolitan cities together account for a relatively high share of fixed lines. Thus, to assess the extent of spread of connec- tivity, we need separate indicators of mass access such as the presence of public call offices (PCOs) in rural and urban areas, and direct exchange lines and village public tele- phones (VPTs) in rural areas. These indicators are by no means encouraging.For example, the number of public pay phones for every 100 inhabitants is not merely low in all coun- tries, but has risen extremely slowly in most (Table 4.11). Internet connectivity Even if connectivity in the form of a communi- cations link is established,there is no guarantee that this can be viably expanded to connect a country\u2019s population to the world through the Internet, if that were considered a advanta- geous route to take.

In terms of Internet penetration in Asia, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) estimated that in 2001,the Asia-Pacific had over 160 million Internet users with a penetration rate of 460 users per 10,000 inhabitants. Amongst the nine Asian countries being stud- ied here, China leads with a little over 59 million users, followed by India with a little under 17 million users (Table 4.12).However,with regard to the number of users per 100 inhabitants, it is Malaysia that emerges on top with a penetration rate of 31.96.The other eight countries are all well below this rate,with Thailand coming in second at around 7.76. The lowest penetration rates are observed in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, with a little over 1 user per 100 inhabitants. Here again, access tends to be extremely con- centrated. For example, in August 2000, when there were an estimated 1.6 million subscribers and 4.8 million users in India (0.37 per cent of the overall population),more than three-fourths (77 per cent) of these users were from New Delhi and the capitals of Indian states. Two cities \u2013 Delhi and Mumbai \u2013 alone accounted for more than one-third of all users. Maharashtra, with 453,000 users accounted for 28 per cent of the total. On the other hand, two of India\u2019s most populous states \u2013 Uttar Pradesh and Bihar \u2013 had only 20,000 and 8,000, respectively.6 Clearly, the inadequate spread of connectivity, the per- ceived benefits of connectivity and the cost at which it is available are working against as rapid a spread of the Internet as was seen in the case of radio. With respect to PC penetration, Malaysia leads the nine countries with 14.7 PCs per 100 inhab- itants. All the others have single digit PC pene- tration rates. In fact, Pakistan, India and Vietnam are at the bottom, with the PC penetration rate below 1 per 100 inhabitants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

variations in connectivity and access lend some support to the idea that ICT diffusion could well be accompanied by widening digital divides, stifling the effort to use the technology for enabling the realization of the MDGs The Technology Achievement Index (TAI), first used by the UNDP in HDR 2001, measures \u201chow well a country is creating and diffusing technology and building a human skill base, reflecting capacity to participate in the tech- nological innovations of the network age\u201d.9 The TAI focuses on four dimensions of techno- logical capacity to compute the value of the index: creation of technology, diffusion of recent innovations, diffusion of old innova- tions and human skills. In Asia, as per the TAI, Japan, Korea and Singapore are the only countries in the techno- logical leader category (Table 4.13). The digital divide across countries is evident, with only one country (Malaysia) among the nine being stud- ied here, being categorized as \u2018potential leader\u2019 with a TAI value of 0.396 and a rank of 30 among the 72 countries covered. China, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand come under the \u2018dynamic adopter category\u2019,while Pakistan is marginalized. Categorization was not possible in the cases of Mongolia and Viet Nam as satis- factory data were not available;this itself proba- bly reflects even lower levels of technology adoption. The different levels of diffusion of the technology to and within different countries has resulted in different stages of e-readiness,a term which the Harvard\u2019s Centre for International Development says can be understood as the potential of a community to participate in ICT developments. An oft-quoted index of e-readiness is the Network Readiness Index (NRI).10 The NRI framework for 2004 takes into account more than just ICT use in the economy: it also incorporates factors that contribute towards the use of ICTs for a nation\u2019s development. Originally, the NRI captured the degree to which a community is prepared to participate in the networked world, which was expanded in 2002 to include a community\u2019s potential to participate in the networked world in the future.Top-ranked countries are those with the most developed ICT networks and the greatest potential to exploit the capacity of their net- works. The NRI scores are a combination of indicators on network use and enabling factors reflecting important dimensions relevant for assessing the digital divide. Of a total of 104 countries cov- ered,most Asian countries with the exception of hosts per 100 inhabitants reveals a similar pic- ture. Interestingly, as per available data, broad- band subscriptions (which enormously increase the speed and volume of information transac- tions) as a share of total Internet users range between a low 0.1 per cent for Thailand to 2.5 per cent for Indonesia. This is well below the Asia-Pacific average of 19 per cent (the Republic of Korea leads the world with a massive broad- band subscriber share of 93 per cent).

Fundamentally, a digital divide is a reflection of existing broader socio-economic inequalities. However, experience worldwide suggests that, even while the effort to mitigate these structural constraints should continue, appropriate inter- vention can reduce the degree to which ICT penetration is shaped by them.

This suggests that the term \u201cdigital divide\u201d came to prominence \u201cmore for its alliterative potential than for its inherent terminological exactitude\u201d.8 What such arguments ignore is the fact that even when diffusion occurs there are substantial gaps between sections within developing countries, so that the global digital divide persists even if the line is not draw along national boundaries. 78 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals Enormous digital divides also exist across regions of the world with respect to both PC and Internet penetration, even as the share of Internet users to total population has more than doubled over the short four-year period 1998-2002 in all regions of the world Singapore,Hong Kong,Japan and Taiwan do not rank among the first 20 countries. Many are ranked 30 or lower, with Bangladesh being the least network-ready at rank 100. Of the nine countries covered by this Report, Malaysia at 27 is ranked the highest. At the other end of the scale, Sri Lanka (71) and Vietnam (68) are the least network-ready countries (Table 4.14). Mongolia does not feature in this ranking due to data limitations. Factors influencing the digital divide The extent and likelihood of a widening of the digital divide can be assessed by examining indicators such as penetration, cost, socio-eco- nomic features, use of locally relevant content, and the policy regime. These factors influence the ability to derive economic and social bene- fits from information-intensive activities.9 Penetration With regard to PC penetration,the digital divide is clear across the nine Asian countries (Table 4.12). Although countries in Asia have taken giant leaps in terms of Internet penetration in the past decade, the digital divide across coun- tries is evident (Tables 4.7, 4.15 and 4.16). Putting this in a global context, enormous digi- tal divides also exist across regions of the world with respect to both PC and Internet penetra- tion (Table 4.16). Data in Table 4.15 show that the share of Internet users to total population has more than doubled over the short four-year period 1998-2002 in all regions of the world. However, the US and high income Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries continue to be way ahead of the other regions.Both East Asia and the Pacific, and South Asia are far behind.

South Asian percentages were even lower, at 0.5 and 1.4. Thus, the digital divide in terms of Internet pen- etration clearly persists across regions. This is significant because the United States and high- income OECD countries constitute just 19 per cent of the world\u2019s population. Cost Cost considerations are a critical factor in the digital divide.The poor are already hampered by social factors such as low education and a lack of familiarity with technology. Adding the burden of high cost of access to ICT services only serves to deepen the digital divide.Unfortunately,users in countries which are in the early stages of ICT development encounter higher cost of access as companies have to factor in capital costs as well as a lower user base. Data on Internet retail pric- ing reveal enormous usage cost differences across countries (Table 4.17). While the average usage costs of Internet retail pricing are comparable between OECD and Asian countries at approximately US$ 30.00 and US$ 32.50 respectively, poorer Asian countries such as Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam have sig- nificantly higher than average costs.Particularly striking is the case of Cambodia,where the total cost of Internet usage per 20 hours stands at an exceptional high of US$ 45.40. At the other end of the spectrum, better-off countries like India, Malaysia and Thailand face costs for comparable services ranging between US$ 2 and US$ 5.5 (Table 4.17). Within each country also, cost differences exac- erbate the digital divide. According to the Mongolia country study associated with this Report, the price of Internet connections has been dropping overall. An hourly rate of US$ 0.60 in Internet caf\u00e9s makes access more afford- able for citizens who have no computer at home or in the office, in the urban area of Ulaanbaatar.

In comparison, phone calls cost only US$ 0.06 per minute in Ulaanbaatar. Therefore,the only alternative in rural aimags are the Internet caf\u00e9s at the local post and telecom- munication offices, which charge rates of US$ 0.45 to 0.60 per minute. Retail prices partly reflect the high investment costs associated with networking and Internet provision in developing countries. Thus, it cost the state government of Maharashtra,India,US$ 600,000 to wire up 70 contiguous villages in the districts of Kolhapur and Sangli. With 550,000 villages across India, the cost of wiring every single village in the country would work out at US$ 4.7 billion, which is indeed difficult to gar- ner given other priorities. High investment costs obviously affect the extent and nature of digital provisioning. The Malaysian government has allocated US$ 290 million in its Eighth Malaysia Plan to bridge the digital divide among its citizens,underlining the role of the State in reducing such inequalities. However, Malaysia has also given some compa- nies a Multimedia Super Corridor status which entitles them to financial incentives such as exemption from income tax for up to 10 years or an investment tax allowance with no duties on the import of multimedia equipment.While this provides incentives for companies to establish themselves on the Malaysian technopole, it can have the unintended effect of further privileg- ing the larger business enterprises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4cfeddb-68ef-4fca-85e0-3f29b7940425": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4cfeddb-68ef-4fca-85e0-3f29b7940425", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40a1308012e58f529aff528ee957ac74783e41d9d4a3bffc12a231bb1c324b40"}, "2": {"node_id": "40651f2e-aab1-4b80-93c3-80a87fb0991c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24044c67c123049ff791cb7ddd5e5abfccac1b74b8ac821bd57af1046e1dd243"}}, "hash": "2d5f7dee49fb3a13b78b07415dabc701e82dfbb08a5ee2dc01cfc3dea83d215b", "text": "Hardware and software costs Another area of concern is the cost of hardware.

Priced at less than US$ 200, it is currently being produced in small prototype batches and is being field-tested in selected ICT for development projects. On the software side, the open source software movement is gathering momentum as a means to reduce costs by promoting more equitable and fair pricing. This has generated some inter- esting debates regarding \u2018open source\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 software.Free software,or software for which the source code is available to programmers and users who can modify the software as required, substantially lowers software costs and maxi- mizes diffusion. The attraction of open source software lies in the fact that its use,by government and a large pub- lic, could encourage local software professionals to provide software support in the form of add- on applications that are written at a cost much smaller than that required to buy multi-featured packaged software.This would decentralize soft- ware production, challenging the large transna- tional producers of packaged and bundled soft- ware, who have been able to convert the soft- ware industry from a service industry to one of large-scale manufacturing, thus worsening digi- tal divides. Recently the government of the state of Madhya Pradesh in India publicly announced its decision to use the well-known open source Linux software in its official IT pro- gramme, which includes its e-governance (Gyandoot) and computer-enabled school education (Headstart) initiatives. This is in keeping with trends in other developing countries including China and many in Latin America such as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Peru. Content The information and communication revolution can also bypass the disadvantaged population groups if there is inadequate attention to devel- oping locally relevant content. Issues of poverty, inequality and exclusion cannot be addressed if content does not address real life problems for these groups.For example,information on health that focuses on tackling lifestyle diseases such as obesity is of little use in a situation of poverty and starvation. Similarly,the empowerment of women can hard- ly be promoted through websites where female subjects focus on beauty treatment or pornogra- Another area of concern is the cost of hardware. While tariff and excise duty reduction has helped bring down the cost of ICT equipment, it still is unaffordable from the point of view of providing IT to the masses 81 Status of ICT diffusion and the digital divide in Asia The attraction of open source software lies in the fact that its use by government and a large public could encourage local software professionals to provide software support in the form of add-on applications that are written at a cost much smaller than that required to buy multi- featured packaged software phy. Rural development issues are harder to address if the content does not use the local lan- guage and idiom. Socio-economic factors and the digital divide The digital divide is not limited to issues of penetration and costs of access to hardware and software. Increasingly recognized as more fundamental are factors such as social, eco- nomic, cultural and locational disparities, which lead to further cumulative inequalities. The interdependence among these factors deepens and widens the digital divide, imped- ing the effective use of ICT for human develop- ment. In Asia, gender gaps, urban-rural dispari- ties, special disabilities faced by remote and indigenous populations, inter-generational gaps, all create sizeable obstacles to ICT absorption and use. For example, a study on Net-based advertising targeted at Indians liv- ing in India found there were 3.1 million Internet users in India as of 2000. These users were young (over 70 per cent below the age of 30 years), rich (over 60 per cent came from homes with a monthly income of INR 10,000 or more), and predominantly male (one in every three users was a woman).11 ICTs require specific skills; and that comes in the way of their adoption by the underprivi- leged groups and regions. For example, in less- developed countries, legal and administrative structures that have been considered impor- tant for providing equitable access to all sec- tions of the population are yet to be institu- tionalized.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "446ba231-2d29-477e-9662-c9fbb2a92e88": {"__data__": {"id_": "446ba231-2d29-477e-9662-c9fbb2a92e88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a428daee572ad2c98054b36eae466030d8eb3fbc888081683ca629666a7b8fa9"}, "2": {"node_id": "4cd3323b-e36d-40ec-ad72-f56d6b205cae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f04a6ae5813541b5bdae9bca53971b8cfa31da95f12527ecbd8deb0f84e67fa4"}}, "hash": "ed30186408b8f8e4a4def5e4e26e23a3fef36d159f6d17614bacc5aa4ee23bd3", "text": "Even when these structures are in place, difficulties in implementation can negate their effectiveness for human develop- ment, strengthening the position of economic and political elites vis-\u00e0-vis others.

Policy Appropriate policy regimes can help redress the digital divide. Policies can influence content, access, competition, and availability and spread of infrastructure. Choices guiding ICT initiatives in Asia are often driven by economic and com- mercial interests.The gloss around the technol- ogy obscures social choices about how to com- puterize or communicate, and the ways in which different forms of computerization or communication advance different values.12 ICT initiatives in Asia are also driven by govern- mental agendas such as political interest, social policy and military security, not always consis- tent with promoting human development. The United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development Working Group13 raised some crucial questions which need to be urgently addressed by political leaders and citizens of the developing world. Do the benefits of the increasingly widespread, albeit uneven, diffusion and application of ICTs outweigh the risks for developing countries? Are stakeholders in developing countries tak- ing appropriate measures to minimize the risks of social and economic exclusion that could be associated with these revolutionary technolo- gies? The UNCSTD report and other recent studies not only provide some interesting and useful insights into the problems of access and use of information technology by developing countries but also call for caution and careful planning and implementation of ICT-based programmes if the technology is to be har- nessed for genuine development objectives and goals. The impact of ICTs in a country or a region depends on their specific components, the purpose of deployment and spatial spread, besides the economic, social and administrative environment in which diffusion occurs. It is useful therefore to identify, collate and consolidate evidence of a kind that permits an assessment of the impact of ICT on human development There are differences among planners, policy makers, researchers and others about the role that ICT can play in realizing the MDGs. Many consider the technological opportunities that ICT offers as being important facilitators of the effort to attain the MDGs. The contrary view, however, is that ICT is of no great value and could even be detrimental to populations in the less-developed world, particularly the eco- nomically and socially underprivileged among them. These differences arise partly from the fact that the impact of ICTs in a country or a region depends on their specific components, the purpose of deployment and spatial spread, besides the economic, social and administrative environment in which diffusion occurs. It is useful, therefore, to identify, collate and consolidate evidence of a kind that per- mits an assessment of the impact of ICT on human development. Towards that end, it is necessary not only to identify indicators of the status of ICT use, but also to analyse the nature of interdependencies between indicators of ICT development and those reflecting human development concerns of the kind captured by the MDGs. The present chapter attempts to do precisely this, using empirical evidence from the nine Asian coun- tries that are the focus of this study.The country studies have been used to undertake an empir- ical study which: \u25cf identifies ICT indicators that impinge on the key concerns underlying the human development approach, especially those components emphasized by the MDGs, and \u25cf constructs composite indices for capturing the extent of ICT use for human develop- ment, especially for realizing the MDGs. Through this process, the data relating to the nine Asian countries were used to construct a set of benchmark indices that could help deter- mine and monitor the progress of different countries in using ICT for realizing the MDGs. Recent initiatives and limitations of existing data sources A number of regional and international organi- zations have undertaken similar studies to build a framework for monitoring and assessing the use of ICTs to achieve various socio-economic goals. For example, Orbicom\u2019s Monitoring the Digital Divide assesses the magnitude of the dig- ital divide and, more specifically, the progress of different countries toward the \u2018infostate\u2019, by building thematic clusters of indicators related to info-density and info-use. The Global Information Technology Report, brought out by the Global Economic Forum, provides a frame- work to monitor progress using an index involv- ing measurement of three components: the environment for ICT;the readiness of stakehold- ers; and the usage of ICT among stakeholders. The Global Survey and Guide to ICT Planning in Education is an important contribution to the task of assessing progress in ICT use in educa- tion.

Finally, the International Telecommunications Union\u2019s Report1 seeks to identify \u201crelevant indicators for measuring access of the world\u2019s populations 85 ICT and the MDGs: An index based on empirical regularities MDGs C h a p t e r 5 86 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals to ICTs \u2013 helping to measure the extent to which countries and communities worldwide have genuine access to the information society\u201d.2 The current exercise seeks to build on these ini- tiatives and develop a set of indicators based on the experience of countries in the Asian region.An important effort is that of the United Nations ICT Task Force, established in March 2001,which attempts to combine an analysis of relevant ICT initiatives and the results of research studies relating to them in a coherent framework that offers guidelines for policy. Based on a largely qualitative overview of cur- rent applications of ICT in different countries, the Task Force came out with a set of indicators to chart progress which could help in setting targets for ICT development. It also developed a matrix that maps ICT use for human develop- ment across the eight MDGs. This provides a direction for the current exercise: that of identi- fying ICT goals relevant to the major MDG tar- gets and then constructing a set of compatible ICT indicators. Following this trajectory, a list of indicators under each MDG has been worked out (Appendix II). However, it is not always possible to obtain information on these indicators for Asian countries, since any effort to deal with data deficiencies through cross-country surveys would be prohibitively expensive. This exercise, therefore, aims at making the best use of avail- able evidence to arrive at a set of benchmark estimates of specific indicators. A framework to identify indicators for the construction of a composite index A critical problem in measuring ICT spread and use from the point of view of realizing the MDGs is that of choosing appropriate indicators and assigning weights for composition. Earlier stud- ies on the subject were restricted to the indus- trialized countries. Since problems of diffusion of technology across sectors, regions and groups of the population are less serious for developed countries,concerns about the conse- quences of a digital divide were often ignored. The indicators selected were mostly related to the supply side, such as those pertaining to the availability of PCs, access to Internet facilities, density of telephones, use of electronic goods, and enrolment in or completion of technical education. These data are available in interna- tional publications and on websites. Similar indicators can easily be compiled for Asian countries, although there are problems of com- parability of data in some cases. However, in the case of developing countries, there is a strong case for going beyond supply- linked indicators and attempting to measure the spread of technologies and their role in pro- moting the development process. This would require information on user-specific indicators of ICT applications on the purpose of use, and on the agencies and legal framework used to promote the adoption of ICTs. Unfortunately, existing data sources for Asian countries do not permit construction of such specific indicators suitable for cross-country comparison. Generation of fresh data would make difficult financial and administrative demands on national and international statisti- cal systems. Also, these countries are so very diverse in terms of levels of economic and human development, degree of openness to world mar- kets and socio-cultural specificities that it is diffi- cult to generalize and arrive at a consensus on user-specific indicators.Further,a review of the lit- erature and an analysis of interdependencies of ICT use and human development in developing countries may not be adequate to estimate its role in the future,particularly because ICT use is still in its infancy. Identification of different dimensions of development and their constituent indicators These difficulties necessitate the continued dependence on rather simple and straightfor- ward indicators reflecting, primarily, the degree of availability of ICTs (see the list of supply side relating to the eight MDGs in Appendix II).They are combined with a few sector- or user-specif- ic indicators that can be obtained from interna- tional documents or websites of UN agencies and the World Bank.These indicators are classi- fied into four categories,focusing on four broad aspects: \u25cf those", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28b7bc2c-c6eb-42a2-a94d-4b531c63c2b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "28b7bc2c-c6eb-42a2-a94d-4b531c63c2b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07fcd114f7091b6147592cfb5b0459fb16ae4eb4fab5e4561f88d51b94957f3c"}}, "hash": "07fcd114f7091b6147592cfb5b0459fb16ae4eb4fab5e4561f88d51b94957f3c", "text": "capturing availability or supply \u25cf those measuring \u201cefficiency\u201d (or cost of access) and speed \u25cf those suggesting targeting of social sectors, and \u25cf those reflecting targeting of vulnerable groups (Appendix III).

The first includes popular ICT tools for which users do not require much skill or training such as telephone mainline connec- tions, cellular subscriptions, television sets and radio receivers, all being presented per 1,000 of the population. Under the skill-dependent ICT category, where training and skills are required, the indicators identified are Internet users per 100 people, PCs per 100 people and per capita ICT expenditure. Higher expenditures would imply greater use of ICT by larger sections of the population as they cover purchase of products, including telecom- munication facilities and other equipment for offices, businesses, households, governments and educational institutions.Two separate cate- gories have been kept on the supply side so as to increase the importance of availability-linked indicators in the overall aggregation scheme. Indicators of efficiency and speed The indicators that capture aspects of efficiency are Internet service provider charges, tele- phone usage charges for Internet access, cost of a peak-rate local call per three minutes from a fixed line, cost of a peak-rate call to the United States per three minutes, Internet speed and access, and extent of IT training and education. Information on these indicators is compiled from data obtained from the World Bank and the Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) 2001-02.The indicator of Internet service provider charge is the monthly dial-up access charge for 20 hours of use and that for tele- phone usage charge is the telephone call charge for 20 hours of access. Higher costs would imply lower efficiency and less access. Indicators of Internet speed and access, and IT training and education are positive indicators of efficiency as these assign higher values to countries where ICT facilities are relatively more efficient as manifest in greater speed of access and higher expenditures incurred in training of personnel. Indicators measuring targeting of social sectors These include Internet access in schools, com- puters in educational institutions per 1,000 stu- dents, government prioritization of ICT, and government online services availability. The importance given to universal literacy in the MDGs justifies inclusion of two educational indi- cators. Two government-linked indicators have been included, as the State continues to have a major role in promoting social development. Data on computers in educational institutions are obtained from the World Bank and all other indicators are compiled from the GCR, 2001-02. The latter simply show the \u2018rating\u2019of each coun- try, as assigned by GCR.These ratings, reflecting the performance of countries, are based on an opinion survey of 4,600 senior business leaders from 75 countries. Indicators reflecting targeting of vulnerable groups Five indicators have been identified to assess the contribution of ICTs to improving the status of socially deprived sections of the population: the percentage of women among professional and technical workers; public access to the Internet; government success in ICT promotion; competition in provision of Internet services; and efficacy of laws relating to ICT use. Data on women professionals and technical workers have been taken from HDR 2003 and information on other indicators from GCR 2001-02. Public access to Internet facilities and greater competition among service providers is expected to lead to greater diffusion of the technology, a lowering of prices and an improvement in accessibility: all of which are seen as increasing the access of the economi- cally worse off. Also, greater competition is likely to generate greater employment in the informal sector,ben- efiting poor and vulnerable groups such as women. Government success in ICT promotion as also greater efficacy of the legal system for e-commerce, consumer protection, etc., would reflect the outreach of the technology.This, too, will benefit vulnerable sections that tend to be marginalized under a freely functioning market, without adequate protection of the State or legal institutions. Rationale for selection of indicators What is the extent to which the selected indica- tors can map the attainment of MDGs? For goals like eradication of poverty, the important ques- tion is whether income and employment effects of ICT have a bias in favour of the poor that could help them move above the poverty line.

In any case, availability is a precon- dition for any kind of application, pro-poor or otherwise. This would justify inclusion of avail- ability-linked and efficiency indicators of ICT development.Besides,a role for the State in pro- viding public access to the Internet, in ensuring competition among service providers and a legal system promoting ICT development would help in better penetration of the technology and, thereby, in making a dent on poverty and inequality. It would be useful to construct other indicators for accessibility of the underprivi- leged or coverage of remote and backward areas, but this is not possible with existing offi- cial as well as non-official databases. The role of ICT in improving education has been found to be positive and justifies the inclusion of availability-linked and efficiency indicators to capture aspects facilitating the realization of education-related MDGs. In addition, Internet access in schools and computer use in educa- tional institutions have been considered extremely useful sectoral indicators in articulat- ing progress of countries towards higher quality and universal primary education. Statistics on access to and usage of ICT by women compared to men would be useful in understanding the gender divide in this area. While data are available in The World\u2019s Women 2000, with citations from Cyber Atlas and NUA, there are serious information gaps and prob- lems of reliability due to sources of different quality in the Asian countries. There are also anomalies and inconsistencies in data collec- tion procedures adopted by different countries that are significant, particularly for temporal comparisons.3 One alternative is to use the per- centage of women having a tertiary level of education (university, teachers\u2019 college or high- er professional school), or enrolment of women in the field of science and engineering, but this would be a bit remote in capturing gender sen- sitivity in ICTs. It is, therefore, proposed to cap- ture this dimension through the share of females among professionals and technical workers. With regard to maternal and child health,access to basic amenities and other social sector objec- tives,indicators pertaining to government\u2019s role such as public access to the Internet, success of the State in Internet promotion, and efficacy of laws relating to ICT use, are useful as the State plays a key role in social development in Asian countries. These may be included to indirectly reflect the coverage of social sectors, as disag- gregated data on the use of ICT in these sectors are not available. Besides, use can be made of availability-linked indicators, since the growth of ICT per se can help achieve these goals. The ICT Task Force too recognizes that the selec- tion of indicators will be guided by the availabil- ity of data at each point of time. In particular, it recognizes that the limited availability of hard empirical evidence would constrain the selec- tion of indicators and influence their relative importance. It, therefore, argues in favour of a degree of flexibility in the methodology so that the indicators could be refined over time as data availability improves. In keeping with this per- spective, the attempt here is limited to working out a few composite indices reflecting various dimensions of ICT development as also its over- all progress. In addition, later in this Report, the Task Force\u2019s suggestion that the indexing effort should be complemented with an exercise in assembling anecdotal evidence and profiling success stories is adopted. Component indices on different aspects of ICT development and an aggregate index The methodology In view of the growing popularity of composite indices and the possibility of using the country rankings in terms of various indices in previous studies,it is proposed not to use complex multi- variate tools in the composition exercise. The methodology attempts to aggregate indicators in several stages, as has been done in working out the HDI. The method of assigning weights on the basis of a correlation matrix, such as Principal Component Analysis,is not considered appropriate here since the pattern of interde- pendencies is likely to change as the technology takes firmer roots in the region. As there is no other empirical basis to work out the relative importance of indicators, they are assigned equal weights.

Availability-linked indicators have been placed in two sub- categories: skill- independent and skill- dependent 89 ICT and the MDGs: An index based on empirical regularities In recent years,the methodology for computing HDIs has changed and it uses a fixed range com- puted on the basis of predetermined \u2018goalposts\u2019, reflecting the feasible upper and lower limits for the values. This enables temporal comparisons not only of the rank scores of the countries con- cerned but also of their human development indices. The disadvantage is that the three con- stituent indices pertaining to life expectancy, education and GDP have lost the feature of a fixed range of zero to unity.The highest value in each constituent index falls short of unity as the value for the top ranking country is below the goalpost. The explanation for the minimum value being higher than zero is similar.In view of the popularity of this method among practi- tioners and policy makers, as well as for reasons of comparability,it has been used in the present analysis as well. However, fixing the range of the constituent indices through division by range discrimi- nates against indicators that have greater dis- parity. Also, as the trends in inequality vary across different indicators, it would be inap- propriate to force these to have a uniform and constant range over time. Indeed, with the introduction of the concept of goalposts to compute the range, the (scale-free) values of the indices no longer have a constant range of unity (thereby losing their unique property). However, maximum and minimum values have been specified based on recorded values over recent years and division by the range is expected to ensure that the difference in dis- parity in the constituent indicators does not get reflected in the HDI. There can also be dis- agreements in fixing goalposts for indicators like GDP per capita and life expectancy as the upper bound is based on the judgement of the researcher. On the other hand, the two bounds for literacy and gross enrolment are arithmeti- cally pre-determined.While inequality in these two over time will decline as the maximum value is fixed, the same may not be the case with per capita income.4 Unfortunately, the RE method treats the two types of indices identi- cally. The popularity and acceptability of HDI among policy makers seems to have come in the way of these issues being investigated ade- quately in the literature. It is proposed to use an alternate method that permits the coefficients of variation of different indicators to remain different, even after mak- ing them scale free and lets these differences be reflected in the composite index and ranking. All the indicators have been made scale free through division by their own means.The coef- ficients of variation of the original indicators, thus, become the standard deviations of the scale-free indicators,which are then carried into the component indices. Another important point is temporal compara- bility of the indices.As the present exercise aims at making comparisons across countries only, the elimination of the scale effect has been ensured by dividing each indicator by either range or mean,computed for the chosen year.In case such comparisons are to be made over time, it would be necessary to fix the values of the divisors, as is now being done in computing the HDI for the HDRs. Indeed, for computing ICT composite indices for any future year, it would make sense to use the same means as in the base year in the denominator for each indicator. However,in case the base year is not considered representative of the early years of the 21st cen- tury,it should be possible to work out the mean of the first three years, say 2001, 2002 and 2003, and fix these as the denominators for eliminat- ing the scale bias for all subsequent exercises. Five component indices have been constructed, in the first stage by the RE method as well as by the Division by Mean (DM) method of indexing, to cover the following aspects: skill-independ- ent ICT; skill-dependent ICT; efficiency and speed; social sector targeting; and vulnerable groups targeting.

Component indices obtained through RE method and the corresponding aggregate index Following the RE method,the component index for a category is obtained by first making each indicator scale free, by subtracting its minimum value from each observation and then dividing it by its range. The average of these values across the indicators (within the category) for each country then becomes the value of its component index. Understandably, if a country has maximum values for all the indicators in a category, it will score an index value 1. Similarly, a country will obtain a composite score of 0 only when it has the minimum value in all the indica- tors.The larger the value of the group-specific or aggregate index,the higher is the role played by ICT towards the attainment of MDGs. An aggre- gate index for ICT development has been com- puted by using the same methodology as that for category-specific indices. The indices of skill-independent and skill- dependent ICT availability measure the relative positions of countries in terms of the availability of different types of facilities. Malaysia occupies the top position in both skill-independent and skill-dependent ICT categories (Table 5.1). The value of the skill-dependent ICT index in this case is unity as it secures the highest value in all the indicators belonging to this category. Thailand and China that follow Malaysia are way behind, reflecting the differences across coun- tries within the Asian region. The value of the skill-independent ICT index for Malaysia is also very high but its distance relative to the second and third position countries is less than in the previous case. In sum, the availability of ICT across the countries exhibits wide inter-country variation. The efficiency and speed indices depict the ranking of the countries in providing access to high-speed ICT at low cost. Here, too, Malaysia occupies the highest position.However,its rela- tive position vis-\u00e0-vis other countries is not as high as in the case of ICT availability due to the high costs of providing Internet facilities and of a call to the US, when compared with other countries (the two indicators belonging to this category). Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan report high values (fairly close to Malaysia), although these countries have very low levels of ICT availability. The social-sector targeting index reflects the performance of the countries in promoting ICT in certain specific directions for the well-being of the people. The idea is to assess whether bene- fits of the technology have remained restricted to a few or have percolated down to larger sec- tions of the population. China obtains the high- est position here,followed by India and Malaysia. The high value obtained by China is largely due to the indicators pertaining to deployment of computers in the field of education and the gov- ernment giving ICT a high priority.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2dfe59d-6b30-4200-8de1-eb04f6d5f8d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2dfe59d-6b30-4200-8de1-eb04f6d5f8d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fa2b4122423cf71dd9efb52cf7c93e876fb66145c7e883f519972b709a9a4a5"}, "2": {"node_id": "d711a0fe-aa9f-4da8-9ea3-52eafa3f2166", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "335eb76e37e4e666b8f38e1c050fdc4771a60629683072b9db3fc266e381c22f"}}, "hash": "c1be7d1ba43dcc92e8cea7beaae4139c7b3a58a645df1d68e78f4ce6872db7a4", "text": "Indicators measuring targeting of social sectors include Internet access in schools, computers in educational institutions per 1,000 students, government prioritization of ICT, and government online services availability Indices pertaining to different aspects of ICT development Social Vulnerable Skill- Skill- Efficiency sector group independent dependent and speed targeting targeting Aggregate Country ICT index ICT index index index index index Rank China 0.57 0.12 0.46 0.87 0.39 0.48 2 India 0.04 0.01 0.62 0.65 0.76 0.42 4 Indonesia 0.17 0.04 0.38 0.14 0.40 0.22 7 Malaysia 0.87 1.00 0.67 0.59 0.68 0.76 1 Mongolia 0.14 0.06 0.31 0.09 0.37 0.19 8 Pakistan 0.03 0.00 0.57 0.36 0.48 0.29 5 Sri Lanka 0.18 0.04 0.62 0.10 0.33 0.25 6 Thailand 0.49 0.21", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9439ffc-6ab4-476e-90ec-0711b32a4cae": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9439ffc-6ab4-476e-90ec-0711b32a4cae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6e0cd6a5d2eb7171e0982dcc51353d3f808da60c5cfac587f7ba3041ff8d348"}, "3": {"node_id": "b58f7096-54f6-443d-87a2-be2ffa771939", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "007e24ab6896320e16979fab1972ea6d5054082072be54153c77c27f1dac224f"}}, "hash": "49b54a353d6b217ba3e9f861da5dd6553254a80adf636f17c96e1b5b7af84b16", "text": "0.50 0.57 0.59 0.47 3 Vietnam 0.18 0.04 0.29 0.06 0.24 0.16 9 Table 5.1 Component indices showing different aspects of ICT development and the aggre- gate index as obtained by RE method for nine Asian countries 91 ICT and the MDGs: An index based on empirical regularities Five indicators have been identified to assess the contribution of ICTs to improving the status of socially deprived sections of the population: the percentage of women among professional and technical workers; public access to the Internet; government success in ICT promotion; competition in provision of Internet services; and efficacy of laws relating to ICT use The vulnerable-group targeting index measures the efficacy of the system in reaching the bene- fits of ICT to women and ordinary citizens through legal and governmental support. India is placed in the top position, followed by Malaysia;and this is due to high values reported on public access to the Internet, government\u2019s success in ICT promotion, competition among Internet service providers and a developed legal system governing ICT use. The aggregate index is a summary measure of the five component indices. It may be taken to reflect the overall progress a country has made in promoting ICT for human develop- ment. Malaysia records the highest value, fol- lowed by China and Thailand. India comes fourth and this is due to its scoring high val- ues in categories other than availability of ICT. Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Indonesia are placed at mid-level, indicating a modest role for ICT in promoting socio-economic devel- opment. Mongolia and Vietnam have a long way to go, particularly in terms of targeting specific social groups or vulnerable groups of the population. Component indices obtained through the DM method and the corresponding aggregate index In applying the DM method, the indicators in each category are divided by their respective means. The values obtained are added up for each country to obtain the component index for the category. An identical procedure is adopted for computing the aggregate index of ICT development,based on the category-specific component indices. The leading position of Malaysia in ICT develop- ment emerges in all categories of indicators, except the social-sector targeting index where China takes the initiative (Table 5.2). The posi- tion of Malaysia is particularly impressive in availability of skill-dependent ICT for which the value works out to about 25 times that of the average for India and Pakistan, the two coun- tries occupying the lowest positions. In skill- independent ICT again,Malaysia has a very high value (followed by China),exhibiting a huge gap relative to India and Pakistan. In the case of ICT efficiency,indices for India and Pakistan are impressive, and almost similar to Malaysia and China. Sri Lanka, which secures modest values in availability-linked indicators, goes to the top for efficiency. This index does not show much variation across countries as costs are becoming similar around the world, impacted by globalization. In targeting social sectors,China secures the highest value,basically because of the substantial use of ICT in educa- tional institutions and the high priority assigned to the technology by the government. It is only in this category that we see Malaysia sinking very low, going below the average of the series, while India and Thailand attain significantly higher positions.

Immediately following them are Mongolia and Indonesia.These report medium level values in all the five categories of ICT development. Pakistan and Vietnam are at a lower level in the final aggregate index.The two reflect opposite development patterns,with the former showing high values in efficiency and targeting while the latter has a significant edge in availability. Comparison of the alternate sets of indices A quick comparison of the rankings obtained from the two composite aggregate indices (by RE and DM methods,respectively) suggests that the results are not very different. The top three positions are occupied by Malaysia, China, and Thailand and the bottom position by Vietnam as per both methods. There are a few marginal changes in the ranking of the middle order countries.It could be argued that since the pro- posed DM method gives results similar to the RE method, the credentials of this alternative needs to be noted in the literature of aggrega- tive indices. The objective of using the two dif- ferent methods in this exercise, however, is quite different. It is to identify and focus on the differences that have emerged from the two methods and to analyse the reasons for these differences in the context of the dynamics of ICT development. The first major difference is that despite the ranks of the countries being similar, the gaps in the values of the indices are quite different. For example, the difference between China, Thailand and India, obtained by the RE method, may be seen as insignificant. This, however, is not the case with the results by the DM method. Of particular importance here is the gap between India and the other two countries,which is due to the low values of the former for two composite indices of ICT avail- ability. It is important that the alternate DM approach succeeds in retaining the significant variation in these two indices (Table 5.2), and that these are reflected in the aggregate index which brings down the figure for India.The RE method implicitly reduces their importance by treating them at par with other (compo- nent) indices that do not exhibit significant inter-country variation. Similarly, Mongolia and Vietnam score very low values in the aggregate index by the RE method, which is not the case with the alternate DM method. This again is because the availability indica- tors, for which these two countries record rea- sonably high values, receive low weightage in the logic of aggregation applied in the com- putation of the HDI. One major difference is in the ranking of Pakistan vis-\u00e0-vis Sri Lanka in the aggregate index by the two methods.The higher scores of the latter on availability are reflected in the aggregate index by the DM method,with a rela- tively higher weight giving it a higher rank. In the RE method,the importance of the availability indices (with high disparities) are implicitly reduced, which is responsible for a reversal in ranking. Division by mean eliminates the scale bias but not disparity. Sri Lanka has higher scores than Pakistan in a large number of indi- cators,and by a huge margin in absolute as well as relative terms. The difference in ranking occurs even in catego- ry-specific component indices. Sri Lanka and China get top positions in terms of efficiency and targeting of social sectors respectively by the DM method,leaving Malaysia behind (which is placed at number one in both as per the RE method).Most of the indicators in the two cate- gories have low variation. All the countries have similar values except for telephone charge for Internet services and computers installed in educational institutions. Both indicators are important within their respective categories and are responsible for much of the variation across countries. Importantly, Sri Lanka\u2019s advan- tage lies in charging low prices for Internet serv- ices while China\u2019s is in promoting computer education in schools. The DM method, by implicitly giving higher weightage to these indi- cators, has placed the two countries above all the others in these categories. Similarly, Malaysia is able to get past India in terms of the vulnerable-group targeting index (the latter having the top position by RE method) as it has a larger percentage of female professionals among workers and the method implicitly gives The ICT Task Force too recognizes that the selection of indicators will be guided by the availability of data at each point of time. In particular, it recognizes that the limited availability of hard empirical evidence would constrain the selection of indicators", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b531c91-c6f5-41bf-893a-737ab7d8e96e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b531c91-c6f5-41bf-893a-737ab7d8e96e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ec0a8676f9be7c5efafbd25db82ac9ddcfebcf7c4d5c978d2f55acf92ed1a5f"}}, "hash": "3ec0a8676f9be7c5efafbd25db82ac9ddcfebcf7c4d5c978d2f55acf92ed1a5f", "text": "and influence their relative importance 93 ICT and the MDGs: An index based on empirical regularities a higher weightage to the indicator because of its higher disparity. It is not the purpose of this statistical exercise to establish the superiority of one method over the other, as their suitability would depend on the objectives of the exercise and empirical reg- ularities observed in the region under investiga- tion.This discussion makes it clear that a change in the methodology of composition can and does bring about significant changes in the val- ues of component indices, and can alter even the ranking of countries. Issues of value judge- ment, implicit in the methodology, cannot be dismissed. It has been demonstrated that the RE method inherently gives lower weightages to indicators pertaining to availability and a few other aspects of ICT development that are observed to have high disparity. These disparities are the result of the process of development, mediated largely through the market, with limited control being exercised by the government.In the earlier sections,it has been argued that ICT is still in the initial stages of development and,consequently, increase in its availability itself could prompt socio-economic development. Several econom- ic, social and cultural factors are currently inhibiting the process of growth and an increase in the availability of ICT will help increase the exposure of policy makers, admin- istrators and lay people to the global informa- tion system. Further, this would lead to the establishment of better communication net- works even within the countries and facilitate decision-making by public and private agen- cies. The supply of ICT is strongly linked with economic affordability, bringing in high dispari- ty. Also, economic factors affecting affordability will be important in future years as well for the development of ICT. In view of all this, giving importance to availability indicators does not seem misjudged. National governments in the Asian region have tried to give a direction to the development of ICT by intervening in the market, controlling prices, introducing it in social sectors, fixing pri- orities, strengthening the legal structure for ensuring access to all,etc.Importantly,the cross- country differences in the concerned indicators are not very high as may be inferred from the low coefficients of variation of the indicators (Appendix III) belonging to third, fourth and fifth categories. Irrespective of socio-political structures, each country has taken measures to push the diffusion of the technology. There are specific measures adopted by individual governments to direct ICT towards the MDG objectives but it is impossible to generate cross-sectionally comparable data on this. Also, the success of such measures has been limited and uneven across countries, due to the overwhelming role of markets. This is reflected in the sectorally and spatially unbal- anced growth of ICT, evident from the high disparity of the indicators of availability, belonging to the first and second category. Therefore, maintaining the variation of the indi- cators (by making the standard deviation of the original indicator the coefficient of the scale- free indicator) and then giving equal weightage to their variations in the aggregation scheme appears appropriate. Studies have shown that indicators that play a significant role in the development dynamics of less-developed countries exhibit high disparity in space.5 Undoubtedly,this kind of regularity observed in certain contexts cannot claim universality. However, given the pattern of development noted through correlation analysis and a review of the literature relating to the Asian region, the retention of the variation in availability indica- tors in the process of composition can be justi- fied. This implies giving higher weightage to availability indicators, the rationale for which has been discussed while analysing the devel- opment dynamics in the region. In brief To assess the levels of ICT applications for human development aimed at realizing the MDGs, indicators were identified to capture five dimensions or broad categories of ICT develop- ment. Component indices were worked out for each of the categories by aggregating the con- stituent indicators after eliminating the scale bias. This was done with both the RE method used by UNDP in computing HDI and the DM method. An aggregate index was then comput- ed based on the category-specific component indices by each method. These indices present the relative position of the nine countries in terms of development of ICT for attainment of MDGs. Malaysia has the highest value in most of the category-specific component indices as well as the composite aggregate index, because of its The indices of skill- independent and skill- dependent ICT availability measure the relative positions of countries in terms of the availability of different types of facilities.

China and Thailand follow in most of the indi- vidual indicators as well as component indices. However, in social sector targeting, China goes past Malaysia to the top position by both meth- ods, due to its emphasis on the use of ICT in education.Thailand is at par with these two but gets a lower aggregate value due to deficiencies in availability indices. At the lower end are Mongolia and Vietnam, though they are fairly high in terms of availability indicators \u2013 way ahead of India or Pakistan.The latter two coun- tries, however, have an advantage in efficiency and in targeting social sectors and vulnerable groups.The third South Asian country,Sri Lanka, has fairly high values for availability and occu- pies the top position in terms of ICT efficiency by one method. Indonesia has middle level val- ues in almost all the indicators and figures in category-specific as well as composite aggre- gate indices. An important point emerging from the analysis is that, in assessing the progress of ICTs for achiev- ing any set of socio-economic goals, there would have to be an emphasis on availability indicators. In addition,several efficiency-linked and user-spe- cific indicators should be included in the analysis. For that, information must be gathered covering aspects of affordability, access and utilization of ICT.These should bring in the demand side more strongly and reflect the spread of technology not only across economic and social classes but also regions,sectors and gender categories.Indicators, for example, may be built to articulate what per- centage of households in certain social, econom- ic,rural and vulnerable groups,such as tribals and other disadvantaged sections, are able to make use of ICT for applications relevant to them. Alternatively, one can try to build up \u2018surrogate end points\u2019 such as better information flows and better management of education, health and public delivery systems using ICT, for assessing progress towards achieving the MDGs. There are wide variations across the Asian region in the development and use of ICT for realizing the MDGs, which are not necessarily related to a country\u2019s development as measured by per capita income While the index to measure the impact of ICT on development needs refinement, the attempt to derive such an index does point in one direc- tion. There are wide variations across the Asian region in the development of ICT and its use for realizing the MDGs,which are not necessarily related to the development of a country as measured by per capita income.This is a pointer to the possible role of appropriate policies aimed at reducing the shortfall in performance relative to the potential. Concern with developing an appropriate policy framework for harnessing ICT for development in developing countries is relatively recent. However, an examination of ICT policies indi- cates that by the late 1990s all the Asian coun- tries in this study had put in place a policy framework seeking to accelerate the pace of ICT development.This chapter seeks to examine the extent to which these frameworks are sensitive to human development concerns and the ways in which they implicitly seek to realize the MDGs by promoting ICT use. It needs to be noted that ICTs are neither a stand-alone solution to development problems nor can they replace traditional development initiatives and investments. However, the evi- dence suggests that as Asian nations pro- gressed, so did their understanding of using ICTs for human development.The zeal to devise an appropriate policy framework was,therefore, also accompanied by a tendency to place human development concerns at the heart of each nation\u2019s ICT regulatory framework. Policies tend to be more than just focused on ICT pro- motion through provision of tax breaks and subsidies; they take into account all the con- stituents of a nation from the underprivileged to its business community, and are informed by a range of human development concerns. In particular, government policy tends to empha- size initiatives that can bridge the digital divide and reach the power of ICT to as large a propor- tion of the population as possible.

During the same period, other countries too have been in the process of formulating an appropriate policy framework. In Malaysia, the National IT Agenda (NITA), launched in December 1996 by the National IT Council (NITC), acknowledges the potential for accel- erating and transforming development processes through ICTs, information and knowledge. NITA is a framework for develop- ment in the Information Age that encompasses comprehensive human development, envi- sions the mobilization of the entire nation, views ICTs as a strategic development tool, and seeks to leverage tri-sectoral partnerships as well as top-down and bottom-up approach- es in implementation. NITA focuses on three development areas: people, infostructure (hard and soft infrastructure) and applica- tions, and content. The intent is to provide equity and access to all Malaysians so that they can create value and thereby transform Malaysian society. The release in 1997 of a document titled \u201cNusantara 21\u201dmarked the first major national ini- tiative to develop ICT in Indonesia. Conceptually speaking,Nusantara 21 was a grand design for an information infrastructure that covers the entire archipelago of Indonesia. To support, accommo- date and coordinate the various needs of Nusantara 21\u2019s stakeholders, the Government of Indonesia issued Presidential Decree No. 30 in 1997 that established a coordinating team from 16 technical departments and agencies of the government.The team was called Tim Koordinasi Telematika Indonesia (TKTI: Coordinating Team for ICT Development in Indonesia) and was chaired at that time by the Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution. Under the TKTI, a National IT Framework (NITF) document was prepared by the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) in February 2001 and submitted to TKTI. The NITF document prioritizes five strategic objectives in ICT development: \u25cf e-government for good governance \u25cf e-commerce to support a sustainable economy ICTs are neither a stand-alone solution to development problems nor can they replace traditional development initiatives and investments. However, the evidence suggests that as Asian nations progressed, so did their understanding of using ICTs for human development There are two major sections in Thailand\u2019s current Constitution which outline the foundations of ICT in the national development context.These are: i) Chapter III \u2013 Rights and Liberties of the Thai People, Section 40 \u201cTransmission frequencies for radio or television broadcasting and radio telecommunication are national communication resources for public interest.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8aa2663-6842-418a-9c17-a8c2aa1e2a81": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8aa2663-6842-418a-9c17-a8c2aa1e2a81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39b576752f8cff1aa180671a4be3575e1f31983ae65a5b2b9c77bacd8008ba93"}, "2": {"node_id": "ace16e00-8219-4824-8add-caeab5b57f67", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a0a295e44f16385ee1d94614985620997f0ffa8fd6879c1c00a29f15155c3ad"}}, "hash": "64248c57d3784ea1c16bcea4d571749b6e94670c1a167bad1effeabd6c2225fe", "text": "There shall be an independent regulatory body having the duty to distribute the frequencies under paragraph one and supervise radio or television broadcasting and telecommunication businesses as provided by law.In carrying out the act under paragraph two,regard shall be had to utmost public benefit at national and local levels in education,culture,State security,and other public interests including fair and free competition.\u201d ii) Chapter V \u2013 Directive Principles of Fundamental State Policies, Section 78 \u201cThe State shall decentralise powers to localities for the purpose of independence and self- determination of local affairs,develop local economics,public utilities and facilities systems and information infrastructure in the locality thoroughly and equally throughout the country as well as develop into a large-sized local government organisation a province ready for such pur- pose, having regard to the will of the people in that province.\u201d Section 40 is related to the development in the telecommunications arena whereas Section 78 recognizes State responsibility to provide an equitable information infrastructure and becomes a guiding principle for the drafting of the National Information Technology Policy.

These were: IT in government; IT spread and IT aware- ness;and citizen-IT interface.With regard to IT in government, the Task Force recommended complete computerization (\u201cup to viable limits\u201d) of government in five years. The objective of such computerization was to reach service delivery as close to the citizen as possible, with minimal intermediation and at affordable cost. The argument was that unless computerization progressed significantly in government, it could not spread adequately outside. To that end, it recommended that 2 per cent of the budget in every government department should be ear- marked for the introduction and use of informa- tion technology, including training. In the area of IT spread and awareness, the Task Force,besides recommending reaching comput- ers and the Internet to every school and college within five years,called upon the government to launch a range of value-added network services. The committee argued: \u201cWhile providing deliv- ery of services, use of a variety of technologies and solutions could be explored. These could include home-based computers,ATMs,electronic kiosks, telephones, smart cards, etc. Such net- works could substantially promote govern- ment\u2019s efforts to provide a \u2018one-stop non-stop\u2019 interface with the public\u201d.1 The Task Force also felt that, for at least about two decades, it will not be possible to provide either telephones or Internet or other informa- tion services universally i.e. to more than 90 per cent of households, since many would not be able to afford private subscriptions.It,therefore, recommended that these should be made avail- able on a public access basis, just as long dis- tance services are available through STD/ISD booths. Since there were more than 600,000 of these booths in 2003, with a significant propor- tion located in villages, it suggested that as many as possible should be converted into Public Tele Info Centres. Finally, the committee called for the use of the Freedom of Information Act to make available all official databases online to intensify democ- racy and increase transparency. More recently, as a follow-up to the work of the committee, the government set up a Working Group on Information Technology for Masses, on 10 May 2000. The working group was man- dated to: \u25cf review various schemes and major initia- tives taken by various government agen- cies for taking IT to the masses \u25cf identify potential areas and applications for deployment of IT for the masses \u25cf recommend development schemes/pro- grammes for citizen participation for taking IT to the masses, and \u25cf prepare a comprehensive plan for taking IT to the masses. The Working Group examined four areas \u2013 infra- structure and services, electronic governance, education,and mass campaign for IT awareness \u2013 and came up with a range of detailed recommen- dations in keeping with the thinking outlined ear- lier.Thus,it is clear that at least at the level of poli- cy formulation and statement, a range of human development concerns do enter into the policy framework of the Government of India. Further, there is a substantial degree of recognition of the constraints to ensuring the reach of ICT to the extent needed for it to be a major instrument of development,so that policy does take account of the need for reducing costs and mobilizing resources. However the thrust is indeed quite recent and it remains to be seen whether policy will actually be translated into practice. The ICT legal framework and national ICT vision of Vietnam has been elaborated in Directive 58-CT/TW, dated 17 October 2000, of the Communist Party of Vietnam on accelerating the use and development of IT for the cause of industrialization and modernization. In this Directive, the Vietnamese Government has rec- ognized that IT is one of the most important enabling forces for development. It sees it as one among many means to improve the peo- ple\u2019s quality of life and also create possibilities for a quantum jump in the areas of industrial- ization and modernization.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "667e9019-2eff-4589-bd7d-112be631fd28": {"__data__": {"id_": "667e9019-2eff-4589-bd7d-112be631fd28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f8bb3bdd60422ee404cedf87c2372f260474d8d2f006ee8053f758bbeee4c39"}, "2": {"node_id": "351ae7f7-5fdc-44e7-9dd5-c566020e9596", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5df416bedf2c607cf02067e56e2445e3b4e7fc4d238b5537f400dee4c98922a"}}, "hash": "d664c6c02d86ee9984cc68f0ae225cfb858c7e9e0637d35a0e4591d56f0f9b61", "text": "Not surprisingly, the government wants to ensure that, by 2010, the national information network is developed to reach nationwide coverage.It will support large traffic,high speed Government policy tends to emphasize initiatives that can bridge the digital divide and reach the power of information and communication technology to as large a proportion of the population as possible 100 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals and quality service at a cheap price so that it can raise the proportion of Internet users to levels reflected by the global average.The targets are cau- tious.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "647aca64-17e1-4204-b045-79ed5479b314": {"__data__": {"id_": "647aca64-17e1-4204-b045-79ed5479b314", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a70c540f81a61081db3581c3d50ca75f70e82a857e885df9217d40b481ffdbd"}, "3": {"node_id": "2aa94856-5a6d-48bb-a0fd-b206087abde4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6459e77998d32a52e80e6ac34bafad0310a163ebea97a9608e475ddcec9b8ea9"}}, "hash": "3fea15cef279db7f563f357a2ca2d6a5f69dcecddd75287cfa89e637019a2bc1", "text": "Decision No. 95/2002/QD-TTG of the Prime Minister,dated 17 July 2002,approves the Master Plan for Information Technology use and development in Vietnam in 2005.It targets that, by 2005, average IT penetration and effective- ness all over the country will be of medium level as compared with that of other countries in the region. It also envisages that the level of IT use in activities of the Party and State management agencies,political and social organizations,flag- ship economic branches of the national econo- my in the central government,and in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh cities will be similar to that in the advanced countries in the region. The Mongolian Government is paying similar attention to ICT development as an accelerator for economic and human development.The main blueprint for the ICT sector is the \u201cICT Vision-2010\u201d document which seeks to develop a \u201cknowledge- based society to improve the quality of lives of the citizens\u201dby ensuring that,\u201cregardless of where cit- izens live\u201d, opportunities \u201cfor their equal and active participation in social life, for improving quality of life and to freely communicate with each other and the world community\u201dexist. Needless to say, the direct emphasis on human development concerns in policy tends to vary. In Pakistan, the IT Policy and Action Plan itself makes only two specific references to human development goals: \u25cf Section 3.4.2.3 on IT Education makes par- ticipation by rural and poor segments of society in IT education a strategic priority for both social and economic development, and \u25cf Section 3.4.12.2.4.2 on IT in the Economy recognizes the need to develop new ways to use information technology to help solve the most pressing problems of human and economic development \u2013 education, health, poverty alleviation, rural development, and care for the environment. However, towards these ends, the IT Action Plan makes several implicit commitments, both strategic and financial, that have human devel- opment implications: \u25cf Section 4.6.1 on Universal Internet Access commits the government to spreading Internet access to remote locations and Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) to making the UIN (Universal Internet Number) into a local call (from remote locations) to the nearest PoP of one or more Internet Service Providers (ISPs). This will enable equitable access.In parallel, a drastic reduction in leased line charges is expected to enable ISPs to go to smaller locations, and \u25cf The IT Action Plan Projects Portfolio of the National IT Policy and Action Plan has a project (item 15) called \u201cCommunity Internet Centres in Rural Areas\u201dwith an allo- cation of Rs 70 million over three years (at the 2002 exchange rate of US$ 1 = Rs 58, this is the equivalent of US$ 1.2 million). In addition, there is a project for the \u201cDeployment of Internet Kiosks at Post Offices and Public Places\u201dwith an allocation of Rs 150 million (US$ 2.59 million). Finally, there are two e-government projects with total allocations of Rs 675 million (US$ 11.64 million). In urban areas,where infrastructure is adequate, government policies have already helped expand real access by lowering the cost of Internet access over fixed-line telephones. This has been done with the establishment of the \u201c131\u201duniversal access prefix for all ISPs.Through this facility, Internet users need only pay the charges for a single local call to access their ISP, regardless of the duration of the call. This serv- ice, available only in 29 cities in 2000, was extended to over 805 cities, towns and villages across Pakistan in March 2003.2 This represents remarkable progress towards a universal service regime in the country,although it would be pre- mature to suggest that Internet access or usage is universal. Key obstacles are low bandwidth in non-metropolitan areas and unreliable ancillary services (electricity, maintenance and repair services) and lack of demand for the resulting services. What the Pakistan experience suggests is that, rhetoric aside, the basic thrust of policy aimed at using ICT for development in most Asian developing countries is the same as those cap- tured in the objectives and the first three themes specified in Thailand\u2019s policy. The three objectives are those of ensuring an equitable information infrastructure, building capacity for exploiting that infrastructure, and investing in good governance.

State initiatives to realize this are particularly important in countries with sharp social and economic divides and in those where geography makes universal provision dif- ficult. For example, in China, which has put a strong emphasis on information technology within the context of its 10th Five-year Development Plan (2001-2005) and targets widespread usage of computers and the Internet, the statement on \u201cTelecommunication Regulations and Rules of People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d stipulates that telecom service providers/operators must fulfil the obligation of \u201cuniversal service\u201d. The aim is to ensure that all citizens, living anywhere in the country, are able to access telephone and other basic communi- cation services at an affordable price. To that end, the policy in China recognizes the need for special expenditures for bridging the digital divide among regions. In fact, success in bridging the digital divide is impossible without special expenditure from national budgets. Hence, the government has not only invested heavily in the creation of telecommunications infrastructure, but also in universal telecommu- nication access in rural and remote areas.In par- ticular, plans have been made to accelerate the construction and improvement of an informa- tion infrastructure that can meet the socio- economic needs of western regions of the country. Moreover,special efforts have been made by the government to cultivate a number of promising IT industries in the western regions. Even in Pakistan which still scores low in terms of the ICT for Development Index,policy calls for massive governmental investment in IT and the Internet. It recognizes the increase in govern- mental efficiency and transparency that would be introduced by the application of ICTs to the ways in which government conducts its work. The policy also requires the government to allo- cate a minimum of 2 per cent of the budget for IT services, although it is unclear whether that allocation is to be made at the national budget level, or at secondary and tertiary levels throughout the country.\u2020 This is not to say that there is no role for private enterprise in Internet provision. Rather, the policy identifies \u201cthree general principles that should be adopted if the Internet is to grow in Pakistan\u201d: \u25cf existing regulatory structures should not be forced on it \u25cf competition in Internet growth should be encouraged, and \u25cf unnecessary regulations should be avoided. Even if an adequate infrastructure is built,its use depends on awareness and capability. Therefore, the promotion of the Internet as a medium of communication across the spectrum of business and government is a second key ele- ment of most national IT policies and action plans. The government\u2019s role is considered cru- cial in generating mass awareness of the Internet and IT,and in building the capability for ICT use. The emphasis on awareness in the Government of India\u2019s policy framework had been discussed earlier.Such awareness is visible elsewhere too. In Pakistan, for example, the IT policy, in demanding the infusion of Internet, email and other ICTs into government operations and functions,also recognizes the need to universal- ize awareness and knowledge about the pres- ence of these technologies, and their ready availability. It calls for massive awareness cam- paigns,frequent references to IT by government leaders, special events to promote IT, and the establishment of working groups to create awareness at every government department in the country. The policy also recognizes that awareness per se can be rendered useless without creating an environment in which the Internet as a consumer-driven service can flourish. The policy calls on PTCL to play a facilitative, non- intrusive role in the development of a com- petitive and free environment for the provision of Internet services, both at the back-end (backbone services providers) and at the front end (Internet Service Providers and content providers). A prerequisite for ensuring an equitable information infrastructure is investment: both public investment as well as complementary private investment. However, the infrastructure thus created may not in itself be equally accessible \u2020 Section 3.4.12.1.4.2: A minimum of 2 per cent of the budget shall be allocated for IT services and provincial as well as federal IT departments will allocate a substantial sum annually for developing IT infrastructure and conducting training at all levels in the government. 102 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals Reducing cost Cost considerations are an important factor in reducing the digital divide.Hence,governments in Asia are taking a proactive stand on reducing ICT costs.

As a fundamental and strategic industry, telecom- munication operations have been monopolized by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunica- tions of China for more than four decades. Therefore,the Chinese Government did not sim- ply follow the trend towards a private, liberal- ized telecommunications order but carefully managed the introduction of market forces,and balanced development goals with its need for control. As a result, while the telecommunica- tion operators remain State-owned, the basic telecommunication market advanced from a monopoly to a duopoly, and is now being extended to pluralistic competition. The reform of telecommunication operations began with some decentralization of decision- making and profit, via the contractual responsi- bility system in 1985.Further structural reforms \u2013 separating postal and telecommunication opera- tions from each other and from governmental supervisory functions \u2013 were implemented dur- ing the period 1988-91. In the 1990s, the Chinese Government adopted a series of reform measures that, in less than three years, accom- plished the tasks of separating enterprises from government and post from telecommunica- tions,reorganizing industry sectors,dismantling monopoly and introducing competition in all service sectors,including basic and value-added telecommunications and information services. In 1994,China Unicom was formed,and allowed to build and operate nation-wide cellular net- works. To promote fair competition in paging services, the paging sector of China Telecom was split in 1998 to form Guoxin Paging Ltd. In a deepening of this trend, a new round of reform was launched in 1998.The basic idea was to create a fair market by breaking up China Telecom and simultaneously strengthen Unicom through market restructuring. China Telecom Hong Kong, China Mobile Group, Jitong, and China Net Communication were formed. Competition among State-owned insti- tutions has thus increased. In other contexts, the introduction of competi- tion has involved the induction of the private sector.In India,telecom reform aimed at encour- aging competition has involved: \u25cf opening up the basic services sector to pri- vate operators.The National Telecom Policy of 1994 threw open the basic services sec- tor by allowing for bidding for licences to operate in circumscribed telecom circles consisting of the metros and regions co- terminus with the State. The ostensible objective was to supplement the efforts of the public sector to ensure telephone pro- vision on demand and a telephone in every village at affordable prices \u25cf permitting the entry of private and public sector companies into the mobile teleph- ony area, using both GSM and CDMA technology \u25cf corporatizing the public sector telecommu- nications network by creating separate cor- porations to cater to the principal metros and to the rest of the country, and convert- ing the Department of Telecommunica- tions into a policy-making entity \u25cf creating a statutory Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to recommend policies to increase competition, fix tariffs and mediate between different service providers regarding interconnection, etc., and \u25cf opening up National and International Long Distance Telephony to private operators. In terms of the availability and cost of telecom services, the competition introduced by these measures has had significant consequences. However, there is concern in some circles on two counts. First, with increased competition and the presence of many players, it is argued, the objective of universal service provision would take a back seat.Second,it is argued,that the duplication of the expensive network by competing providers in different circles would result in tariff benefits of competition being dis- tributed differentially. It is likely, it is contended with some supporting evidence, that low inten- sity and rural users would face an increase in tar- iffs over time, whereas high intensity users in high-density urban areas would benefit from a reduction in tariffs. If these outcomes are real- Even if an adequate infrastructure is built, its use depends on awareness and capability.

The concern of governments at national, state/provincial and local levels to incorporate ICT into their development agenda is visible in the large number of \u2018e-governance\u2019 projects that have been initiated in Asian countries. These projects constitute by far the most numerous, among the largest and the most noticed of ICT for development projects in the region. Pakistan\u2019s IT policy sees a role for government, not just in facilitating Internet expansion but in exploiting its potential by increasingly adopting e-governance features. The stated vision of the e-government programme is the improvement in the efficiency and trans- parency of the public sector and the enhance- ment of its service delivery mechanism. The National IT Policy recognized the need for a thorough adoption of information technology by government at the functional level. In October 2002, Pakistan\u2019s e-government portal (http://www.pakistan.gov.pk) was launched with an interface to 35 government divisions and all existing federal ministries. However,the anticipated widespread use of tech- nology in the business of government has not yet transpired.The legal framework necessary to implement internal government documenta- tion and communication through electronic media does not exist. While enormous strides have been made in providing government employees with training and capacity-building opportunities, they have been skewed in favour of specialist training in computer sciences disci- plines. In any case, the goal is not the provision of training or infrastructure to government offi- cials but to re-engineer the manner and form of governmental action. Meanwhile, funds for e-government are being used mostly on infor- mation management systems and the develop- ment of content. Estimating the return on this investment would be premature, and purely speculative. However, the magnitude of invest- ment, and the overarching desirability of the goals of e-government serve to enhance the importance of deploying e-government in an effective and meaningful manner. Unfortunately, unequal access to Internet serv- ices (as explained above), inherent inequalities based on content (the e-government portal is entirely in English), and the limited \u201con-the- ground\u201d service delivery function of the federal government (the portal is limited to the federal government, whereas social service delivery is in the provincial and local government domain) are all factors that may actually tend to exacer- bate the digital divide in Pakistan, instead of correcting it. Not surprisingly, while IT policy in Pakistan calls for the establishment of e-government that would utilize IT and the Internet for a more effi- cient service delivery mechanism, the policy recognizes that this represents an enormous challenge.It,therefore,does state that e-govern- ment may take between five and seven years before it can be deployed with any expectation of seeing its benefits. In China too, the government strives to harness the digital opportunities offered by ICT and Cost considerations are an important factor in reducing the digital divide. Hence, governments in Asia are taking a proactive stand on reducing ICT costs. However, often, this involves policies that imply a trade-off with universal provision of services 104 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals eliminate the threat of the digital divide to social and economic development. The \u2018Government Online\u2019and \u2018Enterprise Online\u2019pro- grammes, initiated in the mid-1990s, aim to facilitate information access for all citizens.

In Indonesia, there are 22 e-Government Pilot Projects with an estimated cost of more than US$ 60 million that were identified by Booz-Allan- Hamilton\u2019s project to facilitate the deployment of Government Online. In early June 2003, a Presidential Instruction (No 3/2003) was issued on policy and strategy for developing e-govern- ment. This document instructed all government offices to take necessary action within their func- tion and authorities to develop e-government. Three important documents were provided as attachments to the Presidential Instruction: \u25cf National Policy and Strategy for Developing e-Government \u25cf Architectural Framework of e-Government, and \u25cf Framework for Implementing National Policy and Strategy for Developing e- Government. This Presidential Instruction is viewed as an important commitment by the Government of Indonesia to play a leading role in maximizing the utilization of ICT. In India,the e-governance area is the one in which some of the most innovative experiments in using ICT for development fall.Some well-known instances of such projects like the computeriza- tion of the Mandal Revenue Offices (MROs) in the state of Andhra Pradesh, and Bhoomi in Karnataka have been already discussed in Chapter 3.This is an area which has attracted large government outlays and is expected to receive even more attention in the immediate future. Thus, the experiences of the countries chosen for special study as the basis of this Report sug- gest that, at a macro-level, ICT policy is indeed sensitive to human development concerns and seeks to use the technology in partnership with NGOs, donors and the private sector. What needs to be examined, therefore, is the degree to which this economy-wide commitment is being translated into specific projects that advance specific MDGs. This is the focus of the chapters that follow. What needs to be examined is the degree to which economy-wide commitment is being translated into specific projects that advance specific MDGs Given the role of information in technology diffusion, the ability to use ICT to purvey information across geographical space at relatively low cost, enhances its role as an enabling instrument in the realization of the MDGs relating to hunger and poverty All new technologies that restructure produc- tion and raise productivity can, all things being equal, reduce the incidence of poverty. Inasmuch as productivity increases help raise per capita incomes, they can help combat hunger and contribute to the alleviation of income poverty. Information technology, it is argued, can go even further. In a fundamental sense, information access and spread is crucial to the diffusion of tech- nology; and community effort can play a major role in the process. Consider, for example, the Green Revolution which is an indisputable suc- cess story in South Asia as far as agricultural productivity and aggregate economic growth are concerned. It involved the spread of a pro- ductivity-enhancing technological package, which has had a long-term,continuing positive impact on rural incomes. Information access and spread was crucial to the Green Revolution.It involved a process of provision of information and material support to rural farmers. The information that they were not otherwise privy to was a crucial component. What the community development pro- gramme accomplished, in fact, was the cre- ation of an effective system of communication that helped disseminate the benefits of this technology to a large group of farmers.

Both \u2018old\u2019and \u2018new\u2019ICTs have been used for these purposes1 with some success.2 The impact of ICTs on poverty differs greatly, depending on which technology is used. Radio and telephony are rather cheap; their use requires few skills while in terms of content and language, they enjoy great flexibility. Evidence suggests that access through radio to relevant and timely information can make a difference to the livelihoods of people liv- ing in poverty. In fact,until recently,radio was one of the most popular ICT tools for rural development. It has a high penetration rate, can effectively reach different target groups, and is relatively inex- pensive. Radio has been used for provision of education, health and agricultural extension services. Although radio penetration has dropped at the expense of expansion of televi- sion over the past decade, it retains its attrac- tiveness; and has found new audiences,both in the urban and rural areas. 107 ICTs and eradication of poverty and hunger MDGs C h a p t e r 7 108 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals The other conventional ICT instrument used to support development projects has been the tele- phone. Technological change, especially the arrival of mobile telephony,has strengthened the role of this instrument substantially. One often- cited example of successful ICT use in poverty reduction is the Grameen Bank\u2019s Village Pay Phone initiative.3 Grameen Bank is a village-based micro-finance organization in Bangladesh. The lives of members of the Grameen Bank,who now also form the backbone of Grameen Telecom, changed when they were provided access to cel- lular telephones. Women members in villages were offered loans to buy cellular phones at taka 18,100 a piece (US$ 385).They were then able to rent the sets out to other villagers on a commer- cial basis. By providing gainful employment as well as ensuring connectivity that can be exploit- ed to various ends, the Grameen Bank\u2019s Village Pay Phone initiative proved that ICTs can help provide goods and services that directly benefit the poor.4 Our concern here is primarily with the impact of fast developing modern ICTs, including the Internet, on the MDG-realization effort. Unfortunately, empirical evidence in this area is still limited, though there are a large number Technological change, especially the arrival of mobile telephony, has strengthened the role of telephones substantially.

Source: \u201cThe Role of ICT in Enhancing the Achievement of Millennium Development Goals\u201d Draft prepared by UNDP for the consideration of the UN ICT Task Force. 21 February 2003 109 ICTs and eradication of poverty and hunger ICT and global poverty Muhammad Yunus,Founder and Managing Director,Grameen Bank,Bangladesh The new millennium has brought with it unprecedented possibilities for each human being to discover his or her own potential, and a chance to change his or her life.This is true, irrespective of where in the world she lives, due in large part to the rapid development in ICT. ICT is setting the stage for a distanceless world. It is already con- tributing to the expansion of economies at a rapid speed. Although ICT offers exciting possibilities for fighting poverty, this potential will remain unexplored if we leave it to market forces alone. The benefits of these swift developments will primarily enable the rich countries to become richer, and big businesses to get bigger. They, in turn, will guide the ICT industry in the direction that will help them achieve their goals. This need not be so. There are resourceful people and organizations in the world with a strong commitment to end poverty. They can throw their weight behind directing the ICT industry towards developing an ICT infra- structure, products, devices and systems which would best fit the needs of the poor. ICT business leaders, prod- uct and system designers, and researchers can be involved in contributing their time and talent to address issues faced by the poor. ICT can be used creatively to enable new and cost-effective ways for poor men, women and young people to participate in the global economy. IT can play a role in bringing an end to poverty in the following ways: \u25cf integrating the poor into the process of globalization by expanding their markets through e-commerce, eliminat- ing middle-men in their businesses, and creating international job opportunities through outsourcing \u25cf delivering education, knowledge and skill training, and \u25cf delivering health services on demand. Within the Grameen family,we are designing companies,some of which are IT companies,with exclusively the poor in mind. Grameen Phone has been created in collaboration with Telenor of Norway and Marubeni of Japan to pro- vide mobile telephone services in Bangladesh. It is taking its services into rural areas of Bangladesh through Grameen Bank borrowers.A Grameen borrower receives a handset with Grameen Bank financing; and becomes the telephone-lady of the village,selling telephone services to the villagers,in places where even fixed lines did not exist before.In the process, she makes an income, on average, higher than twice the per capita income in the country.By July 2003, Grameen had provided more than 29,000 poor people with mobile phones for income generation in vil- lages across Bangladesh. Grameen Phone itself has become one of the largest mobile phone operators in South Asia, having reached 1 million subscribers in just seven years of operation. Another company we set up, Grameen Communications, is providing Internet service to rural areas \u2013 to bring edu- cation, knowledge and business opportunities to the poor. Grameen Energy is bringing solar power to the villages to provide energy for mobile phones, and light for shops and homes. Grameen Software has been set up to intro- duce international-level IT opportunities in Bangladesh for the benefit of the poor. Shares in all these companies will, one day, be owned by the poor, once they are established as financially attractive, profitable ventures. Whether the poor can afford IT or not depends not on the amount of investment needed by the poor nor on how complex the IT is but on the appropriateness of the institutional environment around the poor.Microcredit can pro- vide such an appropriate institutional environment. IT and microcredit both empower individuals, which makes them mutually reinforcing. Mobile phone operators in the villages of Bangladesh have been able to afford mobile phones because of microcredit.The same principle will apply to other IT services, applications and products. I have been advocating for the creation of an \u2018international centre for information technology to end global pover- ty\u2019, to create an appropriate information technology infrastructure and design suitable applications for delivering services to the poor.The funding to create such a centre could come from a consortium of donors and contributors who support the core programme of the centre.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9baf2b32-3a7c-4f45-96e5-336a8e2fe46e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9baf2b32-3a7c-4f45-96e5-336a8e2fe46e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60d31b5e9a90820e6fde9a5ba054de74d876a5b57180ea334e912bf5a9127474"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ac1112f-15ad-47d2-ae29-df5649770410", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52be2d93e9daeb4c78108f523fd0b4d35c052506e5ec6d5640631e3fc6709cb5"}}, "hash": "cbb9ec22076cda8574fcfc3081ffd2b097d22c424adc05cd9bc3ae8986a29a44", "text": "It can build strategic partnerships with leading IT companies and their staff,research and academic institutions,social activist groups,microcredit institutions,development agencies, and health and education institutions and professionals.

SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION 110 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals of experiments under way.5 Examples of uses of the technology in poverty alleviation include: \u25cf those that help small- and medium-scale farmers increase their revenues and improve their farming practices by making it possible for them to access information on agricultural know-how and market developments6 \u25cf those that improve the marketing of prod- ucts produced by small-scale artisans in rural areas through various e-commerce ini- tiatives7, and \u25cf those that offer additional non-economic benefits such as improved law enforcement and more rapid and effective communica- tion during disasters.8 Such projects cater to demands for information that have a significant economic content, e.g., real-time information on prices, weather, and pests; advice on agricultural technology (agri- cultural extension),water use,soil management, livestock management, and livestock diseases; and the availability and conditions of bank cred- it, microcredit, and governmental grants and subsidies. ICTs and agricultural development Agriculture, like the production and exchange of commodities, will also be trans- formed by ICTs. Increasingly, ICTs spur the development of innovative programmes and research in the agricultural sector. Farmers worldwide are using ICTs to obtain market information, to bypass intermediaries and to obtain better prices for their produce.9 Timely access to market information via com- munications networks also helps farmers make judicious decisions about what crops to plant and where to sell their produce and buy inputs.10 Additionally, ICTs empower farmers, rationalize supply chains and improve productivity. ICTs also facilitate research and development, and information-sharing on agricultural farm exten- sion technologies and approaches (such as the development of effective seed technologies), particularly those that can work to enhance food security and subsistence. An even more upbeat assessment of the role of ICT in agriculture runs as follows:\u201cICTs will allow farmers to have more accurate information on the factors that are needed to increase crop yield. \u2018Precision farming\u2019, or farm management using ICTs, will become the norm rather than the exception. We can also expect better crops and livestock as a result of agricultural biotech- nology\u201d.11 A project launched by ITC Ltd in India is a case in point. ITC Ltd has set up a network of Internet- connected kiosks,known as e-Choupals,to serve the soybean, cotton, tobacco, and shrimp farm- ers in its procurement network. Through the e- Choupal (a high-tech version of the traditional choupal, meaning a village gathering place in Hindi, where farmers get updated weather reports, information on local and international produce prices, etc), farmers are not only allowed to sell their produce directly to ITC, but also to buy agricultural inputs and consumer goods for daily household use. One element of e-Choupal\u2019s success is its reliance on local expertise, since kiosks are typically managed by respected farmers and located in or near their houses. In addition, both ITC Ltd and the farmers enjoy lower costs and higher revenues. ITC Ltd saves money by eliminating two layers of middle- men and buying its produce directly from farmers; the farmers, knowing current prices, can negotiate a better deal in selling their crops. Farmers are also able to increase the quality and quantity of their harvests, thanks to the information the kiosks provide. This \u201cwin-win\u201d business model helps ensure the e-Choupal network\u2019s sustainability, while mak- ing it highly scalable. ITC Ltd has thus devel- oped an internationally competitive agricul- tural business by empowering the independ- ent small farmer in a country where 200 mil- lion people are engaged in farming or related activities. China is another country to have exploited the benefits of the technology in this area. The website of the China Technology and Science Service for the Countryside, operated by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, delivers comprehensive technological and related information to 900 million peasants in more than 800,000 administrative villages in China. The website is operated by a broadcast network that includes television and uses the functions of a computer terminal. It started operations on 6 June 2001, and has since post- ICTs empower farmers, rationalize supply chains and improve productivity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e86d22db-8194-4024-9e5d-e8066458fb12": {"__data__": {"id_": "e86d22db-8194-4024-9e5d-e8066458fb12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dff4331ff4d768779e03955e3f3f2111a85ae0fbeffa6fc60b0e936a2687cc2e"}, "2": {"node_id": "1bef262f-d8d4-45aa-bdc6-e36525997b7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "567616d795a58a48ad1b9e06e817800ca47a5f905f8bb6ca3c308f7e596fbd8e"}}, "hash": "396218c6f0ef91da2fb48fe1cf5ced65b074a092c38e9a9e3e04c9650a22ec53", "text": "ICTs also facilitate research and development, and information-sharing on agricultural farm extension technologies and approaches 111 ICTs and eradication of poverty and hunger ed 18,000 scientific and technological articles, and more than 100,000 words have been updated every day.

Farmers can access information on crop planting, disease control, pest identification and control, seed prices, and market prices as well as consult with agricultural specialists by email. There are many such examples else- where in Asia. One such in Malaysia, which is comprehensive in scope,is discussed in Box 7.1. There are many other instances of the contribu- tions ICT can make to raising the magnitude and reducing the vulnerability of returns earned by small producers from their economic activities. These include provision of information that warns fisher-folk of storms at sea or facilitates the pre- vention or treatment of crop or animal disease. In India, Embalam is a two-street village 22 km west of Pondicherry, where 130 out of 210 fam- ilies struggle below the poverty line.The village elders have allowed the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) access to one side of the temple,to house two solar-powered com- puters that are used to give villagers a wealth of data, varying from the price of rice to weather conditions for fishermen and medical informa- tion for the sick. Embalam is one of four villages in which the MSSRF is implementing the \u201cinfor- mation village\u201d project. The project aims to use \u201cscience and technology to tackle poverty, with a $120,000 grant from the Canadian govern- ment.The foundation provides villages with free technology and information in exchange for the villages\u2019 promise to house the computers and staff their operation.\u201dThrough the project \u201cfarm- ers have gained a better grip on their local mar- kets as prices are more transparent.They get the right seeds when they want them; and they have catalogued over 350 different types of herbs that can grow in their area.Fishermen get information from satellite images on where the fish shoals are likely off the Pondicherry coast, and (from a United States Navy website) on wave heights and wind directions in the Bay of Bengal\u201d.12 Pakistan\u2019s ThreadNet Hunza is another example of the use of ICT in generating economic activi- ties and sustainable incomes. Established in 1995, the Karakoram Area Development Organization (KADO) is funded by the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) and the Swiss Agency for Development Corporation (SDC). Its objective is to work closely with the communi- ties inhabiting the Karakoram area in the north- ern mountainous region of Pakistan. KADO has programmes that employ ICTs, such as the e-commerce initiative called ThreadNet Hunza (http://www.threadnethunza.com). ThreadNet Hunza offers the products of local handicrafts, such as carpets and household accessories, for sale over the Internet.With technology support from KADO\u2019s staff, the website has established a On the employment front, India\u2019s experience is used to argue that the growing market for IT services and Business Process Outsourcing offers poor countries a new development opportunity TaniNet is essentially an information service toolset.It was started in September 1999 in Malaysia as a project under the Demonstrator Application Grant Scheme (DAGS). Among its main objec- tives is to introduce the Malaysian rural farming community to agricultural biotechnology through an interactive, Internet-based service in English and Malay. Services offered include: online information and services on agriculture and biotechnology; information on the local application of new technology; a forum for discussions among the rural farming communities through a managed bulletin board and chat room; easily available infor- mation on agricultural biotechnology;online access to expert advice and troubleshooting related to agricultural problems; and education for the community through access to important and useful information and services.

ICTs and employment On the employment front, India\u2019s experience is used to argue that the growing market for IT services and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) offers poor countries a new development opportunity. As UNCTAD 2003 puts it, \u201cOutsourcing to offshore vendors or \u2018offsourc- ing\u2019is expected to continue growing in the near future,\u201d because \u201ccompetitive advantages and economic pressures encourage companies located in the United States and Europe to look for partners in developing countries to deliver quality business services\u201d.13 The pressure to out- source non-core operations and concentrate on core business functions has always been characteristic of large companies. Initially, this resulted in the hiving-off of certain operations to be undertaken by specialized, local firms in the developed countries themselves. The change now is that, with the increasing avail- ability of cheap and better or larger network technology, communications infrastructure and bandwidth, many of these services can be managed and provided from remote locations. So long as a cheap workforce with the requisite language abilities and skills can be found or cre- ated,this is an opportunity waiting to be exploit- ed by developing countries, according to many. The evidence too seems to support this argu- ment.As the UNCTAD 2003 report argues,\u201cmany companies in certain developing countries (mainly India) have flourished by providing, in particular, software application development and manage- ment services to clients worldwide\u201d.14 It is true that India has certain specific,historically determined advantages, such as English language abilities that serve it well in the principal outsourcing market, the US; a large pool of educated and in many cases professionally trained manpower; and, above all, an autonomously evolved soft- ware services industry base. However, even in countries without these advantages, other capa- bilities can,if combined with national government and international support, be used to win them a slot in the BPO-IT enabled Services (ITeS) space. This is not necessarily true in the case of IT servic- es which requires more advanced skills,but would definitely be true in the BPO-ITeS segments. It is indeed true that any growth in employment and income can ultimately have some effect on domestic demand and, possibly, poverty. However,the human development effects of out- sourcing are limited because such employment is still extremely small, predominantly urban and restricted to the English-educated middle class. ICTs can also play a role in ensuring better employment opportunities in developing coun- tries via improved labour market facilitation and direct employment. Using electronic job mar- ketplaces, employers and employees can match labour skills and availability to satisfy demands. For example, TARAhaat, a portal designed to serve villages in rural India, provides job oppor- tunity information on local websites in local dialects (Box 7.2). In addition, the establishment of local telecentres in countries such as Pakistan and India has created direct employment for thousands of local women and men. Another country to have harnessed ICTs for improved labour market facilitation and direct payment is Mongolia. ICTs directly create employment opportunities for the unemployed and poor in IT industries. Newly established mobile phone stations,for example,have created many job places.They operate on CDMA, AMPS and GSM technologies and increase communi- cation capacity to 200,000 users. Ulaanbaatar, in the last decade, has established more than 100 Internet caf\u00e9s and created at least 200-300 jobs.Some self-employed citizens, through their own initiative,have sought to fill a gap in the market by installing telephones in public places for local calls. The price for a one- minute call is 100 tugrugs for residential phones and 200 tugrugs for cellular phones. This is a clear demonstration of the self-employed har- nessing ICTs to make a living.

Lack of credit can prevent the growth of productive activities, affecting poverty alleviation. In the absence of credit, the poor can be forced into a state of indebtedness that prevents them from realizing the full benefits of their economic activities. This leads to bondage and extremely low wages, very often pushing children from poor households into underpaid child labour. It is also accepted that microfinance ventures organized through self-help groups are a useful complement to State-provided credit,especially in a large country like India. The problem,however,is that microfinance ven- tures, even when successful from the point of view of reaching credit to the poor and ensur- ing high recovery rates, are characterized by high transaction costs and therefore extremely high interest rates. The Swayam Krishi Sangam (SKS) smart cards project is one example of using ICT to reduce transactions costs and reduce the cost of credit provided by self-help groups (Box 7.3). ICTs and the improvement of government services for the poor Social deprivation of various kinds can be alleviated through provision of information related to health, government projects and The use of ICTs offers increased opportunities to improve the living conditions of the poor through better government services, enhanced environmental monitoring and more efficient education and health care services TARAhaat, named after the all-purpose haat (meaning a village bazaar), comprises a commer- cially viable model to bring relevant information, products and services via the Internet to the unserved rural market of India, from which an estimated 50 per cent of the national income is derived.It combines a mother portal,TARAhaat.com,supported by franchised networks of village cyber caf\u00e9s and delivery systems to provide a full range of services. In the absence of efficient infrastructure for transport and communication,information is hard to come by and market options are not clearly or widely known. There is no instrument more effective than the Internet for bringing both jobs and information to the rural economy: bring- ing the buyer and seller together and creating an efficient marketplace. The look and feel of TARAhaat is carefully designed to attract and retain users of all kinds:farmers, traders, housewives, senior citizens, and children. The primary interface is both graphic (using specially designed pictures and icons that are attractive, colourful and animated) and voice- based to ensure that everyone, regardless of their level of literacy, can quickly learn to take advantage of the system. The impact of TARAhaat is being felt at several different levels:family,agriculture and youth.For the family, this venture provides a window to the world, enabling it to connect locally to international information, and health, matrimonial, and mailing services. The farmer benefits through weather forecasting, procurement services, and sales negotiations. The younger generation benefits through career counselling,entertainment,and educational and career opportunities.

Nearly 75 per cent of the Vietnamese population lives in rural or remote areas. The aim of the TPCPC plan is to provide 100 per cent of the com- munes in Vietnam with the ability to access basic telecommunications and postal services. The total of 5,714 post and culture centres nation- wide provide basic knowledge and up-to-date information to farmers, especially in remote and mountainous areas.

Its success lies largely in tar- geting information by assessing the interests of the people. The key services it offers are:information on rates for agriculture produce,land record rights,gov- ernment programmes and employment opportunities; provision of access to documentation such as caste certificates, applications for jobs, local weather reports and e-newspapers; provi- sion of services such as computer training, online public grievance redressal, health services, email, rural e-auction, and matrimonial services. The scheme also requires the establishment of intranet/Internet kiosks that are run on a com- mercial basis, with the operator obtaining a share of the minimal fee charged as revenue for undertaking the investment. In many places, the village panchayat paid for the kiosk (soochanalaya) and equipment, which was operated by a soochak who was an educated unemployed youth from the village, trained for the purpose. To quote Sood1:\u201cThe Gyandoot Project in Dhar has developed an important e-governance protocol, in the form of the shikay- at, or complaint. For a fee of INR 10, rural citizens may select from a predetermined menu of 30 different kinds of complaints, which together cover a wide range of citizen-consumer to government interactions in rural areas. These include for example: the absence of a school teacher; the death of cattle that may require a government veterinarian\u2019s inspection; the mal- function of a public hand-pump that must be repaired; and so forth.\u201d Between January 2000 and June 2001,68,500 villagers have used various services.The most com- monly used services were grievance redressal (41 per cent), market rates (25 per cent), and land records (20 per cent).Interestingly,one out of every six users of the network was illiterate with no knowledge of reading or writing. It is a disappointment that only 13 per cent of the users are women, which can be attributed to the low status of and lack of women-specific and family- oriented services.With this experience, similar initiatives, with better refinement are underway.

ICTs and poverty mapping Poverty maps are defined by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to be spatial descriptions of the distribution of poverty in any given country. As such, they are impor- tant tools in guiding expenditure for govern- ments.ICTs such as GIS allow for poverty map- ping, which combines geographically-refer- enced surveys and census data to generate poverty and inequality profiles at low levels of aggregation. Additionally, poverty maps based on highly disaggregated data serve benchmarking as well as monitoring and evaluation purposes.16 In other words, ICTs help facilitate consultative inputs, poverty monitoring, mapping and assessments to evaluate impact and enhance support to the poor within the context of a country\u2019s pover- ty reduction strategy, as seen in Malaysia. Often, however, such interventions in areas such as health, education and infrastructure, being the responsibility of different agencies, are not coordinated. In order to integrate such cross-institutional data, a Meta Data Standard needs to be established. Malaysia\u2019s database on the poor, the SINAR sys- tem, utilized the Poverty Level Index (PLI) to register poor households. SINAR was devel- oped as a system to centralize the coordina- tion of information on the urban poor, which is useful to various agencies and private institu- tions. This enables services to be provided to individual poor families while helping to avoid duplication and abuse. By March 2002, SINAR had been used to record information on 13,049 household heads and 2,845 members of poor families in Kuala Lumpur.17 Another such example is the multi-county initiative from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) titled Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping Systems (FIVIMS) (Box 7.6).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c01cc78-16ec-40ad-a5e5-fdf71942e306": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c01cc78-16ec-40ad-a5e5-fdf71942e306", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "693cce4b23110fed85ba0f6001f5dfc02cecebbc866b2ad942ca9929bb68e628"}, "2": {"node_id": "afcdb1f9-2ea3-449d-99ba-118268770c38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "014e51f73e0beca7aa475288a057ceaf614fb2dc21591e50e5e029c936647aae"}}, "hash": "012dcef05c495f63e4cabf534649cf354bd707ee6032f552e57e98e8aacbabec", "text": "Supportive measures As can be deduced from the discussions above, ICTs can have an important development impact as they are able to overcome the barriers of social, economic and geographic isolation, increase access to information and education, and enable the poor to participate extensively in the decisions that affect their lives (Table 7.2).

At the national level,its aims include raising awareness of food security issues,improving data qual- ity and promoting better use of the information to drive action. At the international level, an inter-agency working group with a secretariat at FAO,Rome,helps to define common standards, methods and tools for information management and presentation. It also mobilizes resources and provides support to national FIVIMS programmes. A number of FIVIMS activities are under way in countries in Asia and the Pacific, including Bangladesh,Cambodia,India,the Philippines,Sri Lanka,Thailand and Papua New Guinea.In Asian countries, which host the largest number of undernourished people worldwide, FAO, backed by the Japan Trust Fund,has been supporting start-up activities via the Asia FIVIMS project.The aim is to improve information on food insecurity and vulnerability so that countries can take the nec- essary actions in favour of the goals of the World Food Summit \u2013 to reduce the number of under- nourished people and achieve food security for all.

Currently, the information, both on- and off-line, is still agency-based, not peo- ple-centred. At this stage, an informa- tion/knowledge management system that is people-centred and user-friendly is probably more important than hardware and network connectivity for a middle-income society such as Thailand. Illiteracy and knowledge only of local languages are, as expected, major obstacles to the use of ICT. To be relevant, applications must be avail- able in local languages and, to the extent possi- ble, be visually oriented and use voice inter- faces.20 Given the low literacy rate as well as the very limited familiarity with English, much of the available content is not accessible by rural pop- ulations. Since 2000 some viable solutions to this problem have emerged, such as Inpage software. However, the standardization and deployment of solutions and content will take time.Nevertheless,it is encouraging to note that various initiatives to develop content in local languages have been launched in countries such as China, Pakistan and India. For instance, China\u2019s various websites specializing in agricul- tural development and poverty reduction are in their national language \u2013 Mandarin. Therefore, the following principles governing the use of ICTs in future poverty alleviation undertakings suggest themselves21: \u25cf Efforts should be made to develop viable ICT poverty alleviation programmes. These pro- grammes should be coordinated across agencies in the best spirit of networking, to ensure proper focus in resource use and syn- ergy in development efforts.The small,spon- taneous but fragmented initiatives among private agencies and NGOs to bridge the dig- ital divide should not only be encouraged and facilitated but be mainstreamed and coordinated by creating an \u2018ICT for poverty alleviation small grants fund\u2019 that can be micro-managed by regional agencies. \u25cf Educational applications of ICT should be fully supported for their economic potential. \u25cf Technological interventions should be sup- plemented by strong content provision. It should run parallel with a development programme, thus providing mutual reinforcement between ICT utilization and impacts. \u25cf The use of poverty maps should be fully exploited through the collection of highly disaggregated census and economic data. \u25cf A regional approach to programme devel- opment should be adopted since ICT and poverty alleviation are not best dealt with using a single national strategy. Govern- ments and government agencies within the same region (e.g., Southeast Asia) should initiate dialogues to determine standards, platforms and protocols for information and knowledge exchange and re-use. A regional approach to knowledge network- ing should be adopted. These and other practices can make ICTs powerful tools for poverty reduction by enhancing the capa- bilities of the poor in education,marketing,manage- ment and planning, as well as providing links to a variety of resources such as agricultural information. To be relevant, applications must be available in local languages and, to the extent possible, be visually oriented and use voice interfaces By providing flexible and interactive learning styles and anywhere anytime access, ICTs benefit learners by giving them the material they need when and where they want it. ICTs allow them to interact without temporal and spatial constraints with both teachers and learner groups We cannot predict what forms systems of edu- cation will take in the future;what their environ- mental characteristics, content structure or mode of delivery would be. However, what we can safely predict is that ICTs will play a major role in such systems, since this is a trend that is already visible across the world, including in Asia. Needless to say, changes in the nature of educational systems are visible too. Assumptions of teacher-centred education and whole-class instruction are being challenged.

Most significantly, in countries with vast land areas that make assured access to educa- tion difficult, ICT is proving a boon since it reduces costs and renders distance learning much more viable than it was earlier. Potential benefits The opportunities and benefits associated with the use of ICTs in education are manifold. The capacity of ICTs to reach students in any place and at any time is bringing about revo- lutionary changes in the traditional educa- tional paradigm\u2020 by eliminating the premise that learning time equals classroom time.2 By providing flexible and interactive learning styles and anywhere anytime access, ICTs ben- efit learners by giving them the material they need when and where they want it. ICTs allow them to interact without temporal and spatial constraints with both teachers and learner groups. The teachers benefit by taking advantage of the interactive systems that help them understand a learner\u2019s needs and performance more accu- rately, make more effective assessments and develop improved systems of certification. ICT-based systems enhance educational quality for learners by increasing motivation, facilitat- ing acquisition of basic skills, promoting inquiry and exploration, and preparing individuals for the technology-driven world. On the teaching side,ICTs enhance quality because they can be used as tools for training and support for teachers regardless of their geographical 121 The role and use of ICTs in education MDGs C h a p t e r 8 \u2020 The traditional paradigm is built on three basic principles: 1. Learners must congregate in a building where the teaching/learning process must take place. 2. There must be a predetermined path,divided into grades,that leads to a diploma and students must follow this path regardless of their interest, needs or abilities. 3. There must be a hierarchic structure where the instructor is the provider of knowledge and the students are the recipients. 122 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals The digital revolution has created a dilemma for the less educated. On one hand, it creates new and better jobs but, on the other hand, it raises the bar on high-demand skills, which they don\u2019t possess. There is a distinct need for utilizing technology to serve those on the \u201cdownside of privilege\u201d SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION The Virtual University: a key component of the Pakistan Education and Research Network Atta-ur-Rahman,Chairman,Higher Education Commission,Pakistan Explosive growth in IT in the current decade has opened up vast new opportunities for devel- opment for countries such as Pakistan. The four broad IT areas on which the Government of Pakistan has focused are: \u25cf IT education \u25cf IT infrastructure \u25cf government enabling policies to promote IT related investments, and \u25cf providing services to the citizen. The Government has given the highest priority to IT education. A multidimensional strategy was adopted to overcome the deficiency in human resources in the field of information tech- nology.This involved the initiation of new government-sponsored short-, medium- and long- term training programmes, setting up of seven IT universities, and strengthening of existing computer science departments at public sector institutions. A nation-wide programme has been launched to train the trainers in various areas of IT.To improve the quality of IT educa- tion in schools, a training programme for 25,000 school teachers has been completed. Some seven new universities are being set up, including two in the private sector. In order to save funds and time, we decided to use existing campuses, wherever they existed, and con- vert them into IT universities/institutes. This is an important cornerstone of our policy since construction would have taken us years of effort and seriously delayed our IT initiatives. An exciting educational initiative has been the establishment of the Virtual University,started with the assistance of UNDP on 26 March 2002.This distance-learning university will allow us to train tens of thousands of IT professionals in different parts of the country, as high quality TV programmes are telecast across the nation. Viewed as a single entity, Pakistan has highly qualified individuals who are scattered in var- ious institutions and organizations without forming a critical mass at any single place. Similarly, the wider Pakistan diaspora includes many notable academics. Virtual University dispersion. In fact, research has shown that the introduction of ICTs for educational purposes has positive effects on teaching practices.Other ben- efits for educational providers include efficient management of learning resources at lower costs (Table 8.1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e61e5cf3-1019-4a17-b704-03837cac40e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e61e5cf3-1019-4a17-b704-03837cac40e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c51b83a25040621272792a598c8071ef35b1576bd1afe46e8bcac921e61179f6"}, "2": {"node_id": "68f16b41-a9b8-49a2-b89c-05398fe36732", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07b91f1f73fcef06966bf803d5be1b17bb8e02c251bd3959c444e881ff34c576"}}, "hash": "a0841ebe7ef73589a133ef79be3112569f382fb12941350264f8ae75ff619cb1", "text": "These result from the sharing of resources and learning environments,opening up of classrooms as well as the promotion of collabo- rative learning and a general move towards greater learner autonomy.3 The use of ICTs brings new challenges as well.

Since computers, being only tools, themselves bring very little to the learn- ing process, policy makers must help teachers effectively integrate computers and Internet technologies into their schools.5 ICTs alone do not have special properties or powers that would revolutionize education. The principal agents in the teaching and learning process are teachers and their pupils, and if both parties commit to the use of what is undeniably a pow- 123 The role and use of ICTs in education The new flexible and interactive learning environment ushers in new ways of learning. ICTs break through traditional constraints of space and time, making for an ideal educational tool in reaching out to learners across remote areas utilizes the services of these talented individuals to design and develop its courses, which are then delivered, free to air, on television. A strong student-teacher interaction is provid- ed over the Internet using a comprehensive Learning Management System which provides course content, discussion boards, assignments, etc. as well as their own email accounts for students. To maintain a formal educational environment, students are encouraged to attend classes at any of the many \u201cvirtual campuses\u201d all over the country. These campuses provide the necessary equipment for viewing lectures as well as networked computer lab- oratories that are required by students for their studies.The local networks connect to the main servers of Virtual University over the Internet,which has become available even in the remotest regions of the country. Although still in its infancy,Virtual University has made considerable progress.Over 2,000 students are enrolled in its first degree programme \u2013 a four-year BS in Computer Science or Information Technology. The courses have been well received by the academic com- munity in general, and several conventional universities have incorporated them formal- ly or informally into their own programmes. The fact that Virtual University provides a uniform educational environment to its students, regardless of their physical location, has become a huge equalizer with significant implications for uniform development across the country. Quality higher education is no longer the domain of the urban elite, and the affordability of the programmes puts them within reach of even the lower income groups. Realizing the importance of providing affordable quality higher education to its people, the Government of Pakistan formally chartered Virtual University in September 2002. Keeping in mind the effectiveness of the new mode of education and the changing world scenario in IT, the charter empowers Virtual University to offer courses in a wide spectrum of disciplines.The University has recently introduced a series of BS programmes in liberal arts thereby provid- ing an opportunity to a much wider audience. Virtual University has also been granted a license to operate two independent television channels dedicated to education.These channels will be available on free-to-air digital satel- lite telecasts across the region and are scheduled to go on air towards the end of 2003.The advent of these channels will go a long way towards enhancing the outreach of Virtual University and it is anticipated that,with the introduction of new courses in English and other regional languages, enrolment from overseas will also increase. As enrolment grows, the Virtual University of Pakistan will be poised to become a significant contributor towards the socio-economic well-being of the nation. erful tool, then improved learning is likely to occur.6 Finally, while ICTs do offer many beneficial opportunities for education, they are no substi- tute for formal schooling.The role of technology is to support primary education not replace it, though the technology may play a part in meet- ing the needs of children or adults who cannot go to a conventional school or class. Access to ICTs ensures enhancement of traditional or for- mal education systems, enabling them to adapt to the different learning and training needs of societies. Computer simulation, telematics, video-audio, computer conferencing and virtual learning, along with educational television and radio, have the potential to reach larger audi- ences than possible through the traditional classroom.7 In principle, ICTs can increase the effectiveness of the process of education by pro- viding cheaper and more interactive tools.They can enhance the teaching aspect of education and improve educational administration (the planning, monitoring and evaluation of educa- tion).Value addition to education represents the greatest advantage in the use", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "441daa15-3acf-418e-a8c2-5a1cad87de93": {"__data__": {"id_": "441daa15-3acf-418e-a8c2-5a1cad87de93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0e0fa55859bd1aed3f9665e87b7e7e9c01a4a680020370132befcc632885eb6"}}, "hash": "d0e0fa55859bd1aed3f9665e87b7e7e9c01a4a680020370132befcc632885eb6", "text": "of ICTs (Figure 8.1). Policies, investments and initiatives In order to successfully use ICTs for education within a country, it is essential to pursue certain long- and short-term objectives for development 124 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals of ICTs. Some of the more significant objectives can be summarized as follows: \u25cf to build the physical infrastructure such as computer networks (local networks, intranets, Internet) and computer rooms in schools, to ensure connectivity, and to pro- vide access to various databases and resources for teaching and learning activities, and for educational management \u25cf to develop human resources for the ICT industry with ICT trained specialists at all levels of qualification and to create special- ized ICT training programmes for promot- ing ICT applications in different fields \u25cf to develop educational software that uses ICT as a tool to aid innovative thinking, problem-solving and processing skills, and \u25cf to improve educational management by designing student, teacher and administra- tive databases. In order to profit from the advantages that ICTs bring to education, several governments and NGO across Asia have initiated programmes to exploit the benefits of the technology.In India,the IT Action Plan adopted in July 1998 was an early initiative. In Mongolia, as a follow-up to its ICT Vision 2010, the Ministry of Science, Technology, Education and Culture (MOSTEC) released a set of Using network technology, distance information platforms are being built across the fields of basic, higher and vocational education.

The objective of the document was to establish a flexible system for the implementation of ICT training at all levels of education, according to international standards. ICTs in education mainly focus on development of the education management system and reform of educational content and technology. In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Human Resources, Education and Cultural Affairs conducts several programmes,as part of the Sri Lankan education- al system reform policy,promoting the use of ICT to streamline the school educational process at primary and secondary levels. There are also a number of specific projects experimenting with the use of ICTs in educa- tion. For instance, in June 2003, the Government of India announced an ambitious programme titled \u2018Vidya Vahini\u2019, to create com- puter laboratories with facilities such as Internet access, an online library, academic services and web-casting across 60,000 schools run or financed by it. Drawn up by the Department of Information Technology, the project is being implemented by ERNET India and the software is being developed by the National Informatics Centre. In India community projects are conducted across several states.

Another state that has joined the ranks in using ICT to enable community development is Andhra Pradesh. It set up 663 computer class- rooms with over 8,000 computers for computer education in high schools,reaching over 300,000 students. Other initiatives of the Indian govern- ment include less ambitious but highly effective community-based projects (Box 8.1). The Sri Lankan Government also runs an initia- tive connecting 92 education centres across provinces,regions and sectors to the Ministry of Education, developing computer training cen- tres at 800 selected schools, and issuing CD- ROMs to meet the educational requirements of Sri Lankan secondary schools. In a decisive move, the Ministry has also introduced IT stud- ies as an optional subject for the General Certificate of Education (GCE) (Advanced Level) examination from 2004. Malaysia is another country that looked to propel itself into the knowledge economy with its Smart School concept, a learning institution that aims to foster self-assessed,self-paced and self-directed learning.The government,along with the private sector, set out to develop Smart School In male-dominated societies, technology has proven a cost- effective alternative to all-female schools for educating women without disrupting cultural traditions.

However, the project faced many chal- lenges and was downscaled at a later stage. Although, most governments initiate sound ICT policies and even implement some successful projects, many fail due to lack of resources. Building the ICT infrastructure requires a huge amount of initial investment from governments. Yet, countries such as Vietnam have invested in a computer-based information network system for education called Educational Network (EduNet) and improved computer facilities at educational institutions. These investments will go towards providing an Internet connection and presence for all educational institutions, additional multi- media classrooms and high performance com- puting centres,educational databases for teachers and students,and facilities for distance education. Investment in the EduNet is expected to lead to improvements in the areas of content, teaching methodology and education management. In China too heavy investments have mainly been made in building the physical ICT infrastructure required to support education. In 2001, there were 7,266 primary schools and 3,714 middle schools that were built with campus-wide net- works,and the total number increased by 200 per cent by 2002.By the end of 2002,there were 5.84 million computers in primary and middle schools nationwide with about 3.5 students sharing one computer on average,as compared with a ratio of 100 to 21 in 1999. In Thailand, investments in the educational infrastructure have been made with a view to bridging the quality gap between urban and rural education (Box 8.2). Pakistan too has made progress in developing the infrastructure through the Pakistan Education Network (PEN) initiative,at a cost US$ 5.18 million, to provide connectivity across universities, sec- ondary and primary schools.PEN is is a major ICT infrastructure project being administered by the Higher Education Commission \u2013 the federal gov- ernment\u2019s regulatory agency for universities.

While it will take a massive effort to change this situation, as an interim measure, ICTs can be employed in formal and informal settings to deliver essential knowledge and information.8 ICT-based distance education has been used to overcome time, space and geographic restric- tions, allowing teachers and students to inter- act and share learning materials.Using network technology, distance information platforms are being built across the fields of basic,higher and vocational education. Such online schools offer excellent teaching and systematic curriculum resources. ICT enables better management of knowledge resources, ensuring that distance- learning students receive high quality educa- tion and access the best teaching resources. This holds true especially for a huge country like China where millions live in remote areas, and the lack of qualified teachers impairs access to fundamental and advanced education. According to the Ministry of Education\u2019s programme, the China Modern Distance Learning Satellite Broadband Multimedia Transmission Platform went into operation in November 2000, to serve mainly the western and other remote regions. This project allows simultaneous transmission of video and multi- media channels at different rates. Moreover, the Internet access service provided on the platform enables a high-speed interconnection with CER- NET, forming a satellite to land consolidated bi- directional education network.The operation of The question of equitable access is not just a question of who can use what is available on the Internet, but also of who can produce it. There are already great differences across countries in this respect SchoolNet Thailand was initiated by the National Electronics and Computer Technology Centre (NECTEC) in 1995. The project\u2019s prime objectives are to provide Internet access to schools throughout Thailand, to improve the overall standard of education in the country by reducing the gap in quality of education between schools in urban and rural areas.The proj- ect was successfully implemented with the help of the Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT), the Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) and the Ministry of Education. Each of these agencies plays a vital role in the project. NECTEC is responsible for technical matters; TOT sponsors domestic communications and hosts the Network Operation Centres (NOCs) nationwide; and CAT supports the international Internet bandwidth. Finally, the Ministry of Education selects schools and coordinates, promotes and supports the use of Internet in these schools. SchoolNet successfully achieved the target of connecting 4,758 schools and its activities have evolved beyond network connection to incorporate comple- mentary activities.They can be classified into five areas: \u25cf It connects schools to the network, regardless of where they are located, by paying only the local telephone charge, and no Internet access fee. School members receive up to five dial- up accounts each for 80 hours per month.They also receive 8 MB of data storage on a cen- tral server to post school web pages and educational content. \u25cf It provides technical support to schools,through a special distribution package called LINUX School Internet Server or LINUX SIS, which contains Web-based system administration soft- ware that is distributed to schools as freeware. In addition, a help desk is provided at the NECTEC SchoolNet office. \u25cf The project provides teachers and students with Internet training and web page development courses.

In addition, projects such as the 101 Distance Learning Centre (www.chinaedu.com) cater to 200 distance-learning middle schools in China with over 0.6 million registered students com- ing from 70,000 common middle schools. Remarkable achievements have been made in many big cities such as Beijing where there are more than 30 online secondary schools with 50,000 to 100,000 students. Distance education has also proved enormous- ly successful in countries like Indonesia, Thailand and India. Government ministries have been instrumental in taking distance edu- cation from concept to execution with reward- ing results across these three countries. Indonesia\u2019s Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) established a regional open and distance learning centre to supplement or substitute conventional class- room instructions. Its projects include develop- ment of online courses for senior secondary school students, training institution personnel, field extension workers and university lectur- ers, production of web and CD-based multime- dia learning programmes for online access, integration of IT in teaching mathematics and science and in the education and prevention of HIV/AIDS. India\u2019s outstanding success story in distance education was a one-of-a-kind project initiated by the Ministry of Human Resource Development using television to reach out to India\u2019s students.Well into its 20th year, the proj- ect has seen resounding success in equipping student communities in backward areas with the knowledge they require (Box 8.3). In Thailand, the Distance Learning Foundation (DLF) has been entrusted by the Ministry of Education to conduct live secondary curriculum broadcasts via satellite to schools. Since its inception, from broadcasting for a limited time to 99 schools, it is now available through the week,round-the-clock via UBC Channel to desti- nation schools. The Foundation has broadcast to 3,000 secondary schools, or around 2 million students, and to 350,000 UBC members. The broadcast was also later expanded to cover neighbouring countries. Teachers and students in distance education programmes can use telephones or fax machines if they have questions, and this serv- ice is provided free of cost with the help of both the public and private sectors.In 2002,DLF part- nered with the Institute for Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology offering free- of-charge web-based information content to those with access to the Internet, through both \u2018live broadcast\u2019and \u2018by demand\u2019. Pakistan can also be cited as another country that has put distance education to good use in tackling adult illiteracy in rural areas (Box 8.4). It also has several other distance learning initiatives in place, from training and capacity building for mid-career professionals in the areas of sustain- able development and the environment to train- ing employees in the social sector. Spearheaded mostly by NGOs, other initiatives also include electronic media projects for underprivileged pre-schoolers. Based on Sesame Street, produced by the US-based Children\u2019s Television Workshop, the project has taught children concepts such as numeracy, communication and language, critical thinking, environmental concerns/ecology, health and hygiene, character-building, self- development,and social awareness. Other countries such as Sri Lanka,however,have been slower to adopt distance learning, and are only now taking steps towards harnessing its potential. The Open University of Sri Lanka was launched in 1997, and initially only distributed teaching materials to a selected group of inter- nal students. After a while, institutions such as the University of Colombo,School of Computing and Singapore Informatics began to introduce web-based distance education services. Soon, a small but growing number of wired individuals started pursuing diplomas, and professional or degree programmes offered by overseas insti- tutions via the Internet.9 ICT programmes have also been utilized in other ways.

However, since the project was spearheaded by Microsoft,all training was based on its platforms which increased dependence on proprietary software and made it expensive to replicate on a mass basis. Distance learning in both formal and non-for- mal environments has helped raise the quality of education and contributed to economic and social development in most countries where these initiatives have been undertaken. It must also be noted that in some countries, more than others, the benefits have been manifold. In male-dominated societies, technology has proven a cost-effective alternative to all- female schools for educating women without disrupting cultural traditions.10 Television and radio or Internet-based technologies enable girls to continue their studies from home or small learning centres. Functioning without gender or cultural allegiances, technology facili- tates communication and through this expanded access to information enhances the reach and processes of education significantly. The impact of ICTs on educational services is growing.11 Initial attempts to introduce com- puter-based technologies into schools and higher education were hampered by cost, con- straints on information processing, and lack of connectivity. However, in recent years, ICTs have been successfully harnessed for educa- tion in countries such as Mongolia, to reach ICTs have been successfully harnessed for education in countries such as Mongolia, to reach remote communities, and provide education to traditionally marginalized sections of society In order to combat the traditional compartmentalized system of education in India which pre- vented acquisition of knowledge and learning, the University Grants Commission (UGC), which comes under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, ini- tiated a unique educational experiment, called the Countrywide Classroom in 1984. Realizing that India\u2019s explosion of student population could not be adequately reached through merely classroom education, television was used as a means to supplement class- room teaching. The UGC used the Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system to telecast high quality educational material via Doordarshan, India\u2019s national public service television net- work. The project was primarily aimed at undergraduate students in small towns and rural backwaters. Initially conceived as a one-hour programme,the Countrywide Classroom grew to 20 hours of programming per week.The project sought to use television\u2019s positive attributes such as ani- mation, special effects and visual power to make an impact on its youthful target group. Content is developed by Educational Media Research Centres and Audio Visual Research Centres established by the UGC. Today, 17 autonomous media centres function in a decen- tralized mode, co-ordinated by the Consortium for Educational Communication.These media centres have produced over 6,000 educational programmes on science,applied science,engi- neering, medical science, social science and humanities among others. The Countrywide Classroom reaches out to four million viewers a day for an average pro- gramme.The enormous reach is explained by the fact that TV viewing is a community activi- ty in India. The central and state governments along with the UGC have ensured access to communities and, therefore, larger audiences by providing TV sets. Today, although the project has gained recognition around the country, UGC may need to explore interactive packages, utilizing the potential of widespread cost-effective Internet services to complement the Countrywide Classroom in order to survive the age of conver- gence. Other shortcomings include lack of effective promotion to create awareness, limited transmissions, lack of videotapes which can increase reach, and lack of telecasts in other lan- guages apart from English and Hindi.

In addition, choosing the appro- priate ICTs will also demand a thorough under- standing of the educational objectives at hand which, in turn, requires complete knowledge of the target audience\u2019s goals and aspirations. However,the re-training of teachers and reshap- ing of the educational system remains the most challenging task as ICTs are increasingly used in education. ICTs provide active learning experi- ences and access to a wide range of media.13 Therefore,teachers need to consciously redesign learning environments so that students can transfer their newly gained ICT skills to other applications that can be used in an ICT-rich envi- ronment.14 Once teachers and students acquire ICT skills they can adopt a transferable learning style so that each further step in using ICT becomes easier. A change in the learning envi- ronment calls for a paradigm shift for teachers. This shift primarily occurs due to teachers mov- ing from being passive instructors to becoming active constructors, putting the learners in charge of the learning process (Table 8.2). There are four key reasons demanding a change in the role of the teacher.15 Firstly, ICTs will render certain teaching resources obsolete. Secondly, ICTs will make some forms of assessment redundant.Thirdly, it will become crucial for teachers to encourage critical think- ing skills, promote information literacy and nur- ture collaborative working practices. Finally, teachers will need to reappraise the methods by which they meet children\u2019s learning needs. In order to effect these changes, teachers have to be empowered to use ICT.16 Providing them with resources to integrate ICT would help them gain confidence in these technologies. However, training of teachers alone is unlikely The provision of a localized, supportive environment that encourages teachers to see ICT as integral to the achievement of their existing goals will be an important national initiative The Functional Education Project for Rural Areas in Pakistan was initiated as an experimental programme to address the learning needs of the rural populace, where adult illiteracy is 62 per cent.1 Based on extensive research and careful development of material, the Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) worked out a method of teaching and group study led by villagers to meet the needs of locals. The experimental stage ran from 1982 to 1985 and the AIOU has since institutionalized some of that work. The main teaching methods and media include printed teaching material, illustrated flip charts, audio cassettes and group meetings led by group leaders. Field workers recruited and trained group leaders in the techniques of group study and supervised their work.At the end of each session, the group leader completed a feedback form that was used later for man- agement and evaluation.The project reached about 1,500 learners and it was estimated that it could be extended to reach about 5,000 a year. It also met with some success in reaching people with little formal education, as 55 per cent of the learners were illiterate and 66 per cent had either not gone to school or were educated only up to the lower primary level.The evidence is consistent in showing that the project succeeded in establishing a viable and effective system for rural education.Its work has continued and has now become the respon- sibility of a university faculty of mass education at the AIOU.

Box 8.4 Pakistan\u2019s Functional Education Project for Rural Areas 131 The role and use of ICTs in education to be effective in the development of ICT skills and knowledge, and enhanced use of ICT in schools.17 A more holistic approach comprises appropriate training (appropriate in terms of skills, knowledge, relevance to educational goals and priorities, and delivery), ready access to ICT resources and ongoing support to encourage progress beyond formal training. The provision of a localized, supportive envi- ronment that encourages teachers to see ICT as integral to the achievement of their existing goals will be an important national initiative. A good example of the holistic approach is the project for improving teacher quality in China. The Ministry of Education,along with UNDP and DFID, is using distance education to raise the educational equity for 20,000 teachers in the poorer Western provinces. Pakistan too has developed training projects that would equip 10,000 primary and secondary school teachers with ICT skills. Although these training pro- grammes have been initiated to effect a change in the learning environment, it is too early to ascertain the impact of these initiatives.

Claudio de Moura Castro, Chief Education Adviser of the Inter-American Development Bank, points out that though The pressing problems for educational planners is how to quickly reach the majority of the poor, uneducated rural populace, and find out how to fund, implement and maintain the educational part of ICT networks One of the simplest uses of ICTs is exemplified by the Gobi Women\u2019s Project in Mongolia. Funded by DANIDA at a cost of US$ 1.7 million and aided by UNESCO, the project provides non-formal distance education to some 15,000 nomadic women,broadcasting useful instruc- tion on health, commercial skills, family planning, traditional crafts and environmental issues. The project relies on a series of weekly radio programmes and booklets, covering everything from stitching a camel saddle to basic mathematics. Since nomads move a couple of times a year, a chain of \u201cco-ordinating committees\u201d composed of education specialists and profes- sionals such as doctors,veterinarians and economists have been formed.They reach out from the capital Ulaanbaatar to the 62 sums (districts), linking teacher trainers to the corps of 620 visiting teachers, who meet monthly with about 30 students individually or in small groups. The project has re-equipped four radio stations (one in the capital and three in the Gobi) to produce three weekly series reinforcing the books\u2019 lessons. While the Ulaanbaatar station takes the lead in introducing new subjects, the regional stations take a local look at the cur- riculum. Radio producers, teachers and communicators have been trained by the project.The project helped women become self-sufficient. UNESCO plans to extend the project with another DANIDA-funding of US$ 1.5 million to enable parents to learn new skills and help their children study at home. It is expected to reach 37,000 families since the school drop-out rate is a problem because parents need the children to help with domestic work. The project, in its next phase, therefore aims to offer \u201cfamily-based education\u201d.

Instead, then, developing countries need to focus on those technologies that compensate for factors that are lacking, namely, well-trained teachers and the resources to pay for expensive equipment. The task at hand is to concentrate on technological alternatives that, at low cost, bring to students the imagination and creativity of a few excellent teachers. Though there have been commendable efforts by many countries in leveraging ICTs for educa- tion, the true potential of ICT application has not been realized. Both civil society and the public sector have focused almost exclusively on ICT education. The lack of creativity in using ICTs as a means to better education, and focus- ing on ICTs only as a component, deprives the education sector of an important instrument. The goal of achieving universal primary educa- tion has yet to be advanced using ICTs, with the exception of some experimental innovations in the private sector.

One possible reason is that equipping schools with infrastructure is easi- er than developing corresponding instruc- tional material,20 since many countries have yet to discover how to produce suitable yet cost-effective content for delivery. Educa- tional materials could typically include content in the form of text, special \u201cbooks of readings\u201d, study or learner guides, assignments, assess- ments pads and tutors\u2019 guides. These resources, along with appropriate learner support systems, would complete the educa- tion or training environment.21 In this context, questions of equity and quality become significant. The pressing problems for educational planners is how to quickly reach the majority of the poor, uneducated rural populace, and find out how to fund, implement and main- tain the educational part of ICT networks. The question of equitable access is not just of who can use what is available on the Internet,but also of who can produce it.There are already great dif- ferences across countries in this respect.Similarly, there are great differences between public and private corporate players in their capacity to become \u201cnet-based education providers\u201d. Equity can be looked at from two angles: \u25cf equitable access of students as consumers, where the poorer peoples and nations are put at a disadvantage, and \u25cf equitable provision of content, where the poor are even worse off. Finally, the need for linking ICT and education efforts to education policies and reforms that embrace the use of new technologies holisti- cally cannot be stressed enough.22 Though Internet connectivity represents innovative public sector leadership and ministries of education around the world have made a commitment to computerize schools, few have developed coherent strategies to fully integrate the use of computers as pedagogi- cal tools in the classroom. Today, countries have seen levels of computer literacy grow but they remain far from utilizing the full potential of ICTs in education. Real learning gains have yet to be made and will only come when countries succeed in integrating com- puters and the Internet into the broader edu- cational curriculum. The need for linking ICT and education efforts to education policies and reforms that embrace the use of new technologies holistically cannot be stressed enough In as much as there is a gender divide that adversely affects the status of women, it also contributes to a digital divide, since women\u2019s access to and capacity to use the benefits of the technology is restricted It is now widely recognized that systemic or structural and conjunctural factors have com- bined to generate and perpetuate substantial gender disparities in the course of economic development the world over. Needless to say, Asia is no exception. Recognizing the equal right of women and men to development, and the debilitating effects on overall growth and human development that gender disparities have been found to have, the UN\u2019s Millennium Declaration provided for special goals and tar- gets in the area, which calls for mainstreaming the gender problem into economic develop- ment. This chapter is concerned with delineat- ing some of the principal challenges raised by the gender situation in the Asia-Pacific region and examining how ICTs are being and can be harnessed to further this agenda. Assessing the status of women The fundamental problem from a gender-sensi- tized, human development point of view is evi- dence that economic growth need not necessarily generate improvements in the socio-economic status of women. There is indeed national and international indication of a positive relationship, in the long run,between material progress and the socio-economic condition of women. However, this outcome does not reflect an automatic, monotonic relationship. The outcome is influ- enced, among other things, by women\u2019s strug- gles for equality and justice and by the demand for labour resulting from economic expansion. Increased demand for women workers leads to greater recognition of women\u2019s work because it is paid, resulting in pressures to provide better conditions of work, enlarge the opportunities for women\u2019s partici- pation and improve the overall freedom and status enjoyed by women. A range of indicators has been used to assess the extent to which this process has unfolded.1 To start with there are variables defining the basic conditions of life and survival, such as access to food and nutrition, water, shelter and basic consumables (including amenities such as electricity and sanitation). Second, there are variables defining capabilities,such as access to education and health services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cfa7430-0a3f-4ef5-823d-c1a1509b49a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cfa7430-0a3f-4ef5-823d-c1a1509b49a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fff35ef076066cb27334cd2db22e6d9772c1431408ab8cbf379bb8e48e10eb2c"}, "2": {"node_id": "78ebefab-8134-40d6-a1bf-e95489c5878d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca73a53a2f465e523c7ba026109c51cd83d898b71d6744e43ab95ad426ac7d4f"}}, "hash": "288b126e4484e968d9783fa3abbd8e9da6820c3e51107706a27da4e227bffe9a", "text": "Second, there are variables defining capabilities,such as access to education and health services.

Almost all of these features are covered by the goals and targets set by the UN\u2019s Millennium Declaration. It should be obvious that each of these can influence the degree of access to and the capac- ity to use the benefits of ICT. Therefore, inas- much as there is a gender divide that adversely affects the status of women, it also contributes to a digital divide since women\u2019s access to and capacity to use the benefits of the technology are restricted.In the South Asian region,Internet users constitute less than 1 per cent of the pop- ulation.And most women Internet users belong to the predominantly urban, educated elite. According to one analysis:\u201cBarriers of illiteracy, preoccupation with survival,constraints of time, inegalitarian and oppressive socio-cultural norms and practices, high costs and predomi- nantly urban character of facilities, and band- width limitations are some of the key factors impacting women\u2019s access to ICTs in the region. 135 ICT, gender equality and empowerment in Asia MDGs C h a p t e r 9 136 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals Obstacles to access \u2013 a necessary condition for women\u2019s appropriation of ICTs \u2013 prevent the engendering of the design, content and use of ICTs.\u201d2 We can think of two ways in which ICT use can empower women and improve their status: \u25cf directly, through the agency of the affected women themselves, who exploit the bene- fits of the technology to improve their sta- tus, and \u25cf indirectly, by those who are exploiting the technology to improve the delivery of serv- ices to women,to increase awareness about the status of women and to advance their advocacy activities. The latter could consist either of women\u2019s groups or those not specifically targeting women,but whose activities have a positive fall- out for women who,as a group,are specially dis- advantaged. Given the gender divide, it is the latter that is likely to be more important in the early stages of the effort. At an individual level, ICTs offer possibilities for women to participate in e-commerce, distance education and e-government, thereby over- coming socio-cultural barriers to women\u2019s eco- nomic advancement that have been especially significant in many Asian cultures.At the level of women\u2019s groups,information technology allows information processes to be accomplished much more efficiently, and thus can be used to raise the productivity of information workers, including the operations of advocacy groups and NGOs that work to improve the lot of women.3 The use of ICT in women\u2019s education Educating women and giving them equal rights is important because it increases their produc- tivity, raises their output and reduces poverty. It also promotes gender equality within house- holds and removes constraints on women\u2019s decision-making, thus reducing fertility rates and improving maternal health. Educated women do a better job of caring for children due to an increase in awareness about the health and nutrition of their children. Equal access to education is an important step towards greater gender equality,but it is not the only one.However,even as gender disparities in education diminish, other differences persist everywhere in legal rights, labour market opportunities, and the ability to participate in public life and decision-making. ICTs can do a lot to improve women\u2019s opportu- nities in receiving education and training. Distance education based on ICTs, especially through radio and television programmes which contain various forms of educational and training content,will promote sharing of educa- tion resources and offer women wider access to professional training, secondary education, on- the-job education, etc. Programmes targeted at women could not only educate and develop skills, but also provide insights into women\u2019s issues, and create awareness among women regarding their rights, problems, solutions and choices.This would help equip women to iden- tify and break down barriers that restrict and discriminate against them.

In Pakistan, the Sustainable Development Networking Programme (SDNP), as part of its Internet Skills Training Programme for Women, conducts workshops at SDNP centres that teach basic Internet access and use.These were intro- ductory in nature and could offer large numbers of participants some hands-on experience.They were usually targeted at specific groups. For instance,SDNP in Quetta focused one workshop on housewives and working women in May 2001, attracting about 50 participants with access to computers at home. The province is highly gender segregated and the presence of a female SDNP staff member enabled contact to be established. The aim was to assist women in ICT can be used to empower and improve the status of women: directly, through the women themselves, who exploit the benefits of the technology to improve their status; indirectly, by those who are exploiting the technology to improve the delivery of services to women 137 ICT, gender equality and empowerment in Asia overcoming their fear of technology, to provide basic training on email and Web use, and to enable them to oversee family use of the Internet. The office reported enormous interest in Quetta city and Baluchistan, with one session attracting over 250 people,and there was much interest expressed by the participants in obtain- ing more advanced skills.Other centres at which a large number of such sessions have been held are Peshawar, Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore. In many remote areas,this was women\u2019s first expo- sure to the Internet. Once the access barrier is broken, the opportu- nities are immense. A community development project on ICTs for women\u2019s empowerment through education is being conducted by the Annisa Foundation, in collaboration with the UNESCO office in Jakarta, Indonesia.The project is being implemented in two villages: Batu Kumbung and Gegerung in West Lombok in West Nusa Tenggara. The Foundation assists eight groups in literacy programmes including three groups of female farm labourers for the functional literacy programme; one group of children who are out of school; one group of male teenagers; one group of fathers; and two groups of mothers. The programmes teach writ- ing and reading skills, and simple calculation. Other activities for women\u2019s empowerment conducted by the Foundation include the dis- semination of knowledge related to their health and the environment, and the establishment of income-generating activities. This project also cooperates with the Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology in the implementation of solar cells as the main energy source for computers and televisions in the classroom, reducing costs of provision sub- stantially. The teaching is conducted through the media of television and radio. Each village has one multi-functional hall for conducting the programme. A set of computers for database and administrative purposes and another of tel- evision and radio sets for teaching purposes are installed in the hall. Face-to-face class activities are conducted three times a week and also for evaluation and assessment purposes.The major impact of this project for women is that they could acquire the skills to take up productive activities such as making snacks, growing veg- etables and other home-based activities that allowed them to earn extra income, while attending to their family responsibilities that are ingrained in the socio-cultural condition. In other countries, especially China (Box 9.1), such efforts are being undertaken on a much larger scale. Very often educational programmes impart skills that raise productivity and increase returns from employment. Since 1985, Indonesia has been developing a programme called Kelompencapir. Kelompencapir is short for Kelompok (group), pendengar (listeners), pembaca (readers) and pemirsa (watcher). So, the programme involves radio listeners, news- paper readers and TV audience groups, who together discuss the information delivered to them, arrive at a decision and take collective action, mainly regarding rural life and develop- ment.It is a programme aimed at disseminating knowledge on new varieties of crops, new methods of growing crops,or new technologies in the villages. The villagers from different vil- lages compete in transforming that knowledge into actual practice. The participants in this pro- gramme have an almost equal gender distribu- tion. Such simple models could be further improved to become more innovative by using the full spectrum of ICTs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b30753ab-4f4a-424d-a888-17db04051885": {"__data__": {"id_": "b30753ab-4f4a-424d-a888-17db04051885", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d44acc6daaafaad301e5a25a6cfdcee020599e13f0b82a11697d9dffccc1e51"}, "2": {"node_id": "bcbde27b-a8d7-4200-ba8b-b3ce95b137df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5908507534a59c1917505caed8b0ded49f42d538546bb53f85c017d27e741e29"}}, "hash": "a76045c1a75cfec19e840f01c0db9f9a6468502dad953f3d175f5fdff4d4ddc0", "text": "In India, the National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (MANAGE) has set up vil- lage information kiosks in 11villages in the Ranga Programmes targeted at women could not only educate and develop skills, but also provide insights into women\u2019s issues and create awareness among women regarding their rights, and choices.

The 11 village kiosks cater not only to the concerned villages, but to women from 25 to 30 surrounding villages, who are group members of these societies. This project is an agriculture extension initiative, which seeks to ensure quick dissemination of technological information from the agricultural research system to farmers in the field and then relay their feedback back to the system man- agers. Staff of the MACTCS are trained by MAN- AGE to run the kiosks. The maintenance and operation of MACTCS finances is a major service offered by the kiosks. Villagers also use the Internet to check their eligibility for housing loans, crop loans and other schemes, and as a source of information about market prices in the state. Elsewhere in Andhra Pradesh, a project titled \u2018Sustainable Dry-land Agriculture by Mahila Sanghams\u2019 has been initiated by the state gov- ernment, under the UNDP-GoI Food Security Programme. A major objective of the project is to utilize appropriate methodologies to meet the information needs of women farmers.These include information on agronomic practices and farming methods, access to and use of new technologies, market news and agricultural commodity prices, weather and rainfall pat- terns, recommended crops for the season, and information on meetings and workshops on rel- evant issues.A database of relevant information is maintained and updated at a central hub, which can be accessed through a network of computers at information centres located in the office of the Mandal Agricultural Offices. These centres will be equipped with computers and modems for dial-up Internet access, and would provide services to the entire communi- ty.In addition to information related to dry-land agriculture, the information centres would also maintain a gender-disaggregated village data- base with basic demographic information, land- holding patterns and income profiles.The centres would provide a platform for distance learning through centrally developed interactive learn- ing packages on specific technologies.They will also provide simple services such as filling in and printing out applications for various gov- ernment schemes in the required formats, at a small charge. Such projects have been launched elsewhere in Asia as well. In order to improve and enhance current science and technology-based products and services, and their delivery through the application of ICTs, the office of the Ministry of Research and Technology in Indonesia devel- oped a delivery system of information products called Warintek (Warung Informasi Teknologi or Technology Information Kiosk). Warintek has been introduced in rural communities in Indonesia since 2000. It consists of technology information kiosks that provide access to the Internet and CD-ROMs of appropriate technolo- gies for rural communities. All information on appropriate technologies in the CD-ROMs is presented in Bahasa Indonesia. Warintek charges a small sum for access to the Internet and provides free access to the CD-ROMs. Both male and female farmers are invited to Warintek kiosks to be trained on how to use and access the information needed. In West Sumatra and Palembang, women participants, including farmers, are very active in the use of Warintek kiosks to search for information related to their businesses. About 10 to 20 people utilize the kiosks each day of whom half are women. In Medan, North Sumatra and the Papua Provinces, district governments have allocated 50 to 60 per cent of the Warintek training slots to women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86c4e50a-469e-410f-93f7-4349e406e4e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "86c4e50a-469e-410f-93f7-4349e406e4e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85d3a974630873b049205160cbde6f5a4a8a508015060bfa6fb9ed69d1d95ada"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3735ac8-d2f1-41dc-8967-0fbfdd4affe3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26acab5599bc1a1b58cb40ac2710f1c4dabfc8e073f443092848c6e5937abf5f"}}, "hash": "2f3d7c47d7a89f48356c24523309c4bf45381aadd29d5568b24a55378cc67972", "text": "Education is one of the areas where ICTs have been shown to have the most impact.

However, a positive development is that ICTs can provide a number of new job opportunities for women or business opportunities of which women could avail themselves. ICTs can prima- rily allow women to juggle family responsibili- ties and work commitments by teleworking, which opens up a plethora of productive employment opportunities for women previ- ously constrained by the need to stay at home due to socio-cultural reasons (Box 9.2). In partnership with Nari Raksha Samiti (NRS), the Datamation Foundation in India started a computer literacy programme and established a computer-training centre in a slum locality in Delhi.Women who are underprivileged, abused or destitute but have had at least school-level education are trained there to acquire basic computer skills such as the use of software applications like Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. The training is expected to help increase employment opportunities for these women. The Datamation Foundation itself has hired nearly 150 of these women, which accounts for about 10 per cent of its work force. Datamation\u2019s goal is to create more than 3,000 full-time job opportunities for women in the next two to three years. There are examples in India where ICTs are used for marketing purposes to strengthen the earn- ing opportunities of poor women.

To sup- port the venture, FOOD runs an e-marketers project at the same time, which trains computer operators at different locations to partner local cooperatives,deliver products,provide customer services, and promote the website. After the ini- tial pilot period during which the e-marketers were provided free Internet access to carry out their work,they continue to receive DSL Internet connections from FOOD for a small fee, while some choose their own Internet service provider. e-Marketers are trained by FOOD for free,and receive a commission ranging from 2 to 5 per cent of sales by the women\u2019s cooperatives and NGOs.The commission helps the e-marketers to sustain the project and motivates them to fur- ther expand their client base. FOOD now collab- orates with the Council for Advancement of People\u2019s Action and Rural Technology (CAPART) to expand this successful model to other parts of India. The use of ICTs for women\u2019s social and political participation ICTs can also facilitate women\u2019s participation in government and political affairs. Some rural women can gain a new communication plat- form to exchange their opinions on political issues with their political leaders and use ICTs to raise awareness about women\u2019s issues. Female political candidates can also win support from voters in this way, employing ICTs in the com- munication of their political messages to the voters. In Malaysia, the use of ICTs among political groups is seen to be higher and more compre- hensive as compared to non-political groups. A major factor for this could be access to better funding. Puteri UMNO (the young women\u2019s wing of UMNO, the dominant Malay-based party within the ruling coalition) and Wanita MCA (the women\u2019s wing of the major Chinese- based political component within the same coalition) have secretariats with several perma- nent staff linked through Local Area Networks (LANs). Most administrative work is computer- ized and electronic file sharing is common.Both organizations have Internet-enabled comput- ers,websites (Wanita MCA\u2019s is located within the parent site), and use emails and faxes for com- munication between branches as well as between members. Of the two, Puteri is clearly more organized in terms of having a strategy to promote the use of ICTs among its members, as well as in using ICTs to advocate and achieve political purposes. Presently, there are plans for the Puteri state headquarters to be on broadband, and for all UMNO offices to double-up as community IT centres that are open to the public. Members are being trained in information warfare and in \u2018Cyber War Conventions\u2019 that have been under- taken as an on-going, year-round activity on a national scale. Puteri\u2019s website is frequently updated, and hit rates and contributions indi- cate that it has a core group of regulars as well as quite a high number of irregular surfers. Underlying Puteri\u2019s plans, which are coordinat- ed by an IT bureau, is the recognition that ICTs, in particular the Internet, are a crucial tool for educating and empowering women. This drive to ensure widespread awareness of women\u2019s individual rights, and the collective power so generated, can help towards realizing the MDG indicator of expanded women\u2019s representation in national politics, which stands at just over 10 per cent of total MPs in the national parliament. In contrast, Wanita MCA is adopting a more organic approach. It has no specific bureau in charge of ICT,whether for administrative or pro- gramme purposes, relying instead on direction from its research and operation units.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3440358-9f9e-4bc4-a0e0-8e72d4663204": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3440358-9f9e-4bc4-a0e0-8e72d4663204", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8604ad85e4c3cac88ab1cbb9a0def6bbadea607f643129489da0116790b20153"}, "2": {"node_id": "1863b2fb-a112-4558-8ffd-c78286a52a79", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "286ea476c4028fc924c3b7bdbccc83fd2d6fe7da9b4d3b053270f4f0964b6054"}}, "hash": "09d3dfaf059441a4704ce38cecf705b24ad2870618b5e4df4c0852216b2e269a", "text": "The use of ICTs by women\u2019s advocacy groups Perhaps the most significant positive impact of ICTs on women\u2019s empowerment is the enhanced capacity of women\u2019s advocacy and support groups to exchange information, coordinate action, and increase the reach of advocacy cam- paigns.

Some women\u2019s groups in Thailand have started to use the Internet in their work. An example is the Development and Education Programme for Daughters and Communities Centre (DEPDC), whose website can be found at www.depdc.org. DEPDC became internationally famous when its founder and manager, Sompop Jantraka, was named an Asian Hero by Time magazine in April 2002. Its main objective is to prevent young women,from seven districts in the northern Thai province of Chiangrai, from entering the sex industry or the labour market at a young age. Since 1989, DEPDC has offered scholarships, shelter and various kinds of support to children and their communities. It has successfully pre- vented more than 1,000 girls from entering the sex industry.At present,the Centre is taking care of a large number of children,including hill-tribe children orphaned by AIDS. DEPDC markets and sells the girls\u2019 handicraft works on its website. The handicrafts, which include hand-made scarves and bags,generate profits that are chan- nelled to the Centre\u2019s Vocational Skills Training Programme for the benefit of the girls. Older forms of communications technologies such as the radio have a crucial role to play in a society with limited literacy.This is illustrated by the activities of the Kutch Mahila Vikas Sangathan (KMVS), an NGO working with rural women in 150 villages of the Kutch district in Gujarat, India. After its involvement in commu- nity development work for over a decade,KMVS launched a weekly, 30-minute, sponsored pro- gramme in the Kutchi language on All India Radio\u2019s Radio Bhuj in 2000. Titled Kunjal Paanje Kutch Ji (Sarus Crane of Our Kutch), the pro- gramme deals with a range of gender-related issues such as the participation of women in political processes, a girl\u2019s right to education, female foeticide, the harassment of brides for dowries and female suicides. There are similar examples of innovative use of the Internet in Pakistan as well (Box 9.3).The project \u2018Portrayal of Women in the Media\u2019 was designed by UNDP in collaboration with Pakistan Television (PTV), Pakistan\u2019s only pub- lic telecast media channel. It aims to ensure a Low levels of literacy and education of a majority of rural women results in insufficient computer skills to fully harness the potential of ICTs. Language barriers pose a formidable obstacle and there are substantial difficulties for non-English speakers in Asian countries to interact with the virtual global community Shirkat Gah (Urdu for \u201cconvening point for participation\u201d) is one of Pakistan\u2019s most respected women\u2019s rights groups,known for its efforts to empower women and advocate for a better legal and social framework.In recent years,the international recognition it has received,and the coali- tions and networks it has helped build, have served the cause of Pakistani women through the Internet and email.

Under this programme, PTV facilitates specialized courses on gender sensitization and seeks to incorporate gender issues into regular training programmes. Gender commit- tees have been established at all PTV centres and, in 1999, PTV management made a major policy decision to ban all displays of physical violence against women and children in their programming. Perhaps the most significant landmark in the history of PTV\u2019s gender policy was the launching of a daily 60-minute trans- mission for women, titled Khwateen Time. The project has now established its credibility by securing reasonable success in portraying a better image of women through the electron- ic media. Mind sets and attitudes cannot be changed overnight but at least the first step has been taken in that direction.5 The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has also been able to extend its outreach precisely because of email and the Internet.One initiative that was critical in making such interaction pos- sible is the construction of email lists and list archives on specific issues by SDNP. Indeed, this is among the true success stories of Pakistan\u2019s ICT experience.It represents the most complete source of news and information about various social and human development issues in Pakistan available on the Internet. The Gender and Sustainable Development List\u2020 (GSD-List) provides a daily news update on women\u2019s issues, both from mainstream and alternative media sources. The GSD-List has helped in the evolution of a vibrant community of women\u2019s activist organizations in the country by placing the power of electronic communica- tion at their disposal. By understanding the con- vening power of the Internet,they have leveraged it to great effect in several cases of atrocities against women \u2013 bringing unprecedented attention to the state of women\u2019s empower- ment in Pakistan. According to CENWOR, which monitors the use of ICTs by women\u2019s groups in Sri Lanka, enhanced networking has been one of the most useful, practical and visible results of indi- vidual women and women\u2019s groups gaining more access to ICTs.Such networking has been used in recent years, for example, to quickly and effectively share information updates among all concerned women about significant court cases that raise issues related to women\u2019s rights, violence against women and women\u2019s access to resources. Also, ICTs and their net- working capabilities allow women\u2019s groups to raise action alerts among women activists in Sri Lanka. An example was a government pro- posal to import labour for the country\u2019s free trade zones where the work force was predom- inantly rural women. The Internet has also enabled women\u2019s groups in Sri Lanka to become better connected with international women\u2019s groups and women activists from around the world.6 In Mongolia, the Women\u2019s Information and Research Centre (WIRC) is a well-recognized and dynamic NGO, which was established in 1995. WIRC facilitates the promotion of gen- der equality in Mongolian society and uses ICTs in a number of ways. Firstly, it uses ICTs in research and database processing, and analy- sis on broad-scale social, economic, political and cultural events with a gender-specific agenda. Next, it uses ICTs for information dis- semination and networking in priority areas.

Rural and mar- ginalized women tend to forego the chance to use ICTs such as mobile phones as they believe their husbands, brothers and other male mem- bers of the household should have first priority, due to deep-seated socio-cultural notions of male superiority and hierarchy. This situation imposes natural barriers for women to get ade- quate access to ICTs and to reap the benefits that ICTs offer.Furthermore,unexposed to the knowl- edge and use of computers, women develop a fear of technology,which is difficult to overcome, affecting their confidence in learning to use ICTs. The majority of women, particularly in rural areas,have a low level of literacy and education. This results in insufficient computer skills to fully harness the potential of ICTs. Language barriers pose a formidable obstacle. There are substantial difficulties for non-English speakers in Asian countries to interact with the virtual global community because most of the infor- mation from outside of these countries is in English.This is further complicated by packaged software that embodies the experience and requirements of a foreign culture. The lack of cultural relevance is significant to women as they are, more often than men, deprived of for- mal educational training.7 Women in many Asian countries have limited time to themselves due to their responsibilities of caring for their families even while engaging in income-generating activities.This situation is especially true for women in rural areas. Thus, the opportunities for women to receive formal education and vocational skills training are scarce.Women, therefore, face the triple burden of having to earn an income, manage the household and provide childcare. This gives them little time to learn and use ICTs. Next is the limitation of the lack of ICT equip- ment and poor infrastructure as not many women\u2019s groups have proper or adequate ICT equipment and facilities. The high cost of ICT hardware makes the acquisition of ICT equip- ment, especially PCs, largely unaffordable for women, more so for the disadvantaged who could greatly benefit from ICT usage for eco- nomic self-reliance.Women are often financially dependent upon men and have limited control over financial resources that could be used to purchase or gain access to ICTs. In the statement of the Asia-Pacific Gender Forum for the World Summit on the Information Society, it was also recognized that \u201cthe poten- tial of ICT as a tool for enhancing women\u2019s capacities in the area of health and education, as well as their access to basic social services and information, is well-recognized. However, in the marginalization of women from the lack of accessibility and affordability of ICT, women face a variety of barriers from low rates of basic literacy and information literacy to the lack of high-skilled ICT training. The English language dominance of ICT in software and in content further isolates women in this region from fully participating and benefiting from the informa- tion society\u201d.8 The Way Forward Relatively few applications of the technology will be planned to achieve gender goals, but indirectly ICTs may have profound effects on gender roles, gender equality and the empow- erment of women. It may well be that most countries will maintain the policies and build the institutions needed to utilize the technolo- gy to promote social and economic develop- ment,and that the improvement of the status of women will be part and parcel of the resulting modernization and development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b2caccc-9ccb-42ed-8a91-24d42c2a2d5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b2caccc-9ccb-42ed-8a91-24d42c2a2d5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4037211673d12a62e87f546d839900306cbd04c99dc5708f23975f1532422429"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7c236f0-ad83-49f3-9cf2-c43e2b5799cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d39501693ba2392cfdfdfb33a9d3bf36aa268de7c0bbd2fabe5cfe71a6f8bf0"}}, "hash": "917c101cb8cffc677150252a95050eb202a7617c63696c93a7403e34b7e4d186", "text": "It may, how- ever, be the case that preexisting gender inequalities will be reflected in the differential abilities of men and women to appropriate the technologies, and that the information revolu- tion will see a continuation or a worsening of gender inequality.9 The key actors in the ICT policy-making and implementation process are national govern- ments,multilateral agencies including bodies in the United Nations system, donor agencies, civil society organizations and the private sector.

Furthermore, the representation of women\u2019s organizations at all levels of ICT-related policy and decision-making processes should be ensured. Otherwise the making and implemen- tation of ICT policies would be skewed towards the interests of the male population, which is unfortunately all too common in most Asian countries. There should be an allocation of financial resources in the national budget to support strategies to increase women\u2019s participation in the information economy, including funding for NGOs to strengthen opportunities for women\u2019s empowerment through ICTs. In addition, ICT education should be integrated in school curric- ula and be based on gender equality, to realize girls\u2019full participation in science and technology education.Similarly,relevant distance education and training programmes should be imple- mented using ICTs, especially for rural women and girls, who are most disadvantaged in gain- ing access to education. It is thus imperative that the State play a proactive role in improving the social and economic environment for females so that they can harness ICT technolo- gies and reap the vast benefits that ICTs afford. International agencies should assist national governments in these areas by providing a vari- ety of supporting resources:technical expertise for design of policy tools, financial support and institutional capability-building. Specific activi- ties include policy dialogue and advocacy, where organizations representing women\u2019s interests are deliberately included in consulta- tions regarding all issues related to ICTs, and where women are specifically consulted regarding their needs and contributions in the process of ICT expansion.Institutional strength- ening has to be ensured, so that the govern- ment, national regulatory bodies and other entities involved in the governance of the ICT sector have the capacity to analyse the impact of the sector on gender equality, and include this analysis in policy-making and planning processes. The private sector is powerful and important in the ICT area; however its goals tend to empha- size profitability.The major challenge for private sector organizations in developing countries is to reorient their strategies to long-term market development, rather than short-term profitabil- ity. Private sector organizations should adopt proactive employment policies that encourage and facilitate the participation of women in a wide spectrum of ICT-related fields. Also, they should demonstrate their commitment to achieving the goals of gender equity in the ICT sector by providing and supporting training programmes specifically designed for girls and women.Lastly,they should promote the protec- tion of women\u2019s human rights against online sexual exploitation and gender-based violence without compromising women\u2019s rights to infor- mation and communication. Civil society organizations should participate fully in ICT policy-making consultative processes, promote indigenous local content that reflect local cultures and ways of life, and support women\u2019s online communities and networks, especially those that aim to address gender issues and promote linguistic diversity. A strategy for enhancing women\u2019s access has to be multi-pronged. It will entail a change in social structures, community and household norms, economic and technological models, and the creation of spaces for women\u2019s agency. The lessons from micro-level initiatives indicate some directions for moving towards greater access for women. Crucial among these are capacity-building for women, sensitive design of projects, continuous adaptation of design and delivery based on women\u2019s needs, the exploration of technology menus that fit the convenience of women (such as the use of radio and multimedia).10 The representation of women\u2019s organizations at all levels of ICT-related policy and decision-making processes should be ensured.

ICTs are increasingly being used to facilitate two-way information exchange in healthcare between rural and urban areas, providing isolated communities with access to the latest health information and treatment, and informing officials of rural public health issues. If ICTs are strategically deployed and integrated with health interventions, they can enable resources to go much further through cost-effective and scalable solutions. Many development practitioners believe that ICTs can play a critical role in improving health- care in developing countries. Some of the key premises in this area are: \u25cf ICTs represent an unprecedented opportuni- ty to make new knowledge, services and opportunities available in underserved areas. Poor communities benefit by receiving criti- cal health resources communicated across large distances, improved access to govern- mental and quasi-governmental resources and services, and superior medical advice, diagnosis or knowledge in their own locality \u25cf ICTs can play a critical role as instruments for continuing education and lifelong learn- ing that will enable doctors in developing countries to be informed about and trained in the use of advances in medical science and knowledge, and \u25cf ICTs can be potentially used to increase the transparency and efficiency of governance, thus improving the availability and delivery of public health services. ICTs have been used in many ways to enhance healthcare provision and delivery by: \u25cf increasing access of rural caregivers to spe- cialist support and remote diagnosis, and delivering healthcare services through tele- consultation to remote populations, lead- ing to a decrease in the reallocation of med- ical specialists \u25cf responding to disease epidemics through sharing lessons, treatment practices and guidelines with healthcare professionals, researchers and policy makers \u25cf enabling governments, NGOs and health establishments to increase access to health information through various forms of ICTs, for example, radio or television pro- grammes and the Internet \u25cf collecting and analysing health informa- tion, measuring outcomes, and disseminat- ing information to healthcare professionals, researchers, policy makers, citizens, and/or any other relevant parties \u25cf facilitating intra-government coordination on healthcare, enhancing government planning, increasing health awareness and purveying disease prevention content across all actors and departments, particu- larly in the most crisis-affected countries \u25cf enhancing the delivery of basic and in-service training for healthcare workers, and serving as a medium for continuing education or lifelong learning for healthcare professionals to keep abreast of the latest knowledge. 147 ICTs and health MDGs C h a p t e r 1 0 148 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals Telemedicine The most reported ICT application in health is telemedicine.The potential of ICTs to traverse time and distance allows humans to interact with each other in new ways.As such,ICTs are being used in many developing countries to facilitate remote consultation, diagnosis and treatment. Tele- medicine helps to extend the scope and reach of clinical services, and allows for the capture and analysis of clinical data from multiple sources to assist in the formulation of improved treatment programmes. Instead of having to move the patient to the doctor or vice versa, it becomes possible to move only the relevant medical infor- mation. In rural communities, where access to specialized care is almost non-existent, patients can seek advice from distant specialists without leaving the community.One form of telemedicine is interactive videoconferencing.This permits two doctors and a patient at different sites to confer simultaneously. A camera in an examining room enables one doctor to present the patient to the other doctor, usually a consultant. Essentially, telemedicine can impact health by: \u25cf reducing the need to transfer patients to a site of medical expertise \u25cf decreasing the need for reallocation of medical specialists \u25cf decreasing the number of patient days in the hospital \u25cf lowering the costs of healthcare for patients \u25cf enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic quality of care, and \u25cf preventing deaths through increasing the levels of second opinion diagnosis between medical practitioners. Where no doctors are available, remote health- care provision via the Internet is better than hav- ing no healthcare at all. For example, the best medical students in Pakistan often leave upon graduation to work in Europe and the US. For those who remain, medical practice is no longer the lucrative career choice it once was, although top professionals in urban Pakistan command very high premiums for their services. For devel- oping countries such as these, with an acute shortage of medical practitioners, telemedicine may be the most practical means to provide good healthcare services to the people (Box 10.1). In Thailand,the telemedicine project was initiated and implemented by the Ministry of Public ICTs can play a critical role as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55406038-97c6-4928-87fc-c0717f53f54b": {"__data__": {"id_": "55406038-97c6-4928-87fc-c0717f53f54b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21dc4f62549b2607112b0a8086790cc986825cb18e510d5d0b9ecde4fe1887eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "506c59d3-e6db-4852-aff9-4a2f153ceb10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53d6b91acd84ce2fba68be965443f9bb2743fa412c52464b587f426e50cfe4c0"}}, "hash": "4b80e84f485e64684de3a0a01da654e95dfc8c7a78b65d12559fd082131070c5", "text": "instruments for continuing education to enable doctors in developing countries to be informed about advances in medical science and knowledge Established in April 1998 in Pakistan, TelMedPak seeks to interconnect hospitals and local doc- tors. A prototype was set up in a private hospital in Taxila, a small town 20 km from Islamabad. This hospital was equipped with an Internet-enabled PC and a scanner. Store-and-forward tele- consultation was used.The patients\u2019case reports requiring expert medical opinion were emailed to the specialist, who studied the case reports and replied to the hospital. Each patient\u2019s com- plete record was kept strictly confidential with a limited number of people having access to it. This project proved to be very successful. TelMedPak also launched a pilot project in Gilgit. Case histories with images of x-rays and CT scans were sent through the Internet from Gilgit to Islamabad. A panel of consultants then gave their expert advice on the cases. Internet service providers helped to connect the district head- quarters (DHQ) at Gilgit with the surgical unit of Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi, where apart from general surgeons, orthopaedics, neurosurgeons and other medical specialists were made available. All the practical modalities of telemedicine were tested. DHQ Gilgit, with only a few doctors, was able to offer patients health services similar to those in developed cities such as Islamabad. TelMedPak aims to establish satellite links and promote collaboration with interna- tional hospitals and schools. TelMedPak.com also serves as a repository of medical information, articles and news alerts on emerging health issues,guidelines on preventative medicine and a directory of practitioners.The site is constantly updated and provides valuable information such as articles on the SARS epi- demic. One attractive element of TelMedPak is a small Urdu language section on maternal and child healthcare (http://www.telmedpak.com/homes.asp?a=995).

Medical consultations include tele-radiology, tele-pathology and tele-cardiology.The project has been in opera- tion since May 1998, linking the MPH and major university hospitals in Bangkok with about 20 district hospitals. Each station has a room-based videoconferencing system. The commercial ThaiCom I satellite provides the network backbone while provincial telephone lines serve as a support network.The tele-con- sultation application has store-and-forward and interactive videoconferencing features. One of the frequently used applications is tele-sonography where still or dynamic sono- graphic images are sent from remote areas to city specialists. The first phase was completed with reasonable success. China too has many rural areas where health- care is usually inadequate due to geographic isolation and low population density. Considerable healthcare discrepancies exist between rural and urban areas. Medical expert- ise is concentrated in capital cities, so people in rural areas often have to travel for specialized health treatment. The government, public insti- tutions and the private sector have been pro- moting ICTs as a means of overcoming this problem. In India, Apollo Telemedicine Enterprise Ltd, a sister organization of the Apollo Hospitals Group, was established in September 1999. It specializes in providing consultation services and second opinions to remote sites where access to quality healthcare is difficult. Apollo Telemedicine is reportedly the pioneer in launching the first rural telemedicine centre in the country, catering to a population of about 50,000 villagers. As many as 10 hospitals cov- ering eight states have recently hooked up to the Indian Space Research Organization\u2019s (ISRO\u2019s) network, thus extending super-spe- cialty medical consultations to remote areas such as locations in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Tripura, Leh, and Assam.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "506c59d3-e6db-4852-aff9-4a2f153ceb10": {"__data__": {"id_": "506c59d3-e6db-4852-aff9-4a2f153ceb10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21dc4f62549b2607112b0a8086790cc986825cb18e510d5d0b9ecde4fe1887eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "55406038-97c6-4928-87fc-c0717f53f54b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b80e84f485e64684de3a0a01da654e95dfc8c7a78b65d12559fd082131070c5"}}, "hash": "53d6b91acd84ce2fba68be965443f9bb2743fa412c52464b587f426e50cfe4c0", "text": "Using Insat satellites and VSAT equipment, the patient\u2019s medical records, such as medical images and outputs from diagnostic devices, are sent to specialist doctors, who, after perusing them, provide advice on the course of treatment in a videoconference with a doctor or a paramedic at the patient\u2019s end. This is indeed a major advance, given the fact that less than 2 per cent of specialist doctors in India are practic- ing in rural areas where the majority of patients live.At present,links have been estab- lished between super-specialty hospitals and smaller hospitals in neighbourhood district towns. The principal criticism of telemedicine applica- tions is that they are expensive and cannot be scaled up to cover large populations. However, there are successful attempts to develop low- cost applications in this area as well.

The equipment includes a remote diagnostic kit and a PC,which together provide basic healthcare infrastructure in rural areas at a cost of just INR 10,000 (around US$ 220). It can measure basic physiological parameters such as temperature,blood pressure, pulse rate and multi-channel ECG (electrocardio- gram). It also has an electronic stethoscope. Doctors in secondary or tertiary healthcare centres and patients at remote locations can be connected to each other via the Internet and a videoconferencing link. The data from the kit is communicated to a computer through a wireless infrared link. The fully battery operated kit also has an integrated video/audio confer- encing capability, and a central database can store all patient records and history. Measurements made using the kit can be sent to the doctor in a remote location over the Internet. Using the data, the doctor can make his/her diagnosis and provide the appropriate advice. In Malaysia, the Ministry of Health (MoH) joined forces with the private sector to form Telehealth,with the aim of delivering high qual- ity health content to the public using ICTs. The project\u2019s initiators believe that empowering people with medical knowledge will enable them to make informed decisions so as to care for their own health. This is the \u201cwellness para- digm\u201d, which is envisaged by MoH to be the future of healthcare. The Telehealth website (www.telehealth.com.my) has four compo- nents, one of which is tele-consultation that provides a platform for specialists to make deci- sions without the need to physically examine the patients. To reach a wider section of the population, the content is in the national language, Bhasa Malaysia, and in English. ICTs are being used in many developing countries to facilitate remote consultation, diagnosis and treatment. Telemedicine helps to extend the scope and reach of clinical services and allows for the capture and analysis of clinical data from multiple sources to assist in the formulation of improved treatment programmes 150 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals The portal also offers a wide range of articles on lifelong wellness including pregnancies and newborn babies. It also allows users to register with the site to facilitate collection of their pro- files based on which they are provided with per- sonalized content. Users can also request for information stored in the database to be auto- matically emailed to them.The portal offers chat facilities to allow users to interact with others, while newsgroups allow users to exchange ideas without having to be online all the time. In Indonesia, the Videophone Telemedicine Project uses low-cost videophone equipment to enable local doctors to consult specialists at major hospitals over normal telephone lines. It was launched in May 1999 as a joint trial project between Medifa, an Indonesian non-profit organization that supports the training of young doctors, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), advisers to the Indonesian Government on telecommunica- tions policy. Based on the results, Medifa has expanded the network considerably. The aim was to find a practical and inexpensive way for local doctors in outlying regions to consult medical specialists and take part in medical education. Doctors in regional clinics sometimes lack expe- rience in certain fields and are hesitant in their diagnoses without the support of senior doc- tors at major hospitals. Both local doctors and patients want to be able to consult specialists \u201cface-to-face\u201d via videophones in difficult cases. There are several advantages: it is applicable in any area with a telephone network; it is easy to use as PCs are not required;and it is economical, costing only US$ 450 for equipment and tele- phone charges. ICTs in healthcare education and training The potential for use of ICTs to improve medical education is indeed immense.For example,in Sri Lanka,an experimental application is being used at Colombo University\u2019s Medical Faculty to train its undergraduates. It is a client-server solution that can run on an Apache web server, with PHP server-side scripting language, or on a Windows NT platform. Students can log on to the server through the LAN using a conventional web browser. Once connected, they can choose between two types of approaches: a pre-deter- mined sequential walk through the lessons; or a pre-lesson question paper, and depending on the answers they provide, a tailor-made sequence of lessons.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c887643-72de-4dbf-9c61-dbb4f0de0352": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c887643-72de-4dbf-9c61-dbb4f0de0352", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "601c2a955ae6624f342938a0f900880c2d767fdfb1e256bcc7186ed4d0c72106"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cf17651-a355-415f-9783-d664c61ed694", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c28c838f87e7886607680f2ad6f9640c8ea4bcb3e7b98b07ea77d3b2c78b0342"}}, "hash": "a8312e0a6b36918b87df04f23bf14e2377dbaa811aecd76a9def4c53264dcce6", "text": "Each lesson comprises a combination of text, images and multi-media clips.

A student can use these question banks to test his or her knowledge before the exams. The tool also incorporates a search engine and a discussion forum. In addition, students in different medical schools in Sri Lanka have joined hands to create e-groups for information sharing. These e-groups provide not only technical informa- tion related to medical studies,but also allow for dissemination of advice from seniors to juniors. Malaysia\u2019s Telehealth initiative also has a contin- uing medical education component that helps increase the knowledge and skills of healthcare providers.The country\u2019s Health Ministry has also partnered with a private company, Intuitive Controls Sdn.Bhd., in the use of ICTs for medical training and research.In the RM 1.5 million proj- ect (around US$ 395,000 at current exchange rates), Hospital Kuala Lumpur\u2019s five operating theatres in its urology department are linked to the main auditorium for real-time training sessions through the use of sensitive cameras, microphones and other equipment. The events and sessions are archived and accessible through the Internet for students to refer to dur- ing their course of study, making medical train- ing more flexible and cheaper as students need not necessarily be sent overseas to train. The University Malaya Medical Centre also uses sim- ilar solutions to conduct its training and aca- demic curriculum. ICTs have also helped increase access to infor- mation and research for healthcare workers in developing countries. One example is Health InterNetwork (http://www.healthinternet- work.net), which provides access to a vast online library of more than 2,100 high-quality medical journals with the latest information on public health to providers in 69 developing countries for free, and another 42 for a signifi- cantly reduced subscription fee. Institutions in Information is vital in improving the health status of a population and preventing the spread of communicable diseases. ICTs can play a role in the management of such information, through database storage and retrieval of information 151 ICTs and health new countries just need to invest US$ 1,000 per year for online access, beginning with a six- month free trial.Health InterNetwork was creat- ed to bridge the digital divide in health, ensur- ing that relevant information \u2013 and the tech- nologies to deliver it \u2013 are widely available and effectively used by professionals, researchers, scientists and policy makers. Launched by the UN Secretary General in September 2000 and led by WHO, Health InterNetwork has brought together public and private partners to further the principle of ensuring equitable access to health informa- tion. Its core elements are content, Internet connectivity and capacity building. A similar project, eMedicine.com, is making its online database available for free in countries having a per capita GDP of less than US$ 3,000. Continuing education and training are impor- tant so that healthcare workers are aware of the latest developments and can provide bet- ter service to their patients.It will be very help- ful if the role of ICTs in healthcare is empha- sized at the entrance stage into the profession. For practicing doctors and health profession- als, IT literacy may be incorporated into profes- sional upgradation programmes. Fortunately, the use of ICTs to train healthcare workers, especially in remote areas, is an active and expanding field. ICTs in hospital and healthcare administration In Thailand, ICTs are also used to increase the efficiency of database management in health- care systems, such as hospital administration systems. Most medium to large hospitals now use ICTs, to some extent, to manage patient records and treatment procedures,hospital sup- plies and inventories, as well as other back- office functions. This allows them to serve patients more effectively and efficiently, and enables them to come up with surveillance sys- tems for communicable diseases such as malar- ia, measles and tuberculosis that allow for more efficient tracking and planning. Western China has initiated the Angel Programme, also known as the Hospital Management Support for Poverty Alleviation Programme. Its aim is to use ICTs to create a Hospital Information System to enhance the management of hospitals and their equipment, thus improving the quality of healthcare serv- ice. Electronically-based support systems are being deployed to support healthcare workers, providing support tools that allow them to increase the accuracy of the data flowing through the healthcare reporting structure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e5dd4f7-9619-4982-87c0-1fb973ac0c74": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e5dd4f7-9619-4982-87c0-1fb973ac0c74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f3d8e24530bc655082c70eed9bf3bbcb5c8d4e00540bb976ed26122abd6676b"}, "2": {"node_id": "43d7b16d-213b-4d21-84f0-caf5665e0ca8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd9d0f57a1774d74aac1a1a652f94782fd827a33821ecc8b6fb725b7fdec2ddf"}}, "hash": "5133e9e53f00a9435680155af5b87bccffaf4be3f88c6573d169342fa74c74ff", "text": "These developments have ensured significant improvements in healthcare in western China, especially in terms of alleviating infant and child mortality.

The initial target date in the Master Plan for connecting all district hospitals was 2000 but due to financial constraints,the unoffi- cial target is now 2005. Wide Area Networks (WANs) are used by hospitals to send their peri- odical reports to the Ministry of Health (www.moh.gov.vn) electronically. Some hospi- tals use LANs to facilitate the management and processing of patient records. In Pakistan, hospitals like Shifa International Hospital and Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital are using computers for maintaining data. Computers are available in most Indonesian hospitals, primarily for recording and reporting data of individual divisions, such as patient admissions, medical records, billing systems, and personnel and logistics data. Many hospitals do not have online intranet facilities that allow the sharing of data between divisions, but they have their own homepages. A noteworthy difference between the homepages of profit and non-profit insti- tutions is the availability of pages for public education.The state-owned Infection Hospital, has webpages for basic information on major communicable diseases. In contrast, a number of private hospitals\u2019 websites focus primarily on the types of services and products offered by them. Malaysia\u2019s foray into ICT is comparatively more advanced. The Primary Care Doctors\u2019 Organization of Malaysia (PCDOM) project \u2013 Primary Health Care Network Services (PNS) \u2013 consists of a clinic and patient management system and an e-community environment. Under the pilot project that started a few years One of the main problems in eradicating child mortality has always been the lack of awareness, information and education. Timely and effective dissemination of information for healthcare is the key to overcoming this problem. In this context, ICTs can play a very powerful role in improving public awareness of healthcare 152 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals ago, 50 general practitioners were selected to be part of an e-community.PNS helps to simplify management processes, which reduces admin- istrative costs. ICTs for the management of patient/health information Information is vital in improving the health sta- tus of a population and preventing the spread of communicable diseases. ICTs can play a role in the management of such information, through database storage and retrieval of infor- mation. In Thailand, ICTs are used to promote maternal and child health through the Perinatal HIV Implementing Monitoring System. Developed by the Office of Health Promotion, Department of Health, the system aims to improve the management of maternal and child health information, starting from data collec- tion at public hospitals and health facilities, through the transmission of such data to the central office and ending with the analysis of that data. Programmes are distributed via CD- ROM and sent to all public hospitals and health facilities, which are then advised to enter the data of all cases of HIV-infected pregnant women and also all cases of children born to HIV-infected mothers.The information is sent to the Bangkok central office on a monthly basis, so that appropriate measures can be taken to prevent transmission, and to follow up on infected cases. The programme has been used for a few years and found to have achieved sat- isfactory outcomes. An interesting ICT for health project in India is Community Access to Sustainable Health (CASH) which uses PDAs loaded with a database of patient records. Local paramedic workers can quickly and accurately collect patient informa- tion and often make on-the-spot diagnoses based on the patient\u2019s medical history in the PDAs. As the information is uploaded daily into a central database, it also helps to effectively track the spread of diseases, allowing for epi- demiological research and fast responses. The project is based at the Comprehensive Rural Health Centre, a 60-bed hospital in Ballabhgarh, Haryana, and provides healthcare to around 147,000 people in 100 villages.

Since data are now collected on a daily basis, dis- eases can be tracked as they spread and cor- rective action taken. The doctors at Ballabhgarh are now deeply interested in using the CASH system to combat infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis which are prevalent in the area.There are other examples of the use of similar data collection and management techniques in the country (Box 10.2). The use of ICTs in public education and awareness One of the main problems in eradicating child mortality has always been the lack of aware- ness, information and education. Timely and effective dissemination of information for healthcare is the key to overcoming this prob- lem. In this context, ICTs can play a very power- ful role in improving public awareness of healthcare. Many of the Thai government\u2019s major health promotion programmes and projects have a health-education component,and ICTs are used to deliver health information and/or knowledge to pregnant women and mothers of newborns, as well as healthcare workers. Traditional ICTs such as radio, video and television programmes are mostly used and these accompany less-cost- ly print media such as booklets,newsletters and Time is of importance in stopping the spread of communicable diseases. ICTs can play an integral role in preventing disease dispersion through the tracking of cases and incidents. This will enable healthcare professionals to be alert enough to warn people to take the necessary precautions, and thus stop the spread of the disease at the initial stages 153 ICTs and health magazines. Some major health promotion pro- grammes include: \u25cf the Thalassaemia Prevention and Control Project, which aims to reduce the number of thalassaemic infants by 10 per cent \u25cf Baby-Friendly Hospitals which promote breastfeeding \u25cf the Safe Motherhood Project which pro- vides special care to women during preg- nancy, labour and post-labour, and \u25cf the Under-Five Child Development Project, which instructs mothers on child develop- ment through a nutrition and development corner at each hospital and health facility. The Office of Health Promotion also has its own radio programme, which broadcasts health information on AM and FM channels for 30 min- utes each week. About 20 to 30 per cent of the airtime is allocated to maternal and child-relat- ed health information.Video cassettes have also been used extensively to provide health-related knowledge and these are distributed to public and community hospitals as well as health facil- ities. Hospitals generally run these programmes at the outpatient lobby or in the nutrition and development corner. Since 1999,Thailand\u2019s Department of Health has been operating a 24-hour hotline where people can phone to make health-related inquiries and/or look for health consultation. The auto- mated answering machine guides users through 692 topics, grouped under 23 cate- gories of health-related issues.In 2002,a total of 673,885 calls were received. The three most popular categories were sex (583,706 calls or 86.62 per cent), mental health (64,554 calls or 9.6 per cent), and general health and communi- cable diseases-related issues (55,080 calls or 8.17 per cent).1 Similarly in China, television plays a very impor- tant role in enhancing public awareness of healthcare due to its high penetration density nationwide. China\u2019s Central Television (CCTV) network has launched a special programme on maternal and child health.Such disease preven- tion techniques have had a positive impact on mass behaviour and achieved significant results. Carefully tailored and targeted mes- sages have played a role, through a combina- tion of local and nationwide broadcasting, where appropriate, so that the majority is exposed. In Mongolia, the Health Promotion Department is in charge of health education and promotion; media campaigns; health and behavioural sur- veys; developing, planning and distributing information, education and communication materials; and social mobilization to create a healthy environment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17cc6a08-d47a-4b7e-acfc-e137f3de7f1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "17cc6a08-d47a-4b7e-acfc-e137f3de7f1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53c132e4eb428042f3631fc2a3945ba8a500f86a77ab16a6e05cc8d5e8e21f74"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f46a45a-eeaa-4e76-bcd2-a7026f6bf72a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "791b21531cf48a72a1c84a9d1404c5e3f2bbf81743f746d7f28dc0303d2cee25"}}, "hash": "7fb4397372e0e552d3ddcedef5496fcd5928d304d4e4fa4a545a9bc47412b133", "text": "It also develops, designs and distributes health education messages and advertisements for radio and TV.The ESS studio ICTs are seen as a potential tool in the global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic because they offer the feasibility, at a relatively low cost, of providing access to information and knowledge to those working on the problem, to those who are suffering from the disease or its effects, and to those who need to take preventive action Teledoc,also known as Handy Vaid,is an initiative of Jiva Ayurveda in the state of Haryana,India,that seeks to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e246078e-82f1-47ef-999b-412415609619": {"__data__": {"id_": "e246078e-82f1-47ef-999b-412415609619", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db617a964223c8203392eb840f38e353cebf4a9d32dcd3c172dbd014ce462809"}, "3": {"node_id": "f01c7a26-2fa9-4382-a53e-4117d93c8759", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d275d2c7a21c80994d5ac9ffd857bed8372c73278a8003340120fc4b0cfb8ce6"}}, "hash": "706d27265d433a1c37a3e0a1dea996015bdcd9e7a3608d310b53b6b42c9b84b6", "text": "get timely health advice and medication to the patient\u2019s doorstep by making innovative use of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs).

ICTs and the prevention of diseases Time is of importance in stopping the spread of communicable diseases. ICTs can play an inte- gral role in preventing disease dispersion through the tracking of cases and incidents.This will enable healthcare professionals to be alert enough to warn people to take the necessary precautions,and thus stop the spread of the dis- ease at the initial stages. Given the current and projected impact of the epidemic on development, reversing HIV/AIDS becomes the most important MDG; and progress towards this particular goal will be a precondition for reaching all other MDGs. Though having a much longer history, malaria continues to challenge national governments and poses a significant public health problem in parts of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, the Pacific, and sub-Saharan Africa. It is now believed that there are 300 million cases of malaria each year, and the dis- ease kills over 1 million people a year, mainly children. This translates into a death from malaria every 30 seconds. Together with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB), malaria is a major barrier to economic and social develop- ment, especially in Africa where 90 per cent of the cases occur. In keeping with targets defined at the African Summit on Roll Back Malaria in 2000, one of the MDG\u2019s health tar- gets also includes having halted and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases by 2015. The number of TB cases has been on the decline since 1980 in most industrialized countries and still is, although the rate of decline has slowed largely because of trends in immigration. Nevertheless, the global incidence rate of TB is growing at approximately 0.4 per cent per year, and is growing much faster in sub-Saharan Africa and in countries of the former Soviet Union. Today, one-third of the world\u2019s popula- tion is infected with the TB bacillus. Of this pool of infected people, about 8 million become sick with TB every year of which 2 million die. Current trends indicate that between 2000 and 2020, nearly 1 billion people will be newly infected, 200 million will develop the disease of which 35 million will die. The rise in TB is so great that WHO\u2019s World Health Assembly, in an unprecedented step, declared TB a global emergency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f01c7a26-2fa9-4382-a53e-4117d93c8759": {"__data__": {"id_": "f01c7a26-2fa9-4382-a53e-4117d93c8759", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db617a964223c8203392eb840f38e353cebf4a9d32dcd3c172dbd014ce462809"}, "2": {"node_id": "e246078e-82f1-47ef-999b-412415609619", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "706d27265d433a1c37a3e0a1dea996015bdcd9e7a3608d310b53b6b42c9b84b6"}}, "hash": "d275d2c7a21c80994d5ac9ffd857bed8372c73278a8003340120fc4b0cfb8ce6", "text": "ICTs are seen as a potential tool in the global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic because they offer the feasibility, at relatively low cost, of providing access to information and knowledge to those working on the problem, to those who are suffering from the disease or its effects, and to those who need to take preventive action.

Knowledge about care and treatment, educa- tion and prevention efforts is a prime area for the effective use of the new ICTs in the battle against HIV/AIDS. Its promise of enabling ease of access to information and knowledge at a relatively low cost for different interest groups is its main attraction. This allows for networks that have the potential to link partners in dif- ferent spheres and locations, in the North and in the South, in their efforts to apply rapidly increasing knowledge to action. Therefore, efforts should be made to take advantage of the potential of ICTs to stimulate the creation and sharing of appropriate knowledge, and to strengthen alliances among civil society institu- tions as well as with the private sector and local government. ICTs can be used as tools to collect and analyse health information, measure outcomes, and disseminate information for relevant audiences, whether they are healthcare professionals, researchers, policy makers, or citizens 155 ICTs and health For example, with low levels of AIDS awareness in a country like Pakistan, and a cultural infra- structure that discourages the discussion of sexual practices and drug use, information dissemina- tion is essential.Television and radio advertising campaigns have been the primary mechanism employed by the Government of Pakistan in spreading awareness about AIDS. It has also used mainstream television programming,aired during prime time, to educate viewers about AIDS through several private sector television series productions that focus on life with AIDS and discrimination against AIDS patients as the central theme of the plot. The first such show was Bujhta Hua Diya (The Extinguishing Lamp), which aired in 1994. Malaysia\u2019 PROSTAR is an innovative experi- ment at information dissemination. Initiated in 1995, PROSTAR is a community mobilization programme where youths aged between 16 and 25 are trained as peer educators who, in turn, plan and implement suitable activities to influence other youths to practise healthy lifestyles. PROSTAR has more than 850 clubs throughout the country, most of which are based in secondary schools, with a total mem- bership of 20,000. It runs an e-forum on its website targeted at this large pool of potential users. Even if they do not have computers at home, they can make use of the computers in their schools or they can patronize Internet caf\u00e9s. The Department of Health\u2019s AIDS/STD Section printed posters and distributed them to various PROSTAR clubs to publicize the launching of the new website. The Section\u2019s emphasis on youth- related activities is understandable. According to the AIDS/STD Section\u2019s 2001 Annual Report, an average of 16 new HIV-positive cases are reported each day, the majority being people aged between 20 and 49. And, 40 per cent of those in this category are young adults aged below 29.2 The AIDS/STD Section is now making use of ICTs to effectively monitor peer-educator train- ing programmes and other activities at the var- ious PROSTAR clubs. In 2002, it launched an in- house network PROSTARNET, which links the Section with its 115 state and district-level branches throughout the country. Each branch keeps track of all the clubs within its territory and sends reports to its headquarters via PROSTARNET. The reports cover membership details, activities of the clubs, activities of PROSTAR officers, club committee meetings, proposed projects, progress on the implemen- tation of approved projects as well as training programmes. Previously, the Section had to rely on the tele- phone, fax and on-site visits to obtain reports.

Table 10.1 Types of organizations, their objectives and types of knowledge 156 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals Using ICTs for surveillance of HIV/AIDS and other diseases AIDS surveillance is well developed in most of the world and HIV surveillance, often based on sen- tinel antenatal surveys, has been extensively implemented,especially in Africa and other hard- hit areas.3 As the diversity of HIV epidemics around the world is becoming ever more appar- ent, existing HIV surveillance systems are ill- equipped to capture this diversity, or to explain changes over time in mature epidemics. Efforts are now being made to build on existing systems, strengthen their explanatory power and make better use of the information they generate. Strengthened systems, dubbed \u201csecond gen- eration surveillance systems\u201d, are being devel- oped to yield information that is most useful in reducing the spread of HIV and in providing care for those affected. That means tailoring the surveillance system to the pattern of the epidemic in a country. It means concentrating data collection in populations most at risk of becoming newly infected with HIV \u2013 popula- tions with high levels of risk behaviour or young people at the start of their sexual lives. It means comparing information on HIV preva- lence and on the behaviours that spread it, to build up an informative picture of changes in the epidemic over time. In the circumstances, ICTs can be used as tools to collect and analyse health information,meas- ure outcomes, and disseminate information for relevant audiences,whether they are healthcare professionals, researchers, policy makers, or citi- zens.That is, they can be used both for monitor- ing the HIV/AIDS situation in the country as well as the efficacy of policies aimed at limiting the spread of disease. With regard to the latter, by allowing for the placement of vital information in the public domain,transparency can be encouraged,finan- cial commitments tracked and governments held accountable.4 Having data sets that are reliable and consistent (between and within countries) is essential for planning and monitor- ing policies and programmes, for national and global advocacy,for making decisions about the intervention mix, and for providing a focus for the different sectors and actors.5 For example,in Thailand,an \u2018Annual Surveillance of HIV Infection\u2019 has been adopted by the Ministry of Public Health since 1995 (rather than the semi-annual surveys conducted between 1989 and1994). In this project, ICTs have played a significant role in the data collection, analysis, and dissemination of results, which enables the Ministry to have up-to-date surveillance data for better management and control of the AIDS epidemic. The Tak Malaria Initiative, carried out in the northern Thai province of Tak, along the Thai- Myanmar border, was implemented during November - October 2002.Supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, an information network was set up to allow the submission of diagnosed malaria cases from district health centres to provincial health centres using elec- tronic forms. With such a system in place, provincial health centres were able to monitor and predict the number of malaria cases more effectively, and health authorities were better placed to control and prevent the spread of the malaria epidemic. Sri Lanka also uses ICTs for purposes of surveil- lance and research.The Malaria Research Unit of the Department of Parasitology at the University of Colombo Medical Faculty uses a GIS to monitor the spread of the disease in sev- eral selected Grama Niladhari divisions at Badulla and Moneragala districts.This GIS data- base was developed using the data collected between 1997 and 2002.Based on this GIS data- base, the unit has prepared a risk map to indi- cate the areas more prone to malaria. ICTs for information exchange and networking ICTs can be used as a means of information pro- vision and networking, aimed at empowering stakeholders and facilitating consultations on policy formulation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79b98713-5b11-47eb-be55-c0003f68096a": {"__data__": {"id_": "79b98713-5b11-47eb-be55-c0003f68096a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89c7c9805d881e7d94918037861df13e257cc7771488217eb196b581a41fd1f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c0d6eef-1081-44a0-b786-59332bb3c61a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6512d13e204bb0f3e9051a34255f3dc5192b81352353ed0cd2a48c7e34c2a056"}}, "hash": "55c9aa9436c81378e73509b364bee8fbe1571bbca3af93be3f38142c4e61df3e", "text": "It can also support the shar- ing of information among medical practitioners and researchers working in the area.

It also collaborates with AIDS-India e-forum to disseminate India-relevant information on a daily basis. It seeks to facilitate active discus- sions on current HIV events relevant to India, and sharing of information on various pro- grammes, individuals and experiences. The AIDS-India e-forum is a virtual organization set up as a Yahoo! e-group forum in response to the AIDS crisis in India.It facilitates networking, communication and collaboration among those of who are involved or interested in AIDS-related issues in India. It has more than 1,700 registered members, and is currently extremely active with four or more messages/ responses circulated every day (Box 10.3). ICTs can be used as a communication tool in self-help group initiatives such as peer coun- selling and consultation. It can also be used as a means of building communities of those affected by HIV/AIDS and can serve as an online source of mutual support. Thailand\u2019s Kaew Diary, is one popular example of a civic movement to offer community support for HIV-infected and AIDS patients. Initiated by an HIV-infected woman, the website, (www.kaew- diary.com) is used as a medium of communi- cation. The website started out as a personal diary posted on one of the most popular por- tal sites, www.pantip.com, where Ms. Kaew wrote about her experience of being diag- nosed as HIV-infected when she was applying for a new job a few years ago. The feedback was very encouraging, and she got many kind words and support from people who read her story. Later on, more people volunteered to help with her \u201ccyber community\u201d, by develop- ing a website, and enriching its content and design. Approximately 3,000 people have applied to be a member of her website, on which they can search for information, exchange information and experiences, or seek consultation. Through ICTs, partnerships at the regional or international level can also be formed to tap into pooled resources and focus the effort against HIV/AIDS. SEA-AIDS, for example, is an email-based information network that receives, manages, edits and disseminates information related to HIV/AIDS. It supports a discussion forum among over 1,000 people working and living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region. The project was developed, launched and run in Thailand in 1996 with the support of UNAIDS.In Successful ICT initiatives are usually those that respond to \u201creal social needs\u201d rather than being prescribed by \u201ctechnology pushers\u201d \u2013 initiatives where technical and contextual knowledge are disconnected, and where the control is located outside the community India\u2019s Samuha is an organization that has been working since 1989 among the poor in the state of Karnataka, with a range of activities in its portfolio. One of its arms is Samraksha, which focus- es on counselling, care and support of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The organization has a network of five outreach sites for counselling,six outpatient clinics,two 10-bedded Respite Homes, and community-based home care and hospital support services.

Experts have done research to assess the benefits of such electronic networking among HIV/AIDS organizations. It was found that SEA- AIDS has proven to be much more than a mech- anism for discussion, updates and articles. It has changed the way people involved in HIV/AIDS programmes communicate and work on a day- to-day basis. By facilitating fast, easy and open communications across geographic and sec- toral borders, SEA-AIDS has demonstrated that networking and information sharing are crucial to strengthening and uniting the response to the epidemic.6 In a survey of SEA-AIDS members, 97 per cent found the services useful,99 per cent saw it as a good source of information and 86 per cent said it had helped them find other people working on the same topics.7 However, almost half of those surveyed also reported that they were too busy to contribute to such a network. The researchers concluded that electronic networks could help to meet the expressed needs for improved collaboration,and sharing of informa- tion and experiences in response to HIV/AIDS. Many people participate and benefit passively by observing discussions, while others actively contribute. In China too, ICTs have been an integral part of the country\u2019s fight to stop the spread of diseases. On 1 January 2002, China\u2019s Ministry of Health issued an Internet-based Disease Prevention Information System (DPIS) that requires the local authorities to report diseases in a timely manner. The major objective is to collect timely and accu- rate information on epidemic diseases nation- wide so that decision makers are able to adopt appropriate measures to stop the disease early. The DPIS is an important public health pro- gramme in China.The government of Guilin city runs a Computer Telephone Integrated DPIS to monitor the programme and has significantly enhanced its efficiency. Challenges to adopting ICTs in healthcare The benefits of applying ICTs in healthcare are constrained by limited human and institutional capacities, common to most poor developing countries.8 These include large gaps in basic infrastructure availability, the ability and willing- ness of health workers and others to make use of the opportunities, the availability of relevant and/or localized digital content, government regulations and policies, and ICT sustainability and scalability. While ICTs can help improve the health status of populations,there are major constraints such as access to the higher bandwidth, required for transmitting physiological data and complex medical images,as well as high telecommunica- tion costs. Many challenges to the viability of rural ICT projects remain, given the limitations of access to electricity, telephony, Net-connec- tivity and other basic infrastructure.9 Except for Malaysia, constraints such as lack of access to telecommunications and high costs have pre- vented the deployment of ICTs on a strategic large-scale level. These constraints are more severe in developing countries like Pakistan, India and Indonesia, where even dial-up access via normal telephone lines, let alone broad- band, is limited. Many countries lack the basic infrastructure to support use of ICTs. Failure to address these problems would mean that ICTs will not play \u201cmore than a marginal role\u201d10. The implementation cost is far too high to achieve critical mass for realizing any real impact. In Vietnam, the use of ICTs in healthcare is still in the start-up stage. It is mostly limited to small-scale initiatives at local levels and is not systemized. ICT applications have been deploy- ed in over 30 hospitals but these costly applica- tions face the problem of integration as they were developed by different software compa- nies.The lack of ICT specialists and low comput- er literacy in the health sector is a big challenge for the implementation of ICT applications in the sector. The quality of the health data in Vietnam is also still a problem because ICT has not been widely and efficiently used in the health sector.

Failure to address these problems would mean that ICTs will not play \u201cmore than a marginal role\u201d 159 ICTs and health economic barriers. Thailand\u2019s tele-consultation usage was not as high as anticipated, mainly due to rural physicians and city medical special- ists being unfamiliar with the system. Also, the very high workload of rural physicians made it difficult and inconvenient to schedule consulta- tion times. Although the diffusion of ICTs in healthcare has had varying successes,its application is still at a primary stage. In order to reduce infant and child mortality, improve maternal health and combat infectious diseases, access to hos- pital services, especially for the poor, must be improved. One major challenge is to reduce the huge digital divide between rural and urban areas caused by imbalanced ICT diffusion. Specific health support is needed, including investment in ICT infrastructure, and govern- ments should promote its use and development in rural areas, especially to improve the popu- lation\u2019s health. It is also important to focus efforts on educating health professionals on the use of ICTs and providing them with neces- sary connectivity, rather than to the popula- tion at large. With proper knowledge and con- nectivity, these professionals will, in turn, spread health benefits and knowledge to a wider group of people.11 Another challenge which developing countries face is that the information economy functions mainly in English. While a majority (59.8 per cent) of the total global online population comes from non-English speaking zones, 68.3 per cent of web pages are written in English.12 Similarly, the bulk of medical information in online databases is in English. This means that familiarity with English is essential to become a digital citizen, and implies that non-English speaking countries should invest either in the generation of software in local languages or in developing English language skills, or both. Although the number of non-English websites is growing rapidly, it is still not keeping pace with the English-oriented World Wide Web.13 Unfortunately, for countries experimenting with ICTs for healthcare, information transmis- sion through websites is still mainly limited to one-way transmission, from the experts to the public.This is reflected in the construction of expensive portals, accessible only to other experts, urban users and those literate in English. Interactive usage and public activism through the portal is clearly lacking due to the unavailability of innovative and interac- tive local-language content that is presented in an easily understood manner, without the use of medical jargon. While good training has been offered to select professionals on best practices in HIV/AIDS prevention, this type of information remains unavailable to most of the general population. Consequen- tly, many complementary sectors of mass media and popular culture are, on the whole, under-utilized. In some developing countries, there is lack of government will to fully exploit the benefits of ICTs. For example, in Indonesia, the medical fac- ulty of Gajah Mada University conducted a pilot study in 1990 on radio-telemedicine that linked it with Sardjito Central Hospital and five pilot health centres in a selected district. The system allowed emergency message transmission, interactive discussions among faculty members and medical consultation from the health cen- tre. This simple technology used low radio fre- quency and had notable success in the early detection of an outbreak of food poisoning. However, there seems to be no intention to upgrade or sustain the system due to shortage of funds and the low incentive has led to the lack of community enthusiasm. The Mongolian Government has created pro- grammes to improve the promotion of health education to the population, as well as a legal environment to implement information, educa- tion and communication activities. But the health expenditure budget on ICTs is not ade- quate and many websites still depend on inter- national NGOs and cannot provide up-to-date information regularly. As for the Pakistani Government, its role in promoting telemedicine has been limited to policy commitments and the occasional reference to telemedicine at political events.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b4e9a2c-c53d-424a-828c-f478ca052c5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b4e9a2c-c53d-424a-828c-f478ca052c5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a69e9207675a91445d252f97a26d4475ec5ae98e6cc23e8750eb8cf17d1cab3d"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa2da2f7-496e-470c-abb0-dc95380967eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cadf6af0a9c183ca812eb9b384b3f7f487211b19e1dece9ee71129931f20eb27"}}, "hash": "ba5257b1120cba5cb4a6ca903d8c9c9239d46da02dfde26a47b9307f8258a862", "text": "The one example of a working telemedicine initiative of the government, the Distance Learning and Telehealth (DLT) clinic in Gujjar Khan, has had serious Internet access problems due to the country\u2019s still-evolving telecommunications infrastructure.The DLT was established as a pilot programme of COMSATS, a government-owned ICT and Internet service provider, managed by the Ministry of Information Technology.

That includes focusing on building local skills to encourage the process of local appropriation16 and rein- forcing traditional information communica- tion networks.17 Internet-based communities have been formed all over the world by environmental activists. ICTs, by their very nature, have various applications that go beyond mere information distribution \u2013 analysis of data is one of their key potentials. Technology\u2019s role in environmental protection and sustainability is undisputed.ICTs,in particu- lar, are gaining in relevance amidst the increas- ing concern for the environment worldwide. Internet-based communities have been formed all over the world by environmental activists. ICTs,by their very nature,have various applications that go beyond mere information distribution \u2013 analysis of data is one of their key potentials. Hence,they can make a valuable contribution to a sustainable environment by improving moni- toring and response systems, facilitating envi- ronmental activism and enabling more efficient resource use. Material on most environmental management issues is scattered. It is possible to use the Internet to put together and classify the material. Information on water management would be of particular interest to most developing countries. ICTs can also influence the functional adjust- ments and changes required to help sustain the environment. A free-access website that tracks industrial emissions, for example, can serve as a self-monitoring tool for private sector business- es with warning emails to the relevant offices when emissions approach a critical \u201climit\u201d. Additionally, ICTs can serve as devices to com- municate information and increase awareness about the importance of the environment and understanding of issues such as climate change and biodiversity. A significant benefit that ICTs offer any society or local community is the pro- vision of effective tools to exchange ideas, knowledge and even support, not only from within a nation but also from global resources. The power of ICT as an information and network- ing medium enables citizens to act as environ- mental enforcement agents, alerting decision makers to compliance infringements while leveraging that power to reach and influence public opinion. Most, if not all, identifiable envi- ronmental initiatives that employ ICTs do so using mass media, including the Internet and email.Television and radio have also been inten- sively used in Asia.Any programme that exploits the connectivity these technologies offer car- ries the potential to increase sustainability, given appropriate content and training. ICTs also play a unique role in ensuring envi- ronmental sustainability by bridging the infor- mation gap between the government and the public. Information flows from the public that supply qualitative, time-sensitive inputs for decision-making can be crucial for policy. On the other hand, the development of ICTs and their use in the environmental area creates the opportunity for the government to ensure pub- lic access to environmental information and broaden public participation in decision- making and implementation. Further, ICTs directly facilitate improved deci- sion-making.Two application areas,key to natu- ral resource management, are GIS and remote sensing techniques. Both are relatively new developments founded on what are referred to as geospatial technologies. Their relevance for ensuring environmental sustainability is dis- cussed here. Overall, the effect of the use of ICTs on the environment is by no means fully clarified.

For example, the efficient use of natural resources could lead to a fall in the demand for raw materials and other produc- tion inputs. Or new online information services could provide consumers with more informa- tion about practices that positively influence consumption patterns from an environmental point of view. Overall, the potential use of ICTs in this area, although largely untapped across developed and developing economies, remains enormous. However, technological determinism must be avoided. ICTs, like all technologies, may also be used by people who over-exploit natural resources.They deliver positive outcomes only if integrated with appropriate policies and into appropriate programmes. GIS and remote sensing techniques GIS and satellite remote sensing have played an important role in collecting information relating to sensitive and vulnerable forest and water- shed areas. They provide essential information on both the quantity and quality of forestland as well as wildlife inhabitants. They have also been instrumental in monitoring changes in forestland. Thailand uses GIS and satellite remote sensing to monitor progress in the country\u2019s largest reforestation project. In Thailand\u2019s \u201cloves the trees\u201d forestry project (launched at Her Majesty the Queen\u2019s initiative in 1999), satel- lite imagery is used to identify denuded forest areas in five Northern provinces. These areas constitute the most important and threatened watershed. The project involves land and air patrolling, and reforestation in forest and non- forest areas. All types of media are used \u2013 radio, village audio towers, and TV documen- taries in Thai language and local dialects \u2013 to promote public awareness of the project, and to solicit support. Four hundred people volun- teered to join the project, which has effective- ly been employing GIS to verify and monitor changes in forest areas. The Government pledged to reforest 5 million rai in protected areas to commemorate the fifth cycle of the reign of H.M. King Bhumiphol during 1994- 2007. More than 3.5 million rai have been reforested. Other, urban uses of GIS have also been experi- mented with in Thailand. Its Department of Environmental Quality Promotion piloted a community GIS for environmental manage- ment in four Tambon Administration Organisations (TAOs). The system provides the following outputs: \u25cf physical data such as location, size, bound- ary and other geographical details \u25cf infrastructure data such as access to elec- tricity,piped water,telephones,roads,water sources and health stations \u25cf information on tourist sites \u25cf socio-economic data on population,house- hold distribution, land ownership, occupa- tion, income, education, and health, and \u25cf natural resource and environment data on land, water, forests, mineral resources, pollu- tion situation and pollution sources. Local communities are expected to participate actively in collecting, updating and using infor- mation in the database. In this connection, the Ministry of Science and Technology supports efforts by local academic institutes to familiar- ize TAOs with the GIS and its potential contri- bution to tourism management, tax collection, and natural resource planning and manage- ment under a \u201cTechnology Clinic\u201d project. Similar urban uses have been made in India as well (Box 11.1).

This demonstrated how effectively the combi- nation of TM and GIS techniques could be used to find information of operational significance related to deforestation. The Survey Department has been using GIS appli- cations for several years. Within their GIS data- base, the map of Sri Lanka has been divided into 92 units or sheets. Data collection is done using both aerial photography and plan table methods. Information collected is used to build a three dimensional model. This process involves the Photography, Remote Sensing and Airbase units of the Department. The database provides, among other things, minute details such as the start and end points of a river or the exact forest coverage in a given area.The hydro layer has infor- mation on the capacity of reservoirs and quality of water \u2013 which supports scientific management of freshwater resources. The administrative layer divides the island into provinces,districts and divi- sional secretariats (formerly known as assistant government agent divisions).The beneficiaries of this information include the Urban Development Authority, the Forest Department, Ceylon Electricity Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Universities of Kelaniya and Moratuwa, and Sri Lanka Telecom. For example, the Department of Agriculture analyses data on terrain patterns to locate areas with high soil erosion. The land use layer will further add value to the system from an environment angle. In Mongolia,the \u201cnatural resources management system\u201d project supported by DANIDA was implemented during 1998-1999 in two soums. The project objective was the formulation of county guidelines for pasture management, based on information derived from satellite data and geographic information systems coupled with geo-positioning systems and its application for sustainable livestock management. Satellite data,namely,Landsat and Spot images, were captured over the territories of the soums selected as project sites and processed to pro- duce dominant vegetation and land cover maps.Those maps were integrated with pasture The development of ICTs and their use in the environmental area creates the opportunity for the government to ensure public access to environmental information and broaden public participation in decision-making and implementation GIS was applied for the rehabilitation of the water distribution system in the water zone of Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh in India.1 The objective was to allow the water department to make key improvements in the system to enable registration and regularization of water connec- tions. Since the water supply is shared among several zones, identification of the required investment based only on water supply system drawings was difficult.Computer-based mod- elling was required; and specific information was needed for this. A picture of the basic water distribution system along with node coordinates was required.The population for each node was used to estimate the demand. Without GIS, this information would have been almost impossible to bring together quickly in the right format. With GIS,the water supply network was evaluated along with property maps to estimate the pop- ulation at each node. Coordinates for each node were easily identified. Since the water supply maps only showed recent system repairs and improvement,key elements of the system such as secondary distribution lines in neighbourhood streets were not updated. GIS was used to map physical survey information directly to the streets without creating a new water system map.This allowed a much finer grain of analysis than was possible with only the water system map.

The ICT initiatives of the Mongolian Government, with the support of UNDP and the Government of Switzerland,include a new project to deal with disasters titled \u2018Strengthening the Disaster Mitigation and Management System in Mongolia\u2019. The project aims to support the Mongolian Government\u2019s priorities on sustain- able development, environmental protection and poverty alleviation by developing a natural disaster mitigation and management agency accredited at international and national levels. Project activity focuses on the establishment of information and communication systems, and information databases for disaster management. In 2002, JEMR Consulting Co. had assessed the performance of ICT emergency activities for two cases of heavy windstorms that hit most parts of Mongolia,involving human deaths and substan- tial livestock losses. The first windstorm with dust and snow hit Mongolia during 5-9 April 2001 and as a result,23 people and 185,000 live- stock died. The economic loss was estimated as Mongolian Tugrig 8.5 billion. Meteorologists underestimated the weather situation before this wind disaster and information dissemina- tion was taken as \u201cnot required\u201d. Thus, informa- tion was not disseminated to the population. As a consequence, the country was devastated. The second windstorm,that occurred during 18-21 March 2002, killed three persons and 50,000 live- stock. The total economic damage was estimated as Mongolian Tugrig 2.1 billion.This windstorm had the same intensity and geographic coverage as the previous one, but there were fewer human and livestock deaths and lower economic loss due to the use of ICTs.Before the storm,the weather serv- ice issued an emergency warning and disseminat- ed information to the entire population by means of national radio, TV, e-newsletters, and portative radio receivers. The professional weather service, ICT and Government-supplied radio communica- tion networks, introduced at bagh level in 2002, have played an important role in preventing or alleviating the consequences of natural disasters. Similarly,Thailand\u2019s Royal Irrigation Department has launched an early warning system regard- ing floods in 10 water basins.Information on the water level is transmitted from upstream sta- tions to downstream stations. For example, information from the Mae Taeng station,located 32 kilometres north of Chiang Mai, provides a 12-hour warning to Chiang Mai residents. The information dissemination process uses mobile vehicles with loud speakers, manned warning boards, local radio and television. The Department is also developing a system which will provide automatic reading of the water level, transmit the information electronically to downstream stations and the Department with- in seven or eight minutes,and electronically dis- seminate the warning to the public. The use of environmental databases The development of effective environmental data- bases that can be used for tracking the status of various environmental indicators is an important way in which ICTs are applied to environmental protection. One relevant database, INFOTERRA, is an information retrieval system that provides information essential for effective environmental management that will help to ensure the sustain- able development of natural resources. On the surface, such online databases or web- sites represent little more than information dis- Technological determinism must be avoided. ICTs, like all technologies, may also be used by people who over-exploit natural resources. ICTs deliver positive outcomes only if integrated with appropriate policies and into appropriate programmes 167 ICTs and environmental sustainability semination mechanisms on important environ- mental issues. However, the process by which they are constructed and maintained ensures capacity and skills development at the grass- roots level (i.e. the organizations for which the websites are developed). Moreover, these web- sites represent an injection of new energy into the work of organizations. There are many national level databases as well (Box 11.2). The National Agricultural Research Centre in Pakistan provides retro- spective searching facilities of 23 internation- al databases available on CD-ROMs, including major agriculture and life sciences databases such as CAB, AGRIS, AGRICOLA and Biological Abstracts as well as specific databases like TREE-CD, ECONLIT, FASTA, Pest Bank, Tropog and Rural, Aquatic Science and Fisheries Abstracts, to help scientists search through relevant world literature.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36d763e0-6c80-439a-ae33-4f52bd930f3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "36d763e0-6c80-439a-ae33-4f52bd930f3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4dde73b3a432c6eefc4a929267f1d7e774e6caf485f012a1093fcd01e5ce0e67"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca2296d1-537c-4e78-913d-8e26a523483e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c50605028350730eb60bfa85aa0b4f5a323be5174b9fb6c477d19d8428215320"}}, "hash": "12cafa295f27acf1ca84ba8fe6b6851da6e41c99bd167e4d1172fdeb6c3014b8", "text": "In Sri Lanka, the International Water Manage- ment Institute, part of the global network known as Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), is among the leading research institutions using ICTs for nat- ural resource management.

Earlier, it had been discovered that although information on biodiversity was readily available, access to it was difficult due to the disparate locations in which the research data was found.Moreover,to facilitate discussion of the topics, researchers had to either travel or use expensive modes of com- munication such as the telephone. With the provision of financial assistance from the Demonstrator Application Grants Scheme,\u2020 ARBEC has built an online portal that gives researchers access to the database and per- mits them to critically discuss biodiversity issues. Internet technology cost-effectively enables equitable dissemination of critical research within the biodiversity community. ARBEC also provides opportunities for upgrad- ing research skills of budding scientists. ICTs for better monitoring of environmental violations ICTs can be used for emergency communication with and at the grass-roots level,with significant implications for environmental management. For example, one key use of ICT by the Forest Department in Sri Lanka is a communication GIS and satellite remote sensing have played an important role in collecting information relating to sensitive and vulnerable forest and watershed areas. They provide essential information on both the quantity and quality of forestland as well as wildlife inhabitants In China, many national databases have been constructed for land evaluation and manage- ment,such as the 1:4,000,000 national database for population,environment and sustainable development; 1:1,000,000 national database for land cover (by county), national database for soil erosion, national database for cultivated land by slope steepness; 1:250,000 national database for land cover (two periods),national database for wetlands,etc.Some of these data- bases were generated through the interpretation of the remotely sensed images.

The Department head office in Colombo can contact any zone through the network, while the provincial or local offices can only access other offices within their own zone. Mobile units of each office are accessible via a radio network. In the event of illegal activities taking place in a particular region, the respective office is contacted over the network and instructed to connect over the telephone to pass on information through a secure channel. This avoids the risk of third-party interception of confidential information. Additionally, Sri Lanka\u2019s Environmental Founda- tion Ltd.

In the mid-1990s, this facility was further expanded to access databases containing environmental information at foreign universi- ties.

In Indonesia pollution has been reduced since early 1997, when the Environmental Impact Management Agency began using the mass media to expose plants that are non-compliant with their designed environmental standard.1The Programme for Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating (PROPER) rates the water pollution pro- duced by 187 medium and large industrial plants. Performance ratings were based on the govern- ment\u2019s existing data on compliance with water regulations, responses to a survey about effluent discharges,and rigorous on-site inspections. Prior to disclosure in the media, the Environmental Impact Management Agency rated only 35 per cent of the plants as \u201cin compli- ance\u201d,but after exposing companies to the media the compliance figure rose to 50 per cent. Surprisingly,improvements at facilities were moti- vated as much by the information that senior management gained about their plant\u2019s environ- mental performance as by the external disclosure of ratings.In most cases,plant managers had sim- ply not understood the level of wastes they were releasing and the associated business costs. GISs are also potent tools in management of potential or actual calamities. GIS techniques have been used in tracking and managing forest fires and floods. China has successfully experimented with the technique in these areas 169 ICTs and environmental sustainability The importance of having a dedicated source of funding is highlighted by the fact that the PROPER programme went into hibernation after the economic crisis of 1998.Such is the vulnera- bility of enforcement programmes. Fortunately, with the economy picking up, the programme re-emerged in the year 2003 with a new round of ratings. On a smaller scale,in Pakistan,a Self-Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) for Environmental Protection Agencies was developed through the joint efforts of SDPI and the Punjab and Federal Environmental Protection Agencies. SMART is a scalable software solution devel- oped for the management of reports generated by industries under the self-monitoring pro- gramme. SMART maintains a database of indus- trial activities and the emissions/pollution levels generated by specific industrial concerns,which helps redress imbalances. Numerous opportunities exist for the use of ICTs by civil society initiatives directed at ensuring environmental sustainability. One was utilized by civil society in Pakistan in 1999 for the Save Kirthar National Park Campaign. Kirthar National Park (KNP) is a protected area of 308,733 hectares situated in Sindh province, 80 miles north of Karachi (capital of Sindh Province). Kirthar was designated a national park by the Sindh Wildlife Department in 1974, the first of Pakistan\u2019s parks to be included in the UN\u2019s listing of National Parks of 1975. It first came into the public eye because of the proposed construction of a national highway in 1991. The active involvement of civil society resulted in a rapid assessment of the serious damage this project might have on the ecology of the national park. In July 1997, the Federal Ministry of Petroleum (Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions) Government of Pakistan, granted the Dumbar Block Exploration License to a multinational oil and gas exploration firm (Premier Oil). The Dumbar Block encompasses more than 90 per cent of the Kirthar National Park, which enjoys \u2018Protected Area Status\u2019.

Its use of the Internet and email to build a coalition of support for the protection of KNP is instructive for its simplicity and effective- ness. It generated frequent headlines in news- papers, both in Pakistan, and through the exposure it generated online, in global civil society journals and websites.While it failed to thwart Premier Oil\u2019s designs in KNP, it persuad- ed its partner organization, Shell, to disengage from the project. The Save Kirthar National Park Campaign estab- lished a website, now located at a free host (http://www.geocities.com/savekirthar).The site generated numerous email messages to mail- ing lists in Pakistan (through the SDNP) and across the world,and attracted media attention. The results induced Friends of the Earth International (http://www.foei.org/) to join the campaign and take the oil and gas companies (Shell and Premier Oil) to court. ICTs and energy consumption Initially, ICTs generated activity in a substantially new business sector, i.e. the IT industry includ- ing software, hardware, knowledge manage- ment,and content development.The industry is characterized by the minimal use of \u201cmaterial\u201d capital,and the premium it places on intellectual or human capital, i.e. knowledge. Currently, and perhaps more importantly, ICTs are redefining the way products and services in the economy are designed,produced,and oper- ated. The economy grows not just by adding more resources (including energy resources) but by being increasingly efficient in the way these resources are used to meet real human needs. ICTs have reshaped the very notion of productivity, allowing sharp increases in the efficiency with which materials, labour and cap- ital are used. Additionally, many electronic gadgets and devices have inbuilt energy saving and standby modes which significantly reduce energy con- sumption. This is especially important in poor countries with have low access to energy sources. On the surface, online databases or websites represent little more than information dissemination mechanisms on important environmental issues. However, the process by which they are constructed and maintained ensures capacity and skills development at the grassroots level 170 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals ICTs can also be used to change energy con- sumption habits. In Thailand, one of the most successful projects using ICT to save electricity resulted in a saving of approximately 3,000 BTU per year or US$ 208 million (9,000 million Baht). The Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO), Ministry of Energy, has made extensive use of the media, especially TV and radio, to promote its energy saving projects under the slogan of \u201cDivided by Two\u201d(reducing energy use by half). Each year, EPPO invests heavily in TV and radio advertisements and public campaigns,financed by the Energy Conservation Promotion Fund which comes from an oil tax surcharge.The tar- get audience is the general public, especially urban residents. EPPO\u2019s award-winning website \u2013 www.eppo.go.th \u2013 provides useful and friendly content on various aspects of ener- gy, energy development and conservation programmes, and energy tips. It also serves as a gateway to TEENET (Thailand Energy and Environment Network), a network of research and development organizations in this field. Using ICTs to empower slum dwellers One of the indicators for the environmental sus- tainability MDG is the achievement of signifi- cant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020. ICTs are playing an invaluable role here as well.By mapping land, recording land ownerships and simplifying registration and other transactions for tenure transfer, ICTs contribute to current efforts for improving the slum environment. ICTs can also be used to help ensure potable water supply. Their application ranges from metering and reduction of transaction costs to organizational maintenance functions such as personnel recruitment and management. The functions of some organizations that are responsible for supplying potable water include construction of reservoirs and tapping of ground water resources, building and main- tenance of distribution systems, and assurance of water quality. All these have benefited from ICTs. Furthermore, technologies on sewerage, solid waste management, and related sanitation functions can be adapted from developed countries and appropriately modified for devel- oping nations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67badd53-ccc7-48e7-8ee4-08f00a523ff4": {"__data__": {"id_": "67badd53-ccc7-48e7-8ee4-08f00a523ff4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "044d2edc88f21cba34093ed7407470b93da8cb2ab3973922250c1ee89003d551"}, "2": {"node_id": "393cffca-e7cd-401a-abf1-5aaca998d944", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9ec2040201ff55c9d78fcf8b2724a6f628db58e38f1ad5114ecc0e6a2621a38"}}, "hash": "677dd9d506a7c28dca3117f446178193ea32a6fd9bf6dc9c801188ba77d4e657", "text": "John Daly2 emphasizes the importance of ICTs in empowering the urban population and in improving the environment as a whole: \u201cICT can play a major role in urban planning and monitoring urban development.The technology can be applied to design and construction of housing, to the building supply industry, and to improving the markets for housing,building sup- plies,labour for the construction industry,etc. \u201cICT rollout is likely to empower slum dwellers with access to information as well as with more voice in public affairs, and with more access to entertainment.

The rollout of communications technology to enterprises and service centres working in slums is likely to be ultimately ben- eficial to the slum residents receiving those services, as is the general rollout of ICT to the larger organizations such as the health and education ministries supporting the slum health centres and schools.\u201d Challenges and lessons Despite the immense potential for applying ICTs to better the environment, broadcast media such as radio and television remain the most prevalently used ICTs for the environment, in terms of information dissemination and knowl- edge networking. Our discussion suggests that, besides better appreciation and understanding of the current state of the environment, the key challenges to utilizing ICTs for ensuring environ- mental sustainability are: \u25cf ICTs are used mainly for environment mon- itoring and less attention is given to risk and vulnerability analysis \u25cf the application of ICTs for environmental sustainability is uneven across North and South, highly qualified and poorly educat- ed people, between different environmen- tal aspects, and among agencies with respect to environmental management \u25cf ICT tools are mainly used by State con- trolled organizations for environmental protection. The roles of NGOs and private organizations in ICT promotion for environ- mental sustainability remain weak ICTs can also be used to change energy consumption habits. In Thailand, one of the most successful projects using ICT to save electricity resulted in a saving of approximately 3,000 BTU per year 171 ICTs and environmental sustainability \u25cf the shortage of budgets results in ICT meas- ures being focused only on major environ- mental problems,such as disaster monitoring, soil erosion, and forest depletion, and \u25cf public awareness remains weak in this area. Training of skilled people and connectivity remain the two major challenges facing developing countries aiming to use the tech- nology for environmental management in Asia. Currently, research grants serve as one way of encouraging ICT awareness and development in the environment arena. These efforts include UNDP\u2019s Pan Asia ICT R&D Grants Programme, which calls for building institu- tional capacity in the developing countries of the Asian region and encouraging innovative networking solutions to problems such as environmental management. Similarly, Virtual Foundation, an online philanthropy pro- gramme, carefully screens organizations, even at the grassroots level, so that they can be funded by online donors. This initiative encourages private philanthropy amongst cit- izens and also supports NGOs in their quest for environmental sustainability. However, experience clearly shows that, although ICTs have enormous potential in ensuring environmental sustainability, the spread of ICTs must not be an objective in itself. ICTs should be implemented in appropriate cir- cumstances coupled with the needed legisla- tive support and dedicated funding. While the process of globalization inexorably compresses the world into a global village, ICTs intensify and accelerate the process. Developing countries need to cope with the process by adapting to it in ways that allow them to appropriate its benefits and minimize its adverse consequences Revolutionary advances in information technol- ogy are reinforcing economic and social changes that are transforming business and society.From this evolution,a new kind of econ- omy \u2013 the information economy \u2013 is emerging in which information is the critical resource and the basis for competition. Throughout the world,ICTs are generating a new industrial revo- lution already as significant and far-reaching as revolutions of the past. Old ways of doing busi- ness are being challenged, and sometimes defeated, in this process. This is part of the process of globalization,to the extent that the latter is mediated by technology. While globalization inexorably compresses the world into a global village, ICTs intensify and accelerate the process. Developing countries need to cope with the process by adapting to it in ways that allow them to appropriate its ben- efits and minimize its adverse consequences. The target of MDG 8 is to manage the effects of globalization through a focused partnership for development. Such a goal-oriented partnership for development can tie multiple stakeholders into joint risk-taking and reward-sharing relationships.

The objective is to create a win-win situation, where the goals of the private sector, based primarily on the prof- it/loss criteria, would be increasingly comple- mentary and mutually reinforcing with broad development goals that the United Nations works to advance. ICT partnerships involving the private sector, civil society and global organizations Global companies must be persuaded to play an important role in this endeavour. This could start in their own corporate domains, through the application of good practices everywhere they operate. Understanding the far reaching effects of this benefit,UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has gone forward to invite the business community to join the \u201cGlobal Compact\u201d by incorporating in their own corporate practices a set of core values in the areas of labour stan- dards, human rights, the environment and the anti-corruption. This initiative has been endorsed by a wide variety of business associa- tions, labour groups and NGOs. However, the process cannot stop here. Governments alone cannot ensure that ICTs play their designated role in development. The effort of developing the appropriate technology and innovation aimed at reducing the costs of that technology is, most often, best undertaken by individuals, autonomous institutions, private firms and civil society organizations, that have the requisite knowledge and the flexibility to 175 ICTs and global partnerships in Asia MDGs C h a p t e r 1 2 176 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals ensure success. Partnerships between these entities and the government \u2013 which serves as facilitator and financier \u2013 and international organizations, that provide technological and financial support for the process, would be nec- essary to accelerate the process of technology development. An obvious area in which the private sector can contribute is to impart skills that can help the poor and the disadvantaged exploit ICTs if pro- vided access. Even if still on a marginal scale from a global point of view, work in this area has begun as illustrated by Intel\u2019s \u2018Teach to the Future\u2019 programme discussed in Box 12.1. The need to multiply and strengthen such or similar projects hardly needs emphasizing. Fortu- nately, private firms recognizing the need for corporate social responsibility have entered the area. Civil society organizations that play a major role in the development arena and have the knowl- edge, experience and the grassroots organiza- tion required to induct ICT into existing proj- ects, and design projects aimed at utilizing ICT in innovative ways,have to be harnessed as well (Box 12.2). Finally, international donors and NGOs, with their long track record in supporting develop- ment activities, collating international experi- ences and scaling up small experiments, cannot but be involved in this emerging area. In Pakistan, for example, SDNP, a programme fund- ed jointly by the UNDP, IUCN and IDRC in 1994, was responsible for helping develop websites for NGOs and development agencies at highly subsidized rates. This created a significant momentum for networking within the develop- ment community, the sharing of best practices for poverty elimination and the opening up of a world of information and knowledge that lay unexplored on the Internet. Global partnership requires establishing rela- tionships among all these actors and between them and the State in developing countries. An example of such a partnership is that between the Sri Lankan government and a regional UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has gone forward to invite the business community to join the \"Global Compact\" by incorporating in their own corporate practices a set of core values in three areas: labour standards, human rights and the environment Intel\u2019s \u2018Teach to the Future\u2019 is a worldwide effort to help both experienced teachers and pre- service teachers integrate technology into instruction and enhance student learning.

Collaboration using ICTs in higher education and research Given the origins of the Internet as a tool for research collaboration, it is not surprising that one area where partnership based on ICTs has autonomously evolved to a substantial extent is higher education and research. ICT tools have linked worldwide research institutions, en- hanced scientific research and developed part- nerships for innovative projects. Commun- ication between universities and research organizations has increased collaborative efforts between institutions and countries that mutually exchange research ideas, acquire interdisciplinary knowledge, solve special tech- nical problems on-site, share public informa- tion, compare methodologies and report new achievements. In China, educational institutions are aggressive in establishing partnerships with foreign institu- tions and this is often done using ICTs. Apart from China, Indonesia has also been using ICTs to build partnerships with foreign research institutes to enhance its education sector. One such initiative is the Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) project at University of Indonesia. The project was approved by the World Bank in 2001 and had a budget of US$ 2 million. Its objective is to test the potential effectiveness and sustainability of distance learning in Indonesia, by delivering training material developed by global institutions for various segments of the public, such as stu- dents,key decision makers in the public and pri- vate sectors and the public at large. Thailand has also started initiatives using ICTs in education. One such key initiative is the ASEAN SchoolNets project, where the ASEAN Foundation is the main sponsor of the project. This initiative,a regional partnership,is aimed at incorporating the use of ICTs in schools to improve the teaching and learning process. Global Public Policy Networks (GPPNs) Another set of new global partnerships have emerged between what are termed variously as global civil society organizations, global social movements and, now more recently, as Global Public Policy Networks (GPPNs). They are inter- national networks and coalitions that can work consensually in developing sustainable policy positions. They have been effective in drawing interest from a wide group of organizations with similar objectives although operating in different local environments. GPPNs are seen to fill the gaps in terms of addressing North-South issues. The GPPNs are increasingly using ICT; and oper- ate rather informally. They are thus able to mobilize and respond quickly through public policy campaigns which attract broad global interest. The globalization process and the Internet have,in turn,facilitated these loose and innovative networks of organized action where traditional processes have failed to respond in an appropriate manner.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37812492-3aa3-4a00-9ca5-f7858a560b4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "37812492-3aa3-4a00-9ca5-f7858a560b4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c11b8d32814fd2d1c5db01955a0ee61e8ae61f759d9eb5fce6a8eb500193dcca"}, "2": {"node_id": "91708ade-ae9e-4584-8d64-e524997cb5ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "151d7e62ea248c10c3105eb80a2a6d93af18fd4c81ae447243569fff1c36cf6f"}}, "hash": "b2b13f1f723dd76057573459f79b99a82054d92ff2330495f0379949a36459b5", "text": "The effectiveness of GPPNs can be seen in their ability to address capacity gaps in national governance as well as in global governance when conventional insti- tutions have proven ineffectual.1 GPPNs, on the Given the origins of the Internet as a tool for research collaboration, it is not surprising that one area where partnership based on ICTs has autonomously evolved to a substantial extent is higher education and research TVE International is a non-profit organization working globally and locally to raise awareness of environment, development, health and human rights issues through the media.

The potential and capability offered by global partnership networks cannot be overstated and should be leveraged fully by all sectors. The use of technology itself generates partner- ships that have larger implications for develop- ment. These partnerships share information, views and experiences,and generate discussion facilitated by the technology. They, therefore, help arrive at international positions, standards and mechanisms on development, in general, and the use of ICTs for development, in particu- lar. Further, by helping mobilize a constituency for these democratically derived positions,stan- dards and mechanisms they create international pressures on different actors \u2013 government,civil society organizations and the private sector to adopt them. These positions relate not just to the use of ICT for development per se, but to macroeconomic issues such as debt reduction, capital controls, fiscal and monetary policy and sustainable development, to name but a few areas. In general,the impact of ICTs in developing sus- tainable global partnership has been positive for many countries. This has enhanced the new hope that ICTs have generated in the develop- ing world.Indeed,social and economic develop- ment are complex phenomena depending on various factors, and ICTs alone cannot solve the developing world\u2019s problems. However, integra- tion of ICTs into overall national and regional development strategies expands the scope and coverage of development interventions. Global partnerships that ICTs help forge can contribute substantially to realizing that goal. One of the most important constraints is no doubt sheer physical access and, where such access is available, the cost of such access. The first conclusion of significance is the need to increase the reach of the technology, not merely physically but also at reasonable cost Given the nature and the power of ICTs,the per- ception that they can be used as enabling devices in the effort to realize the MDGs is well- grounded and indisputable. They can be used: \u25cf for information collation and analysis \u25cf to serve as low-cost means of communica- tion and information dissemination \u25cf to enhance the productivity of operations varying from production and management to marketing and delivery \u25cf to help deliver services such as education and health more efficiently to even remote locations \u25cf to help monitor the status of achievement and progress on all MDG fronts \u25cf to help increase transparency and account- ability in a range of organizations,including government, and \u25cf to encourage networking of a kind that increases the power of disparate and dis- perse organizations working toward the same goals to jointly formulate alternatives and campaign strategies and lobby and pressurize governments into delivering on requirements and promises on various fronts. Given the spread of the technology in Asia, countries in the region are in a position to use ICTs for socio-economic and human develop- ment.Telephone availability, personal comput- er ownership and Internet access are increas- ing rapidly, facilitated by much lower start-up costs, compared to those experienced by developed countries initially, as well as by growing government support with pro-ICT policies and regulations. This Report points to the significant role that ICTs can play in achieving the MDGs. The evi- dence suggests that while countries are attempting to exploit these opportunities, progress has been slow. The experiences of the countries chosen for special study as the basis of this Report suggest that, at a macro-level, ICT policy is indeed sensitive to human develop- ment concerns and seeks to use the technology in partnership with NGOs, donors and the pri- vate sector. What needs to be examined, there- fore, is the degree to which this economy-wide commitment is being translated into specific projects that advance specific MDGs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c93e556b-91cc-4de5-a844-3cb0292ccc38": {"__data__": {"id_": "c93e556b-91cc-4de5-a844-3cb0292ccc38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "226993e0e33429481601dd3ebede582feff6cde8852c4d68015c756a72962a9b"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ae824d1-fcce-4d02-b733-9ccbd761a2cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c2e97091ecf51c506ec3a98eeb0c1adbc8ed7eb41ce2ea011c8d437cdb9daa4"}}, "hash": "dd26b03c4c0598804f4b629104fd3c55122ab700e69c116fe5e30baf03925dc7", "text": "Though, many of the applications studied are in the nature of pilot projects \u2013 experimental in char- acter, small in scale and uncertain in terms of sustainability \u2013 they provide the material to assess the role that ICTs can play as well as the models that, if successful, need to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "583d26d2-63d9-4981-a46e-ffd818dc2e10": {"__data__": {"id_": "583d26d2-63d9-4981-a46e-ffd818dc2e10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "815a30a6c781262cd80dfc45249f7ecdef16c0d1daf8090b7a472eb8e82b5bc8"}}, "hash": "815a30a6c781262cd80dfc45249f7ecdef16c0d1daf8090b7a472eb8e82b5bc8", "text": "be scaled up. An objective of this Report, besides selectively documenting the myriad experiments in differ- ent MDG-related areas, was to attempt to understand some of the constraints to extend- ing the effects of the technology as illustrated by specific experiments.One of the most impor- tant constraints is, no doubt, sheer physical access and, where such access is available, the cost of such access. The first conclusion of sig- nificance is that there is need to increase the reach of the technology, not merely physically but also at reasonable cost. Increased reach has many aspects: spread of the required hardware; dismantling of barriers to access even when the technology is physically available; ensuring the availability of the appropriate software; and developing appropriate, people-sensitive con- tent in local languages. There is reason to believe that,in terms of these indicators,reach is still limited.This is partly due to the inadequacy of the hardware that is in place in many coun- tries. In many contexts, aggregate indicators of 181 Conclusions and policy implications MDGs C h a p t e r 1 3 182 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals reach are far from satisfactory even when spread is rapid. Further, aggregate figures of reach conceal the low penetration of telecom- munications capacity and a high degree of urban and regional concentration. Not surprisingly, the number of Internet users relative to the population is very small at pres- ent and many developing countries lag in terms of the bandwidth (or the pipe) necessary for people to simultaneously access information flow through the Internet.Inter- and intra-coun- try variations in connectivity and access lend some support to the idea that ICT diffusion could well be accompanied by widening digital divides, stifling the effort to use the technology for enabling the realization of the MDGs. Those who have no or limited access to the technology or the skills and knowledge required to exploit it fall further back in terms of their ability to use the technology. Very often the choice of policies to overcome these constraints is posed in terms of a private vs.public effort dichotomy.Advocates of private entry and dominance in an area where the pub- lic sector has for long been the dominant player, suggest that public monopoly has been detri- mental to both access and cost. It is indeed true that, in many contexts, private entry has increased competition and reduced costs. However, focusing on this alone would lead to ignoring a number of factors. First, private networks would be almost worth- less if they could not interconnect to the large and historically evolved public network and exploit the network externalities that are wide- spread in these areas. Second, the private net- work reach is narrow, in the sense that it tends to avoid areas where the terrain is difficult and/or where line and call densities are low.This is true even in environments such as India where there is a Universal Service Obligation attached to most licences given to operators in these areas. Narrow private reach is inevitable because of the profit motive underlying private invest- ments. While private initiative can supplement the investment needed from the government,it is not always clear whether private providers would be willing to offer connectivity in remote locations at all, or at a reasonable cost. Reach of a kind that is required for the pursuit of the MDGs would not materialize without public involvement. The government may, in the process, avail of facilities created by the private sector in areas where traffic density is high, especially if competition among private produc- ers has substantially reduced cost. However, in the foreseeable future, government investment would be crucial in areas where traffic density is low or where remoteness or the difficulties of geography make the investment inadequately profitable in the initial stages. The possibility of tapping profits from commercial exploitation of the technology through taxation, as in the export of software and IT-enabled services, needs to be explored to finance the govern- ment\u2019s investment for human development purposes. This would ensure some degree of holistic development of the ICT sector. Finally, private entry and competition results in the replication of communications infrastructure in the same area which, given the massive capaci- ty of individual optical fibre networks,for exam- ple, is wasteful and has adverse cost and viabili- ty implications in the long run. Connectivity and hardware availability are only one end of the problem. ICTs require specific skills and that comes in the way of their adop- tion by underprivileged groups and regions.

The elite has larger resources at its command to own or access the technology, can acquire the necessary skills easily due to its higher levels of secondary and tertiary education, and can establish links through ICT with other produc- tive and social sectors for appropriating new facilities and opportunities. Progress along many MDG fronts is not just enabled by ICT but, in a complex two-way relationship, is also a pre- requisite for exploiting the technology. The conclusion here is clear. A prerequisite for ensuring an equitable information infrastruc- ture is investment: both public investment as well as complementary private investment.But the infrastructure thus created may not in itself be equally accessible.So an ICT policy sensitive to human development concerns must emphasize universal service provision in the telecom area. State initiatives to realize this are particularly important in countries with sharp social and economic divides, and in those where geography makes universal provision difficult. Very often the choice of policies to overcome these constraints is posed in terms of a private vs. public effort dichotomy. Advocates of private entry and dominance in an area where the public sector has for long been the dominant player, suggest that public monopoly has been detrimental to both access and cost 183 Conclusions and policy implications ICT and poverty alleviation In the long run, the most important MDG is that of abolishing poverty and raising incomes of the poorer sections of the population. While progress can be achieved independently in other areas, success beyond a point rests on progress on the income poverty front. Our dis- cussion suggests that ICTs can play a major role here. ICTs can directly contribute to poverty reduc- tion by generating new employment opportu- nities and by increasing productivity, reducing costs and enhancing returns from economic activities undertaken by poorer households. They can also facilitate and reduce the costs of delivery of information and services that pro- mote wage- and self-employment,raise produc- tivity and improve the quality of employment- generating and poverty-alleviating projects being implemented by the government. Besides this,ICTs can facilitate poverty mapping and monitoring, help evaluate the impact of poverty reduction strategies and mediate enhanced support to the poor. That having been said, we should be careful not to extrapolate this argument too far. Whether these uses of ICT development can be sustained and whether they can be translated into faster human development depends on factors that constitute components of the human develop- ment index. Given the skill-dependence of the technology, a prerequisite for ICT application and use is literacy and education. Poverty is the product of economic processes occurring at a variety of levels \u2013 local,national and internation- al.

To do so, a number of inadequacies need to be addressed. While providing access to informa- tion to the poor is an important step in lifting them out of poverty, identifying the type and relevance of information required in the local context are aspects that have to be considered in providing information to the marginalized. It has been found that a successful ICT concept must encompass relevant information about local and indigenous situations, and must also have suitable ICTs as a tool to deliver the infor- mation effectively to the targeted local, poor communities. In addition, content provided through ICT should not be limited to knowl- edge from outside sources, but extended to draw on knowledge from the local community, especially the poor. Some principles governing the use of ICTs in future poverty alleviation undertakings, thus, suggest themselves: \u25cf technological interventions should be sup- plemented by strong content provision and must be combined with well-planned development programmes \u25cf efforts should be made to coordinate viable ICT for poverty alleviation programmes across agencies in the best spirit of net- working, to ensure proper focus in resource use and synergy in development efforts, and \u25cf the small, spontaneous but fragmented ini- tiatives among private agencies and NGOs should not only be encouraged and facilitated but be mainstreamed and coordinated. These and other practices can make ICTs power- ful tools for poverty reduction by enhancing the capabilities of the poor in education,marketing, management and planning,as well as providing links to a variety of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8734456-3555-44e4-941e-8549b727c62c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8734456-3555-44e4-941e-8549b727c62c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc33409af499335e89097bcc12f8e220404081be40490d3f5550d4f6418c7378"}, "3": {"node_id": "76634bf9-921b-4a29-bb7b-ad037e2449ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b520f32619b1512a2ed766b32cc8cb056b6010ed60403711af6d8b1c07a4deb"}}, "hash": "6d3ed687f1649053d2a682fb2264a7c61a0c5af67291cbacd27dd4754fb31741", "text": "resources such as agricultural information. ICTs and education There is adequate cross-country evidence to suggest that supply-side adjustments can sub- stantially influence educational achievement. This enhances the role of ICT as an enabling device in an area such as education.It can play a role by improving the delivery and administra- tion of educational services and by providing wider access to educational material, while improving the quality of content and pedagogy. Given the ability of ICT to provide access to quality educational resources at low cost over a wide geographical area, it can not only help boost the effort at providing education but can help reach it to the marginalized, irrespective of their location. Above all, it can serve these pur- poses by reducing the cost of provision of edu- cational services as well as improving quality \u2013 two features that may keep children back at school and stem the rising drop-out rates as the Connectivity and hardware availability are only one end of the problem. ICTs require specific skills and that comes in the way of their adoption by underprivileged groups and regions. This could negate the effectiveness of the technology for human development, even when made available, by strengthening the position of economic and political elites vis-\u00e0-vis others 184 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals years of schooling increase. ICT-based distance education has been used to overcome time, space and geographic restrictions, allowing teachers and students to interact and share learning materials. Ongoing efforts to build distance learning platforms need to be strengthened since their benefits in this area are substantial.However,while ICTs can play a significant role in providing a more effec- tive, relevant and flexible mode of learning to the underprivileged,its use calls for a complete- ly new teaching paradigm.This shift in teaching environment needs to be taken into considera- tion before deployment, along with other fac- tors specific to each country.These factors span local infrastructure limitations,localized content availability, cost to install, maintain and scale up ICT based educational programmes, familiarity and the learning curve of the target audience. These factors must relate the technologies being used, socio-cultural aspects such as age, gender and literacy levels, and penetration and perception of technologies among others. Choosing the appropriate ICTs will also demand a thorough understanding of the educational objectives at hand which, in turn, requires com- plete knowledge of the target audience\u2019s goals and aspirations. One objective should be to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of edu- cational administrators, authorities and enablers through the strategic application of ICTs and through ICT-enabled skill develop- ment. The technology can also be used to sup- port teacher training, learning and capacity development, and ICTs can be used to broaden the availability of quality educational materials and resources. It must be noted, however, that while ICTs do offer many beneficial opportunities for educa- tion,they are no substitute for formal schooling. The role of technology is to support primary education,not replace it;though the technology may play a part in meeting the needs of chil- dren or adults who cannot go to a conventional school or class. Access to ICTs enhances tradi- tional or formal education systems, enabling them to adapt to the different learning and training needs of societies. Developing coun- tries need to focus on those technologies that compensate for the factors that are lacking: well-trained teachers and resources to pay for expensive equipment. The task at hand is to concentrate on technological alternatives that, at low cost,bring the imagination and creativity of a few excellent teachers to students. A major constraint is the lack of content for ICT delivery. The development of instructional content-ware remains a neglected area and needs special attention Finally, questions of equity need to be priori- tized. The pressing problem for educational planners is how to quickly reach the majority of the poor, uneducated rural populace, and find out how to fund, implement and maintain the educational part of ICT networks. ICTs and the gender divide It is clear that,throughout the region,a range of measures is required to reduce gender inequal- ity. These could vary from creation of employ- ment opportunities specifically for women and ensuring equal pay for equal work to changing mind-sets and reforming social practices that work against giving women an equal position in the economic, social and political mainstream.

However, as discussed in the Report, given the characteristics of those who find employment in these sectors, the direct effects of such employment on improving the status of the poor can be only marginal.Much of the benefit for the poor would be through the second-order effects of such activity and employment that generate demands for activi- ties undertaken by the disadvantaged. However, the principal effects of ICT on gender equality would be elsewhere. To quote some obvious applications,ICTs can deliver educational and literacy programmes, specifically targeted at poor girls and women, using appropriate tech- nologies in both formal and non-formal educa- tional settings (e.g. public access centres).

Female politi- cal candidates can also win support from voters in this way, employing ICTs in the communica- tion of their political messages to the voters. Perhaps the most significant positive impact of ICTs on women\u2019s empowerment is the enhanced capacity of women\u2019s advocacy and support groups to exchange information, coordinate action, and increase the reach of advocacy cam- paigns. Civil society and activist organizations routinely receive dozens of email containing information on emerging areas of concern. It must be noted that relatively few applications of the technology are planned to achieve gender goals.This results in pre-existing gender inequal- ities determining the differential abilities of men and women to appropriate the technologies. If not addressed, the information revolution will see a continuation or a worsening of gender inequality.This requires purposive action. There should be an allocation of financial resources in the national budget to support strategies to increase women\u2019s participation in the information economy, including funding for NGOs to strengthen opportunities for women\u2019s empowerment through ICTs. In addition, ICT education should be integrated in school curric- ula and be based on gender equality,in order to realize girls\u2019 full participation in science and technology education. Also, relevant distance education and training programmes should be implemented using ICTs, especially for rural women and girls, who are most disadvantaged in gaining access to education.It is thus impera- tive that the State play a proactive role in improving the social and economic environ- ment for females so that they can harness ICT technologies and reap the vast benefits that they afford.

ICTs and health Intervention to ensure improved healthcare must focus on prevention through means such as immunization and the launch of public health campaigns as well as on treatment deliv- ered through a strengthened basic healthcare system.ICTs can help these efforts by improving the effectiveness of health promotion and dis- ease-prevention programmes as well as facili- tating health-service delivery.

One of the Perhaps the most significant positive impact of ICTs on women\u2019s empowerment is the enhanced capacity of women\u2019s advocacy and support groups to exchange information, coordinate action, and increase the reach of advocacy campaigns 186 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals main obstacles to improving public health has always been the lack of awareness, informa- tion and education. In this context, ICTs can play a very powerful role in improving public awareness of healthcare. In particular, ICTs can serve as an important tool in the global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. They offer the feasibility, at a relatively low cost, of providing access to information and knowl- edge to those working on the problem, to those who are suffering from the disease or its effects, and to those who need to take preven- tive action. ICTs can also play a significant role in combating malaria, TB and a host of other infectious diseases, by enhancing the effec- tiveness of health institutions, improving pri- mary healthcare and delivery of health services in rural areas, and also by serving as an advo- cacy tool in raising awareness of prevention and treatment methods. ICTs can be used as a means of information pro- vision and networking aimed at empowering stakeholders and encouraging consultations on policy formulation. It can also support the shar- ing of information among medical practitioners and researchers working in the area. It provides the opportunity for healthcare providers, researchers,and policy makers to engage in dis- cussion through local/global discussion groups and/or Web boards, and, thereby, serve as a good venue for easy sharing and consultation on various health issues. The benefits of applying ICTs in healthcare are constrained by a number of factors common to most poor developing countries. These include large gaps in basic infrastructure availability,the ability and willingness of health workers and others to make use of the opportunities, the availability of relevant and/or localized digital content, government regulations and policies, and its sustainability and scalability. While ICTs can help improve the health status of populations, there are major constraints. These include access to the higher bandwidth,required for transmitting physiological data and complex medical images, as well as high telecommunica- tion costs. Many challenges to the viability of rural ICT projects remain, given the limitations of access to electricity, telephony, Net-connectivity and other basic infrastructure. Except for Malaysia, constraints such as lack of access to telecommunications and high costs have pre- vented the deployment of ICTs on a strategic large-scale level. These constraints are more severe in developing countries like Pakistan,India and Indonesia where even dial-up access via nor- mal telephone lines,let alone broadband,is limit- ed.Many countries lack the basic infrastructure to support use of ICTs.Failure to address these prob- lems would mean that ICTs will not play \u201cmore than a marginal role\u201d. The implementation cost is far too expensive to achieve critical mass for realizing any real impact. Further, the actual impact of ICTs in healthcare actually hinges on the ability and willingness of health administrators to adopt ICTs as a tool. The lack of computer skills has prevented many healthcare professionals from harnessing the potential of ICTs. Inertia and the fear of new technologies have also prevented many from utilizing ICTs. There is under-utilization of even available services in some localities due to socio-cultural and economic barriers. Thailand\u2019s tele-consultation usage was not as high as anticipated, mainly due to rural physicians and city medical specialists being unfamiliar with the system.Also,the very high workload of rural physicians made it difficult and inconvenient to schedule consultation times. Although the diffusion of ICTs in healthcare has had varying successes,its application is still at a primary stage. It is important to focus efforts on educating health professionals on the use of ICTs and providing them with neces- sary connectivity, rather than to the popula- tion at large.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cbc1bd7-fd4a-42d6-87a4-1b3ef943260c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cbc1bd7-fd4a-42d6-87a4-1b3ef943260c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "079bb52097ce4ecaeaa059e5643c6dd5f7c7a96df81eda450aa423231d0fd342"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ee81608-a414-4025-95d6-bfff1bf23b49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "924fd6f2b22a58a351014265cf26233c0c9df9236212acfee30af93ec65567b9"}}, "hash": "af40f62d34f702c3e39b047d4a46aae522c8693b726114a9c7514776320bd8eb", "text": "With proper knowledge and con- nectivity, these professionals will, in turn, spread health benefits and knowledge to a wider group of people.

Despite the immense potential for applying ICTs to better the environment, broadcast media such as radio and television remain the most prevalently used ICTs for the environment in terms of information dissemination and knowl- edge networking. Our discussion suggests that, besides better appreciation and understanding of the current state of the environment, the key challenges to utilizing ICTs for ensuring environ- mental sustainability are as follows: \u25cf ICTs are used mainly for environment mon- itoring and less attention is given to risk and vulnerability analysis \u25cf ICT tools are mainly used by State con- trolled organizations for environmental protection. The roles of NGOs and private organizations in ICT promotion for environ- mental sustainability remains weak \u25cf the shortage of budgets results in ICT meas- ures being focused only on major environ- mental problems, such as disaster monitor- ing, soil erosion, and forest depletion, and \u25cf public awareness remains weak in this area. ICTs and partnerships for development Developing countries need to cope with the process by adapting to ICT in ways that allow them to appropriate ICT benefits and minimize its adverse consequences.The target of MDG 8 is to manage the effects of globalization through a focussed partnership for development. Such a goal-oriented partnership for development can tie multiple stakeholders into joint risk-taking and reward-sharing relationships. Global companies must be persuaded to play an important role in this endeavour. This could start in their own corporate domains, through the application of good practices wherever they operate. International donors and NGOs, with their long track record in supporting develop- ment activities, collating international experi- ences and scaling up small experiments, cannot but be involved in this emerging area. Given the origins of the Internet as a tool for research collaboration,it is not surprising that one area in which partnership based on ICTs has autonomously evolved to a substantial extent is higher education and research. ICT tools have linked worldwide research institutions, and enhanced scientific research and developed part- nerships for innovative projects. Communication between universities and research organizations has increased collaborative efforts between institutions and countries that mutually exchange research ideas, acquire interdiscipli- nary knowledge, solve special technical prob- lems on-site, share public information, compare methodologies and report new achievements. Another set of new global partnerships exist between what are termed variously as global civil society organizations, global social move- ments and GPPNs.These international networks and coalitions can work consensually in develop- ing sustainable policy positions.They have been effective in drawing interest from a wide group of organizations with similar objectives although operating in different local environ- ments. GPPNs are seen to fill the gaps in terms of addressing North-South issues. The use of technology itself generates partner- ships that have larger implications for develop- ment. These are partnerships which by sharing information, views and experiences generate discussion, all undertaken with the help of the technology that helps arrive at international positions, standards and mechanisms on devel- opment, in general, and the use of ICTs for development, in particular. Further, by helping mobilize a constituency for these democratical- ly derived positions,standards and mechanisms it creates international pressures on different actors \u2013 government, civil society organizations and the private sector \u2013 to adopt them. These positions relate not just to the use of ICT for development per se, but to macroeconomic issues such as debt reduction, capital controls, fiscal and monetary policy and sustainable development, to name but a few areas. In general, the impact of ICTs in developing sustainable global partnerships has been pos- itive for many countries.This has strengthened the hope that ICTs have generated in the developing world. Indeed, social and econom- ic development are complex phenomena depending on various factors, and ICTs alone cannot solve the developing world\u2019s prob- lems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d40ec1d9-4b09-42d2-8eb3-96c41881e47b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d40ec1d9-4b09-42d2-8eb3-96c41881e47b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28b5096b005290884d840796b65ca7c0a46b13133ace7b390bdde0fd14be8f52"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d4ab77e-4f93-4ba2-9f70-2764c7c577f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9fea5791571daaac864dfa427b31982a64606abc304af8b647443faa9f6a38c"}}, "hash": "43648dd8c6fcd8e64302e8830511a55f8a64a68a8609ece685a21c1d56f062e6", "text": "However, integration of ICTs into overall national and regional development strategies Despite the immense potential for applying ICTs to better the environment, broadcast media such as radio and television remain the most prevalently used ICTs for the environment", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe8e5aac-7b2b-49ec-a221-50248984f5d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe8e5aac-7b2b-49ec-a221-50248984f5d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5e6f829662ddba222cb71c217f61060ca88e968a0239088f757b720eaf055e8"}, "3": {"node_id": "9df21cd8-483a-49f8-bb8a-0656e13d6048", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97cc1c939e697eccd45104000e46ac2cc1ef0b2ddc3a27f1231b91e9bc0e88eb"}}, "hash": "17588e327fe1cde7366a5dd05975ec73e40770dbb9a0f8a9c99a7d09e6900d31", "text": "188 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals expands the scope and coverage of develop- ment interventions. Global partnerships that ICTs help forge can contribute substantially to realizing that goal. To sum up, in all MDG areas, an effort to raise consciousness with regard to best practices and alternatives and a greater degree of moni- toring are imperative to ensure progress. The role that ICT can play here is obvious. In addi- tion, in specific areas, the technology can directly contribute to the realization of the MDGs, with even greater effect. Assessments of the current use of ICT for development and the potential for harnessing the technology to yield benefits in these areas needs to distin- guish between these general purpose and spe- cific uses,in order to maximize the returns from investment in the area. Further, while ICT opportunities can be identified for each of the MDGs, there is a need to prioritize the goals where ICTs can be demonstrated to have the greatest impact, e.g., education and healthcare as opposed to addressing the hunger reduc- tion goal. There is also a need to prioritize and cost ICT opportunities for a range of implemen- tation modalities, within the context of each of the MDGs.If this is done,even a small effort can go a long way. However, as mentioned earlier, because of inad- equate diffusion of the technology much of the potential of ICT still remains unexploited. The ICTs for human development project is in its early stages. Even if many of the experiments may prove financially unviable and/or unsus- tainable, the experience so far does provide the basis to identify areas in which further progress needs to be made to render the proj- ect successful. This Report has attempted to assess and even quantify the progress of nine Asian countries towards using ICTs for advancing the MDGs.Our examination of the myriad, innovative efforts and experiments to harness the technology for human development purposes establishes that, the limited reach of the technology notwith- standing, use of the technology to help realize the MDGs has progressed substantially and can- not be reversed. However, the same examina- tion does point to numerous inadequacies in designing and implementing projects for the purpose. Overview 1. UNCSTD 1997 2. UNDP 2001 3. UNDP 2004 4. Wang et.al. 2003 5.

Aimags are subdivided into Soums and Soums into Baghs. The capital city is divided into dis- tricts and districts into Horoos. Analogue devices: Analogue devices are those in which continuously variable physical quanti- ties such as electrical potential,fluid pressure,or mechanical motion are represented in a way analogous to the corresponding quantities in the problem to be solved. ARPANET (Advance Research Projects Agency Network): The network that became the basis for the Internet, ARPANET was a large wide-area network created by the United States Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA). Established in 1969, ARPANET served as a testbed for new networking technologies, linking many universities and research centres. It consisted of a number of individual comput- ers connected by leased lines, using a packet- switching scheme. Bagh: Refer Aimags above. Bandwidth: The range of frequencies, expressed in Kilobits per second, that can pass over a given data transmission channel within a frame relay network.The bandwidth determines the rate at which information can be sent through a channel \u2013 the greater the bandwidth, more the information that can be sent in a given amount of time.

Broadband: A transmission facility having a bandwidth sufficient to carry multiple voice, video or data channels simultaneously. Each channel occupies (is modulated to) a different frequency bandwidth on the transmission medium and is demodulated to its original fre- quency at the receiving end. In general, broad- band refers to telecommunication in which a wide band of frequencies is available to transmit information. Because a wide band of frequen- cies is available, information can be multiplexed and sent on many different frequencies or chan- nels within the band concurrently, allowing more information to be transmitted in a given amount of time (much as more lanes on a high- way allow more cars to travel on it at the same time). British Thermal Unit (BTU): 1 BTU equals 1 055.05585 Joules. Caller Party Pays (CPP): CPP is the arrange- ment in which the mobile subscriber does not pay for incoming calls. Instead, the calling party pays for those calls. Digital devices: The versatility of modern infor- mation systems stems from their ability to repre- sent information electronically as digital signals and to manipulate it automatically at exceeding- ly high speeds. Information is stored in binary devices, which are the basic components of dig- ital technology.Because these devices exist only in one of two states, information is represented in them either as the absence or the presence of energy (electric pulse). The two states of binary devices are conveniently designated by the binary digits, or bits, zero (0) and one (1). Digital devices can be broken down into three basic categories: input devices, output devices, and manipulating devices.

Output devices are hardware, which allow those digital 1s and 0s to be con- verted into hardcopy output. Manipulating devices would be the servers, PCs, or any other device which are used to alter the state of those digital 1s and 0s. Digital Signal Processor (DSP): A DSP is a spe- cial-purpose Central Processing Unit that pro- vides ultra-fast instruction sequences, such as shift and add, and multiply and add, which are commonly used in math-intensive signal pro- cessing applications. DSPs are not the same as typical microprocessors though. Micro- processors are typically general purpose devices that run large blocks of software. They are not often called upon for real-time compu- tation and they work at a slower pace, choosing a course of action, then waiting to finish the present job before responding to the next user command. A DSP, on the other hand, is often used as a type of embedded controller or processor that is built into another piece of equipment and is dedicated to a single group of tasks. In this environment, the DSP assists the general purpose host microprocessor. Division by Mean (DM) method: The method of building composite indices of multiple indi- cators. In applying the DM method, the indica- tors are divided by their respective means which permits the coefficients of variation of different indicators to remain different even after making them scale-free and lets these dif- ferences be reflected in the composite index and ranking. The coefficients of variation of the original indicators, thus, become the standard deviations of the scale-free indicators,which are then carried into the component indices. E1 connection: European Digital Signal 1, which is the European standard for digital trans- mission at 2,048 kb/s. Falciparum malaria: The most dangerous type of malaria.Red blood cells infected with the par- asite tend to sludge and form \u201cmicroinfarctions\u201d or small areas of dead tissue due to lack of oxy- gen in capillaries in the brain, liver, adrenal gland, intestinal tract, kidneys, lungs, and other organs. Human Development Index (HDI):The HDI is a summary measure of human development. It measures the average achievements in a coun- try in three basic dimensions of human devel- opment: a long and healthy life, as measured by life expectancy at birth; knowledge, as meas- ured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weight) and the combined primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrolment ratio (with one- third weight);and a decent standard of living,as measured by GDP per capita (PPP US$) Geographical Information System (GIS):GIS is a computer system capable of assembling, stor- ing, manipulating, and displaying geographical- ly referenced information (i.e. spatial data). The system combines database management sys- tem functionality with information about loca- tion. In this way it is able to capture, manage, integrate, manipulate, analyse and display data that is spatially referenced to the earth\u2019s surface. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER): The ratio of total enrolment, regardless of age, to the population of the age group that officially corresponds to the level of education shown. However, what matters is the net enrolment ratio, which is the ratio of the number of children of official school age (as defined by the national education sys- tem) who are enrolled in school to the popula- tion of the corresponding official school age. Haemorrhage: Flow of blood from a ruptured blood vessels. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR): IMR is the annual number of deaths among children younger than one year as a proportion of the annual number of live births.

Khurals: Khurals are local public self-governing assemblies in Mongolia. Local Area Network (LAN): A group of com- puters and other devices in a relatively limited area (such as a single building) that are con- nected by a communications link, which enables any device to interact with any other device on the network. Mandal: An administrative unit between a block and a district in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. Megabit: A megabit is roughly 1 million (pre- cisely 1,048,576) bits. Mbit/s is a unit of meas- urement in digital transmission, indicating the number of megabits transmitted per second. Megahertz (MHz): A measure of signal fre- quency expressing millions of cycles per sec- ond. This unit is typically used to measure the processor speeds of computers. Every com- mand given to a computer (from the keyboard, mouse, software, hardware, etc.) requires a fixed number of MHz to execute.The more MHz avail- able,the faster commands can be executed,and the faster a computer will perform. Microprocessor: A microprocessor is an elec- tronic computer Central Processing Unit (CPU) made from miniaturized transistors and other circuit elements on a single semiconductor inte- grated circuit (IC) or chip. Before the advent of microprocessors, electronic CPUs were made from discrete (separate) TTL integrated circuits; before that, individual transistors; and before that, from vacuum tubes. Moore\u2019s Law: An empirical observation stating, in effect, that at our rate of technological devel- opment and advances in the semiconductor industry, the complexity of integrated circuits doubles every 18 months. It is attributed to Gordon E. Moore (a co-founder of Intel). Moore outlined his \u201claw\u201d in 1965. His original empirical observation was that the number of components on semiconductor chips with lowest per compo- nent cost doubles roughly every 12 months, and he conjectured that the trend will continue for at least 10 years.In 1975,Moore revised his estimate for the expected doubling time, arguing that it was slowing down to about two years. Network Readiness Index (NRI): The NRI seeks to better comprehend the impact of ICT on the competitiveness of nations. It is a composite of three components: the environment for ICT offered by a given country or community; the readiness of the community\u2019s key stakeholders (individuals, businesses, and governments) to use ICT; and finally the usage of ICT amongst these stakeholders). Paan: Chew made of betel leaf wrapped around spices and other ingredients. Packet: The unit of data sent across a network. Packet Switching (network): A communica- tions technique where a message is broken into packets that include address information and are sent to the destination on the fastest routes available; all packets may not take the same route, so the receiving station reassembles the message in proper order before forwarding the complete message to the address. Panchayat: Indian village council,often consist- ing five members. Protocol: A set of formal rules describing how to transmit data, especially across a network. Low level protocols define the electrical and physical standards to be observed, bit- and byte-ordering, and transmission and error detection and correction of the bit stream.High level protocols deal with the data formatting, including the syntax of messages, the terminal to computer dialogue, character sets, sequenc- ing of messages, etc. Principal Component Analysis: A method of analysing multivariate data in order to express their variation in a minimum number of princi- pal components or linear combinations of the original, partially correlated variables. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): A method of measuring the relative purchasing power of dif- ferent countries\u2019currencies over the same types of goods and services. Goods and services may cost more in one country than in another. Therefore, PPP allows us to make more accurate comparisons of standards of living across coun- tries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ef25af8-345a-44cd-8eeb-11ae42381766": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ef25af8-345a-44cd-8eeb-11ae42381766", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca6b090cc7133fb628f1b509d630241941c13af5831ee2670ca82206c6de03e6"}, "2": {"node_id": "34b15200-1802-4fc3-9c22-d6f47cd54a67", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01d9167a48ee316c7f267a29527a91121c2c6d8fd18ab8b62f1779ea0b8e12b6"}}, "hash": "22b3679e5624fff83d805de6fa4d1d83307a9128de79d8045ab34d5d2e770f3a", "text": "PPP estimates use price comparisons of comparable items but since not all items can be matched exactly across countries and time, the estimates are not always \u201crobust\u201d. 200 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals Rai: Land area measure in Thailand.1 rai = 1,600 square metres.
