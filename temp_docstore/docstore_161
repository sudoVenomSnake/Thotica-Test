The following paragraphs present country-specific aspects of the decision making on the capacity of organizations involved in forest issues, in particular of local forests. Armenia The state forestry agency Hayantar is under-resourced (in terms of budget, equipment and qualified personnel). Foresters have a low status and low salaries and receive minimal training. (Junge, Fripp, 2011) The technical capacity of Hayantar is very low at all levels. The agency lacks forestry professionals, particularly in the spheres of management, inventory & cadastre and forest rehabilitation. Despite graduates with forestry education finished university during the last years, in 2000 only 4% of Hayantar\u2019s staff had an educational background in forestry. One reason for the poor human capacity of Hayantar are not transparent recruitment procedures based more on personal connections than on professional qualification. (Gevorgyan, 2009) Under the Ministry of Agriculture a specialized State Forest Monitoring Centre has been established in 2007. It is in charge of monitoring of illegal cuts, monitoring of areas of assigned cuts and general monitoring of forest use, pests and fires. The centre has only monitoring functions, but no law enforcement authority. While this centre is technically well-equipped and capable, Junge, Fripp (2011) found a substantial discrepancy between reported illegal logging and de-facto unauthorized 98 logging, and (given the currently still similar demand and supply situation) this has likely not changed. Currently the annually reported numbers of illegally cut trees or violations provided by Hayantar are even higher than those of State Forest Monitoring Centre (Balyan, CPC Armenia, in lit. 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5940845-92a5-4114-bfd9-69822e91627f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5940845-92a5-4114-bfd9-69822e91627f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76521afcde05e1be0ac593f4747b702e56e048aa27862b4e9fa722d58ae3e6ab"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc0d1472-5faf-4e94-8948-181aeac060b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a94673639b11464ef9dcb49f930d416fe90ace02ddad17f913f118a9e4c857a"}}, "hash": "9279e340ce661176fcab92b88d0945252feba4f1c47efb1e3583601f05648fad", "text": "2016).

However, these local level units for environmental protection do not have decision making authority on the management of the tree and shrub vegetation, and their capacity is therefore of limited relevance. (Case Study Azerbaijan) Belarus The capacity in the forestry sector of Belarus is adequate in terms of staff qualification and technology as well as equipment, infrastructure and finances. The forestry inventory and management planning enterprise \u201cBELGOSLES\u201d is even able to provide its services to forestry enterprises in Russia. The regional state production forestry associations have sufficient staff and are capable to fulfil their functions. The state forestry enterprises and their forestry units are adequately staffed and equipped and have necessary infrastructure (central administration building, forestry unit building, roads, machinery etc.). The certification of the production from 57 state forestry enterprises and 55% of the total forested area in accordance to the FSC requirements and of 98% in accordance to the weaker PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification schemes) system indicates the adequate capacity of the state forestry enterprises and their forestry units. (Case Study Belarus) The region and district level administrations lack the technical capacity to fulfil entirely their substantial decision making mandate. At region level the state production forestry associations are subordinated to the first deputy head of the region, but these administrations do not have a unit of qualified staff. Similarly the district administrations that according to the Forest Code have substantial decision making authority on the forests in their jurisdiction do not have qualified staff for carrying out these functions. Thus all these functions are in fact executed by the state forestry enterprises, which prepare the decisions that are then adopted by the district administrations. This compensation of insufficient capacity in region and district administrations by the capacity of the forestry organization is functioning and some directors of state forestry enterprises are elected deputies of the region council, and conflicts of interest are possible. (Case Study Belarus) Georgia The capacity of forestry organizations declined over the years since the independence of Georgia. Staff numbers were cut several times. The NFA does not have own capacity to do forest inventory and management planning but contracts external private companies for this purpose. The capacity of the departments of the central level of the NFA is barely sufficient to fulfil its current tasks. (Case Study Georgia) 99 With the assignment of long-term concessions and the intended hand over of local forests to the municipalities the capacity of the NFA at local level was reduced to the bare minimum. Usually the NFA in its local forestry units has one head and ten to 15 forest rangers. These local representations are not economic units or enterprises and they do neither have own income nor budget, but belong to the regional forestry services and the NFA makes all management decisions centrally. The capacity of these forestry units is just sufficient for issuing the fuel wood cutting permits, assigning of locations for cuts and some very limited control of the forest areas and of the compliance by the concessionaires. These forestry units do not have the capacity to implement planting activities or any other forestry works. Very few of the employees in the local forestry units have an educational background in forestry. (Case Study Georgia) The National Forest Concept of Georgia recognized the insufficient capacity of the state forestry agencies and provides for a substantial capacity development of state forestry organizations with local units that would implement all practical forest management activities. Further, university and college education programs are now starting to educate qualified young staff for the intended development of the forestry organizations. (Case Study Georgia) The capacity in the two communes already managing forests is still weak. In the Ecology and Green Spaces Department of the City Hall of Tbilisi the capacity is only sufficient for some general oversight and planning of their forests, but it has neither any inspection staff for control on the ground (forest rangers) nor an own workforce for forestry. All works are contracted through tender. The municipality has a separate inspection unit that is independent from the Ecology and Ecology and Green Spaces Department and in some extent assists in control and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4d9fa01-2f24-4190-8bf5-d05fb46b73c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4d9fa01-2f24-4190-8bf5-d05fb46b73c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c931a9a4ff7b6f554a5f255de373e68418e66a78254f2f379c83dd94d3f6cc9"}}, "hash": "8c931a9a4ff7b6f554a5f255de373e68418e66a78254f2f379c83dd94d3f6cc9", "text": "law enforcement. The capacity of the administration of Tusheti Protected Landscape under the Municipality of Akhmeta, which is in charge of the forests of this PA, is still under development. It has a very knowledgeable Head of Administration and an educated Natural Resources Specialist that would be leading all forestry related works. The administration owned one UAZ 4x4 vehicle. (Case Study Georgia) Other municipalities do not yet have any staff with even minimum capacity to lead and manage forestry related activities. Some municipality representatives suggested that in case of transfer of forests to the municipalities the local offices of the NFA with the respective staff might as well be taken over by the municipalities or alternatively municipalities would become able to hire qualified staff. Some municipality administrations already have elaborated concepts how to develop their capacity for communal forest management. (Case Study Georgia) The MENRP refers to the lack of capacity at municipal level when arguing against the handover of forests of local importance, while its own NFA itself currently does not have sufficient capacity for effective forest management. Thus the argument of insufficient capacity of the municipalities appears in some extent as political pretext and is possibly caused by reluctance in the MENRP and NFA to devolve authority to the local level and by competition for possible state funding for capacity development in forestry and for forest management. Moldova The capacity of Moldsilva and its subunits seems appropriate. Its enterprise ICAS has the capacity to do all FMP according to the required standards. Moldsilva is also able to provide certain services to the municipalities, in addition to its functions in the forests under its own management. The marking of cutting areas in communal forests is done for free by Moldsilva, in accordance to applicable regulations and out of the interest in the quality (accuracy) of the work. Further, Moldsilva is doing planting and maintenance of young plantations on communal forest lands in case of availability of project funding. (Case Study Moldova) 100 The capacity of most municipalities to manage their forests is low. A municipality with four forestry staff employed and seasonal labour to manage its communal forests is rather an exception among the forest owning municipalities in Moldova. Most communal forests are of low area size and the majority of communal forests consist of artificial forest plantations of low productivity. Thus, the incomes earned by most of these municipalities are too small for financing an own forest management unit. Moldsilva would be ready to take over the management or even ownership of these forests. Some municipalities for creating the needed capacity plan to establish a joint forestry enterprise that would manage the forests of several municipalities or consider the establishment of communal enterprises for integrating forest management with other communal tasks. (Case Study Moldova) Russia The capacity of the federal state forestry agency Rosleskhoz has been substantially reduced with the delegation of forest management functions to the Federal Subjects in accordance to the new Forest Code from 2006. Staff numbers, funding etc. of the federal forestry agency were cut, the federal forest protection service with its aerial fire protection was abolished. Despite the transfer of state budget funding through subsidies for the forest management by Federal Subjects their capacity in particular organizational and technical capacity remained insufficient for effective forest management and protection against fire and illegal logging. Almost no exchange of information and experience takes place between Federal Subjects. With the abolishment of the federal forest protection, the forests are no longer patrolled by forest rangers, and the much reduced number of staff of the forestry units and forest parks is overloaded with other tasks, and not able to protect the forests and to detect and extinguish fires before they spread. In the current system economically viable state forestry enterprises that would be able to implement costly forest management activities in the interest of the public, including fire prevention and firefighting do not any longer exist. Short-term contracting of forestry works to external enterprises, lack of mandatory direct use of incomes from forest use for forest regeneration, maintenance and protection, and insufficient federal funding are limiting factors for the development of capacity to implement forest regeneration, maintenance and protection. The expectation that leaseholders have the capacity to implement these works did not materialize because only a part of the forests (20% in 2010) are leased, most leaseholders remain in a state of decay and do not have the capacity to replace the state forestry enterprises. (\u0428\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0446 et al., 2010) All reorganizations in the forest sector (five between 2005 and 2015) reduced the capacity of forestry", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dd4d2b2-dd79-4107-9d7e-b4d707c5dc3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dd4d2b2-dd79-4107-9d7e-b4d707c5dc3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6c864fec7e7622d89bbcbf4298cc125b8b084f01159d3ea5155791a4af8578e"}, "3": {"node_id": "868c6ac9-2257-44f7-a31f-cbd518c50085", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65fb635d361bcc623c0471bff14a7ac919341d9ff42296d1407d3f1c387e8acb"}}, "hash": "f2829bcc445201182bea22a9cc1df49680606c99e3e3b4ad6385e04637531273", "text": "organizations, in particular the personnel numbers. A typical example is the Bitsevsk forest (\u0411\u0438\u0442\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0441) with an area of 2,200 ha. Its administration does not have any longer workforce, drivers and most of the forestry experts left. The Zagorsk state forestry enterprise (\u0417\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0437) in Moscow region in the past consisted of ten forestry units with each about 40 staff - forest rangers, workers and tractor drivers that were able to react quickly on any forest fire. After 2006 the former state forestry enterprises were downgraded to forestry units and their staff has been reduced from e.g. formerly 500 to 5, usually one forester and few rangers. These are totally overloaded with paper work on planning and reporting and hardly spend any time in the forests.75 This problem seems typical for the entire federal forestry system. The about 12,000 staff of all forestry units and forest parks of Russia spend about 75% of their working time for paper work on planning and reporting, thus having an effective capacity equivalent to only 3,000 staff for real forest control and protection (\u0428\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0446 et al., 2010). 75http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/experience/226787-woodman 101 The level of qualification and knowledge of many forestry experts is considered very low, including of those teaching in colleges and forestry schools, and in the result also of the graduates from these schools (Anonymous, 2014)76. Ukraine The capacities of the SFRA and its state region forest administrations as well as their state forestry enterprises have not been specifically assessed in the frame of this Regional Study and of the Case Study on Ukraine. The fact that forests managed by the state forestry enterprises are larger and less fragmented and have higher timber volumes and better qualities, together with anecdotal information from stakeholders, suggest that their financial situation and accordingly their capacities are better than those of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. The forest inventory and planning agency of the SFRA, Ukrderzhlisproekt, meets the main capacity needs in terms of financing, available technology and equipment as well as qualification of staff. The FMP is one-sided focussed on wood harvest; there are deficiencies in public participation in the process; and socio-economic, environmental and nature conservation aspects are insufficiently considered. The reasons might either be in the approach and guidelines determined by the SFRA and/or in the capacity of the staff of Ukrderzhlisproekt. Zhyla et al. (2014) reported that the majority of interviewed representatives of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises assessed the financial and personnel capacity of their enterprises as insufficient. Close to 40% of the interviewed representatives assessed their own knowledge of the legal and regulatory framework as not sufficient for fulfilling their duties. However, the Consultant found that the capacity of the visited \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises in terms of financial situation, staff and equipment seemed adequate. (Case Study Ukraine) The region forestry enterprises can provide certain services and make use of the economy of scale by purchasing equipment or employing specialized experts in the staff that would be beyond the financial opportunities of district forestry enterprises. The capacity to involve local people and other stakeholders of \u201ccommunal\u201d as well as state forestry enterprises is rather low. Most forestry staff has an attitude of considering local people more as potential offenders and public participation as an undue interference in their own sphere. FSC certification requirements have helped to develop knowledge of and interest in stakeholder participation and involvement of local communities. The local councils (rural, district and region) not always have members or staff with the expertise that would be necessary to make decisions or provide opinions on forest related issues. Most of the representatives of councils owning \u201ccommunal\u201d forest enterprises interviewed by Zhyla et al. (2014) assessed their own knowledge as only low or medium. Some of the councils have members that are at the same time leading staff of the forest enterprise, thus representing technical expertise in the council while bringing in conflict of interest.

These environmental inspections can also be authorized to implement law enforcement in regard to the state forestry enterprises, e.g. in Armenia, Belarus and Moldova. In Ukraine the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises have only limited law enforcement authority and therefore have to rely on the State Environmental Inspection. Forest users have only limited law enforcement authority but have to rely on assistance by authorized state organs in case of encounter of illegal use by third parties. In Georgia concessionaires and in Russia leaseholders are supposed to protect their forests against illegal use, but in the reality this protection by users is insufficient for replacing the loss of law enforcement caused by the massive reduction of state forest protection staff. Where local communities feel that local forests are owned by them, through municipalities or \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises, they can actively contribute to law enforcement. Such a situation is reportedly found in few communes in Moldova. Even where forests belong to the state local people can assist in law enforcement, as e.g. in Armenia, where violations of forestry regulations are reported through a special hotline and recently joint public and state monitoring of illegal forest use has been established77 and forces the agencies in charge of law enforcement to persecute more effectively illegal and unaccounted tree cutting. Neither the available documentation nor interviewed stakeholders mentioned financial rewards for forest rangers and other enforcement personnel for the capture of illegal forest users. The applicable penalties for offences against the forest legislation are determined by other legislation, usually the code on administrative legal violations and possibly the criminal code as well as bylaws. Administrative fines can either be issued by the authorized state forestry staff or by the environmental inspection. Criminal punishment is issued by courts based on the criminal code of the respective country. Legislation normally distinguishes between the penalty for legal violation and the compensation of damage caused by the violation, which is established in the environmental legislation. Law enforcement effectiveness is very high in Belarus where illegal or informally accepted unauthorized logging are impossible because of the tough control of the State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President. In contrast, in Armenia during the last years as much as 85% or more of all consumed wood is illegally harvested, mostly informally accepted but unaccounted by the involved authorities (Junge, Fripp, 2011). Similarly in Ukraine unaccounted and informally tolerated by forestry authorities wood harvest under the disguise of legal harvest happens. In Moldova the estimated consumption of fuel wood is nearly three times the official harvest, suggesting substantial illegal cuttings. Also in Russia law enforcement is of limited effectiveness. In particular in the Far East, large quantities of timber are illegally harvested and largely exported. In Georgia large scale illegal or unaccounted logging does not seem to be an issue, but violations occur in smaller scale. Restrictions on regular cutting of trees can cause forest users, e.g. in Azerbaijan (Dieterich, Baku State University, pers. comm. 2014/2015), to deliberately damage trees for justifying of sanitary cuts. 77https://www.iucn.org/fr/nouvelles_homepage/nouvelles_par_theme/forets_news/?20205/Not-in-Our-Forest 103 Table 16.

Ukraine State forestry enterprises, State Environmental Inspection. \u201cCommunal\u201d forestry enterprises rely on State Environmental Inspection; decrease of violations in \u201ccommunal\u201d forests because of consolidated user- rights and improved collaboration. The following paragraphs present country-specific aspects of the law enforcement in forestry, with the focus on local forests where differences to forests in general can be found. Armenia In Armenia forest law enforcement is a task of the State Environmental Inspection and its Forest Control Division (one of six divisions in the central structure) with 15 staff and its divisions in the regions (Marz) with in total 250 staff. The Forest Control Division annually inspects each local branch of Hayantar and controls the compliance of forest use with the FMP and the annual implementation plans. (Gevorgyan, 2009) 104 The State Environmental Inspection under the Ministry of Nature Protection is responsible for control of both state forests (managed by Hayantar) and protected areas (managed by the Bio-resources Management Agency under the Ministry of Nature Protection) (Gevorgyan, 2009). While in relation to Hayantar the State Environmental Inspection carries out an external control function, in relation to the protected areas due to the inspection\u2019s subordination under the same ministry the control is rather internal. According to Vardanyan (NGO representative, pers. comm. 2015) this only internal control is one reason for the comparably higher level of violations in the protected areas compared to state forests. Law enforcement effectiveness in Armenia\u2019s forestry sector is generally low. The fuel wood demand and consumption are in an order of magnitude larger than the official harvest and limited import and non-forest fuel wood sources make illegal or unauthorized and unaccounted harvest the main source of supply to meet this demand. The annually detected illegal cut (In 2009 officially recorded illegal timber sale was just 2,287 trees) is negligible compared to the real illegal harvest. Illegal cuts by local villagers make up the smaller share of all illegal cuts because their access can be rather effectively prevented by Hayantar and its harvest brigades. The recently opened opportunity for households in villages close to forests to collect fallen wood in determined amounts per households may have reduced the need for illegal harvest by those people. The brigades contracted and authorized by Hayantar for legal harvest are responsible for the majority of illegal cuts by cutting several times more wood than indicated in the permits and accounted for. As this unaccounted harvest occurs with the knowledge of forestry and other authorities, including the State Environmental Inspection and the traffic police, law enforcement is effectively not possible without fundamental changes in the political and economic system in the forest sector and beyond. (Junge, Fripp, 2010) The State Forest Monitoring Centre under the Ministry of Agriculture contributes to law enforcement by detecting illegal logging by remote sensing and determination of the situation on the ground. It would provide the information to the Ministry of Nature Protection (forests in PA) or Hayantar (other forest) and these would have to initiate the investigation and persecution and to report on the steps undertaken. The State Forest Monitoring Centre does not detect the enormous illegal cuttings either because of political and other non-technical reasons and/or because of the largely remote sensing based monitoring, the resolution of which might be insufficient for the detection of selective illegal cutting without clear cuts. The website and hotline of the State Forest Monitoring Centre can be used for reporting of violations by citizens. The Armenian Forests Public Monitoring78, a joint monitoring by the civil society and the state was recently established with support by ENPI-FLEG II. This joint monitoring of illegal cuttings by communities, the broader public and the State Forest Monitoring Centre in collaboration with Hayantar is already contributing to a higher effectiveness of law enforcement.79 Azerbaijan The law enforcement in the forests of the forest fund is in the responsibility of the state forestry enterprises. There are reportedly not many reported violations in the state forests. The main problem of the state forestry enterprise is livestock grazing, hindering the natural rejuvenation of trees in easy accessible areas (Case Study Azerbaijan). The opportunity to fell trees in the frame of sanitary cuts motivates local people, groups involved in fuel wood trade and/or possibly forestry staff to damage trees deliberately for later harvest under the disguise of sanitary cuts. Even in some protected areas a large proportion of trees are damaged for this reason.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2adbbd2-f623-4294-9e8d-04bce14969de": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2adbbd2-f623-4294-9e8d-04bce14969de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5df1492bb8723aff5bc46111ad8948a8f98f51630608a14e2af38a4c82a84ee2"}, "2": {"node_id": "dfed74e0-eeeb-43d4-b90a-f3e57255cb7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d1762cb482f0f7c97832b556d9027dc25cd86cc3126bd2202f63712d4423d02"}}, "hash": "8080126dea629ef9752d8e05e7eb80e5ec9d9c42b2966f4fe9fabfde235b9f18", "text": "Even in some protected areas a large proportion of trees are damaged for this reason.

In case of unauthorized cutting of trees outside of forests of state forestry enterprises the District Department for Ecology would issue a protocol, the state forestry enterprise would assess the damage and confiscate the wood. The case would be brought to the court that would decide about the penalty. (Case Study Azerbaijan) Belarus The prevention of violations and enforcement of the forest legislation is the task of the State Forest Protection which is formed by the rangers and technical staff of all state forestry organizations, including the state forestry enterprises, the six region state production forestry associations and the Ministry of Forestry. About 13,000 official persons are patrolling the forest areas. (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015) An additional and important law enforcement agency is the State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President with its local branches. This inspection service carries out independent law enforcement and controls the forest users, including the state forestry enterprises (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015). After the independence of Belarus poaching and illegal forest use by influential people were hard to address by state forestry organizations. The establishment of an independent inspection service with direct highest level subordination proofed as highly effective. In collaboration with the state forestry enterprises it almost entirely eradicated illegal harvest of forest products and poaching. (Case Study Belarus) The level of documented illegal harvest of timber in the range of 0.004% of the total timber harvest and its impact on the country\u2019s forests must be considered as insignificant. (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015) The state forestry enterprises install gates, automatic cameras and warning signs to prevent unauthorized vehicle access to forests and related fire risk and pollution with trash. The number of detected violations is an (at least unofficial) indicator of the effectiveness of the State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President. With the success of the law enforcement the inspections cannot meet the expectations of constant or increasing numbers of detected violations. Probably for this reason, the inspection service tends to apply rules in an overly rigid and inappropriate way and tightens the control of the activities of the state forestry enterprises. Even minor technical aberrations from plans and permits are now considered as violations and lead to fines and the imposing of very high compensation payments on the involved workers. In the result of such cases state forestry enterprises increasingly face difficulties to attract local people as workers, as people consider the danger very high to be heavily fined for minor mistakes. (Case Study Belarus) Georgia Illegal wood harvest mainly concerns fuel wood that is cut by small groups of local people who sell it to the local population. Also sometimes local households would cut higher amounts than indicated in their fuel wood harvest permits and consume or sell the surplus. (Case Study Georgia) The forest rangers of the local NFA offices/forestry units are in charge of law enforcement. They control forest use and issue penalties for unauthorized use. However by their number and due to limited budgets, these NFA forest rangers are insufficient for protection of all forests. The concessionaires are also obliged to implement own protection activities. In the reality this is not or only partly done. In some concession areas local people feel alienated by the concessionaires, as 106 they have insufficient access to wood for their own needs, and are thus motivated to steal wood, while the NFA has insufficient capacity to prevent this illegal use. This conflict has led some communities to oppose perceived illegitimate activities by concessionaires in forests that are in the possession of the NFA, but may as well qualify as \u201cforests of local importance\u201d. (Case Study Georgia) Additionally the Agency for Protected Areas (APA) in PA territories and the Environmental Supervision department of the MENRP have law enforcement functions. In Tbilisi municipality the department in charge of the communal forests does not have any law enforcement staff and relies on the municipality\u2019s environmental inspection. In Tusheti Protected Landscape illegal forest use was common until 2012. Since the establishment of the administration under the local municipality and the takeover of forests into communal management legal access to wood and the work of local forest rangers ended the illegal cuttings.

(Case Study Georgia) Moldova The level of violations of forest regulations, in particular illegal cuts, is considered by all stakeholders as low, but relevant. The total consumption of fuelwood in 2010 had been estimated at just below 1.1 Mio m\u00b3 per year, more than 2.5 times the official harvest. The scale of the imbalance indicates significant volumes of illegal harvesting (Mitchell et al., 2015). In forests in attractive locations obvious violations of the rules on lease of forests can be seen in form of erected permanent housing with massive fundaments. Enforcement of law seems weak at least in cases where the violators are wealthy and/or influential. (Case Study Moldova) In communal forests noncompliance with established rules, like unauthorized cutting of trees and the destruction of reforestation/afforestation sites by grazing cattle, by the local population is common where the municipality lacks the financial means for implementing the necessary law enforcement activities and at the same time in the community does not feel a sense of collective ownership and does not expect legitimate benefits from the forests. Wherever possible, municipalities collaborate with Moldsilva in law enforcement. Few communes in Moldova have a tradition of community forestry and possess productive forests that benefit the local population. In such communes the inhabitants have an attitude of ownership, and they would participate in \u201ccollective guarding\u201d of their forests, actively preventing illegal cutting. (Case Study Moldova) The State Ecological Inspection, the subdivision of the Ministry of Environment responsible for law enforcement, in the first place enforces the compliance with laws and regulations by the forest owners and managers. However, the interviewed stakeholders also stated that this inspection is not sufficiently undertaking (hinting on corruption) law enforcement in supporting communities against illegal forest use by nonlocals. (Case Study Moldova) Russia The absence in Russia\u2019s legislation of forest protection, and the existence of only supervision and control, is one reason for the practical lack of prevention and early detection of violations of the forest regulations. In the past the forest protection, supervision and control were combined with the forest management and use within the state forestry enterprises and the higher level forestry agency. Policy makers considered this combination of functions as a problem and as potentially 107 encouraging unauthorized and unaccounted forest use. With the handover of all functions to the Federal Subjects this combined system de-facto continues to exist at the region level. Russian NGO had suggested to keep the functions of protection, supervision and control in the federal forestry agency and to delegate only those authorities to the regions that are related to the use of forests.80 These suggestions have not been implemented and the federal forest protection was abolished in the course of the reforms after the adoption of the new Forest Code 2006. Further, the term \u201cillegal cutting\u201d is not defined in the Forest Code, which makes its prevention and persecution difficult. According to recommendations of a parliamentary hearing in 201081 the forest supervision and control organs do not have the authority to control natural persons in the forests, but are only authorized to check on the compliance with the legislation of the activities of enterprises or entrepreneurs on their leased forest sections, which in 2010 made up only 15% of the forest lands. In some regions now this share is much higher and reached e.g. in February 2015 in Leningrad region 90%82. The effectiveness of the supervision and control of the compliance of these leaseholders and also in what extent they are able to prevent illegal use by third parties would deserve additional analysis. This situation means that law enforcement in Russia\u2019s forests is virtually inexistent in large areas. The forest dependency study (ENPI-FLEG II, 2014b) confirms this for some of the studied areas in the Russian Far East. The studied village Mukhen in Lazo district of Khabarovsk Kray was an important centre of processing of logged timber during Soviet times and immediately after. \u201cNow the wood processing plant is abolished, and the wood is exported by illegal, mainly, Chinese companies.\u201d The proportion of illegally exported timber from the Russian Far East is extremely high. In 2012, officially a little more than 30 Mio m\u00b3 of timber were exported from Russia to China, while, according to experts, about 24 Mio m\u00b3 were exported illegally83.

One reason might be the generally lower availability of commercially interesting wood resources in \u201ccommunal\u201d forests, compared to state forests. In some communes, where \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises actively interact with rural councils and the population, local people develop a sense of ownership and the work of the district forestry enterprise becomes more accepted, although some violations may still happen. (Case Study Ukraine) Zhyla et al. (2014) reported that the long undetermined legal status and ownership of these forests caused abuse of power by rural councils and unauthorized forest use by local people.

This limited law enforcement authority of staff of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises requires the involvement of the State Environmental Inspection in case of detection of violations. This limitation of the mandate of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises reduces law enforcement effectiveness and undermines generally the authority of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry institutions. Component 3.3 Administration of forest and land ownership and user rights The documentation of land-use designations, ownership and permanent land-use rights in the programme countries is kept in the land-use agencies. These are national level agencies that have branch offices at each territorial level, at least down to the districts, but often also in the sub-districts. These branch offices keep land-use maps that are accessible for the public and any stakeholders. These maps are in most cases still on paper and present simple schematic maps with reference to landmarks, where existing, but without topographic reference. Electronic, georeferenced maps exist in the documentation of the forest inventory and management planning in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine and in some extent in Russia and Georgia. These electronic, GIS-based maps only cover the designated forest areas, including forests of \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises and municipalities if recently covered by FMP. The forest enterprises and forestry units have these maps on paper, and where the technical capacity exists (most forestry enterprises in Belarus and Moldova, some in Ukraine, Russia and Georgia) they are also available electronically to them, in advanced form on handheld devices with GPS allowing for identification of land-use boundaries in the field. Reportedly in all programme countries boundaries of lands of state forestry enterprises and forestry units are well documented and ownership or permanent user rights are certified. The ownership and user rights of Moldova\u2019s municipalities on their communal forests as well as in the two municipalities with communal forests in Georgia (Tbilisi and Akhmeta) are well documented.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06949ae6-13fc-4b8d-8b6f-f2bb1cb43a58": {"__data__": {"id_": "06949ae6-13fc-4b8d-8b6f-f2bb1cb43a58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4e98867fef38e46206447ca76f6bb650180af41bff54092b0a6a2dce9dbcff7"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec874db6-e8f7-4e8f-9d88-c646e5e60678", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45c9bd31e2748efc69802dc56b3139d04d03fd3fa1d60cde836b9bf250580a58"}}, "hash": "3bf2bd37de4348de0a88e37581b4efcb28390d2b7412666c4931952f7b787570", "text": "In all other municipalities in Georgia so far the \u201cforests of local importance\u201d that would fall under management and/or ownership of the municipality are not defined.

In the Russian Federation the documentation on forest lease is kept at the level of the Federal Subjects and their districts. Ownership rights on agricultural lands that have been distributed between members of former collective farms are not in all cases properly documented. In Ukraine the documentation of privatized shares of kolkhoz lands often stated only the area size and the general land section, but not the exact location of the privatized land plot. Where these lands were of low value they staid 109 abandoned for decades and forest developed there naturally. The unresolved ownership documentation prevented reclamation of the land by the owner, but also possible changes of the land designation category to forest. In Georgia abandoned agricultural lands with forest development by natural succession have been incorporated into the forest fund. Where owners of such land have proper documentation they can re-establish their ownership and user rights in a simple administrative procedure. Table 17. Overview of issues of the administration of land and forest ownership rights COUNTRY KEY ISSUES Belarus Documentation in process of being updated, registration renewed and new certificates issued. Georgia Documentation largely outdated and incomplete; need to re-identify all forest borders, in particular of former kolkhoz forests and other forests of local importance; documentation of concession boundaries not available to municipalities. Moldova Boundaries of communal forests well documented; leased plots documented by municipalities. Russia In the Russian Federation the documentation on forest lease is kept at the level of the Federal Subjects and their districts. Ukraine \u201cCommunal\u201d forest lands were supposed to be formalized as permanent land-use of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprise by 1.1.2014, but large areas formalization process still ongoing; succession areas on abandoned agricultural lands not inventoried, ownership not fully determined and not included into the forest fund, hindering sustainable management. The following paragraphs present specific aspects of administration of ownership and user rights in some of the programme countries. Belarus The administration of forest and land ownership and user rights is in the authority of the land-use agencies at different levels, mainly at district level. BELGOSLES is in the process of updating the registration of all forest fund lands with their borders and size of areas for subsequent land registration and issuing of new state certificates to the state forestry enterprises as possessors of state forest. (Case Study Belarus) Georgia Forest land ownership and historic kolkhoz forest lands as well as boundaries of municipalities and their sub-units are often poorly documented. Maps sometimes do not exist or are outdated land-use schemes from Soviet times without geographic references. The NFA does not have clear knowledge about the categories of all forest sections; there is no complete land cadaster on forest lands and all boundaries would need to be re-identified. Sometimes the land-use maps from the 1980s defining the boundaries between major land-users (that time agricultural units \u201csovkhozes\u201d, \u201ckolkhozes\u201d and forestry enterprises \u201cleskhozes\u201d) are still used as references to identify the actual current land-users. Most agricultural land-users\u2019 areas, as far as not privatized, became the land units of municipalities. The former kolkhoz forests together with the leskhoz areas became the State Forest Fund managed currently by the NFA. Neither detailed documentation of the boundaries of former kolkhoz forests nor updated maps of the forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d are available. (Case Study Georgia) Documentation of the boundaries of assigned concessions is probably kept in the MENRP, in the NFA and/or in some other state agency, but is not available to the municipalities. (Case Study 110 Georgia) Moldova The municipalities have proper documentation (land-use maps) of the forest areas assigned to them. One of the reasons why Moldsilva keeps the right of marking forest for cuttings is the checking the borders of communal towards state forest. Leased plots of communal forests are documented by the municipalities. (Case Study Moldova) Ukraine The issue of delimitation of lands in state and \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership has not been solved entirely. New legislation in 2013 determined that lands, on which objects in permanent land-use by \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises are located, are considered as being in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership, including lands of the forest fund.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54c359a7-2108-4c29-8971-c37fed89e920": {"__data__": {"id_": "54c359a7-2108-4c29-8971-c37fed89e920", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bed70939be83145519f091acd22a275e3239c67153e466a78988f5b8981340e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7eee66d-2a27-458c-8b36-36df00b41907", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c678f1e544f7cc8ec3bec71116ff5a629c24759ed27b7437a03b67c76cceecf8"}}, "hash": "824e30f4ab8853c00871a580f7a5c22f0789b96d5ea1cb69e8aaed4e09bfa937", "text": "By this law the \u201ccommunal\u201d administration were obliged to formalize until 1.1.2014 the permanent land-use rights of the \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises.

The certification of forest land ownership of local councils and \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises is ongoing but still not yet completed. (Case Study Ukraine) One reason for the development of natural forest succession on abandoned agricultural areas was the lack of plot specific documentation of privatized individual shares of former kolkhoz lands. During the recent years the certification of these parcels as individual property progressed and is still ongoing. An inventory of actually forested lands and their formal inclusion into the forest fund, where appropriate, would allow of the inclusion of such areas into sustainable forest management, possibly in private, \u201ccommunal\u201d or state ownership. Component 3.4 Cooperation and coordination The extent and adequacy of coordination and cooperation between national forest agencies, forest enterprises and local administrations on local forest-related activities and the extent to which other government agencies coordinate and cooperate with forest agencies and local administrations concerning local forests are very difficult to assess. The available documents, reports and stakeholder statements provided only anecdotal information. A comparison between the programme countries is therefore difficult. Generally, cooperation and coordination can be required by formal procedures, where subordinations between organizations or decision making mechanisms force them to cooperate. Also informal cooperation takes place in the programme countries, often depending on the personal initiative of involved agencies\u2019 staff and other stakeholders. Within the system of state forests the coordination between national level forestry agencies, their region branches and local state forestry enterprises or local branch offices is determined by internal regulations and procedures. In the Russian Federation the delegation of functions from the federal level to the Federal Subjects may have increased the need for coordination, contributing to the reported overload of forestry staff with paperwork on planning and reporting. The cooperation and coordination of forest sector agencies of different levels with local administrations in the regions is formalized where reporting requirements and subordination exist, e.g. at region level in Belarus and the Russian Federation. Where the local forestry enterprises and region offices of the forestry agency are only reporting to their central national level head office, e.g. in Georgia, their cooperation 111 and coordination with region and local bodies depend more on the individual initiative of the officials involved. Cooperation and coordination of state forestry agencies with forest managing municipalities (Moldova, Georgia) or with \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises (Ukraine) are usually determined by the formal regulations and procedures in place, but also depend on personal initiative. In Moldova and Ukraine state forestry agencies have to be involved in a number of decision making procedures, forcing the establishment of cooperation and coordination. In addition, the state forestry agency Moldsilva directly assists the municipalities in Moldova in some forestry activities. In Georgia the NFA has no formal influence on the management of the communal forests of Tbilisi, but cooperates in a limited extent with the communal administration of the Tusheti Protected Landscape. Cooperation and collaboration between forestry enterprises and local administrations and self- governance bodies vary between the countries. In Ukraine forestry enterprises, independent of their ownership type, have limited coordination with rural councils. Compared to the state forestry enterprises\u2019 cooperation, the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises might cooperate slightly better with the rural councils, in particular where FSC certification required establishing at least some coordination. Coordination and cooperation between \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises and districts are limited, while the region councils and administrations as owners of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are intensively involved with them. In Belarus the district councils have some decision making mandates on the forests and their management and accordingly intensive cooperation takes place. Collaboration and coordination between the forestry agencies and other agencies concerns mostly the agencies in charge of environmental protection and protected areas and law enforcement organs. In the Russian Federation forestry agencies of the Federal Subjects collaborate with the firefighting services of these regions and with the firefighting brigades of the Ministry for Emergency Situations in the combatting of large forest fires.

Russia Collaboration in combatting large forest fires with fire brigades of regions and of the Ministry for Emergency Situations; Region inter-agency commissions for coordination and collaboration e.g. on control of timber trade; Regions established public councils for coordination. Ukraine Cooperation of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises in law enforcement required. The following paragraphs present specific aspects of cooperation and coordination in some of the programme countries. Armenia The State Forest Monitoring Centre under the Ministry of Agriculture cooperates with Hayantar (under the same ministry) and with the Ministry of Nature Protection and its Bio-resources Management Agency and State Environmental Inspection. The Monitoring Centre informs these agencies about detected illegal cuts and other facts. The Monitoring Centre is under the oversight of a board of directors representing most ministries, the vice prime minister, and NGOs, and reports annually to this board. Each agency reports as well to the Monitoring Centre about detected illegal cuts and conditions of forests, number of trees and volumes harvested. The two Ministers of Nature Protection and Agriculture have issued a joint order on the regulation of harvest, transportation and sale of timber. Hayantar does not have established mechanisms for cooperation and coordination with local communes, but informally such collaboration takes place, in particular in the context of the implementation of externally funded forestry projects involving local communities (Vardanyan, NGO representative, pers. comm. 2015; Michel, 2014). Petrosyan (Hayantar, pers. comm., 2015) mentioned the failure of all projects aiming at the development of community-based forest 113 management and Michel (2014) observed limited consideration of local interests by Hayantar. This anecdotal information suggests that coordination and cooperation between Hayantar and local communities is not yet effective enough for development of community commitment and of acceptance of local people\u2019s interests by Hayantar. Azerbaijan Anecdotal information suggests that collaboration between the state forestry enterprises and the local administrations as well as land-users managing lands with tree and shrub vegetation is limited. The collaboration of an agricultural cooperative (kolkhoz) managing such lands with the District Department for Ecology seemed partly difficult. This kolkhoz collaborates with the police in law enforcement. (Case Study Azerbaijan) Belarus Cooperation is well developed at region level between the region councils and administrations and the state production forestry associations of the Ministry of Forestry. Locally state forestry enterprises cooperate well with the respective district administrations and rural councils.

Their local representations/forestry units of the NFA contact the municipalities only in case of special needs, but do not involve them in any forest management decision.

This cooperation is facilitated through various projects. 114 Coordination and cooperation include local state forestry enterprises, the national level as well as the inventory and planning enterprise ICAS, which all have direct contacts with the forest owning municipalities. (Case Study Moldova) Russia In the Russian Federation the transfer of responsibility for forest management to the Federal Subjects requires their cooperation with the federal level forestry agency Rosleskhoz and their territorial subunits in the seven federal districts (Rus. federalnyy okrug \u2013 \u0444\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433), six of which cover several Federal Subjects each and one Moscow region only. Some regions have established inter-agency commissions for coordination and collaboration on specific subjects, e.g. in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) a commission on control of illegal trade in timber. Further, some regions have established public councils under their forestry agency. In the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) such council has been established in 2014 consisting of nominated representatives of non- commercial non-governmental organizations, private and state enterprises and of the forestry department of the Republic. Ukraine The mandates of different agencies, enterprises, representative and administrative bodies in relation to \u201ccommunal\u201d forests require cooperation and coordination. These seem to work well between the district and region forestry enterprises, between the latter and the region councils as well as between \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises and the region state forest administrations and the State Environmental Inspection. In contrast, cooperation and coordination are virtually not existent between \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises and district councils and administrations and between forestry enterprises of different ownership. The cooperation and coordination of state and \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises with the rural councils seem to be insufficiently developed, mainly because of the subordination of all forestry enterprises to a higher administrative level and because of the lack of formal mechanisms of cooperation and coordination of the forestry enterprises with the rural councils. In this situation the determining factor of cooperation and communication is the relationship between the individual heads and staff of the rural councils and of the local district forestry enterprises as well as of the state forestry enterprises. (Case Study Ukraine) Component 3.5 Measures to address corruption and ensure transparency The measures to address corruption and ensure transparency in the programme countries are part of the general anti-corruption policy, legislation and action in those countries. Rarely anti-corruption is specifically targeted in the forest sector and more specifically in the context of local forests. The formal existence of anti-corruption and transparency policies, legislation and even specialized agencies does not necessarily correspond with the effective combat of corruption and not necessarily ensure transparency. Anti-corruption measures often just add another layer of corruption if this corresponds with the political and economic environment and is in the interests of involved elites. Often mechanisms to ensure transparency can be circumvented and accordingly have limited impact as can be seen in scandals exposed by journalists on procurement of public services or recruitment by government agencies in countries with a generally low corruption level or by international organizations with high transparency standards. On the other hand, overly sophisticated procedures can add unnecessary administrative burden and impose additional costs while failing to achieve the intended transparency. The general situation in terms of corruption and transparency varies between the programme countries. The anti-corruption measures implemented in Georgia after the Revolution of Roses in 115 2003 succeeded in leading to the widespread disappearance of corrupt practices. In Ukraine since the Maidan Revolution 2013/2014 attempts are made to address corruption and improve transparency.

On the other end Moldova, Armenia, Russia and Azerbaijan have a high level of corruption affecting all spheres of politics, economy and society. Belarus with its comparably harsh law enforcement and tight control seems to have less corruption problems than these countries, but transparency is similarly affected by the priority of political loyalty and connection with the ruling elites over other objective criteria in recruitment and tender processes. The scores and rankings of the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International84 show this picture for 2014 (from least perceived corruption to highest): Georgia \u2013 Scores 52, Rank 50/175; Armenia \u2013 37, 94/175; Moldova \u2013 35, 103/175; Belarus \u2013 31, 119/175; Azerbaijan \u2013 29, 126/175; Russia \u2013 27, 136/175; Ukraine \u2013 26, 142/175. This ranking differs from the Consultant\u2019s impressions by assigning better ranks to Armenia and Moldova and the less favourite rank to Belarus than suggested by the Consultant\u2019s observations. The Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International is an important resource for companies that need to carry out risk assessment under the EU Timber Regulation or other legal frameworks. It is also an important indicator used in the FSC Controlled Wood system and in the PEFC chain of custody requirements for avoiding controversial sources.85 The FSC and PEFC certifications do not provide any additional information on the implementation of anti-corruption measures and their effectiveness in the certified forestry enterprises. An additional problem is associated with the transparency of the certification itself. \u201cThe certifying bodies (assessors) are paid by the companies wanting to get certified. It is in the assessors\u2019 interest not to get a reputation for being too \u201cdifficult\u201d, otherwise they will not be hired in future. This is a clear conflict of interest.\u201d86 In the forest sector the existence, effectiveness and independence of governmental oversight mechanisms external to the forest agencies as reflected in their mandates (Component 1.4) can influence on corruption and transparency in some extent. Independent oversight is in place in some of the programme countries in form of the mandate to control the compliance of the forest sector with the legislation being assigned to the ministries in charge of environmental protection (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Ukraine) and to their state environmental inspections. In Belarus such an inspection, independent of the forest sector and directly subordinated to the President, has proven being highly effective, although in some extent now overreaching. In Moldova the establishment of another separate forestry inspection is considered as the state environmental inspection does not effectively prevent illegal logging. In Georgia the NFA is under the MENRP and thus the control is not entirely institutionally separated. In the Russian Federation the federal state forestry agency is independent of the Federal Subjects to which most forest management tasks are delegated, but no effective control of compliance with forestry regulations externally to the forest sector exists. In all programme countries the forest sector is additionally subject of control by the state agencies that control compliance with public procurement rules, public spending and taxes. The separation of functions and external oversight are often expected to reduce corruption risks and provide more transparency. Where planning (e.g. determining of allowable cut), implementation (e.g. cutting operation) and control and law enforcement (e.g. inspection service) are concentrated within one system or agency, the risks of manipulation, unsustainable and illegal use tend to be higher, than where these mandates are separated. However, corrupt systems can also evolve across agencies and sectors and having more actors involved may not necessarily prevent corrupt and illegal practices, but may just increase the costs and losses they cause. For instance, in Armenia, 84https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results 85http://www.nepcon.net/newsroom/corruption-index-latvia-turkey-and-malaysia-move-above-controlled-wood- threshold 86http://fsc-watch.com/2014/06/01/the-10-worst-things-about-the-forest-stewardship-council/ 116 Moldova and Russia the large unaccounted and illegally harvested amounts of wood are only possible with the involvement of different agencies, the forestry agencies, environmental inspections, traffic police and in case of exports (Russia) the customs and border guards, which all seem to profit more from these activities than they would from enforcing the law. While an independent oversight can contribute to the reduction of corruption and ensure more transparency, an overly strict separation of functions can also cause risks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1eed4e2-f53b-4397-8735-3c9ed490994b": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1eed4e2-f53b-4397-8735-3c9ed490994b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "497416c6d7b1eb81ce7f7c3c3492537d5e27a9d6398e63705c49d7fc93dbb1c0"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c2077e9-f6c4-4f93-b64f-eb532c245172", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46acf9e245f9de980305ec86f499e4c5e791816a8a9503497668fe8b1f9e0e4b"}}, "hash": "0b783ccafe49a516baa1e722fb6ab6905e054e06ef992a3b804fae2be8a4071a", "text": "The agency approving the allowable cuts should ideally not be economically benefiting from the harvest.

In Belarus, despite the proven high effectiveness of the existing independent inspection, policy makers now consider a further separation of the functions of state forestry enterprises in forest regeneration and maintenance from their functions in harvest and initial processing of wood, by establishing separate units for these functions. Similar considerations are made in other countries. In Belarus, Russia and Georgia sale of standing timber, temporary lease for logging and concessions already exist. Such systems do create additional opportunities for corruption and not transparent assignment of use contracts. Further, they disconnect the links between harvest and forest management or between profitable and costly operations. These disconnections may create disincentives for sustainable forest management and ecosystem friendly harvest practices. Forestry enterprises procure services where they do not have the workforce to implement all forestry works themselves and where forests are not leased to leaseholders or concessionaires, which are supposed to implement the forestry activities. Planting material is often procured from external nurseries, except in Armenia, where only Hayantar runs forest tree nurseries. Also machinery and equipment has to be purchased. In all programme countries procedures are in place, which should formally ensure that these goods and services are procured by the public forest sector in a transparent manner and no corruption is involved. The effectiveness of these procedures is hard to assess in the context of this Study, but only limited anecdotal information suggests the existence of some problems. On the other hand, the absence of such information may not necessarily indicate the effectiveness of these procedures. In some programme countries, like Armenia and Moldova, a massive discrepancy between supply of wood and market demand suggests illegal logging in a substantial scale, and at the same time, harvest of trees is a monopoly of the state forestry enterprises and their contractors. In such a situation it is very likely that first, these forestry enterprises and their contractors are directly involved in the unaccounted logging, and second, that recruitment into key positions controlling this informal business and contracting of brigades or companies doing harvest, transportation and resale, are influenced by corruption and do not comply with transparency requirements. On the other hand, procurement rules can also increase costs of operations and hamper the use of local workforce and small enterprises for the provision of forestry services. For instance, in Georgia according to procurement procedures companies contracted for providing of forestry services or planting materials have to fulfil high requirements, e.g. in terms of years of operation, turnover etc., which effectively exclude small scale local businesses and individuals while at the same time increasing the costs for the public. Local forests in the wider sense might be less under risk of corrupt and not transparent practices. 117 They are often of lower attractiveness for larger logging operations in terms of possible harvest amounts and assortments. Further, there is the possibility of more public control by the inhabitants of nearby located towns and villages. On the other hand, local people, depending on fuel wood and timber, might be forced to pay informally to local foresters or forest rangers for getting access to these resources. Difficult procedures for official access, as e.g. in Russia87, tend to increase the risk of this type of corruption. Harvest quotas for local people reduce this corruption risk if they are issued in a simple procedure, as recently introduced in Armenia for the collection of fallen wood by villagers of close-to-forest villages. In those countries where local forests are managed by the municipalities (Moldova, possibly evolving in Georgia) or by \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises (Ukraine) the measures to address corruption and to ensure transparency may partly differ from those in place in the state forests. In Moldova and Ukraine the state forestry agencies, their region branches and/or their local state forestry enterprises have certain mandates on local forests as well. These mandates can provide more transparency, in particular though an independent approval of wood harvest. But on the other hand these agencies themselves are economically involved in forestry and are in fact competitors with municipalities and \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. This situation certainly bears a high risk of conflict of interest. The municipalities and \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises can locally be under more public control where local people and communities identify themselves as forest owners, and thus corruption risks can be reduced informally. In some communes in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine such sense of possessorship is developing.

Overview of corruption issues and measures to ensure transparency COUNTRY KEY ISSUES EXAMPLES OF MEASURES Armenia Discrepancy between legal wood supply and demand \u2013 large amounts of unaccounted harvest and related corruption. Legal access to fallen dead wood for local villagers; joint monitoring of forest use by State Forest Monitoring Centre, Hayantar, civil society and citizens. Belarus Formerly poaching by influential people, illegal logging; combination of planning, silvicultural activities, permitting and wood production in one organization has been criticized. Tight control by State Inspection under the President; legal access to wood for local people; intended separation of silvicultural functions from production functions - possibly unintended impacts. Georgia Generally effective ant-corruption policy; assignments of concessions in the past not entirely transparent. Phasing out of concessions, no new assignments. Moldova Discrepancy between legal wood supply and demand \u2013 large amounts of unaccounted harvest and related corruption; misuse of forest lease for private housing and business. No specific measures reported; in communal forests low corruption risk due to low harvest potential and social control. Russia Risks of misuse of federal subsidies for forestry at region level; high illegal harvest and export of timber; conversion of forests for private housing by elites. No specific measures and/ or low effectiveness. Ukraine Reports about conversion of forests for private housing and illegal logging; low local ownership and social control of local/\u201ccommunal\u201d forests; informal employment of forest workers. Ongoing reform process addresses corruption, but effect not yet clear; in some \u201ccommunal\u201d forests development of sense of possessorship and social control facilitated by FSC certification. 87http://forestforum.ru/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=16200 118 The following paragraphs present some more specific aspects of corruption and measures to address it and to ensure transparency in some of the programme countries. Armenia Junge, Fripp (2011) found that the forest sector in Armenia is characterized by pervasive corruption. The state owned forests and their resources are exploited for the private income of officials and entrepreneurs. Police and state environmental inspection collect bribes from the brigades transporting the unaccounted fuel wood. Because the AAC is so far below the demand for fuelwood, it is impossible for Hayantar to register the real amounts of wood sold. Therefore, corruption through under-invoicing will be inevitable as long as demand outweighs supply. The annually lost state revenue in fuelwood alone is estimated being the equivalent of between USD 7.2 Mio and USD 21.8 Mio. Added to this is an unknown quantity of high quality wood for domestic processing and export. Hayantar assigns the logging rights to brigades, which would in excess to the permitted amounts harvest large unaccounted volumes of wood. These rights to cut and sell trees are allocated without a fair selection process, and it can be assumed that the brigades (have to) share their gains with the officials who grant them access. Most activities in the forest sector occupy a grey area between legal and illegal, formal and informal. Illegal and corrupt activities often depend on the existence of legitimate rules (like the setting of an AAC) and institutions. The political and economic environment makes the implementation of effective measures to prevent corruption in the forestry sector very difficult. The assignment of limited rights of using fallen dry wood as fuelwood by villages close to forests may have led to a modest reduction of corruption. The assignment of more user rights, management and control of local forests to the communities living close to these forests and having vital interests in their sustainable use may actually reduce the opportunities for unaccounted harvest by commercial brigades using corruption. However, it is likely that those powerful structures profiting from the current situation are effectively preventing the transfer of power to the local level. The negative attitude found in Hayantar towards communal or community forestry (Michel, pers. observations 2014 and 2015) might be caused by such motivations and not only by negative experiences with pilot projects on community forestry. Further, it is possible that the specific challenges that caused these pilot projects to fail, in particular the insufficient economic viability and low motivation of local communities were caused by the limited access to wood. These reasons likely have not been properly addressed, possibly because of limited interest in successful projects of community forest management.

The recently started (ENPI-FLEG II-supported) joint monitoring of illegal logging by communities, civil society organization, the State Forest Monitoring Centre and Hayantar88 substantially counters this risk due to its institutional cooperation and transparency. Engaging the public in the monitoring of its forests can make forest management and activities more transparent and - if combined with legal access to fuel wood - generate a direct interest within local communities in protecting the forests, which support their livelihoods and wellbeing. This can substantially reduce the opportunities for unaccounted cutting and other illegal forest use tolerated by corrupt officials. 88https://www.iucn.org/fr/nouvelles_homepage/nouvelles_par_theme/forets_news/?20205/Not-in-Our-Forest 119 Belarus The below median ranking by Transparency International (score 31, rank 119/175)89 does not fully correspond with statements of stakeholders interviewed by the Consultant, including representatives of forestry organizations, the CPC as well as occasional people not related to the sector, which all stated about low corruption levels and effectiveness of anti-corruption measures initiated by the government. The results of the analysis of the elements of governance related to legal framework, mandates of organizations, planning, decision making, harvest, processing and marketing of forest products and control and law enforcement suggest that there are currently limited opportunities for corruption in the forest sector and in particular in the context of harvest and sale of timber and other wood products. The Consultant could not find confirmation of the concern about substantial corruption potential provided by the combination of functions of allocation of forest resources to users and state control of protection and use of forests on one side and on the other side of being the immediate forest user within the state forestry enterprises. The forest inventory and management planning by BELGOSLES, which is independent from the state forestry enterprises, the decision making on timber harvest and the rules on timber marketing in combination with the independent strict control by the entirely independent State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President seem to be largely effective in the prevention of corruption related to timber harvest. (Case Study Belarus) Georgia Georgia during the last decade has very effectively eradicated corruption, and this is reflected in the forestry sector as well. Not a single stakeholder reported any cases of bribery for access to fuel wood and timber at local level. One municipality representative mentioned that access to illegal fuel wood had been provided by NFA staff for gaining local political support. This seemed to refer to the past, but may possibly as well indicate a return of previous corrupt practices. However, the lack of transparency about the concession contracts provides reason for concern that violations might have happened when the concessions were assigned. The current policy is to let the concessions phase out and not to assign new concessions. (Case Study Georgia) Moldova The mentioned obvious and long lasting violations of regulations in form of erection of buildings with massive fundaments in leased forests and the high unaccounted and illegal wood harvest indicate a significant level of corruption. In the communal forests, however, no obvious risks for substantial corruption are visible. This is partly caused by their comparably lower attractiveness for timber harvest and the higher level of local control. The risk of provision of undue benefits in form of cheap fuelwood or of selective purchase of services from certain inhabitants might be low due to the peer pressure and social control in the communes. (Case Study Moldova) Russia The system by which the Federal Government supports the Subjects of the Federation with subventions for the implementation of functions delegated to the regional level does not sufficiently require accounting for the achievement of the final results. It is also not transparent. Both factors establish the fundament for possible corruption.

(Case Study Ukraine) 6. Conclusions \u2013 Impact of Governance of Local Forests An assessment of governance of forests is largely about processes, but what finally determines the quality of these processes is the impact they cause. The pillars and components of the governance framework analyse elements of governance of local forests, which finally contribute to the situation in the local forests and in the communities depending on these forests. Assessing these impacts and attributing them to the quality of the governance systems in the respective countries, or even to specific features of the elements that constitute these government systems, is very challenging. A full evidence based assessment is therefore not possible in the frame of this Regional Study. In the following sections the Consultant attempts drawing some conclusions from the findings on the elements of governance, the observations and reported situation in terms of trends of forest cover and its conditions as well as benefits for the society from the forests. These conclusions highlight specific issues where an impact of the actual governance is obvious or likely. 6.1 Impacts of governance of local forests on forest cover and forest conditions Changes in forest cover can either be assessed from official reports or from studies using remote sensing. Both methods have their inherent challenges and their results cannot be directly compared. Officially reported changes in forest cover are based on the forest definitions applied in the respective countries. These definitions vary and do not always include forests, woodlands and shelterbelts outside of the borders of the state forest fund, and accordingly such forests in the broader sense are not covered by the statistics. However, such areas can make up substantial parts of \u201clocal forests\u201d, e.g. in Azerbaijan, Moldova and Ukraine. Remote sensing based assessments are suitable for detecting real changes in forest cover independent of formal definitions. These methods, on the other hand, cannot distinguish between temporary loss of forest cover because of logging 90https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results 121 and permanent loss of forest cover because of transformation of forests into agricultural, urban and other land-use types. Also gain of forest cover through reforestation or natural regeneration of formerly logged areas, afforestation or natural succession on formerly not forested areas cannot be distinguished from each other. Further, data are not always available for the same time period for all programme countries. In some cases forest gain and forest loss cannot be compared against each other for methodical reasons, thus not allowing for the determination of net losses or net gains of forest cover.91 Local forests are difficult to define and the definition applied in this Regional Study is too vague to allow for clipping the available data on forest cover with the borders of local forests to measure the specific trends in local forests. Remote sensing analysis has shown substantial changes in the forest cover of some of the programme countries. Between 1985 and 2012 Moldova experienced a net gain of forest cover of 28.9% and Russia of 4.0%92 (Potapov et al., 2015). Similarly an analysis of a stratified random sample of 12 Landsat footprints showed an increase in forest cover in the temperate zone of European Russia of 4.5% between 1985 and 2010, but the changes in forested area varied over time: a decline in forest area between 1990 and 1995 (-1%) was followed by an increase in overall forest area, possibly caused in part by forest regrowth on abandoned farmlands (Baumann et al., 2012). The conditions of forests can change over time due to human influence. The harvest of trees changes the age structure, volumes and other features of forests. The type of cutting, i.e. selective single tree, group, clear cutting, shelter wood etc., influence on the vertical and horizontal structure and species composition of forests. Reforestation and afforestation create stands of single age classes and of more or less autochthonous or exotic origin, depending on the choice of planting material.

Overview of key findings on impacts of governance on forest coverage and conditions COUNTRY TRENDS OF FOREST COVER TREND OF FOREST CONDITIONS KEY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS Armenia Decline of forested area from 11.6 % of total land area in 1990 to 9.4% in 2005; recent years - annual tree cover loss significantly reduced; local gains in areas close to villages. Degradation of forests, selective cutting of valuable trees, reduced standing volumes and increment of forest stands; livestock largely hinders regeneration. Unaccounted logging because of discrepancy between AAC and demand; inadequate financial mechanisms; corruption; failed attempts of community-forestry development. Azerbaijan Forest cover 1 Mio ha or 11.8% of the country\u2019s area; loss of tree cover since 2000, decline of annual tree cover loss. Gradual degradation, livestock grazing, deliberate damaging of trees for \u201csanitary\u201d cutting, new afforestation \u2013 mainly exotic species plantations. Gas supply reduced fuel demand; discrepancy between supply and demand due to use restrictions; lack of incentives for sustainable forest management. 91http://www.globalforestwatch.org/country/AZE 92http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=86221based on (Potapov et al., 2015) 122 Belarus Continuous increase, since WWII almost doubled; afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands. Dominance of even-aged young forests changes slowly towards mixed and older forest. Governance supportive to increase of forest cover and improvement of forest conditions; considered functional separation may challenge positive trends. Georgia 1992 to 2007 increase; after 2007 deforestation in some areas because of illegal logging. Degradation because of unsustainable use; selective cutting of large trees; lack of systematic silvicultural activity. Weak state forestry organizations; insufficient control of concessions; pending status of \u201cforests of local importance\u201d; insufficient forest inventory data and FMP coverage. Moldova Slight increase over the recent years and further increase is planned. Decrease in standing volumes and reduction of species in demand caused by unaccounted logging; poor conditions of communal forests due to their origin and limited economic potential. Afforestation largely on communal lands, possibly hampered by need of land designation change; discrepancy between supply and demand; restrictive use policy; insufficient incentives for sustainable management. Russia Slight increase since 1995; tree cover loss 2000-2014 much higher than gain; probably negative trend. Degradation caused by unsustainable logging (partly illegal), poor regeneration, large scale forest fires. Negative impacts of reform following new Forest Code; abolishment of federal forest protection; insufficient control and law enforcement; status of former kolkhoz forests not fully determined. Ukraine Stable, increase by succession on abandoned lands, but loss due to reclamation. \u201cCommunal\u201d forests poorer conditions than state forests, due to their origin and past use; shelterbelts degrading. Succession on abandoned lands not included in forest fund; \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises economically disadvantaged by lower harvest potential; insufficient sense of local ownership. The dynamics of forest cover of local forests as well as the trends in the condition of forests vary between the programme countries and between regions within the countries. In the following paragraphs general trends and typical examples are presented. Armenia In Armenia local forests are not formally differentiated from the overall state forest fund. Reportedly during the years of crisis and economic blockade in the 1990s illegal logging for meeting immediate needs of the rural and urban populations heavily affected the forests and likely local, easily accessible forests suffered more than remote forested areas. This pressure caused both deforestation and degradation. The forested area declined from 11.6 % of total land area in 1990 to 9.4% in 2005 (The World Bank, 2007). During recent years the situation has changed and Global 123 Forest Watch data93 show that annual \u201ctree cover loss\u201d has been significantly reduced in 2013 and 2014 compared to the decade before. Reforestation and afforestation projects in areas close to villages have led to gains in forest cover in those areas, while illegal and unaccounted logging shifted towards remoter but still accessible forests with higher wood volumes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04f02986-921d-4d52-bab5-c955f99e4efb": {"__data__": {"id_": "04f02986-921d-4d52-bab5-c955f99e4efb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8dbab87052f2f5a38409ed9820dcc3c5a490f96e2f5f9eddbc5363576408cc52"}, "2": {"node_id": "34759ee2-610f-42fc-9954-8a554e6e3463", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1de0767c91086a2025c1f4f4e591945077f4dbf058c6a4ce932da6a3085297ba"}}, "hash": "8a3fb41e020bbff9337ea2537507bc11d1295fe9946c29dbf7759090bd4a9a3f", "text": "In some areas also reduction of livestock numbers, of livestock mobility and abandonment of agricultural lands may have contributed to some local increase in forest cover but leading to stands of poor timber quality (Petrosyan, pers. comm. 2015).

Unregulated selective cutting reduces the resilience and negatively affects the functionality of the forest ecosystems. The negative trends in forest cover and forest conditions can be partly attributed to several governance problems. The ongoing unaccounted logging has one reason in the discrepancy between supply (restricted by the artificially low set AAC) and demand in fuel wood and timber. This situation creates a large incentive for illegal cutting. At the same time, Hayantar contracts logging brigades, which harvest much larger amounts than permitted, tolerated by different authorities in a corrupt system. In some forest areas thinning and maintenance cutting operations could provide more fuel wood than currently harvested and at the same time provide positive silvicultural effects (Michel, own observations 2014). However, hesitations by Hayantar to cut more trees officially and the market preference for larger dimensions so far limit the use of this opportunity to increase supply. Setting the AAC in accordance to the natural potential of the forests would increase the supply and reduce the incentives for unaccounted logging. The change of legislation allowing for easier access of households in close-to-forest villages to fallen dry wood already contributes to a reduction of the unregulated harvest pressure. So far any attempts to develop community-based forest management have failed, despite the legal framework provides the options of both communal forest ownership and communal management of state owned forests. The reasons for this lack of success of management of local forests by local people seem to lie in the framework conditions set by Hayantar (Petrosyan, pers. comm. 2015): communes were forced to set up a special organization with a director and other staff being paid salaries; no harvest of trees was possible (or permitted) in the assigned forest areas, only NWFP; and it seems the forest areas were neither transferred into ownership nor were they assigned in long-term use (ten years would have been possible but for the pilot shorter terms were applied). In the result salaries consumed all funding and the limited income achieved, local people did not develop any ownership and interest in long-term results, and livestock grazing and insufficient maintenance hampered the success of afforestation activities due to short-term assignment and lack of tangible benefits from the forest stands. This limited available information shows how economically not viable organizational requirements and inadequate user-rights and use potentials caused the failure of an approach that is possible by the legal framework, has been successful in many countries and should lead to an increase of forest cover and improved forest conditions. One could imagine that integrating the responsibility for forest management within the existing rural local self-governance structures and reliance on unpaid work for the sake of current small and future increasing direct benefits from the forest, long-term user rights, assignment of areas with at least 93Hansen, M.

Newly planted forests have largely plantation character, composed of exotic tree species and sometimes depending on irrigation. These plantations do not contribute to the increase of the area of forests as ecosystems. The policy of the government favours the establishment of such plantations in semi-arid and arid areas. Belarus In Belarus the forest cover is continuously increasing. Since the historical low after World War II the area covered by forests has almost doubled and this trend is continuing. The former kolkhoz forests are completely integrated in the state forests. The forest cover increases due to afforestation and natural succession on abandoned agricultural lands of low productivity. (Case Study Belarus) This increase of forest in some areas occurs on the expense of meadows and drained peatlands which are valuable ecosystems in themselves. From the perspective of carbon sequestration and ecosystem conservation the rehabilitation of the hydrological system of drained peatlands should be preferred instead of afforestation or natural succession towards forests. In Belarus both situations can be found and the current state forestry policy favours afforestation, but a recently passed national peatland strategy may indicate a change of policy towards higher valuation of peatlands and their restoration96. The forests of Belarus in a large extent are even aged forests that are dominated by young and middle age stands younger than 70 years; and mature and over-mature stands are less represented than in continuously sustainably managed forests. The dominance of even-aged forests of younger age was mainly caused by the deforestation during and after World War II and subsequent reforestation, but also by the forest management system with mainly clear cuts and artificial reforestation. A more balanced age structure is aimed for and is currently developing. Clear cuts still dominate the harvest, but other approaches are increasingly applied, which allow for a more continuous forest use and the development of mixed age stands. (Case Study Belarus) 94http://www.fao.org/forestry/39774-0e03f4576d53ec8aeeba6da1d02f63922.pdf 95http://www.globalforestwatch.org/country/AZE 96 http://bahna.land/2016/01/05/strategija-sohranenija-bolot/ 125 The current governance of the forests of Belarus thus seems to be supportive to the continuation and further development of forest cover, ecologically and economically satisfactory forest conditions and a sustainable forest management. Currently considered changes in the governance system are aiming at the separation of the wood production functions of the state forestry enterprises from all other silvicultural activities. Such a separation of genuinely connected functions may challenge the positive trends and lead to a higher dominance of clear cuts, more even aged forests, less natural rejuvenation and a more industrial forest structure. Georgia Forests cover about 40% of Georgia\u2019s territory, i.e. approx. 27,800 km\u00b2, and 95-95% of the forests are of natural origin. Between 1992 and 2007 the forest cover increased due to natural succession on small abandoned fields and pastures, but at the same time forests degraded because of unsustainable use. Illegal logging after 2007 caused significant deforestation in some areas. Commercial logging is restricted to concessions and during the last years a number of concessions have been cancelled. Further, some concessions seem to use not the entire allowable cuts due to market demand fluctuations. The general lack of transparency on the concessions, including on exact assigned areas, forest conditions and impacts, makes an assessment difficult, but must be considered as an indicator of poor governance. (Case Study Georgia) While systematic forest management in state forests outside of the concessions does not take place, local households use fuel wood based on permits and a use quota. This fuel wood use contributes to a degradation of forests because of harvest amounts above the increment and selective cutting of preferred tree species of large dimensions (DFS 2007, DFS et al. 2008, Case Study Georgia). Forests at the edge of pasture areas are affected by livestock that hinders natural regeneration or impacts on its quality and composition. Reasons for this degradation of forest conditions can be found in elements of governance like inappropriate regulation, lack of technical requirements, and the still not decided possessorship on forests of local importance and the resulting insufficient incentives for their sustainable management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da648361-88b8-4a7c-9b34-9b10f2fc90f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "da648361-88b8-4a7c-9b34-9b10f2fc90f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "797757785d7c3ef5861cb5dadcf18c793c3e95d720b526c15a16fffae9a2f944"}, "2": {"node_id": "46802ac3-114e-4aa3-81f5-ea35aba6b3c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9dd8c286390e12723fb7f54a3ad1a2ef632f04e9599850570109df452cd218d0"}}, "hash": "5a99319aca97f6f72025fd356486ead34610a61b233879f1de3eb95e8676547a", "text": "The possibility that municipalities manage forests of local importance, including but not limited to the former kolkhoz forests, is legally provided since 2005.

At the same time the capacity of local representations/forestry units of the NFA is insufficient to implement any effective forest management. So far only two municipalities manage their local forests entirely or in parts. In the case of the City of Tbilisi the forests have been declared as \u201cgreen plantations\u201d, and they are now outside of the control of the national environmental and forestry authorities. These forests consist largely of artificial pine plantations that are in poor health conditions due to drought events and maintenance backlog. Financial limitations and political pressure by the broad public have hindered the implementation of necessary silvicultural measures for the transformation of these stands into more resilient and more natural, mixed, deciduous forests. (Case Study Georgia; Michel, 2014) The second example of communally managed forests is the forest of Tusheti Protected Landscape, which is managed by the administration of this protected area under the municipality of Akhmeta. These forests are in good condition and cover a stable area due to their difficult accessibility and the low intensity use by the local population. The transfer into communal management has led to more effective management and regulated legal use. (Case Study Georgia) 126 Moldova The forest cover of Moldova has slightly increased over the recent years and further increase is planned by the government. The areas assigned to the state forestry agency Moldsilva are all covered by forests except areas where regeneration is going on. For this reason the expansion of the forest cover has to take place largely on communal lands and can potentially lead to an increase of the area of communal forests. This process might be hindered by perceived or real formal difficulties to change the designation of agricultural land for the purpose of afforestation. A large gap between official harvest and market demand for fuel wood and timber suggests high amounts of illegal or unaccounted cuts, which prevent an improvement of forest conditions and may locally lead to a decrease in standing volumes and reduction of those tree species that are in high demand. The formal restrictions on harvest of trees, allowing only maintenance and sanitary cuttings, and the low set AAC may contribute to this situation. Higher official cuts for main use may allow for a more sustainable use of the forests if implemented in accordance to principles of close- to-nature forestry and combined with effective law enforcement. The lease of forests is only possible for recreational purposes, while cutting of wood is not possible and exclusive use of NWFP only in special cases. This limits the incentives for private participation in the sustainable management of forests. Under the current framework lease of forests is more often than not leading to conversion of forests into semi-urban developed areas for private housing, restaurants and similar objects, causing in attractive areas substantial loss and degradation of forests. In some municipalities communal ownership of forests has allowed for the expansion of forest cover and for the maintenance of existing forests in good condition. These impacts have been possible where forest areas of sufficient size and sustainable harvest potential provided the needed income to the municipality and benefits for the local community. The management of the majority of communal forests is challenged by their small size and for historical reasons low quality of the stands, thus providing limited incentives for investments into their expansion and improvement by the municipalities and local people. The lack of suitable mechanisms for involvement of local users and provision of incentives to them, in particular restrictions on use of trees and on exclusive access to NWFP, are further limiting factors. Russia The extent of the forest cover in Russia has slightly increased since 1995, probably due to development of trees and shrubs on abandoned agricultural lands (Baumann et al. 2012). However, Global Forest Watch indicates a \u201ctree cover loss (2001-2014)\u201d of 41 Mio ha which is about 5% of the \u201ctree cover (2000)\u201d and much higher than the \u201ctree cover gain (2001-2012)\u201d97. Despite these three figures for methodical reasons should not be directly compared against each other, they indicate probably a negative trend of the forest cover in Russia. The results of the reform of the entire governance system of Russia\u2019s forests in the context of the adoption of the new Forest Code in 2006 have negatively impacted on the extent and even more on the conditions of the forests in Russia. The abolishment of the federal forest protection service is thought to be one of the reasons for the disastrous forest fires destroying forests in a previously unprecedented scale in 2010 in western Russia and in 2015", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae895cfc-f931-495e-8ea1-daa3257e41a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae895cfc-f931-495e-8ea1-daa3257e41a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e128e30708919fff31825470cac1f81156eaf82b907637f4fcf4f391d6e55ff"}, "3": {"node_id": "6fc7c98a-a454-4723-adf0-3fd2acee1c0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ddee6a09a21f8a8540d99af062786430222ec24f9308a477b3564dfd1cfd19f9"}}, "hash": "a914a20b55b6f19e4f5d07ac01e52ab66b3a9f6922339001cc081b851b018b5a", "text": "in the Baikal region. The burned forests in the latter area may not entirely regenerate because the forests in this region exist at the natural border between forests and steppe. There ongoing climate change and the fires have made the site conditions largely unsuitable for rejuvenation of trees (Edom, pers. comm. 201598). Illegal logging in a large scale in the Russian Far East, but also in other parts of Russia, causes degradation of forest 97http://www.globalforestwatch.org/country/RUS 98http://forest.ru/articles/nemetskiy-uchenyy-frank-edom-o-posledstviyakh-pozharov-v-pribaykale/ 127 conditions. In many areas in Russia unsustainable logging and poor silvicultural regeneration have caused the replacement of highly valued trees by stands of pioneer species that only in the course of long-term succession will again develop into the climax forest. The delegation of most forest use and regeneration to temporary users and leaseholders is very likely contributing to continuing unsustainable use and management of forests and consequently to a decrease of forest cover and conditions. Local forests in the sense of former kolkhoz or agrarian forests are no longer a distinct category. Parts of these forests have been included into the state forest fund, while other forests remained in a poorly determined legal status. Reportedly in the result such stands have been clear cut in some areas99. Ukraine The total forest cover in Ukraine is about 9.7 Mio ha out of 10.8 Mio ha of designated forest lands (FORZA 2010). On abandoned agricultural lands during the last two decades trees and shrubs established naturally and have led to a succession towards forests. These lands are, however, so far not included in the forest fund. Global Forest Watch states for 2000 a \u201ctree cover\u201d of even 11 Mio ha, probably because remote sensing analysis included such lands with tree and shrub vegetation, which are officially not included in the forest fund. About 950,000 ha forests are under the management of \u201ccommunal\u201d bodies, i.e. the authorities of territorial units below the national level, including regions, districts and communes. The study focussed especially on these forests that are managed by \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises, owned by the regions and sometimes co-owned by the districts. In addition to the forests managed by the \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises, there are another 400,000 ha of lands under shelterbelts. Trends of forest cover of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests are not available. The accessible information suggests that the area covered by forest in the management of \u201ccommunal\u201d forest enterprises is more or less stable, and harvest and regeneration are in balance. Neither large scale permanent deforestation nor conversion into other land-use types is reported. No substantial newly afforested or naturally developed forests been formally included into the forests of \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises. In some regions, e.g. in Vinnytsia, efforts are made to include such new forests into the \u201ccommunal\u201d forest area, suggesting a slight general increase in the forest cover of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests. Uncertainties about land ownership of such lands, reclamation of such lands by owners of shares of former kolkhozes and complicated and long procedures for changing land designation and possession hinder this process. This situation leads to losses of newly developed forests in the course of reclamation of agricultural lands or clear cutting for the use of wood. These spontaneously developed forest stands on abandoned agricultural lands are affected by unregulated cutting and by wildfires caused by the burning of crop remnants and dry vegetation on adjacent agricultural lands. The \u201ccommunal\u201d forests tend to be of lower commercial value in terms of timber volumes, qualities and assortments compared to the state forests. These less favourable conditions are to a lesser extent the result of current governance. They can be attributed to the history of these forests with forests of lower value being assigned to kolkhozes, past forest use, e.g. with dominant coppice, and the origin of a large proportion of these forests in artificial plantations. The \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises make attempts to improve the conditions of their forests.

The forest dependency studies hereby focussed on direct income from the (mainly) legal harvest of forest products by the local households, but did not account for forest related employment, supply of (cheaper) forest products by forestry enterprises, illegal harvest of forest products for personal use or sale and the indirect benefits of forests, like protection of agricultural lands, villages and infrastructure from erosion and floods. Taking into account these benefits, the real economic value of local forests for these communities is even higher than the rather narrow focus of the forest dependency studies already suggests. Beyond the immediate forest dependent communities the local forests and forests in general provide goods and services for the society at large. In forest rich countries or regions like in Belarus, Georgia, Russia and Ukraine forest products are of importance in the national or regional economy. The organizations managing forests in the programme countries in varying proportions rely on funding by the state and on incomes created by own economic activities. Where local forests are not integrated in the state forest, but are managed either by the municipalities (Georgia, Moldova) or by \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises (Ukraine), incomes created by the use of these forests are the major source of funding for their management because those local administrations possessing these forests are rarely able to subsidize forest management in a substantial scale. The governance systems in a significant part influence on the extent, in which forests provide benefits to local communities, to the wider society and in what extent forest use funds partly or entirely sustainable forest management. Overly restrictive use regulations can reduce the benefits from legal use and cause disincentives for sustainable forest management. Economic benefits from forests can also be largely captured by external actors. Also deforestation and forest degradation caused by inadequate governance reduce the benefits from forests. Table 21. Overview of key findings on impacts of governance on benefits from forests COUNTRY BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS KEY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS Armenia Large part of income from forest use not available for forest management due to capture by external actors and corruption; short-term interests outweigh long-term benefits; local communities have legal access to fallen dry wood. High level of unaccounted harvest; fixed harvest fees below market value for the brigades; costs of protection of young growth from livestock not born by livestock owners/herders. Azerbaijan Limited income of forestry enterprises from maintenance cuts; access to NTFP for local people; reduction of benefits for the society due to degradation. Restrictions on harvest encourage provoked sanitary cuttings and provide disincentives to sustainable forest management. 129 Belarus Forest sector economically important, income of forestry enterprises for sustainable forest management, local budget contributions, employment, access to fuel wood and timber for local people. Governance system largely adequate, high forest cover, productive forests; certification improves market position. Intended separation of functions of state forestry enterprises may challenge economic efficiency. Georgia Commercial use only concessions; NTFP use by local people; limited income from forest use available for forest management; low employment; no local budget contribution. Economic benefits largely captured by concessionaires; very limited staff in local NFA representations/forestry units; procedures for contracting forestry activities and sale of forest products by public forest owners are not cost effective and preventing local employment; transfer of forests to communes undetermined. Moldova State forestry enterprises self- financing from forest use; communes rarely able to create enough income from forest use to fund professional management; few communal forests provide substantial economic benefits to local households. Communal forests of small area, fragmented and low productivity; neither legal provisions nor political will for transfer of additional forests into communal ownership; attempts made to create larger units by joint management of forests of several municipalities. Russia Income opportunities for private companies; reduced access of local communities to forest products; loss of jobs in state forestry enterprises and small enterprises; reduced ecosystem services from forests.

Armenia The current governance situation does not provide for a sharing of costs and benefits from forests in a way that would sufficiently support the needs of local communities, of the society as whole and enable sustainable forest management. The high level of unaccounted tree harvest causes a large proportion of the economic benefits being captured by private actors that do not bear the costs of forest management. These benefits are lost for Hayantar and also for the local communities living close to the forests. The artificially low AAC and the fixed fees and prices for sale of wood by Hayantar cause legally available economic benefits being much below the illegally possible incomes. This favours short-term interests of all involved actors \u2013 harvest brigades, local people, Hayantar staff dependent on \u201cinformal\u201d income and other corrupt officials \u2013 over long term 130 sustainable management of the resource by Hayantar and local communities. Although livestock grazing is prohibited in all forests, the damage caused by livestock is a key limiting factor for the success of afforestation and reforestation and fencing against livestock damage is an important cost factor (Michel, 2014). The existing governance of forests and pastures obviously fails to force or motivate the livestock owners or herders to bear these costs. Those causing the damage should have to pay for the damage or for the fencing. Further, afforestation and reforestation in areas used for livestock grazing should be planned with participation of the local communities, ideally with their active involvement and providing direct benefits from forest use to them. In that case local people would avoid livestock damage by careful herding practices and/or contribute to the costs of erection and maintenance of fences. In the result reforestation and afforestation would become more successful and cost efficient. Azerbaijan The official economic benefits for state forestry enterprises from the forests are currently limited by the restrictive regulation of wood harvest. No information is available, in what extent regular harvest, not limited to sanitary cuts, would potentially allow for an economically more viable and at the same time sustainable and ecosystem friendly forest management. Illegal tree harvest and provoked sanitary cuttings create economic benefits for private actors while preventing investment into the conservation and sustainable management of forests and creating costs for the public because of reduced economic value and ecosystem services from degraded forests. These factors are of special relevance for local forests in the vicinity of villages and those protecting important river catchments. The restrictions on the use of tree and shrub vegetation on agricultural lands (in fact local forests) may in some extent contribute to the protection of such stands from overly intensive cutting and thus preserve their protective and other ecosystem functions. On the other hand, these restrictions limit the tangible economic benefits for the land user from their existence as forest and make a degradation of these stands and their conversion into pastures economically more attractive than their preservation. Belarus Belarus\u2019 forestry sector is economically important and in a large extent self-financing. The government intends to reduce the share of the state budget in the financing of forest management. The state forestry enterprises are able to sell their produced timber through centrally organized auctions at the internal market, and at the same time they provide raw materials for Belarus\u2019 processing industry. State forestry enterprises are important employers in rural areas and provide affordable fuel wood and timber for the local population, which has also access to NWFP, like berries and mushrooms for subsistence and commercial use. These benefits are largely recognized. Illegal forest use is a rare exception, thanks to the tangible benefits from the forests, to legal access to forest products and to effective law enforcement. (Case Study Belarus) The government, supported by several experts, intends to separate the wood production functions from other forest management by transferring of harvest activities to separate units that might become privatized in the future. This intended change would bear several risks. The income created by timber use would no longer be directly used for forest management. This disconnection may lead to an underfunding of costly forest management activities. But if these would be paid by the government, it may also provide incentives to implement unnecessary (and environmentally harmful) activities, which the state forestry enterprises in the case of self-financing from their own income would not implement. On the other hand, harvest activities would less be oriented on a minimization 131 of impact on the forest ecosystem and on the potential of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b31a0dbb-fd9c-4f30-b43d-93f16219ca89": {"__data__": {"id_": "b31a0dbb-fd9c-4f30-b43d-93f16219ca89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc02b438c37e7d3d1c9e88ef6b34ab2e567eda38f223130a284bdeb5acf8b054"}}, "hash": "dc02b438c37e7d3d1c9e88ef6b34ab2e567eda38f223130a284bdeb5acf8b054", "text": "natural regeneration. Thus the entire forest management and use, in particular forest regeneration and silvicultural approaches, can become less cost effective and also have more negative impacts on the forest ecosystems, their functions and services. (Case Study Belarus) Georgia Commercial use of Georgia\u2019s forests is limited to the concessions. The financial contributions of these concessions to the budgets of the forestry agencies is low and does not support the maintenance and development of these agencies\u2019 capacities and the implementation of forestry activities. Also the fees for use of fuel wood for personal needs of local households are not significantly contributing to the forestry budget. Employment in the forest sector is low because of the massive reduction of staff of the state forestry agencies and because of tender procedures that make the temporary employment of local people for forestry activities very difficult (Michel, 2014). The concessions mainly employ not local people and process the harvested woods in central plants. Local wood processing plants have mainly shut down. Thus economic benefits from forests are largely captured by the concessionaires that are often foreign companies and limited benefits are available for local households in form of fuel wood access, livestock grazing and other NWFP. (Case Study Georgia) The City of Tbilisi does not have any budget to employ permanent forest workers and forest rangers. Pilot activities on forest maintenance cuttings had to be contracted through tender and the harvested wood sold through auctions, barely covering the costs of the contracted services. The procedural requirements for the procurement of services and for the sale of wood are highly ineffective, reduce the potential of economic benefits from the city\u2019s forests and indirectly affect the ecosystem services by hindering adequate forest management. (Case Study Georgia, Michel, 2014) In the communally managed forest in Tusheti benefits for the local communities are access to fuel wood and timber for local needs in limited amounts and the ecosystem services provided by the forests like erosion control, flood risk mitigation and attractiveness for tourism. The protected area\u2019s administration expects that income from the use of these forests and the protected area will be sufficient to finance its operations. Also other municipalities in Georgia expect that they will be able to establish economically viable forest management benefiting their communities and creating incentives for compliance with forest use regulations and contributions to sustainable forest management. So far these potentials cannot be realized, because neither time frame nor requirements for the handover of local forests into the possession of the municipalities are determined by the government. Moldova The use of the state forests, despite the likely high proportion of unaccounted harvest and the limitations on cuttings for main use, provides enough income for the funding of the operations of the state forestry enterprises and of the national level forestry authorities including the forest inventory and management planning. The forests in communal ownership are of smaller size, consist of fragmented sections and have in most cases much lower harvest potential. For these reasons only in few communes incomes created by their use are sufficient to finance full scale forestry operations. Few communal forests create in a substantial scale income from employment and short-term labour and provide fuel wood and timber at competitive prices for local households. In these areas local people are ready to invest in the protection of the forests against unauthorized use and the maintenance of these forests. 132 In most areas income from communal forests are too low to support their professional management by the municipality and direct material benefits are insufficient to motivate community contributions. The actual area size and conditions of these forests are main reason for this situation, but lack of formal opportunities and suitable approaches for communities and local households to improve and use these forests is a contributing factor. The handover of additional forest sections from Moldsilva into ownership or management by the communes would in some areas improve the conditions for sustainable forest management by the municipalities. But there are neither legal provisions nor political will to consider such options of optimizing the shape, size and location of forest sections in state and communal possession Indirect benefits and ecosystem services, especially erosion protection, are not sufficiently recognized by local people to stimulate effective forest protection and contributions to forest management. Some municipalities attempt, with support by ENPI-FLEG II and other programmes, to create larger and thus more viable communal forestry institutions, and to support inventory and management planning, afforestation and the improvement of the conditions of the communal forests.

(Case Study Moldova) Russia The reforms of the forest sector in the context of the adoption of the new Forest Code in 2006 had large impacts on the economic benefits of the forests. The large scale privatization of the forest use provided opportunities for income generation by private companies. However, many of these companies have not reinvested into the protection, regeneration and maintenance of the leased forests. The complicated procedures for access to forest products and the lease of areas close to villages without consideration of the needs of local communities have caused reduced access of local households to forest products, in particular fuel wood and timber for personal needs. Also serious barriers on access to timber for local small and medium wood processing enterprises, which provide about 100,000 jobs in rural areas, challenges their survival. The growth of illegal logging and the involvement of local people in these activities is also a result of reduced legal access to economic benefits from the forests. The large scale forest destruction by forest fires and illegal logging impacts the availability of forest products and the ecosystem services provided by forests. Especially in the Baikal region impacts on local streams and rivers and in the result on Lake Baikal likely impact the entire ecosystem (Edom, pers. comm. 2015;100), and in the result the economic benefits from fishing, hunting and recreation. Ukraine The use of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests funds the operations of the region and district forest enterprises. The income situation of these \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises is determined by the conditions of the forests managed by them. As \u201ccommunal\u201d forests tend to include smaller and more fragmented forest sections with lower harvestable volume and commercially less attractive assortments, the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are in a tighter financial situation compared to state forestry enterprises. (Case Study Ukraine) For the local communes and their self-governance bodies the material benefits from the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests within their boundaries are similar to those from forests of other ownership and possession type. The rural councils get a percentage of the stumpage fee from intermediary cuts but not from cuts for main use. These fees are identical for all forest possession types, but \u2013 caused by their usually lower share of cuts for main use \u2013 the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests provide higher income to the communes per harvested unit of wood. The application of the same stumpage fees and shares for all types of forests and the recent reduction of the shares rural councils receive reduce the 100http://forest.ru/articles/nemetskiy-uchenyy-frank-edom-o-posledstviyakh-pozharov-v-pribaykale/ 133 incentives for local communes and their inhabitants to support the protection and management of forests in the possession of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. The allocation of the entire fee for main use felling to the central budget additionally removes incentives and does not reflect the costs from timber harvest, which the communes (damage to roads) and local households (negative impact on NWFP) have to bear.(Case Study Ukraine) Local households in rural areas close to forests benefit similarly from all forests, independent of \u201ccommunal\u201d or other ownership and management. All types of forestry enterprises prefer to hire their temporary workers informally, and official employment seems limited. Access to NWFP is also free in all ownership types of forests, but no self-harvest of fuel wood and timber is permitted. \u201cCommunal\u201d forestry enterprises sell fuel wood and timber directly to local households. Some \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises sell wood to needy groups of the local population and social objects at subsidized prices that are much below the market price or provide it for free. Some state forestry enterprises provide similar benefits to rural communes and households. (Case Study Ukraine) Given the rather marginal differences between \u201ccommunal\u201d forests and state forests in terms of benefits for local people and rural communes and the generally poorer income situation of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises, the economic viability of keeping separate \u201ccommunal\u201d and state forestry systems might be questionable. Differences between both types are very small because of the ownership of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises by regional authorities and the similar levels of local involvement, participation and benefits at the level of rural councils. The integration of suitable local sections of current state forests into \u201ccommunal\u201d forest management might in some areas increase the benefits from \u201ccommunal\u201d forests.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed2f3b1d-0ccb-448c-a4b5-9646dca47cef": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed2f3b1d-0ccb-448c-a4b5-9646dca47cef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebc4cfc381e57b7977498be9dc202389dcbc265537d2664c559f9a35faad21cb"}, "2": {"node_id": "e06f8756-e1b6-4343-a9b3-2428ee5ff7a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb98ffe389dc7ccdcbeacee230807153a5e50c4c3f14dada1090fb8cbdf70d3f"}}, "hash": "7870a7d49fdcd386df4179712d65816233521fbbca3ecbe78853fd8c783dd2ba", "text": "In some areas an integration of both systems might provide more benefits than the maintaining of separate systems.

Here the application of these principles on the findings on governance of local forests in the ENPI-FLEG II countries is in brief reviewed and conclusions for each principle are presented. Each principle consists of a title and of some elements describing this principle in brackets. Principle 1: Democracy (Inclusion and deliberative democracy, participation and voice, respect and trust, empowerment, meaningful and respectful dialogue, political equality) The assessment of the compliance of governance of local forests in the programme countries with the principle \u201cDemocracy\u201d is challenging. The application of democratic concepts to a single sector \u2013 forestry \u2013 and within this sector to a special object of governance \u2013 local forests \u2013 is difficult, and would require a broader assessment of the political systems of the respective countries from the national to the local level. This is not possible in the scope of this Study. Further, many components of governance in a single sector and of special objects within this sector are rarely subject of democratic decision making procedures, even in countries commonly considered highly democratic. Although parliaments decide about policies and laws, these are usually elaborated by the respective sector authorities. These sector authorities are ideally not subject to massive changes after every election leading to changes in the political power balance. Most of the elements mentioned in brackets under this principle are difficult to apply to governance systems, and some rather characterize attitudes and behaviour of persons and their relations. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)101 compiles annual Democracy Indices, and Democracy Ranking (DR)102 produces an annual ranking using six differently weighed dimensions. The programme countries represent a diverse spectrum of democracy ranks (2014)103104: Azerbaijan (EIU 148/167; DR not ranked), Russia (EIU 132/167; DR 97/112) and Belarus (EIU 125/167; DR not ranked)are usually considered less democratic and even authoritarian, while Armenia (EIU 113/167; DR 92/112), Ukraine (EIU 92/167; DR 73/112), Georgia (EIU 81/167; DR 57/112) and Moldova (EIU 69/167; DR 56/112) are considered as more democratic countries. Generally, a higher level of democracy at all levels and broader opportunities to participate in political processes can have positive impacts on governance. However, the governance of local forest is not necessarily better in more democratic systems and weaker in more authoritarian states. For instance in \u201cdemocratic\u201d Georgia, similarly as in \u201cauthoritarian\u201d Russia, large areas of forests have been assigned to private, mostly foreign, concessionaires. Communal self-governance organs did not have any say in this decision making, which has affected the benefits for local households and enterprises from local forests. In Ukraine members of the parliament (Verhovna Rada) representing a political party originating from the democratic Maidan movement have moved forward legislation, which bans the export of unprocessed round timber and thus reduces income of forestry enterprises and thus is potentially harmful for the sustainable use of forests. On the other hand, \u201cauthoritarian\u201d Belarus has effectively included its local forests into the state forests. The (elected) 101https://www.eiu.com/ 102http://www.democracyranking.org/ 103https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index#cite_note-10 104http://democracyranking.org/wordpress/ranking/2014/data/Scores_of_the_Democracy_Ranking_2014_a4.pdf 139 district councils and the respective administrations have substantial mandates in the decision making on the state forests within their district boundaries. Compared to this, the authority of district councils in more \u201cdemocratic\u201d Ukraine, even on forests in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership is much more limited and mainly in the mandate of the region councils (in case of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests) or the national level State Forestry Agency and its territorial substructures (state forests). The highest level of democratic decision making on local forests exists currently in Moldova, which also ranks best in the above mentioned democracy indices and rankings. The elected municipality councils and the (also elected) primar (head of the municipality) have the main decision making authorities on their communal forests. These authorities are, however, restricted by the legislation that assigns some mandates to state agencies in charge of forestry and environmental protection.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "869bb724-5f72-4bce-b5c0-102cc95d9fdd": {"__data__": {"id_": "869bb724-5f72-4bce-b5c0-102cc95d9fdd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae25a3e40d4c7ca66d3c0110ff3af13e295dbd87e970a6891e7364b473c11e0b"}, "2": {"node_id": "c45a7c67-b1ae-4aea-841f-1019470a9e36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89e729df9071befaf13cc16e5ce8161004f9a220b0523a22dbec95d61fcc0594"}}, "hash": "50c42118cd0d7c6cd20fb036dc4e2668c07fb3765c1345e46ab9b3d5bf668f87", "text": "In Georgia the level of democratic decision making on issues of local forests would be the highest if the provisions of the respective legislation from 2005 would be implemented that give the local municipality \u201cexclusive authority\u201d over local forests.

Here the results are mixed, and in particular economic restraints and public pressure have hindered the implementation of meaningful forest management activities.

The assessment of the adherence of decision makers and actors to this principle in the context of governance of local forests is beyond the scope of this Study. Available anecdotal evidence is not sufficient to draw justified conclusions on the general compliance of governance with this principle. Principle 3: Sustainability and Valuing Nature (Managing ecosystems and landscapes, valuing nature, balancing interconnectedness, promoting good conservation practice) This principle has in many aspects been covered by 6.1, interpreting forest cover and forest conditions as elements of \u201cmanaging ecosystems and landscapes\u201d. The application of this principle is difficult because most of the elements used for characterizing this principle are subject to interpretation by the society and by different stakeholders. Whatever action taken is taken, including no action \u2013 ecosystems and landscapes are always \u201cmanaged\u201d, being it setting them aside as strict nature reserve (no action) or transforming them into an open pit mine. Terms like \u201cvaluing nature\u201d, \u201cbalancing interconnectedness\u201d and \u201cpromoting good conservation practice\u201d are difficult to grasp. A practical example: in the frame of an EU-funded project in one of the ENPI-FLEG II countries openings in a forest area, so far used as pasture with single old fruit trees, had been afforested with broad leaved trees. The involved foresters saw this clearly as \u201cgood conservation practice\u201d, while the external evaluator negatively assessed the loss of biodiversity to be expected due to the reduction of structural and species diversity, the introduction of planting material originating from other areas (risking genetic pollution of native gene fund or dissemination of diseases) and the prevention of natural succession and traditional use of this site. This example shows the difficulty of determining the compliance of governance with the mentioned values. Additionally, even if set elements of governance are aimed at this principle, the results achieved 140 may be substantially different from what is formally intended. The governance systems of all programme countries contain elements, in particular in policy, legislation, decision making and law enforcement aiming at the achievement of sustainability in forest management through balanced use and regeneration and also at integrating of conservation into the regular management of used forests and at conservation by setting aside forest areas with higher formal protection. However, in some of the programme countries regulations of forest use, in contrast to their official intention, are contributing to adverse conservation outcomes. For instance, extremely conservatively set annual allowable cuts have in some programme countries caused high illegal and unaccounted wood harvest and have thus contributed to forest degradation and deforestation instead of achieving sustainability and rehabilitation of forest stocks. Permission of sanitary cuts, formally intended at keeping forests in a healthy condition, in some contexts have led to deliberate damage of trees to provide pretexts for such harvest. Principle 4: Equality (Equal opportunity and non-discrimination, level playing field) In the context of governance of local forest this principle may apply to various ways of access to forest resources, to access to decision making processes and also to access to employment and contracts for the provision of goods and services. The schematic application of this principle might actually lead to governance problems. Access to a limited resource, like local forests, or the opportunity to create income from the provision of goods and services for their management, requires the setting of exclusion or selection criteria, which lead to differentiated opportunity and possibly can be considered discrimination. Some positive discrimination of local actors, like local households, local entrepreneurs, communities and communal bodies can be necessary to avoid either open access situations or alienation of the local actors by more powerful external actors. For instance, in Georgia and Russia the assignment through competitive bidding of user rights to concessionaires and leaseholders let to assignments to local actors only in those exceptional cases where external powerful bidder were not interested. In contrast, if the Georgian legislation on local self-governance would be applied on local forests, and these forests would come under the authority of the municipalities, external actors would lose opportunities and would be discriminated. Given the dependence of local households on forests and the creation of incentives for sustainable forest management by the assignment of user rights to local communities, the impact of such discrimination can be positive from the perspective of governance of the local forests. In Moldova and Ukraine municipalities and \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises provide forest products from local forests to local households based on social need criteria and to communal entities at lower prices or for free.

Principle 5: Equity (Access and benefit sharing, break system traps that curtail resilience, responsive policy) The application of the principle of equity to the governance of local forests is difficult. Similarly to other principles and their elements, terms like \u201cequity\u201d are not universally defined, and it is difficult to assess the compliance of governance systems with such concepts. More detailed explanation of the elements \u201cbreak system traps that curtail resilience, responsive policy\u201d would be necessary for their application in the context of the principle \u201cEquity\u201d in the governance of local forests. Many aspects of access and benefit sharing are covered in section 6.2 of this Study, assessing the access to economic benefits from local forests and the sharing of these benefits between actors. The governance systems in the programme countries lead to different levels of access and benefit 141 sharing for different actors. In all programme countries access to local forests and their resources is regulated. The forestry enterprises and other entities managing the forests are normally using the income created from the use of the forests for entirely or partly covering their expenses. Local people have access to forests for non-extractive use, to NWFP and in some extent to fuel wood and timber for their personal needs. Problems with access to wood and timber for local needs exist in particular in Georgia and Russia where assignments of forests as concessions and long-term lease have caused access restrictions for local households. In recognition of the broader benefits from forests for the society as a whole, the forest sector in all countries is in some extent funded from national and/or local budgets. The ecosystem services of forests are widely recognized, but \u2013 beyond the general subsidizing of the forest sector \u2013 so far no systems of payment for these benefits have been established. In some situations external actors that do not contribute to the conservation and management of the forest resources capture large portions of the benefits from these forests. Such state of affair is highly problematic and causes insufficient forest management and protection and in the result degradation and deforestation. One example is the large scale unaccounted tree harvest in Armenia by harvest brigades. In Georgia concessionaires and in Russia leaseholders in some extent use the forests without sufficiently contributing to their management. Also situations are problematic, where fees are collected at the central level, but costs occur locally, for instance, in Ukraine the allocation to the national budget of stumpage fees for main use, while local budgets bear the costs of maintaining the roads damaged by the transportation of logged timber. Principle 6: Justice (Access to information, transparency, participation, redress, recognition for all peoples and communities, access to justice and legal process, respect for rights of others, rule of law, respect for diversity in legal systems and values) The systems of governance of local forests in all ENPI-FLEG II countries contain various elements of the principle \u201cJustice\u201d. Formally all programme countries are governed by the \u201crule of law\u201d. Rankings like the Worldwide Governance Indicators105 provide some indication of the realization of the \u201crule of law\u201d. The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) \u201care a research dataset summarizing the views on the quality of governance provided by a large number of enterprise, citizen and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing countries. These data are gathered from a number of survey institutes, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and private sector firms.\u201d106 The ENPI-FLEG II countries ranked in the WGI in 2014 as follows (best to worst, percentile rank 0 \u2013 100): Georgia (64), Moldova (47), Armenia (44), Azerbaijan (31), Russia (26), Ukraine (23), and Belarus (23). Such country rankings have their limitations because of the inherent complexity. Drawing of conclusions on the specific sector and sub-sector from the country ranking leads to even more uncertainty. Access to justice and legal processes is formally given in all programme countries for natural persons and physical entities, including civil society organizations. Local self-governance bodies and territorial administrative authorities of district and region level as well as sector agencies and their subordinated entities might be either formally or informally restricted in their access to justice and legal processes. Neither CPCs nor stakeholders mentioned any issues related to this topic. In Georgia civil society organizations initiated law suits against the government agency in charge of assignment of forest concessions and, despite the court rejected their claims, the authorities annulled several of the incriminated concession contracts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a356214-3c64-451e-b140-8e2953c4909a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a356214-3c64-451e-b140-8e2953c4909a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05d848a169124e08e9a04d7e48853725851e0baf320fb51ec290cf98be913a8a"}, "2": {"node_id": "43d11f4b-60aa-4bb0-8314-336019d82f06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "452b1725201abf755735314161d11849a00c7cd55554d687d95b4ad6e77def8b"}}, "hash": "b807b83f5abb5cc7f4f9d486ee2d339797739a9fbd021d386b86102cda51d329", "text": "105http://www.govindicators.org/ 106http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#reports 142 The environmental and other legislation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ae5db4a-72cb-4429-b997-64c17c0df3db": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ae5db4a-72cb-4429-b997-64c17c0df3db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65e6019b003ad6f741795faa56e66679d1c585b3df631169d5be5c4b9c4a2278"}}, "hash": "65e6019b003ad6f741795faa56e66679d1c585b3df631169d5be5c4b9c4a2278", "text": "of all programme countries, in compliance with the Aarhus Convention, provides for access to information, transparency and participation. The realization of these rights in relation to the governance of local forests is partly satisfying, depending on the country and the topic. For instance, in Georgia information on the details of concession contracts is not accessible even for those municipalities, on the territories of which these concessions are located. In Russia for several years after the delegation of important governance functions to the Federal Subjects essential regulations and information were not or only with difficulties publicly available. The governance in the ENPI East countries does not make any distinction in term of ethnic groups or similar categories. In contrast, the Russian legislation, e.g. the Forest Code, specifically recognizes access rights to forests and forest products for indigenous small peoples. In all other issues and all other countries rights of local communities are independent of their ethnic identification. Rights of community members can be realized via the local self-governance bodies (usually rural councils at sub-district level) and other representative organs, through the establishment of legal entities and/or individually. In the practice local communities have limited chances to resist against more powerful interests. Such cases are especially known from Russia, where access to forests and forest products has been restricted, being it the assignment of forests to logging companies as leaseholders, housing development by influential people, infrastructure projects or the exploitation of mineral resources, and local communities and indigenous ethnic groups had little or no success in defending their interests and rights in the justice system. The elements of \u201credress, respect for rights of others, respect for diversity in legal systems and values\u201d do not play a major role in the governance on local forests in the programme countries. Principle 7: Humility (Respect and kindness, openness and tolerance, precautionary principle, recognition of limitations) This principle is difficult to apply for the characterization of the governance of local forests because the principle and many of its elements, in particular respect and kindness, openness and tolerance, rather describe personal character traits and relations between people than institutions. The \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d, without being specifically mentioned in any document in the programme countries, plays some formal role in forest management planning, determination of annual allowable cuts and transformation of forests into other land-use. In the practice the precautionary principle is often poorly applied and forest management that risks the integrity of forest ecosystems is common practice, like clear cuts or the establishment of exotic and potentially invasive tree species. The sector agencies only approve the FMP and focus on allowable cuts, while assessments of silvicultural objectives and planned activities from the perspective of ecological sciences, ecosystem functions and nature conservation do not take place, with the exception of the FMP for some protected areas. Limitations are one element of the regulation of forest use in the programme countries, for instance in form of the definition of annual allowable cuts. Principle 8: Legitimacy (Integrity and commitment, authority and representation, legitimacy) Legitimacy can be based on democratic representation, as described above under the principle \u201cDemocracy\u201d. If referring to the leading staff and representatives of forestry agencies and forestry enterprises, legitimacy should be based on qualification, skills, experience and other criteria that are normally applied in recruitment processes. In those programme countries, where forestry education exists and enough suitable experts are 143 available, the qualification of forestry staff is normally higher. In Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine staff of forestry agencies of various level and of forestry enterprises has an educational background in forestry, which is adequate for the respective positions. Here qualification and experience are the key criteria for recruitment. In Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and Russia the availability of qualified forestry expert has declined because of the vanishing of education opportunities, largely caused by declining demand and low students\u2019 numbers due to the very limited employment and income perspectives in the forest sector. In Georgia now many foresters that lead local forestry units of the NFA do not have a background in forestry. On the other hand, in countries with comparably weaker law enforcement and higher corruption levels, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Ukraine and Russia, positions in forestry agencies, in addition to low official salaries, can provide access to informal income sources \u2013 unaccounted harvest of forest resources, allocation of forest plots for lease for housing development, bribes and so on. Under such circumstances qualification becomes a secondary recruitment criterion and other criteria become more important, like personal connections, loyalty and mutual informal benefits, possibly also buying of positions.

Principle 9: Vision (Strategic vision, interconnectedness, coherence and contextualization) The official forest policies of the programme countries establish strategic visions or goals for their forest sector as a whole. These policies barely recognize local forests and accordingly do not contain specific visions for these forests. In Moldova the Strategy for Sustainable Development of the Forest Sector of the Republic of Moldova till 2020 from 2001107 had the vision of handing over all forests to the state agency Moldsilva. During the recent years the government recognized the potentials of communal forests and with the assistance of international projects, in particular ENPI-FLEG II, strategic visions are developed. These visions aim at the improvement of the economic viability of communal forests and their management by increasing the areas with forest cover, improvement of silvicultural quality of stands and the establishment of effective and more efficient management structures, like joint enterprises of several municipalities. In Georgia since 2005 the acting legislation reflects the political goal of handing over the responsibility on \u201cforests of local importance\u201d to the municipalities. But so far this transfer was not implemented. The more recent National Forest Concept108 vaguely establishes the goal of developing \u201ccommunity\u201d ownership of forests, but remains vague and provides much less detail than on the development of the state forestry institutions. In contrast to the national level policy makers\u2019 vaguely defined goal on local forests, several municipalities in Georgia have developed visions on the transfer of \u201cforests of local importance\u201d into their possession and management. The Government of Ukraine only in 2014 changed its policy on local forests, which until then had the vision of transfer of all local forests to the SFRA as a monopolist. However, the country still lacks a clear vision on the local forests and the \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises managing many of them. With the general policy of decentralization, national and regional decision makers may consider new visions, possibly including devolution of some authority on local forests to the communal level (sub-districts). 107Parliament Decision #350/2001 108 Adopted by Decree of the Parliament #1742-Is/December 26, 2013 144 But also negative consequences are possible if the management of forest territories would become more fragmented in the course of reshaping of administrative districts. In Armenia legislation provides for communal forest ownership and communal management of state forests. However, in the reality both do not exist. The vision of decision makers does not differentiate local forests and sees their management only as integrated part of the state forests, managed by the local branches of the centralized state forest agency Hayantar. Decision makers, forestry agency staff, NGO representatives and communal level authorities, all do not seem to have any vision about a more substantial role of communes of communes and a possible transfer of responsibility on local forests. Also the other programme countries have no specific vision on local forests. In Belarus these forests are effectively and successfully integrated in the state forest fund and no separate vision seems to be necessary. In Azerbaijan and Russia visions for those local forests that are currently not integrated in the state forest fund would be necessary as well as for forests that are part of the state forest fund and are of high importance for local rural households and accordingly may provide a potential for involvement of communities or communes in forest management. Principle 10: Performance (Responsiveness, effectiveness and efficiency, subsidiarity, resilience, financial sustainability) The performance of the governance of local forests can best be assessed by its impacts on forest cover and forest conditions (Section 6.1) and on the benefits the forests provide to the forest management entities, local households and the society as a whole (6.2). The findings of this Regional Study and the Case Studies show that overall performance in terms of impact can vary even within countries. None of the programme countries in relation to the governance of local forest has fully implemented the principle of subsidiarity, in the sense that issues should be dealt with at the most immediate (or local) level consistent with their solution, and that a higher level authority should have a subsidiary (that is, a supporting, rather than a superior) function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level. In all programme countries local forests are in parts or entirely managed by higher level authorities or with substantial interference of such authorities. In the practice the assessment of the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity can be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ca98a85-2118-4bb1-a0c2-b6ac801678d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ca98a85-2118-4bb1-a0c2-b6ac801678d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2fb7778ce998a1b9e54d8e6345684cc178b4eff2cd3ba70bca5abf44d626ec81"}}, "hash": "2fb7778ce998a1b9e54d8e6345684cc178b4eff2cd3ba70bca5abf44d626ec81", "text": "challenging because views can vary substantially about what authorities and functions can only be carried out by higher level authorities. In what extent subsidiarity is actually an element of the principle \u201cPerformance\u201d might also be subject to debate. Among the programme countries the governance of local forests is in some parts most decentralized in Moldova. Communes are the owners of parts of the local forests within the boundaries of their territories. However, there are as well forests in the immediate vicinity of villages, even bordering communal forests, which are in the ownership and management of the central level forestry agency Moldsilva. But this agency is locally acting through its subordinated state forestry enterprises, which are legal entities with some level of independence. These state forestry enterprises are not subordinated to the local public administrations, the municipalities. Further, the state forestry agency and national level environmental authorities retains a set of authorities over communal forests as well. On the other hand Moldsilva assists the forest owning municipalities in forestry activities in their communal forests if communal capacity is not sufficient for their effective implementation. The general performance of the communal forest ownership and management in Moldova varies. Some communes with larger forest areas and a majority of forests of natural origin and higher productivity performing very well in terms of effectiveness and efficiency and being financially viable. 145 The other end of the performance spectrum can as well be found in Moldovan communes \u2013 communal forests that are small and fragmented and consist mainly of poorly maintained and low productive artificial plantations. The municipalities owning such low quality communal forests are not able to implement effective, efficient and financially sustainable management. The municipalities see the immediate reasons for these problems in the characteristics of their forest stands, but components of governance contribute to this low performance, e.g. fragmented ownership between communal and state forests, regulations that provide disincentives for the improvement of the stands. The governance of local forests in Belarus has been entirely integrated in the hierarchical system of state forests and their management under the Ministry of Forestry. In the practice there is no difference between the governance of local forests and any other state forests. This governance system shows a very high performance in terms of effectiveness (impact on forest cover, forest conditions, economic and other benefits), efficiency and financial sustainability. In addition to the governance system, the positive ratio between available forest products and local demand contributes to this high performance. Ukraine\u2019s governance of local forests varies regionally. In some regions local forests are entirely integrated into the state forest fund managed by the state forestry enterprises of the SFRA. In other regions local forests consisting of former kolkhoz forests are owned and managed separately through \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises owned by the region authorities, possibly co-owned by district authorities. The performance of this governance system is mixed. Impacts in terms of forest cover and conditions are similar, but for historical reasons \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises regularly manage smaller and more fragmented forests of lower productivity what impacts on their efficiency and financial viability. The central level SFRA and its region branches and other agencies have certain mandates over the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests in terms of planning, decision making and law enforcement. In contrast, the rural councils of the communes do not have any real stake in the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests. Benefits at local level are similar between state and \u201ccommunal\u201d forests. The efficiency of keeping \u201ccommunal\u201d forests in a separate system might be lower compared to the thinkable and regionally practiced integration into the state forests. On the other hand, the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry system might provide opportunities for the application of the subsidiarity principle in the course of further decentralization and the planned reform of the communal territories. Georgia\u2019s local forests are with few exceptions in the possession of the national level forestry agency, the NFA, although legislation since 2005 provides for the transfer of \u201cforests of local importance\u201d into the responsibility of the municipalities. While this transfer so far has not been realized, large forest areas \u2013 mainly outside of the (poorly defined) \u201cforests of local importance\u201d \u2013 were assigned as long-term concessions and the capacity of the state forestry system was reduced to a level that does not allow for the implementation of any forest management activities beyond permitting and control of forest use by local households.

The governance of the local forests by the municipality of the City of Tbilisi is not performing satisfactorily. The conditions of the \u2013 largely artificial pine \u2013 forests deteriorate due to unsuitable stand conditions and lack of silvicultural activities, which are hampered by insufficient financial means, inefficient and costly procedures and negative public opinion. The communal management of the forests in Tusheti Protected Landscape is still in its initial phase and has the potential of performing well in terms of impact on forests and local benefits; but the comparably small area size, remoteness and limited harvest potential reduce the efficiency and put at risk the financial sustainability of the communal protected area administration. The Government of Georgia, in accordance to the National Forest Concept, plans therefore substantial reforms, most noticeable the phasing out of the concessions and the 146 rehabilitation of state forestry management. The development of economically viable communal management of local forest could improve the general performance of the governance of Georgia\u2019s forests. In Russia local forests are in parts integrated in the state forest fund, while large parts of former kolkhoz or agrarian forests have an undefined status. The decentralization and privatization of forest management and use to the level of the Federal Subjects and through assignment of lease contracts combined with the abolishment of most forestry functions of the federal level forestry agency Rosleskhoz has contributed to a further decline of the performance in the forest sector. Large forest areas have suffered deforestation and forest degradation from extensive forest fires and illegal logging. The Federal Subjects and the leaseholders were not able to replace the federal forest protection service, not to mention the achievement of the expected higher effectiveness and efficiency. The reforms of the forest governance system have affected the legal access of local household and small and medium enterprises to forest products, causing social hardship, reduced employment in the forest sector for local people and higher reliance on illegal forest use. In Armenia local forests are under the same governance system as any other forests. The communal ownership of forests and communal management of state forests that are possible by the legislation have so far not been implemented. The large proportion of illegal and unauthorized logging indicates the low effectiveness of the state forestry system. Loss of substantial potential income from forest use due to an inflexible and outdated fee and price system and the scale of unauthorized wood harvest and related corruption cause low efficiency and financial sustainability. The very limited and perhaps inappropriate piloting of communal or community-based forest management so far did not lead to the establishment of an effective and cost efficient alternative and complement of the branches of the state forestry agency Hayantar. Azerbaijan has integrated larger and economically attractive former kolkhoz forests into state forests while smaller, fragmented, degraded and naturally low productive forests remained as \u201ctree and shrub vegetation\u201d outside of the forest fund. The performance of the governance of both types of local forests is below the potential. Restrictions of regular cuts in all forests create disincentives for sustainable forest management and favour irregular cuts under the disguise of sanitary cutting in the state forests. Most afforestation is made with non-native species, often relying on irrigation at sites that are naturally not suitable for forests. The operations of the state forestry enterprises are not efficient and economically sustainable. Low salaries force forestry staff to rely on informal income from the use of forest products and not forestry related activities, like growing of crops on forest lands. Tree and shrub vegetation outside of the forest fund cannot be used for any wood harvest by the land-users and no incentive for the management and improvement of these stands exist. The land- users of these areas receive only very limited benefits from the existence of the tree and shrub vegetation and protection and effective management cannot be economically viable. In the result the majority of these unrecognized forests are used as silvo-pastoral areas and livestock grazing hinders rejuvenation and forest succession. 147 2 Case Studies \u201cAzerbaijan: Ivanovka \u2013 the last Kolkhoz and its Forest\u201d Fig. 1: Entering the case study village Ivanovka 1.

Since 1953 these forests were already partly handed over to state forestry enterprises. Nevertheless at the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union kolkhozes had permanent land-use rights over 125,000 ha of forests in Azerbaijan, i.e. roughly 10% of the current forest area. Although during Soviet times the state forestry enterprises twice a year conducted control visits on kolkhoz forests, large areas of these forests at the time of Azerbaijan\u2019s independence were heavily degraded. (Garibov, pers. comm. 2015) In the District Ismayilli, where the case study site is located, between 1993 and 1998 the kolkhoz forests of 17,650 ha were step by step handed over to the state forestry enterprise. No kolkhoz forests were included into the National Park. Only 1,000 ha of forests stayed in the permanent land- use of kolkhozes, mainly stands that had been transformed into orchards and vineyards. The kolkhozes and their user-rights on arable lands were later privatized. (Garibov, pers. comm. 2015) This case study describes an exceptional case where a kolkhoz continues to function until nowadays and manages some forests on the lands assigned to it in form of permanent land-use. The definition of \u201cforest\u201d in the Forest Code of Azerbaijan is vague: \u201cfrom the biological point of view 148 the unity of lands, waters, trees, bushes and grasses, animals, microorganisms and other components of environment that are interconnected and mutually influencing their development\u201d. The forest fund is defined by the formal delimitation of its land-use borders and consequently explicitly excludes \u201ctrees, shrubs, shelter belts on agricultural lands, and of transportation and water infrastructure, as well as within urban areas and on household plots\u201d. The Consultant during his visit got the information that the forests of the case study site are officially considered as \u201ctree and shrub vegetation on non-forest lands\u201d, i.e. do not formally belong to the forest fund. 2.

Due to the limited time for this case study and the special focus on the kolkhoz forest in Ivanovka no central level stakeholders, like the Forestry Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources were visited. The role of the Territorial Unit for Environmental Protection became only obvious during the interviews and no meeting could be scheduled on short notice. During his site visit the Consultant was accompanied by Azer Garaev (CPC Azerbaijan of ENPI- FLEG II, IUCN component) and by Nariman Agayev (member of National Project Advisory Council of ENPI-FLEGII).

Findings While these findings refer to the elements of the governance frameworks (as explained in the method section of the Preliminary Report), the Consultant did not attempt to cover here all pillars and their components in all detail but presents the specific aspects identified at the visited sites and being of relevance for this Case Study. Pillar 1: Policy, legal, institutional and regulatory frameworks Component 1.1: Policies The state policy of Azerbaijan is directed toward forest conservation and sustainable forest management, which includes the efficient and rational utilization of land and forest resources. The priority strategic objectives of the country\u2019s forest sector are reforestation, increase of the forest cover, and forest conservation and protection. (ENPI-FLEG 2014) During the last decades the government has made efforts to increase the forest cover through afforestation, mostly with non- native to the afforested sites species, sometimes depending on irrigation. As an official policy document the National Programme \u201cOn restoration and expansion of forests in the Azerbaijan Republic\u201d was adopted in 2003 by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. This document is mainly an action programme, focussed on technical aspects of expansion of the forest coverage in a significant extent by planting non-native trees. Aspects of sustainable use of forests for fuel wood and timber production as well as governance and management of forests and forestry are not subject of this document. The state policy on forests and forestry does not refer to the governance, management and sustainable use of tree and shrub vegetation outside of the state forest fund with the exception of tree belts along highways, railways, canals and the seashore. All forests of Azerbaijan designated as the so-called first group forest according to the Soviet classification of protection and exploitation forests and are thus not subject to logging for main use. (ENPI-FLEG 2014) This classification in the practice has led to a de-facto ban on legal harvesting of wood from forests, even in the context of forest maintenance and silvicultural activities. Component 1.2: Legal and regulatory frameworks The legal and regulatory framework on forestry is based on the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan, which makes environmental protection an obligation of every citizen. Article 14 states that natural resources belong to the Republic of Azerbaijan, but the article does not specifically highlight forests. The Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \u201cOn environmental protection\u201d does not contain any regulations on the conservation and use of forests and other tree and shrub vegetation. The Forest Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan was adopted in 1997 and refers to the forest fund as well as to other tree and shrub vegetation, including trees and shrubs on agricultural and other land, shelterbelts, trees and shrubs in urban areas and on private plots.

The Law of Azerbaijan \u201cOn administration municipal lands\u201d regulates the allocation to users of lands belonging to the municipalities. Component 1.3: Ownership and user right systems According to the Forest Code the forest fund in the Azerbaijan Republic belongs to the state, is its property and the lands of the forest fund are not subject to privatization. In contrast, tree and shrub vegetation located on lands, being in the property of a physical or legal person, belongs to it based on property rights, if the legislation does not establish otherwise. Possession, use and disposal of specified tree and shrub vegetation are to be carried out by the proprietor according to requirements of the forest legislation and other acts of the Azerbaijan Republic. The lands with tree and shrub vegetation outside of the forest fund are in the property of the municipality. The permanent land-use rights on these lands in the Case Study area are assigned to the \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d, which has to pay the land tax. In the forests of the state forestry enterprise people can harvest fuel wood based on forest cutting permits (\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0442) and warrants (\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0440) for trees marked by the rangers of the state forestry enterprise. Local people can also buy fuel wood from the state forestry enterprise. (Garibov, pers. comm. 2015) The kolkhoz does not exploit the wood products of its \u201cforests\u201d as this is legally not possible. The \u201cforest\u201d is used by people for recreation, beekeeping and use of NWFP (hawthorn and other fruits, and limited grazing at the edges of tree and shrub areas with not too dense stands) without the need for special permission (Representatives of \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d, pers. comm. 2015) The kolkhoz does not have the right to cut trees or to permit others the felling of trees because all tree felling on lands not belonging to the forest fund is prohibited. All requests for permission of cuts on non-forest lands would have to be made to the Ministry of Ecology, except for the cutting of single trees on private lands which is possible with permission by the District Department for Ecology. This department, however, does not issue any permits for felling of trees on other non-forest lands. (Garibov, pers. comm. 2015) The prohibition of cutting of trees in the \u201cforests\u201d of the kolkhoz seems to contradict the acting Forest Code which in article 76 explicitly allows for maintenance cutting, sanitary cutting, regeneration cutting as well as other cutting if they support the improvement of the tree and shrub vegetation and the fulfilment of its functions. 152 Fig. 4: Sheep grazing at shelterbelt \u2013 near Ivanovka (neighboring municipality) Component 1.4: Mandates of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations The Forestry Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources is in charge of regulation, control and oversight forestry in the country.

However, in case of violations, the state forestry enterprise would be involved in the assessment of the damage and confiscate the illegally harvested wood products.

The \u201cforest\u201d areas are effectively not grazed because of too dense vegetation. Only a small portion of them is grazed on the \u201cforest\u201d edges.

But there are no herding dogs and pastures are not fenced. Thus livestock grazing in the \u201cforests\u201d is not entirely controlled. (Representatives of \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d, pers. comm. 2015) Local people collect hawthorn and other fruits, and use the \u201cforest\u201d for beekeeping. No cafes or restaurants are located in the \u201cforest\u201d, but more open areas are used for recreation during holidays and weekends. These uses do not require any permits and no payment is involved. Also access is not limited to members of the kolkhoz only. (Representatives of \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d, pers. comm. 2015) No use of wood is formally possible, and the kolkhoz does not harvest any trees. Local people collect some fuel wood without authorization, but only dry wood, no live trees and in very small amounts. (Representatives of \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d, pers. comm. 2015) Generally the demand for fuel wood is low because Ivanovka is connected to the gas grid. However, there might be a market demand for fuel wood, e.g. for restaurants that offer barbecue. The current financial arrangements, economic instruments and benefit sharing rather discourage effective protection, maintenance and expansion of the forest and may in some extent motivate the conversion of suitable sections into pastures. Pillar 2: Planning and decision-making processes Component 2.1: Stakeholder participation There is not much space for decision making by the \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d on the management of the tree and shrub vegetation on its lands. Local stakeholders, i.e. members of the kolkhoz, participate in the decision making process through the General Assembly and the Council of the kolkhoz. Other community members have limited participation opportunities but have the same access to the \u201cforest\u201d for non-extractive use and collection of wild fruits as do the kolkhoz members. 154 Component 2.2: Planning and decision making on conversion of land from forest to non- forest and vice versa During the last years no conversions of land took place in the case study area. The lands of the kolkhoz that are covered by tree and shrub vegetation are all designated agricultural lands. Change of the land designation to forest land would lead to the handover of the property rights from the municipality to the state and of the user rights from the kolkhoz to the state forestry enterprise of Ismayilli District. The general legal procedure for changes of land-use rights and designations was not entirely known by the interviewed stakeholders. Formerly the Land-use Committee was in charge of land designations and land-use rights. The Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources and the State Committee for Property (Rus. Goskomimushchestvo - \u0413\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) are also to be involved in cases concerning forest lands and the decision should be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. However, the issue was seen as not very relevant in the district as even the Deputy Director of the local state forestry enterprise was not entirely aware about the actual procedure. Component 2.3: Decisions on forest inventory and management planning (\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) Forest inventory and management planning (FMP) are mandatory for the forest fund and are the precondition for the implementation of any forestry activities. The FMP is directly financed by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. In the past a FMP team had been working under the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, but this unit does not exist anymore. A new FMP unit is now planned to be reestablished under the Ministry\u2019s Forestry Department. (Garibov, pers. comm. 2015) In the forests of the state forestry enterprise of Ismayilli District the most recent FMP was done in 2005. It is required to be updated after 10 years, but so far the update is not yet scheduled. In Ismayilli new maps have been prepared as a \u201cFMP light\u201d under a project implemented by WWF with participation of the local communities.

The capacities of the Territorial Unit for Environmental Protection (\u0422\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044b) in charge of the four districts of Daghlig Shirvan Economic Region and with the District Department for Ecology to fulfill their mandate of control seem to be limited. The representatives of \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d (pers. comm. 2015) stated that the no regular patrols by their staff take place. These local level units do not have decision making authority on the management of the tree and shrub vegetation of the kolkhoz, and their capacity is therefore of limited relevance. Component 3.2: Forest law enforcement In the forests of the forest fund the state forestry enterprise themselves does the law enforcement. There are not many violations in the state forests of Ismayilli State Forestry Enterprise. The main problem of the state forestry enterprise is livestock grazing hindering the natural rejuvenation of trees in easy accessible areas. In the frame of the WWF implemented forest reconstruction project 300 ha of state forest have been protected with barbed wire fences and reseeded. The kolkhoz has appointed 10 workers for the protection of the \u201cforests\u201d. Some violators from other villages had been caught in collaboration with the police. The district and territorial units in charge of environmental protection do not effectively patrol the areas but come only when called. (Representatives of \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d, pers. comm. 2015) In case of unauthorized cutting of trees the District Department for Ecology would issue a protocol, the state forestry enterprise would assess the amount of wood and get the confiscated wood. The case would be brought to the court that would decide about the penalty. (Garibov, pers. comm. 2015) Component 3.3 Administration of forest and land ownership and user rights In the municipality of Ivanovka land-use maps and certificates about the permanent user rights of the \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d are in place. Component 3.4 Cooperation and coordination The kolkhoz fulfills many tasks of the municipality, while the municipality is seen as a not very effective structure that is \u201conly selling lands belonging to it\u201d. The collaboration with the District Department for Ecology seems partly difficult as \u201csometimes people from neighboring villages cut illegally in the kolkhoz forests and the District Department for Ecology would then blame the kolkhoz\u201d. When necessary, the kolkhoz collaborates with the police in law enforcement. (Representatives of \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d, pers. comm. 2015) 156 Component 3.5 Measures to address corruption and ensure transparency This component was not assessed due to the inherent difficulty this subject presents. An in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of any measures to address corruption and ensure transparency is not possible in the frame of a short visit for a case study but would require long-term involvement and building of trust. Conclusions The area selected for this case study is unique as it represents probably the only kolkhoz in Azerbaijan and the only \u201ckolkhoz forest\u201d. The management of the tree and shrub vegetation in permanent land-use by the \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d shows the potential of protection and use of local forest areas as collective property of the local communities. Similarly governance of tree and shrub vegetation on municipality lands might be possible if the rural councils of these municipalities establish the necessary institutions.

Recommendations The management of tree and shrub vegetation on municipality lands as common property of the local communities deserves more attention. The size of areas with the potential of forest regeneration, site conditions and vegetation of such lands should be assessed and potential costs and benefits estimated. The legislation should be amended to allow for the management of such stands as forests without their inclusion into the forest fund, thus allowing that these stands remain in the property of the municipalities. Options should be explored of closing the gaps in the governance of this tree and shrub vegetation, e.g. in the Forest Code, in terms of inventory and management planning and sustainable use of wood products from such stands.

The \u201cKolkhoz Nikitin\u201d may serve as a model area for developing of such \u201ccommunity forest management\u201d. The kolkhoz would provide an already existing institutional frame. The silvicultural and economic potential of allowing for sustainable harvest of trees and implementation of silvicultural measures by the kolkhoz should be explored. An inventory and management planning of the kolkhoz\u2019s tree and shrub vegetation would be necessary, possibly in a modified format, which compared to the standard FMP might be simplified but be based on stronger participation of the kolkhoz and the entire community. 5.

The remaining 7% of the forest fund surface are recently cut areas and young growth of less than 7 years of age that formally are not yet accounted for as forests as well as wetlands and mires (Yurevich, Ministry of Forestry, pers. comm. 2015). The area covered by forests has almost doubled since 1945 when it was at a historical low due to World War II. This increase in forest cover and also in standing volume currently still continues. The age classes in Belarus\u2019 largely even-aged forests are hence dominated by young and middle age stands younger than 70 years; and mature and over- mature stands are less represented than in continuously sustainably managed forests. Over the next decades substantial areas of forest stands will grow into these age classes.

The certification of the production from 57 state forestry enterprises and 55% of the total forested area in accordance to the FSC requirements and of 98% in accordance to the PEFC system supports the export of processed timber from Belarus. In Belarus the systems of natural resources governance inherited from the Soviet past have been 160 moderately transformed while preserving the main management approaches and organizational structures. During the Soviet Union state forests that were managed by the state forestry enterprises dominated the forest sector in terms of covered area and economic weight. The state forests were considered well managed and their conditions were similar to those found nowadays. Smaller forest areas within larger sections of agricultural lands and in closer vicinity of villages had been allocated to collective farms (kolkhozes). These kolkhoz forests already in Soviet times were in worse conditions than the state forests because of poor management and little silvicultural maintenance. The reason for this situation was seen in the priority of the kolkhozes on exploitation and the lack of forestry capacity in the kolkhozes. After the transformation of the kolkhozes 1998-1999, during the early 2000s all kolkhoz forests were handed over to the Ministry of Forestry and became integrated in the state forest fund managed by the local state forestry enterprises. (Yurevich, Ministry of Forestry, pers. comm. 2015) Some smaller areas with tree and shrub vegetation, in particular succession areas on abandoned agricultural lands, are still to be handed over to the state forest fund. The inclusion of additional areas suitable for forest development is in process. Tree and shrub vegetation covers about 600,000 ha of land of different categories outside of the state forest fund. ENPI-FLEG supports an inventory of the forest fund and of potentially suitable lands for its further expansion (planned increase of forest cover from currently 39% to 41%), especially through the inclusion of succession areas. (Yurevich, Ministry of Forestry, pers. comm. 2015) This case study is based on the findings from the visited state forestry enterprise \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d, which had been selected by the FLEG CPC as typical example, and on the information gathered in the interviews with representatives of the higher level forestry authorities. \u201cLocal\u201d forests are not distinguished in terms of governance and management from any other forests and the former kolkhoz forests have been integrated into the state forests. For this reason the Consultant looked into governance of forests in general, but could not differentiate forest categories that ceased to exist about 15 years ago. However, the Consultant focussed in his interviews in particular on issues of interaction between local people and local administrations and forests and forestry organizations. 2.

The state forestry enterprise in Logoysk manages a total area of 111,100 ha, of which currently 104,500 ha are covered by forests. Thus the area size of state forests managed by this state forestry enterprise is above the average size of areas managed by state forestry enterprises in the region and in the country. The forests and forest products of 16 out of 19 state forestry enterprises of the Minsk Production Forestry Association, including Logoyskiy Leskhoz, are certified as meeting the requirements of the FSC standards110.

The forestry units are divided in subunits (obkhod - \u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434) of about 1000 ha area and each managed by one forest ranger (lesnik - \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a). The total staff consists of 445 persons (by January 1, 2015). The visited state forests are located in a hilly and undulating glacial landscape (end moraine). The forests are dominated by coniferous stands (71%) with a majority of pine (54%). Deciduous forests (29%) are mainly represented by stands of birch (23%), aspen (3%) and black alder (2%). Stands with oak dominance make up only 0.5% of the total forested area. The age structure represents intensively used forests with even-aged stands, average age of 58 years and dominance of young and medium age stands and only 8% \u201cmature and over-mature\u201d stands. This situation reflects the general conditions of Belarus\u2019 forests, which suffered heavily during World War II. The dominance of younger age classes reflects the post-war reforestation efforts. The average standing volume is 240 m\u00b3/ha, in mature stands 283 m\u00b3/ha. The state forest lands include some former kolkhoz forests and some succession areas and agricultural lands for afforestation that were handed over together with the kolkhoz forests. The wood harvest in 2014 was 112,000 m\u00b3 from intermediary cuts and 119,000 m\u00b3 from main cuts (final logging). The state forestry enterprise processes its harvested wood to sawn timber, round timber and wood chips. Fig. 3: Intermediary cut (thinning) in age class forest of pine. The state forestry enterprise manages a part of the forest in four forestry units and adjacent lands as hunting ground. Its total size is 55,400 ha, out of which 32,600 ha are forests, 21,800 ha are fields and meadows and 1,000 ha are wetlands. Within this hunting ground a quiet zone of 5,100 ha is established where no hunting is permitted. The hunting unit has four rangers and one game management engineer. Hunting takes place on wild boar, roe and red deer, moose as well as wood grouse and black grouse, the grouses being of special interest for western European hunters. 163 Data from website of Logoyskiy Leskhoz111 and from Kriskevich, pers. comm.

The system of management of forestry is based on the state ownership of forests and the organization of forestry by the state. Priority directions of the strategic development of the forest sector are: \uf0b7 Improvement of the management structure of forestry with consideration of the division of forest management and productive activity (logging and processing); \uf0b7 Development of the forestry service sector, in particular the development of enterprises for logging works; \uf0b7 Reduction of the share of budget funding in the overall financial turnover in forestry; \uf0b7 Modernization of forestry production; \uf0b7 Introduction of modern information technology in forestry; \uf0b7 Increase of the productivity and biological sustainability of the forests; \uf0b7 Development of the forest roads infrastructure; \uf0b7 Inclusion of all economically interesting forest resources in the economic activities and multifunctional forest use; \uf0b7 Renewal of the existing forestry infrastructure and equipment; \uf0b7 Certification of forest management systems and forest production in accordance to the requirements of international standards; 111 http://leshoz-logoysk.by/?page_id=162 164 \uf0b7 Development of ecological tourism. The Consultant noticed that in this summary neither targets for the overall weight of the forest sector in the national economy nor contributions to the wellbeing of the rural people living in the vicinity of the forests were mentioned. A \u201cStrategic Plan for the Development of Forestry of Belarus for the years 2015-2030\u201d is currently elaborated with support by the ongoing ENPI-FLEG II program. As far as documented in publicly accessible sources this new strategic document is not yet adopted and published. The draft \u201cNational Strategy for the Sustainable Social-Economic Development of Belarus until 2030\u201d112 also contains a chapter on the development of forestry. Here as objectives of forestry are highlighted: economic effectiveness, ecological responsibility and social orientation. Forestry should be based on the principles of balanced and sustainable use and continuity. Indicators for the achievement are the increase of the forest cover to 40.3% by 2030 (i.e. plus 1% of the country\u2019s surface area) and the increase of the Annual Allowable Cut under main use (raschetnaya lesoseka po rubkam glavnogo polzovaniya lesom - \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c) by 100% during this time. This includes the improvement of the age structure of the forests and the increase of the share of mature and over-mature stands from 11.6% (2013) to 16% in 2030. In his message in April 2014 the President mentioned the separation of production functions from management and control functions in the forestry sector. The implementation of this policy statement would have implications leading to changes in the structure and mandate of forestry organizations. This Presidential statement corresponds with changes made already in 2010 in the legislation on privatization of state owned objects, which now would allow for the privatization of state owned enterprises in the forestry sector. The sub-units established in some forestry enterprises for production activities, like the wood processing workshop \u201cPleshchenitsy\u201d in the visited state forestry enterprise in the future might thus become not only independent entities but even private companies. This change would need to be reflected as well in the Forest Code (\u041b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f et al. 2011). The implications of these changes on the structure of and economic relations between the different organizations and administrative levels involved in forest governance and forestry activities on the ground are so far not determined. In particular, if harvest activities are carried out independently from other silvicultural activities and by different entities, problems can be expected for the sustainability of forest use and management as well as for the financing of those forestry activities that do not create immediate income. Component 1.2: Legal and regulatory frameworks The legal and regulatory documents determining governance of forests in Belarus are the Constitution, the Forest Code, related bylaws and laws regulating environmental protection, land use and law enforcement. The following overview is based on the article by Krasovskiy and Usenya (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015).

Further by the Presidential Decree from 9 September 2009 #444 has been adopted the \uf0b7 Bylaw on the allocation of forest sections for lease by legal entities and (or) for forest use. The Presidential Decree from 7 July 2008 # 364 has adopted the rules for the designation of forests by groups and categories of protection and the change of these designations as well as the determination of specially protected forest sections. Bylaws adopted by the Government of the Republic of Belarus regulate the key issues of: \uf0b7 Forest inventory and management planning, state census and cadastre of forests as well as forest monitoring; \uf0b7 Control of forest conditions, use, protection and regeneration of forests; \uf0b7 Issuing of permitting documents for forest use; and \uf0b7 Age of forests at logging. The aforementioned legislation on forestry is completed by a number of technical instructions, which determine practical aspects of the methods and technologies applied in forest management planning, forest regeneration, forest fire protection, determination and assessment of cutting areas and amounts, cutting, and inspection of forest sections where forestry works are carried out. These 166 technical rules are adopted by the Ministry of Forestry and provide a rather narrowly determined framework for the implementation of all elements of forestry on the ground. The law of Belarus \u201cOn environmental protection\u201d determines the legal basis for the protection of the environment as well as for natural resources use and conservation of biodiversity. In forestry it is applied on aspects where the forestry legislation does not provide specific norms. The law \u201cOn the plant world\u201d is also applied where forestry legislation does not establish specific rules concerning the use and conservation of plant species and vegetation. The Land Code of Belarus determines the designation of forest lands, the types of lands belonging to this designation and their use for the purposes of forestry In the frame of ENPI-FLEG national experts have prepared two reports in legal framework and recommendations for its improvement (\u041b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f et al. 2010 and 2011). A detailed assessment of these findings and recommendations and the extent in which they are addressed in the new draft of the Forest Code is beyond this case study. The national experts highlighted as an important aspect in accordance to the Aarhus Convention, to which Belarus is a signatory, the provisions of the Forest Code and the law \u201cOn environmental protection\u201d for access to information and participation of environmental NGOs in decision making, and the lack of detailed legal regulation how these rights of participation are realized in the practice. Further, the regulations on lease of forests are considered contradictory and inadequate. The acting legislation provides a comprehensive and applicable framework for all of forest management. The detailed bylaws may even bear the risk of overregulation and unnecessarily reducing the flexibility of state forestry enterprises to apply adaptive management. Component 1.3: Ownership and user right systems The Constitution of the Republic of Belarus determines that all forests are in the exclusive ownership of the state. But there can also be lands with tree and shrub vegetation outside of the forest fund. Currently 8.3 Mio ha of the forest fund (87.7%) are in the possession of the Ministry of Forestry, the remaining belonging to various other state entities. The state possessor of the forest fund lands assigns these for their management to legal entities carrying out forestry, in the case of the forests under the Ministry of Forestry to state forestry enterprises, which are typically established for managing the forests within one administrative district. Forests can be leased for up to 15 years, e.g. for the harvest of wild fruits. For logging operations forest can be leased only by especially listed specialized organizations and for shorter periods. The management of two state forests had been experimentally entirely handed over to commercial enterprises for a period of five years. The lease concerned not just the harvest, but the entire forest management. The leaseholders only exploited the forests and no effective forest management took place. Finally, when the forest areas were returned under the authority of the Ministry of Forestry, the forests as well as forestry infrastructure and equipment were in poor shape.

Legislation on of lease of forest is contradictory, and bylaw #444/2009 establishes that only legal entities can lease forests for logging and for recreation. Another possible problem is that leaseholders have to pay a leasing fee and in addition the fee for the use of the resource use, while users have to pay only the resource use fee, but no lease fee. In contrast, in the case of lease of other resources, the lease fee is already 167 considered as fee for resource use. The allocation of forests to users is in the authority of a broad range of state bodies. Forest plots can be assigned at the same time to different users for different types of use. (\u041b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f et al. 2011) Forest use is partly restricted by the designation of forests to groups and protection categories. Currently 52% of all forests belong to the first group with restricted use, including recreation forests (17.6%), water protection forests (16.8%), protected areas (14.2%) and protective forests (3.4%). The remaining 48% of Belarus\u2019 forests are exploitation forests with unrestricted use. The new draft Forest Code includes a provision for reducing the width of protective forests along railroads and roads, which would slightly increase the share of exploitation forests. (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015) Standing timber for final logging (main use) is partly sold through the timber stock exchange by the Open Joint Stock Company \u201cBelarussian Universal Commodity Exchange\u201d, in 2013 about 50% of the calculated harvest from main use. The remaining standing timber was allocated to the state forestry enterprise for logging and sale as well via the above mentioned stock exchange. Further, in the domestic timber market natural persons and legal entities can purchase logged timber, but as well standing timber outside of the stock exchange. The latter concerns the cutting of damaged and dead trees and stands for their personal use. (\u0428\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u043e, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015) In 2009 79.8% of the standing volume was logged by governmental enterprises, 16.1% by private sector enterprises and 4.1% by individuals. Timber harvested by private enterprises is mostly processed for the production of furniture and construction materials while more than 90% of the volume harvested by citizens is fuel wood. (\u041a\u0443\u0437\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432 et al. 2010) Fig. 5: Permit for fuel wood use - Logoysk Leskhoz. NWFP can be used without the need for a special permit by individuals for their personal use. However, in the practice NWFP like fruits and mushrooms are often sold by these collectors and this practice is tolerated, despite the formal need for a permit in case of commercial collection of NWFP. The assignment of use rights on areas for collection of NWFP is not much developed; more areas 168 are assigned for tourism and hunting. (BELGOSLES, pers. comm. 2015) In the visited case study area of \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d all forests are in the full possession of the state forestry enterprise and no forest areas are leased for use of forest products. The harvested timber is in large parties sold via the timber stock exchange and remaining pieces are sold by the state forestry enterprise to natural persons for personal construction needs with no resale being permitted. Fuel wood can be purchased by local people and enterprises from the state forestry enterprises. Self-harvesting of fuel wood by local people is also permitted on the basis of forest permits (\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0442/\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0440 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a). Usually people on plots marked by the forest ranger use broken trees only, rarely standing trees (because of danger), except if the forest ranger fells them himself for the local users. The fee for the self-harvest is very low (1,000 BYR/m\u00b3).

The Ministry of Forestry establishes rules and procedures to be followed by the forest managers, advices the Government on forestry issues, plans country wide targets and supervises its territorial (region) units in the six regions of the country. The Forest Code only twice refers to the region level of the forestry administration, the state production forestry associations. Thus the specific mandate of this level is not defined by the law, but by the respective bylaws of these organizations. The state production forestry associations are in double subordination, under the Ministry of Forestry and under the respective region administration (oblispolkom - \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u043c) with the first deputy head in charge of agriculture and forestry being the supervisor, but without specialized staff. Their directors are appointed by the Ministry with agreement by the region administration. The region level organizations fulfil both control and production functions, with an internal functional separation. They issue the annual plans for all subordinated state forestry enterprises based on the respective forest inventory and management plans (FMPs). Based on these plans each state forestry enterprise prepares its own business plan, to be approved by the state production forestry association, which has the final decision making authority, and to which the state forestry enterprises report. These plans determine volumes of harvest, but also include targets and conditions for reforestation activities to be realized by each state forestry enterprise. The state production forestry associations channel the state budget allocation in the forest sector to the state forestry enterprises that depending on the local conditions for self-financing of their 169 operations can receive maximum 40% of their budget as contribution from the state budget. The state production forestry association sells the wood and timber harvested by the state forestry enterprises and receives a share of the income. The Minsk State Production Forestry Association, to which this case study\u2019s state forestry enterprise belongs, has 45 staff, a part of which are paid from the state budget and the other part from own income. The Minsk State Production Forestry Association manages an annual harvest of 2.5 Mio m\u00b3, of which 30% is fuel wood and 70% is timber. The state forestry enterprises are subordinated to the territorial (region) unit of the Ministry of Forestry, the state production forestry association and at the same time to the district administration. State forestry enterprises have the mandate to manage the forests that are assigned to them and which are divided into forestry units (lesnichestva - \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) with a forester (lesnichiy - \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0439) in charge of each. The frame for the decisions made by the state forestry enterprises is set by the state production forestry association to which they are subordinated and by the FMPs. Harvest plans set are never allowed to exceed the limits set in the FMP, but they can be below these targets if the economic effectiveness of the enterprise is ensured as, for instance, in the visited \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d in 2014. The state forestry enterprises fulfil the role of control and oversight in relation to their forestry units and to other forest users. Fig. 6: Information plaque on the forestry unit \u201cKozyrskoe Lesnichestvo\u201d of Logoysk Leskhoz. The Forest Code in article 13 states a number of authorities of the district councils and administrations in the sphere of forestry. In the reality the district administrations fulfil only a part of the functions assigned to them in the sphere of forestry, while the most of them are fulfilled by the state forestry enterprises themselves, and where required endorsed by the district administrations. For instance, the district administration has the authority to assign forest parcels to a commercial entity for the harvest of wild growing berries. The state forestry enterprise would prepare the decision that is then accordingly adopted by the district administration. The state enterprise BELGOSLES is the central unit with the monopoly for forest inventory and 170 management planning, and is subordinated to the Ministry of Forestry. BELGOSLES does all forest inventory and management planning in the state forests of its Ministry as well as in the forests in the possession of other entities, like of the railway and road protection belts for the Ministry of Transportation, and on contractual basis also in other countries. The potential for private services for forest inventory and management planning is now studied. The mandates of forest protection and control of forest use and management are assigned to the Ministry of Forestry and its subordinated structures, the state production forestry associations and the state forestry enterprises.

The official policy is now to separate management from economic functions. The establishment of production subunits for timber harvest and processing under state forestry enterprises is in process. The functions of management (supervision) as well as reforestation, silviculture, forest protection, pest and fire control would remain with the state forestry enterprises. In the perspective the production subunits might become independent entities. Independently of the organizations in charge of forestry, a strong mandate of control is assigned to the State Inspection for the Protection of Animal and Plant World under the President in accordance to the Presidential Decree from 8 December 2005 #580. The mandate of this inspection service includes the direct control of all activities of the state forestry enterprises as well as of any other forest users as well as the prevention and persecution of any illegal harvest of forest products and game animals. Thus an independent external control and protection service is already in place that according to information from the visited state forestry enterprise \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d effectively fulfils its mandate. (Kriskevich, pers. comm. 2015) Component 1.5: Financial arrangements, economic instruments and benefit sharing The local state forestry enterprises are partly self-financing and partly receive financing from the state budget. In the average 35% of the overall budget of the enterprises is funded by the state, this funding is supposed to support specific activities that do not create substantial income, e.g. protection, pest and fire control, planting, forest roads etc. (Yurevich, Ministry of Forestry, pers. comm. 2015). The state forestry enterprises of the Minsk State Production Forestry Association receive up to 40% of their budget from the state, depending on the conditions for self-financing, determined e.g. by the productive potential of the state forests managed by these enterprises. Currently state forestry enterprises fulfil all tasks of local forest management and use, as planting, maintenance, protection, fire prevention, pest control and logging. The sale of harvested timber and fuel wood as well as other forest products, e.g. hunts, creates incomes for the state forestry enterprises that are used for the funding of their forests management activities. The state policy aims at increasing these incomes and by this reducing the share of state funding of the forest sector. If the planned separation of functions would be implemented and the harvest would no longer be done by the state forestry enterprises, new economic mechanisms would become necessary to fund those forestry activities that do not directly create income. This may result in certain risks for the economic viability of forestry and lead to undesired consequences caused by perverse incentives. Such perverse incentives may exist in some extent already nowadays, e.g. if reforestation is be financed by the state this may result in preference for reforestation at the expense of natural rejuvenation. Commercial harvesting units on the other hand are interested in low cost clear cuts and have less incentive to preserve seed producing trees and natural rejuvenation. The state forestry enterprises are seen as an important employer in small towns and rural areas. Also small enterprise providing forestry services to the state forestry enterprises are developing 171 (\u0428\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u043e, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015). So far all reforestation works are carried out by state forestry enterprises, but in the perspective this could possibly be also done by contractors. Currently this is not possible as respective requirements and regulations do not yet exist (Yurevich, Ministry of Forestry, pers. comm. 2015). The visited state forestry enterprise \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d provides significant local economic benefits, in form of employment and forest products. According to the director, also the ecological benefits of the forest are broadly recognized by the local population. The state forestry enterprise hires local workforce and has currently 445 staff. Thus it is an important employer in this rural area. The taxes from the state forestry enterprise go into the budget of the local district (income taxes of the enterprise and income taxes on salaries of the employees. The state forestry enterprise receives the stumpage fees paid by the enterprises that lease forest (entire forest units) for logging, in case of main use, 50% of the total amount; the remaining 50% go to the state budget. In case of intermediary use, the state forestry enterprise receives the entire stumpage fee. (Kriskevich, pers. comm. 2015) The provision of wood for local needs is an important instrument for the maintenance of good relations between the local communities and the state forestry enterprise, motivating their support of the forestry activities.

As the rural population is declining, more fuel wood is available than needed. The state forestry enterprise \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d sells fuel wood to local people in 1 m logs at prices of 100,000 BYR/m\u00b3 for birch, 95,000 BYR/m\u00b3 pine and 90,000 BYR/m\u00b3 ash, plus costs for delivery. In case of self-harvest, the price is only 1,000 BYR/m\u00b3. For comparison, the monthly pension of rural people is in the range of 2.5 Mio BYR. Enterprises can purchase fuel wood at costs of 150,000 BYR/m\u00b3. For comparison, the exchange rates as of 14 May 2015 were USD 1 = BYR 14,160 and EUR 1 = BYR 15,920. Timber is sold via auctions, but sufficient amounts are available for local people for their personal construction needs, with no resale being permitted. (Kriskevich, pers. comm. 2015) Pillar 2: Planning and decision-making processes Component 2.1: Stakeholder participation Article 14 of the Forest Code establishes the right of citizens, NGOs and local self-governance organs to participate in the consideration of issues in forestry concerning their interests through discussions, referendums and other forms of direct participation in decision making. This includes issues related to the assignment of forests, their use, protection and regeneration. Further, citizens, NGOs and local self-governance organs are called to educate the broader public about forest conservation and protection needs and to support directly forest protection and other forestry activities. The state bodies in charge of forestry have to provide the public with the relevant information. The national experts of ENPI-FLEG (\u041b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f et al. 2011) have criticized the lack of specific mechanisms for implementing in the practice these rights of participation as well as the broader rights of environmental NGOs, established in article 15 of the law \u201cOn environmental protection\u201d and by the Aarhus Convention. In the case study areas the state forestry enterprise has good relations with the district administration and with the rural councils. The state forestry enterprise preliminarily informs about planned forestry works at boards in each rural council. Pesticides are not used for pest control as there has not been any calamities of a scale requiring there use; but if necessary it would be advertised in the same way. The \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d has a school forestry unit for involving school children in its work and raise general public awareness (e.g. garbage, fire prevention). The public 172 opinion is very critical about any logging and open complains are expressed, even in cases where cuttings are necessary for maintenance and silviculture. (Kriskevich, pers. comm. 2015) Component 2.2: Planning and decision making on conversion of land from forest to non- forest and vice versa Forestry lands have been delimitated in the frame of the overall land-use planning. Currently the inclusion of further areas suitable for forest development is in process, including lands covered by shrub and tree vegetation from natural succession and agricultural lands of low productivity, which are suitable for afforestation. Succession areas are not necessarily included into the forest fund, but they can also get other designations, e.g. as protected areas. The change of the land category from agricultural to forestry is made by decision of the region administration. Changes of the status of forests of the first group can only be made by Presidential Decree, and thus a high barrier is established against the transformation of forests of a higher protection status. Component 2.3: Decisions on forest inventory and management planning Forest inventory and management planning (FMP; lesoustroystvo - \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) is mandatory for the entire forest fund and is carried out by the state unitary enterprise \u201cBELGOSLES\u201d under the Ministry of Forestry, which has the monopoly for these services.

Most silvicultural and harvest issues are predetermined by the applicable established norms, and thus there is not much space for disagreement between the FMP team, the state forestry enterprise and the representatives of district and rural councils. In the frame of the FMP, the team defines the stand density (stumpage area), volume of stands and the necessary types of cuts. The FMP does not make explicit decisions on the silvicultural targets, e.g. on the mix of species. The FMP materials are available in electronic format on computers and mobile devices. The hunting and game management planning has been done separately from the FMP in 2008. (Kriskevich, pers. comm. 2015) Component 2.4: Decisions on implementation of forest management activities The overall annual harvest amounts for main use are based on the FMPs and approved by the Ministry of Forestry in agreement with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. The resulting aggregated country-wide annual allowable cut for main use is approved by the government. The determination of the logging areas is done by the local state forestry enterprises. For the use of forest resources the respective permitting documents are issued by the state forestry enterprises to the forest users. The forest cutting permits contain all specifics on the amount, type of wood and time for logging and transportation of the harvested wood. (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015) The decisions on the silvicultural targets, in particular on the mix of species are made by the forester of the forestry unit in the frame of the FMP (Kriskevich, pers. comm. 2015). Thinning operations are used to regulate the species composition. All thinning is for each section defined in the FMP, except of the first thinning in newly planted young growth (osvetlenie - \u043e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) (Dmitriev, Minsk State Production Forestry Association, pers. comm. 2015). Decisions on the lease of forests are made by the district administrations, except about leases for the purpose of logging which are decided by the region administration in agreement with the state forestry enterprises. (Dmitriev, Minsk State Production Forestry Association, pers. comm. 2015) 174 Fig. 8: Integration of harvest and regeneration. Within three years after logging reforestation has to take place, usually this is done within one year. The state forestry enterprises elaborate their own reforestation projects, based on the local forest stand conditions (Dmitriev, Minsk State Production Forestry Association, pers. comm. 2015). Observations in the \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d showed that the state forestry enterprise makes decisions on the use of natural rejuvenation techniques, where suitable, and carries out main use logging in a way that support natural rejuvenation. As long as young growth of the required quality and quantity is established in this way, the state forestry enterprise is not forced to carry out reforestation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5a2dd50-ed07-4abb-a375-053ec4e3f769": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5a2dd50-ed07-4abb-a375-053ec4e3f769", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64e1e5b6ec210275255f91aea5bc647cb05c34102f91d3a625c7550d200c5f72"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a9cc4de-034e-4c89-b0fb-90534655f66e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6867bca9be82c2119ee5e32bcbe8584d3f011d0919fa9aeabbb7f0972fb1c16"}}, "hash": "c4961fc00d6fbd5dd952da5ca14d7bfe01724be2034a7987aa96d62530387b73", "text": "National experts of ENPI-FLEG have criticized the decision making process on harvest activities as being potentially prone to abuse and corruption. This concerns in particular the procedure for issuing the forest cutting permit by the legal entity that is carrying out the forest management and is themselves doing the harvest. This combination of regulatory and controlling functions with the role of being the forest user is seen as possibly allowing for illegal harvest. Another critical issue of the decision making on forestry activities is the possibility of issuing the permit within one month post factum in case of urgency (trees causing danger or trees cut under specific circumstances).

The existing system of decision making, control and oversight within the hierarchical structures of the Ministry of Forestry, the elaboration of the FMP by BELGOSLES independently from the state forestry enterprise, the region state production forestry associations and the state forestry enterprises, in combination with the existence of the State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President as an effective external control and law enforcement organ, make substantial abuse and violations very unlikely. 175 Pillar 3: Implementation, enforcement and compliance Component 3.1: Capacity of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations The capacity of all visited organizations and hierarchical levels in the forestry sector of Belarus is fully adequate in terms of staff qualification and technology as well as equipment, infrastructure and finances. The forest inventory and management planning enterprise \u201cBELGOSLES\u201d is even able to provide its services to forest users in Russia. The Minsk State Production Forestry Association has 45 staff and is capable to fulfil its functions. Fig. 9: Harvester in Logoyskiy Leskhoz. The state forestry enterprise visited in the case study, \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d and its forestry unit \u201cKozyrskoe Lesnichestvo\u201d are adequately staffed and equipped and the visited infrastructure (central administration building, forestry unit building, roads, machinery etc.) are in good condition. The conditions of the visited forests and quality of the forest management activities (marking of perspective trees for selection purposes, thinning areas, logging areas with natural rejuvenation, reforestation with seedlings) indicate the adequate capacity of this state forestry enterprise and its forestry units. The region and district level administrations lack the technical capacity to fulfil entirely their substantial decision making mandate. At region level the state production forestry associations are subordinated to the first deputy head of the region, but without a unit of qualified staff existing in these administrations. Similarly, the district administrations, which according to article 13 of the Forest Code have substantial decision making authority on the forests in their jurisdiction, do not have qualified staff for carrying out these functions. Thus all these functions are in fact executed by the state forestry enterprises, which prepare the decisions that are then adopted by the district administrations. (Dmitriev, Minsk State Production Forestry Association, pers. comm. 2015) This compensation of insufficient capacity in region and district administrations by the capacity of the 176 forestry organization is working well, where the relations between them are good as it is the case in the \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d. Generally, in Minsk Region this collaboration is functioning and some directors of state forestry enterprises are elected deputies of the region council. Fig. 10: Administration building of forestry unit. Component 3.2: Forest law enforcement The prevention of violations and enforcement of the forest legislation is the task of the State Forest Protection which is formed by the rangers and technical staff of the state forestry organizations, including the state forestry enterprises, the six region state production forestry associations and the Ministry of Forestry. About 13,000 official persons are patrolling the forest areas. (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015) The State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President with its local branches is an additional and important law enforcement agency. This inspection service is directly subordinated to the President and carries out independent law enforcement and control of the forest users, including the state forestry enterprises (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015). The inspection service was established mainly to prevent illegal hunting and fishing, which after the independence of Belarus had substantially increased. During this time poaching by VIP and illegal forest use by influential people were hard to address by state forestry enterprise staff. In this situation the establishment of an independent inspection service with direct highest level subordination was highly effective. The inspection service established good collaboration with the state forestry enterprises. Due to the effectiveness of the law enforcement, problems with illegal harvest of forest products and poaching almost disappeared.

The state forestry enterprise installed gates, automatic cameras and warning signs for the prevention of unauthorized vehicle access to forests and related fire risk and pollution with trash. Fig. 11: Control of access to the forests and warning sign. With the success of the law enforcement, the pressure on the state forestry enterprises by the State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President grew. It seems that the number of detected violations is an indicator by which the inspection is perceived to show the effects of its activity. This indicator of constant or increasing numbers of detected violations is actually not suitable for measuring effective law enforcement (the indicator should be the decrease of violations, not the increase of detections), and it leads to unintended problems. The inspection service tends to apply rules in an overly rigid and inappropriate way. For instance, in the case study area in the FMP for one plot only pine were considered for harvest, but during the forestry works some birch trees, which that are generally considered being of lower value, were damaged; and the staff of the state forestry enterprise cut and removed these damaged trees. In the result, the inspection service considered the entire cut as illegal cut, not just the few birches, which were not mentioned in the FMP and were accordingly missing in the forest cutting permit. The state forestry enterprise was fined for this violation; and the prosecutor demanded that the worker in charge would be fined in accordance to the damage, calculated by the entire cut. This amount would be far beyond the financial opportunities of a forest worker. In the result of this and similar cases, it becomes increasingly difficult for the state forestry enterprise to attract local people to work in forestry as people consider the danger very high to be heavily fined for minor mistakes. 178 Component 3.3 Administration of forest and land ownership and user rights The administration of forest and land ownership and user rights is in the authority of the land-use agencies at different levels, mainly at district level. Currently \u201cBELGOSLES\u201d realizes a new work program for an update of the registration of all forest fund lands with their borders and size of areas for subsequent land registration and issuing of state certificates to the possessors of state forest. Component 3.4 Cooperation and coordination The cooperation between the state forestry enterprise and the district administration and rural councils in the area of the \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d has been characterised as satisfactory and effective (Kriskevich, pers. comm. 2015). Similarly the cooperation at the level of Minsk Region has been positively described by the Minsk State Production Forestry Association (Dmitriev, pers. comm. 2015). In contrast, the cooperation between the state forestry enterprise \u201cLogoyskiy Leskhoz\u201d and the State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President seemed tense due to the above mentioned cases of overreaching in law enforcement. The Consultant did not have the opportunity to crosscheck the statements with the region and district administrations, rural councils and the inspection service. The CPC, however, confirmed the impressions for the specific region and forestry enterprise as well as their typical character for the general situation in the country. Component 3.5 Measures to address corruption and ensure transparency The Consultant specifically asked all interviewed persons about corruption problems and measures to address these. Belarus was rated by Transparency International in the corruption perception index 2014 with a score of 31 and a rank of 119 out of 175113. This is the medium perceived corruption in the ENPI countries (with Georgia, Armenia and Moldova receiving better rankings). This ranking was not reflected in the interviews with representatives of forestry organizations, the CPC as well as in talks with occasional people not related to the sector, which all stated a low corruption level and effectiveness of anti-corruption measures by the government. The results of the analysis of the elements of governance related to legal framework, mandates of organizations, planning, decision making, harvest, processing and marketing of forest products and control and enforcement suggest that there are currently limited opportunities for corruption in the forest sector and in particular in the context of timber and other wood products. The national experts of ENPI-FLEG (\u041b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f et al. 2011) mentioned the potential of corruption provided by the combination in the state forestry enterprises of functions of allocation of forest resources to users and state control of protection and use of forests on one side and on the other side of being the immediate forest user.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ff9dcea-483e-4607-8329-c0075d7693f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ff9dcea-483e-4607-8329-c0075d7693f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e00309b3d03483ccab465d50a8209bbdcc8783c6afab4746628400797a034c1e"}}, "hash": "e00309b3d03483ccab465d50a8209bbdcc8783c6afab4746628400797a034c1e", "text": "The Consultant could not find a confirmation for the validity of this concern. The forest inventory and management planning by BELGOSLES, an institution independent from the state forestry enterprises, the decision making on timber harvest and the rules on marketing of harvested timber in combination with the independent and obviously strict control by the entirely independent State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President seem to be largely effective in the prevention of corruption related to timber harvest. The Consultant did not receive any information about possible corruption problems related to the allocation of forest areas for lease for logging and for other uses or to the transformation of forest lands into lands of other designation. 113 https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results 179 Conclusions In Belarus the former kolkhoz forests have been effectively integrated into the overall system of centrally managed state forests. Additionally, areas with succession of tree and shrub vegetation and areas suitable for afforestation were included into the forest fund or are in the process of being included. \u201cLocal forests\u201d are part of the state forests that are managed locally by the state forestry enterprises and are indistinguishable in terms of their governance. The provisions of the Forest Code provide the local district authorities with significant decision making authority on forest issues. In the practice of the visited region and state forests, which can be considered as typical for the entire country, these mandates are almost entirely delegated to the state forestry enterprise. Nevertheless, the district administrations, and at the next higher level the region administrations, have the opportunities to carry out their decision making authority and directly influence on the forests and their management. The legislation does not provide the opportunity to assign user rights on wood products to individuals, but only to specialized enterprises. The local population has access to NWFP, even for small-scale commercial use, and to fuel wood as well as to timber for personal use. Given this access to fuel wood and timber, the conditions of forests and the markets for forest products, there seems to be no need for and interest in individual lease of forests for harvest of wood products. Also illegal use of forest products, in particular unauthorized logging and poaching, are virtually absent. The current system of forest governance appears to be effective and satisfactory in terms of improving the conditions of the forests, ensuring the fulfilment of their ecological functions and increasing the area covered by forests while meeting the needs of the local population and contributing to the local and national economy. The certification of 55% of the total forest area by the FSC system and of 98% by the competing PEFC shows that the governance of Belarus\u2019 meets the requirements of international standards. . Fig. 12: FSC certificate of the Minsk region state forestry production association 180 The Consultant did not find convincing justification for the separation of functions at the level of the state forestry enterprises by establishing units for timber harvest and processing that would become separate entities from the state forestry enterprises, as recommended by the national experts (\u041b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f et al. 2011; \u041a\u0443\u0437\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432 et al. 2010) and included into the state policy. The expected positive impact of this intended division on the risks of illegal or unauthorized logging and corruption is not obvious while other measures addressing these risks are already effectively in place. Fig. 13: Marked \u201cpremium tree\u201d. The suggested separation of timber harvest and processing from silvicultural activities and forest protection may have unintended consequences affecting the sustainability of forest management and economic viability of the state forestry enterprises. The same entity being in charge of harvest, reforestation and silvicultural maintenance of the forest stands establishes incentives to carry out harvest in a way that allows for as much as possible natural rejuvenation. Where suitable site and stand conditions exist, even-aged forests, which are used in main use by clear cutting, can be transformed into mixed stands, which are used by selective logging without clear cuts, thus providing for the continuous preservation of the ecological character and functions of the forests and - by mainly relying on natural rejuvenation - reducing the costs of reforestation and maintenance of young growth. Further, keeping income creating activities of harvest and processing of timber within the same entity as the costly activities of reforestation, rejuvenation support, silvicultural maintenance and protection of forests, maintains the economic linkages between the different elements of forestry at local level and is likely more economically effective than a separation of these elements, which would also require new economic mechanisms for funding of the more", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65a08c02-606f-4abe-acec-51de6c20d82c": {"__data__": {"id_": "65a08c02-606f-4abe-acec-51de6c20d82c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "661f206828b4310d7f6d7b30f2e07b1832acebb4e28c0bb933b467199d048166"}, "3": {"node_id": "223625c2-6ec6-4caa-8000-3fa243945956", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50b5120c63d057fa6a996e18635d7787d8f1a41b08027034d6bb31855d0b6a4d"}}, "hash": "b773a90418d2241410876df90606deb25ca2e4aeca6a9c8177ef3204abc51b8e", "text": "costly elements of forest management.

Recommendations The system of governance of Belarus\u2019 forests is in permanent development in accordance to technical progress and changing ecological, economic, social and political conditions. National experts have prepared detailed analytic reports on the legal and regulatory frameworks of forestry as well as on the forest management and use systems in Belarus and made recommendations on their improvement. These recommendations might partly be already implemented or will be reflected in new policy documents and in the new Forest Code of Belarus and the updated related bylaws. The findings of this case study suggest that the existing system works rather effective and from the perspective of governance may not require substantial changes. The Consultant therefore recommends reassessing the potential risks and benefits of the intended separation of functions and authorities of the state forestry enterprises by establishing independent entities for timber harvest and processing. The Consultant recommends the consideration of alternative options. As additional preventive measure against unauthorized use and corruption, the authority of issuing of the forest cutting permits might be transferred from the state forestry enterprises to the region state production forestry associations, possibly with obligatory agreement with or endorsement by the region level environmental protection authorities. It is recommended to keep in the same entity and economically and institutionally linked the income creating elements of forestry, in particular logging activities, with the more costly functions of regeneration of forests, silvicultural maintenance, protection and control of forest use by external users.

Introduction The following case study presents the findings from the mission to Georgia during June 15-21, 2015. The Consultant visited five municipalities that represent different situations in terms of forest conditions and relations of local self-governance bodies to the governance of local forests. Forests cover about 40% of Georgia\u2019s territory, i.e. approx. 27,800 km\u00b2, and 95-95% of the forests are of natural origin (MENRP/NFA 2014). Between 1992 and 2007 the forest cover increased due to natural succession on small abandoned fields and pastures, but at the same time forests degraded because of unsustainable use. Illegal logging after 2007 caused significant deforestation in some areas.

This case study does not attempt to present a full history of these reforms and to analyse their results but refers only to the aspects that are important for the understanding of the current situation, dynamics and perspectives in governance of the country\u2019s local forests. Prior to the enactment of the \u201cOrganic Law on Local Self-Government\u201d in 2005, the communes (in Soviet times \u201cselsovet\u201d), comprising one or several villages, were the lowest administrative territorial level with a self-governing body (DFS et al. 2008). With enactment of the \u201cOrganic Law on Local Self-Government\u201d the next higher level, the districts (in former times \u201crayon\u201d) became the lowest administrative territorial level with a self-governing body. This lowest level with a representative body (council, in Georgian \u201csakrebulo\u201d) and an administrative body (administration or city hall, in Georgian \u201cgamgeoba\u201d) is now called and referred to in this study as \u201cmunicipality\u201d. The formerly lowest level of administrative territorial which could in rural areas consist of one or several villages, sometimes called by stakeholders \u201ccommunity\u201d or \u201cvillage (administration)\u201d is in this study referred to as \u201csub- unit\u201d. The \u201cOrganic Law on Local Self-Government\u201d stipulated the transfer of the management of forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d into the ownership and exclusive authority of the municipalities. What forests actually belong to the category of \u201clocal importance\u201d was not defined, but the broad perception was that this category would include all forests that in the Soviet past were in permanent land-use by collective farms (kolkhoz). By September 2007 it had been planned to hand over to municipalities 850,000 ha of forests, out of which 530,000 ha were former kolkhoz forest (Macharashvili, pers. comm. 2015). The KfW German Development Bank, with financial support by the French Development Agency, after a long preparation and negotiation phase in 2007 launched the Communal Forest Pilot Project Kharagauli (DFS et al. 2008). For reasons that are not publicly documented this project was not successful. So far the transfer of forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d to the municipalities did not take place anywhere in Georgia with few exceptions: forests within the City boundaries of Tbilisi (designated as \u201cgreen plantations\u201d), the forests of Tusheti Protected Landscape in the municipality of Akhmeta and about 1,500 ha in the municipality of Ambrolauri (region Racha- Lechkhumi and Kvemo-Svaneti). The forests in Ambrolauri were communalized in 2006 with the aim to privatize the land. This did not happen and these forests are in the reality without exercised ownership and any management (Macharashvili, pers. comm. 2015). The Sachkhere Municipality (Imereti) has kept its former kolkhoz forests since the end of communism (Tokliksihvili, Center for Development of Municipality Reform, pers. comm. 2015). Since around 2007 significant areas of forests with high economic potential have been assigned as long term concessions to commercial companies, in most cases of foreign origin. These 185 concessions had and have in some areas substantial impact on the access of local people to forests, on the conditions of forests and of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22d90b7a-456e-4915-b037-ccbe7a83e676": {"__data__": {"id_": "22d90b7a-456e-4915-b037-ccbe7a83e676", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f9e6beafd0e29213ef6481d1d630d71194ae314736736e7f445c8f06e1bcee7"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7fa166a-08db-4872-8a54-afc7c8225598", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "802e8fa571b8437377fedccbc1dbfa3f5c9f7804e5178c420e2cc546e74a2b38"}}, "hash": "946fc7de40750533881ff743193a42efbc4418e3e912a192799613592e4bca78", "text": "the local infrastructure. The issue of transfer of management authority of forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d is still stipulated in the law, considered by policy makers and vaguely reflected in the National Forest Concept for Georgia. Local stakeholders and municipality representatives repeatedly raised their voices and requested the handover of authority over local forests. For these reasons the existing governance of local forests and the potential of its future development are of high relevance for Georgia\u2019s forest sector and can provide an interesting example for the region of the ENPI-FLEG II programme. As forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d are not clearly delimited this case study assesses the situation mainly from the perspective of the municipalities and their perception of forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d.

He conducted semi-structured interviews with representatives of the municipalities and with forestry experts in different state, private and non-commercial organizations 187 at national level. It was not possible to visit the local representations/forestry units114 under the NFA because of the limited time for this study and the absence of their representatives from their offices during the site visits. During his site visits the Consultant was accompanied by Marika Katarishvili (CPC Georgia of ENPI- FLEG II, IUCN component). Tbilisi The municipality of Tbilisi in 2010 took over the Tskhneti Forestry Unit with 8,600 ha forests, dominantly artificial pine plantations (Giorgobiani, Ecology and Green Spaces Department Tbilisi, pers. comm. 2015). By Government Decree all forest areas of the municipality were declared as \u201crecreational zone\u201d or \u201cgreen plantation\u201d (MENRP/NFA 2014), i.e. the designation of the land was changed to non-forest. This allowed also for easy transformation of attractive plots into other use and has caused e.g. housing development on riverbanks that where in June 2015 affected by the flood. The MENRP has no authority on the territory of Tbilisi and does not control the management of the de-facto forests there.

The municipality is generally ready to take over forests, but would also be satisfied if the interests and needs of the local population would be addressed through the management of the state forests under the NFA.

The total municipality area is 264,000 ha, of which 74,000 ha forest, with about 50% kolkhoz forest. About 5,000 ha of the state forests outside Tusheti Protected Landscape are since 2008 assigned for 25 years as concession to a Chinese company.

Findings While these findings refer to the elements of the governance frameworks (as explained in the method section of the Regional Study), the Consultant does not attempt to cover here all pillars and their components in all detail, but presents the specific aspects identified at the visited sites and being of relevance for this case study. Pillar 1: Policy, legal, institutional and regulatory frameworks Component 1.1: Policies The Government of Georgia in its Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection (MENRP) has established a special unit for the development of the country\u2019s forestry policy - the Forest Policy Service. The MENRP together with the National Forestry Agency (NFA) has prepared the National Forest Concept of Georgia, which was approved by the Parliament in December 2013 (MENRP/NFA 2014). This document is the basis for the further development of the forestry policy and the ongoing revisions of the legal and regulatory frameworks. The goal of the National Forest Concept and of the country\u2019s policy is \u201c\u2026 to establish a system of sustainable forest management that will ensure: improvement of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of Georgian forests, protection of biological diversity, effective use of the economic potential of forests taking into account their ecological value, public participation in forest management related issues, and fair distribution of derived benefits. \u2026\u201d. The main principles listed in this concept are \u201c1. Sustainable Management of Forests; 2. Precautionary principle; 3. \u201cAll forests are local\u201d; 4. Separation of policy, management and supervision functions; and 5. Forestry as an integral part of the sustainable development of the country.\u201d (MENRP/NFA 2014) The National Forest Concept states as one of the problems of the sector that \u201cforests have not been transferred to local self-governance units due to weak municipal governance\u201d. However, among a number of other fundamental problems of the sector, at the same time it is recognized that \u201cforest management bodies cannot ensure effective management due to limited human and financial resources\u201d and that \u201cleasing of productive forests to the private sector for long-term use (i.e. concessions, the Consultant) has increased the pressure on other forest areas used for meeting social needs\u201d.

The intended development of (currently not existing) \u201cState bodies\u201d for local on-the-ground forest management activities indicates a priority of state ownership and management of forests, and the intention of rather limited if any transfer of forests to the municipalities.

No budget funding would be available for communal forestry, only self-financing is expected (\u201cmunicipalities have enough income\u201d). (Amirgulashvili, MENRP, pers. comm. 2015) This statement on financing of forest management by municipalities is in remarkable contrast to the planned state funding for forestry by state forest management bodies as illustrated by the above mentioned intention in the National Forest Concept. The MENRP representative explained that only \u201ccontrol functions\u201d for local forests could be funded by the state budget (Amirgulashvili, MENRP, pers. comm. 2015). But the Consultant understands that the intended division of functions would likely place these control functions outside of the mandate of the municipalities. On the other hand, the MENRP does not want to transfer productive forests to the municipalities (Amirgulashvili, MENRP, pers. comm. 2015). These statements show that so far the transfer of forests to the municipalities is not fully elaborated as element of the forestry policy. However, the draft new Forest Code is said to provide specific regulations for communal forestry and requirements for the transfer of forests into communal management and possibly later into communal ownership. In contrast to the plans for communal forestry, the presented intentions of the Forest Policy Service in terms of state forest management and private forest management appeared much more elaborated and showed comparably clear concepts. Amirgulashvili (pers. comm. 2015) explained the following intentions: The forestry administration planned as an independent economic entity, i.e. state-owned Ltd. with territorial units, that would do the forest management on the ground, but no local state forestry enterprises would be established. This state forestry administration would only be in charge of own areas, i.e. of state forest in the narrow sense, and implement forest management. All supervisory (sovereign) functions would be held in the MENRP, for all types of forest ownership and management. The approach of commercial forestry concessions was considered not successful by the MENRP. Since 2013 no new concessions were assigned. Only 45 concessions are currently left, and these will be phased out. Private forest ownership is thinkable for forests established through natural succession or afforestation of lands without forest cover. No privatization of existing forest is envisaged. The problem for the development of private forests is that in Georgian law private owners are not bound to ensure public benefits. (Amirgulashvili, MENRP, pers. comm. 2015) Component 1.2: Legal and regulatory frameworks The Forest Code of Georgia enacted in 1999 has been amended in 2009, 2010 (two times), 2011 (six times), and 2013. Some rules and regulations of the acting Forest Code do not fully correspond to the actually intended forest policy. A new Forest Code is under development and supposed to be adopted in the nearest future (Amirgulashvili, Forest Policy Service MENRP, pers. comm. 2015). 193 The acting Forest Code is vague about what regulations apply to the entire forest fund and what regulations concern only the state forest fund managed by the NFA. This indifference is possibly caused by the fact that during the time of adoption of the Forest Code basically all forests of Georgia belonged to the state forest fund in the strict sense.

The Consultant was not able to check what bylaws are still acting, what have been replaced or formally abolished and what lost relevance by being overruled by newer legislation, but the ENPI- FLEG II CPC confirmed that all above mentioned are still acting (Katarishvili, pers. comm. 2015). Bylaws were subject to frequent changes and the Consultant was not able to get access to the most recent versions of the bylaws. According to Macharashvili (2012), for instance the abovementioned Government Decree \u201cOn approval of regulations on the rules and terms of issuing licenses for use of forest\u201d #132/2005 has been changed sixty times until 2012 and the Government Decree #242/2010 \u201cOn approval of the rules of forest use\u201d 27 times. These frequent changes have not always removed contradictions in the legislation but some have even added inconsistency and have caused instability of the regulatory framework. Other laws of relevance (after Macharashvili 2012) are the law of Georgia \u201cOn Environment Protection\u201d (1996) which is a framework law that is providing general principles of environment protection and legal terminology and regulates among other issues the rights and obligations of citizens in the sphere of environmental protection. The law of Georgia \u201cOn the Fees for Use of Natural Resources\u201d (2004) entered into force on 1 January 2005. It defines the fees for the use of bulbous plants and fir cones \u2013 per kilogram, for wood \u2013 per cubic meter and provides that fees go to the local budget of the region, where the resources were extracted. The law of Georgia \u201cOn Licenses and Permits\u201d (2005) provides a full list of activities that are subject to licensing and permitting as well as types of licenses and permits, which in the sphere of forestry include the special logging license and licenses for use for exporting purposes of fir cones and of plant species, listed in the annexes to CITES. No other licences related to forestry are issued at present. Accordingly, harvest of fuel wood for personal use by the local population is not subject of licensing. This law as well governs the permits for \u201cenvironmental impact\u201d and for \u201cexport, import, re-export and introduction from the sea of species listed in annexes to CITES\u201d. The law of Georgia \u201cOn the protected areas system\u201d #136-IIs, March 7, 1996 is of relevance for the governance of forests in protected areas. The Protected Landscape in Tusheti, one of the case study sites, has been established by a separate law \u201cOn the establishment and management of Tusheti, Batsara- 194 Babaneuri, Lagodekhi and Vashlovani Protected Areas\u201d #2086-Is, April 22, 2003. The Code of Georgia on Local Self-Government (2014) regulates the mandate and rights of local self-governance bodies on natural resources within the boundaries of the respective administrative territorial units. Component 1.3: Ownership and user right systems Forests can be in state, communal or private ownership. Private ownership of forests by natural persons or legal entities does not yet play a major role and the Forest Policy Service (Amirgulashvili, MENRP, 2015) sees a perspective of this type of ownership only for newly established forests on lands formerly not covered by forests. It will become formally recognized in the new Forest Code, which is currently under preparation (Katarashvili, in lit., 2016). Macharashvili (pers. com. 2015) considers municipality ownership as a form of state ownership. Similarly, the Forest Code in Art. 5.f treats the \u201cLocal Forest Fund\u201d as part of the \u201cState Forest Fund\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b98f3dd-5c18-468d-b8d7-52182451911e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b98f3dd-5c18-468d-b8d7-52182451911e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76699cc6acc687062c1a0b4e936f52f569252cbfb79973e74cf1c2355ee8c671"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4dfc190-25b9-4e45-9b64-f2ad034952b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0579b5dee40ab4d8e3744afd00302821f81f9453a5ee20218525c16063e59f9c"}}, "hash": "8633c4fcbb4bc3413f9fde127fd785ca5159f887dc0a2a8aff0640db4c2870fe", "text": "However, the \u201cRegulation on the order of the determination of forests of local significance\u201d (Government Decree #105/2007) regulates \u201cforests of local significance\u201d as separate from the \u201cState Forest Fund\u201d and interviewed local stakeholders as well as Amirgulashvili (MENRP, pers. comm. 2015) referred to municipality (i.e. communal) ownership as a form of ownership different from state ownership.

Thus no proper legal definition is provided what forests actually belong to the \u201cLocal Forest Fund\u201d and are to be managed by the municipalities. In this context it is contradictory that the Forest Code refers to the \u201cLocal Forest Fund\u201d as part of \u201cUsable State Forest Fund\u201d only, while the forests in Tusheti Protected Landscape are now in communal management despite formally belonging to the separate category mentioned in Art. 14 of the Forest Code, the \u201cForests of Protected Areas\u201d. The \u201cCode of Georgia on Local Self-Government\u201d (2014) was not available in English. The interviewed people explained that the relevant formulation in its article 107.I.d are the same as in the previous \u201cOrganic Law on of Georgia on Local Self-Government\u201d (2005), which in article 47.d states that local self-government units own the forests \u201chaving local importance\u201d on the territory of the self- governing unit (DFS, 2007). The \u201cexclusive authorities of the self-governance unit\u201d, as defined in Art. 16.2.g include the \u201cmanagement of forest (\u2026) resources of local importance\u201d. The new \u201cCode on Local Self-Government\u201d confirms this exclusive character of the rights of local self-governance bodies on resources of \u201clocal importance\u201d within the borders of the respective municipality. The MENRP and the NFA see this exclusiveness as removing any outside control by the state on forest management and use by the municipalities. In the case of the forests handed over to the municipality of Tbilisi this actually happened, confirming that this concern is not without justification. This case should not be seen as typical because of the change of the designation of the forests of Tbilisi to \u201crecreational zones\u201d or \u201cgreen plantations\u201d. Thus they formally do not longer belong to the Forest Fund and accordingly the Forest Code provides only guidance but not binding regulation anymore (Giorgobiani, Ecology and Green Spaces Department Tbilisi, pers. comm. 2015). The \u201cRegulation on the order of the determination of forests of local significance\u201d (Government Decree #105/2007) defined in Art. 3 that \u201cForest Fund of Local Significance is the Forest Fund that is transmitted to the local self-governing bodies and might be used by the local communities to meet their needs based on the order stipulated in the law\u201d thus making a logically not acceptable circular reference to Art. 47.d of the Forest Code. Art. 4 of these regulations determine \u201cBasic rules for the determination of the forest fund of local significance\u201d and include here forests within the boundaries 195 of the respective self-governing unit \u201con the territories of the former Kolkhoz forests and forest lands owned by Soviet Farming Administrations\u201d and \u201con the lands located next to the territories of the former Kolkhoz forests and forest lands owned by Soviet Farming Administrations\u201d. Forests of the State Forest Fund could be recognized as \u201cforests of local significance\u201d only after these forests are excluded from the State Forest Fund. As above mentioned this regulation contradicts the acting Forest Code that in Art. 5.f treats the \u201cLocal Forest Fund\u201d as part of the \u201cState Forest Fund\u201d. However, this bylaw has so far not been implemented and as understood by the Consultant the transfers of forests to local self-governance bodies in Tbilisi and Tusheti occurred on the basis of other legal documents. In the forests managed by the municipality of Tbilisi currently very little systematic use takes place. Only wood from felling and maintenance of trees is given for free to public objects and to people in need. The municipality did not continue thinning operations that in 2012 had been experimentally undertaken to facilitate transformation from pine monocultures to mixed forests with a higher share of deciduous species and had led to good results. The income from the sale of the timber from these operations had been barely enough to cover the costs. Further, public reaction on these meaningful from a silvicultural perspective cuts had been very negative.

(IUCN CCC 2014) Forests under the NFA are allocated for short-term (up to one year, or seasonal) or long-term (up to 49 years, concessions) forest use. Forest use permits for short term use, for instance the harvest of fuel wood, are issued by the local representations of the NFA for limited time periods and specific areas. Local people shall be given priority in receiving permits. Local household can apply for the allocation of standing timber at their local municipality. The municipality would forward the list of applicants to the region level administration (governor\u2019s office) for submission of the application to the NFA. The NFA decides about allocation of timber and sends the approved list of household names to the bank, where the household representative pays the fee. The local forester assigns the standing the timber and after cutting the forester has issues a special permission for transportation of the timber out of the forest. (Katarashvili, CPC Georgia, in lit., 2016) However, municipality representatives complained to the Consultant that local households do not have direct access to construction timber from the forests. It is not clear if local households either do not know about the procedure or find it too complicated or, if despite the existence of the procedure, the access to timber is not approved in the practice. In the case study areas of Tianeti (Shetekauri, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015) and Akhmeta (municipality council, pers. comm. 2015) local representatives complained that the local NFA offices issue the permits late in the season and in the result the access to the assigned areas is difficult and harvest in fall would not provide enough time for drying of the fuel wood before the heating season. Proper drying of fuel wood would actually require storing it for at least one, better two summers. This would substantially reduce the fuel wood consumption, but would require initially higher harvest quota to store wood for later years. However, Bagaturia (pers. comm. 2015) expects that local people may sell the surplus instead of storing it, as it is already now the case. 196 The access to fuel wood and timber for local people seems to depend in some extent on the local representations/forestry units of the NFA. In the case-study area Kharagauli (Magradze, community council, pers. comm. 2015) the NFA (local office/forestry unit of the Imereti Forestry Service) does issue forest cutting permits (6 GEL/m\u00b3) for fuel wood. Per household 7 m\u00b3 are allocated, formerly 5 m\u00b3. But in the reality people use even more. In Tianeti, which has a harsher climate and longer winter than Kharagauli, the need is estimated with 15 m\u00b3/ per household (Shetekauri, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015). In Baghdati last year the municipality obtained with some pressure a permit from the NFA for cutting of 600 m\u00b3 to support local people. The municipality hired a local company to do the selective logging. However, there are no permanent or long term rights in place. (Gegeshidze, municipality administration, pers. comm. 2015) The municipality representative in Kharagauli (Magradze, pers. comm. 2015) complained about the lack of access to construction timber, even for fencing and vineyard poles. A private sawmill in the municipality has to buy logs at auctions, as the NFA does neither issue timber logging permits nor sells timber locally. The representative of Akhmeta municipality council (Jugashvili, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015) explained that a long and cumbersome procedure is needed for local people to get access to timber for their personal needs. People have to apply to their local representative of municipality; then the head of the municipality would have to submit the application to the NFA. This procedure is also to be applied for the forests already transferred to the municipality (according the Government Decree #242/2010). Akhmeta had been famous for wood processing; now none of the workshops is active due to lack of material because timber for processing is only harvested in concession areas.

Fig. 7: Horses grazing at the edge of forest \u2013 Kharagauli 2007 Commercially attractive forest plots have been assigned as concessions to foreign and domestic companies based on auctions. According to Amirgulashvili (MENRP, pers. comm. 2015) currently still 45 concessions exist. Concessions do not mean full scale cutting (according to Government Decree #132/2005, amended 2006), but concessionaires have to implement entire management plans. (Macharashvili pers. comm. 2015) In all visited case-study areas, except Tbilisi, concessions exist and most are assigned to Chinese companies. The contract terms, including rights and obligations of the concessionaires and often even the boundaries of the assigned concessions, are not known to the municipalities. Local people are not allowed to use the concession areas and to collect as fuel wood commercially valueless dead wood and logging remnants. This seems to be in contradiction to the Government Decree #132/2005 that states that the concessionaires are not allowed to hinder the state forest authorities in issuing of permits for fuel wood harvest for personal use by the local population (IUCN CCC 2014). While legally a concession does not include the lease of the land itself, most concessionaires behave as it would be their land and not just limited to specific use rights of forests. (All interviewed municipality representatives, pers. comm. 2015). The representative of Akhmeta municipality assumed that concessionaire should not only do harvest activities but also forest management and own protection of the forests in the concession area. But in fact nothing except logging takes place and even cases of the concessionaire cutting outside of the assigned areas have been reported. (Jugashvili, municipality Council, pers. comm. 2015) 198 Component 1.4: Mandates of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection (MENRP) is the state body having the mandate to develop the national forest sector policy that is then adopted by the Parliament of Georgia. The MENRP also has the mandate of supervision and control of the subordinated National Forest Agency (NFA) and the Agency for Protected Areas (APA) as well as all forest use and forest users. At the same time the MENRP assigned the concessions. Macharashvili (pers. comm. 2015) sees this combination of all control as well as permitting and use functions under one umbrella as problematic. The National Forestry Agency (NFA) was established in its current form in May 2013 by the Government resolution #93/2013 (25/04/2013) \u201cOn reorganization, defining the rights and responsibilities of the legal entities of public laws under the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources\u201d and Decree #25/2013 (10/05/2013) of the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Protection \u201cOn approval of the statute of the LEPL National Forestry Agency\u201d (both available in Georgian only). The NFA has departments for forest maintenance and reforestation, forest inventory, forest use, finances, legal issues, administration and internal control. The NFA plans, organizes and supervises reforestation activities only in the forests managed by the NFA. The NFA regulates forest use, and through its regional Forestry Services and local representations/forestry units determines wood cutting areas for firewood harvest, plans forest roads and prepares the documentation and draft contracts for forest use concessions and controls the implementation of these activities.122 Further, the NFA drafts legal regulations. The NFA has nine regional units, the Kakheti Forestry Service123, Kvemo Kartli Forestry Service, Mtskheta-Mtianeti Forestry Service, Shida Kartli Forestry Service, Samtskhe-Javakheti Forestry Service, Imereti Forestry Service, Guria Forestry Service, Racha Lechkhumi-Kvemo Svaneti Forestry Service and Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti Forestry Service. Each of the Forestry Services is in charge of the forests under the NFA in the municipalities of the respective region.

Managed reserves can be assigned as hunting concessions and protected landscapes are to be managed by the administration established by the respective local municipality, which governs the area in cooperation with the Agency of Protected Areas (APA 2015124125. The management of Tusheti Protected Landscape is accordingly in the hand of the municipality of Akhmeta which cooperates with APA in the frame of Tusheti Protected Areas that include as well a strict nature reserve and a national park, and the MENRP has the mandate to control their protection, management and use. So far the Tusheti PL is the only protected area in Georgia not managed by APA but by the local municipality (Kavtarishvili, pers. comm. 2015). The mandate of local-self-governance bodies is defined by the \u201cCode of Georgia on Local Self- Government\u201d, which was not available for the Consultant. As mentioned under component 1.3, according to the previous \u201cOrganic Law of Georgia on Local Self-Government\u201d the self-governance bodies have exclusive authority on management of forest (\u2026) resources of local importance. This authority is however so far not executable as \u201cforest resources of local importance\u201d are neither legally defined nor has authority on defined forests been formally transferred to the municipalities, with the exceptions mentioned in the introduction of this case study. Other relevant exclusive authorities under this law are management and disposal of property and land resources, budget authority, introduction of local taxes and fees within the limits envisaged by the law, collection of local fees and land-use planning. The Ecology and Green Spaces Department of the City Hall of Tbilisi manages the forests, parks and trees on public areas in the city of Tbilisi as well as the zoo and the botanical garden. The department has own workforce only for the latter two, but it has to contract all other works to service providers. The department has no rangers for forest protection and prevention of illegal felling of trees despite having the respective mandate. For control and law enforcement the municipality has a separate inspection, which is independent of the Ecology and Ecology and Green Spaces Department. Component 1.5: Financial arrangements, economic instruments and benefit sharing The MENRP and NFA are financed by the state budget.

The financial arrangements on the concessions are not transparent. None of the municipality representatives had seen the concession contracts. According to Gegeshidze (Baghdati municipality administration, pers. comm. 2015) the concessionaires had to pay a one-time high fee for the assignment of the concession. This fee went to the central budget. Annually the concessionaire has 124 http://apa.gov.ge/en/protected-areas/managedReserve 125 http://apa.gov.ge/en/protected-areas/Protected-Landscape 201 to pay fees per harvested amount (stumpage fee) in the range of 22 GEL/m\u00b3 for coniferous and 47 GEL/m\u00b3 for deciduous species. The municipality of Baghdati reportedly receives only 10,000 \u2013 12,000 GEL/year from the concessionaires. This amount seems very low, and would be equivalent to 212 to 545 m\u00b3 harvested timber only. The representative of the municipality of Tianeti (Shetekauri, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015), in addition to the one-time concession fee going to the central level and the harvest dependent stumpage fee, mentioned an area dependent fee of 3 GEL/ha for concessions that is not paid in the practice. Attempts by this municipality failed to receive from the concessionaires this \u201clease fee\u201d. The stumpage fees would be 6 GEL/m\u00b3 for fuel wood, of which 50% go to the local budget and 50% to the central budget. The fee for timber of deciduous species is 45 GEL/m\u00b3 that goes entirely to the municipality. The municipality has no means of controlling the real harvested volumes and assortments of timber. In Akhmeta (Jugashvili, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015) in 2014 officially 1,500 m\u00b3 of wood have been harvested by the Chinese concessionaire. This is below the permitted amount and was limited by the demand. The municipality received 47 GEL/m\u00b3 of fir timber. The head of Tusheti Protected Landscape mentioned the sharing of the fees between the state budget and the budget of Akhmeta municipality. The administration of the protected landscape can have own income, but it seems that they are not allowed to harvest wood resources for sale outside of the community. (Lagazidze, Tusheti PL, pers. comm. 2015) The municipality in Baghdati complained that they do not have a net benefit from the concessions. Heavy damage to roads, water and forest and the negative impact on the nearby health resort are said to outweigh by far the limited contribution to the municipality budget from stumpage fees and the benefits of limited employment of local people (Gegeshidze, municipality administration, pers. comm. 2015). In Akhmeta the stumpage fees the municipality receives are said to be insufficient for repairing the damage caused to roads by the transportation of the logs from the concession (Jugashvili, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015). In Tianeti (Shetekauri, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015) concessions may cover 15% of the forests in the municipality, in particular easy accessible forests forcing the inhabitants to get fuel wood from remote and difficult accessible forests. Employment in the forestry sector is very limited. Most local forestry units of the NFA have only 10- 20 employees in one municipality. Concessionaires often hire workers from outside of the local municipalities. In Kharagauli and, more significant, in Akhmeta local wood processing industry, e.g. furniture production, in the past provided local incomes. With the assignment of concessions to external companies and the sale of timber trough auctions only, the cost of raw materials and related transaction costs became prohibitive for the economic viability of these small-scale factories.

Non-timber forest products used by locals are: mushrooms, berries and herbs (for tea and medicine). They are used by approximately 38% of the households, generally gathered in small quantities, mostly for self- consumption. In addition, the Tusheti PL aims to develop recreational use activities. (IUCN CCC 2014) In Kharagauli 7 m\u00b3 fuel wood is allocated per household and local people sell surplus fuel wood, which they harvest based on their forest cutting permits. Some people provide services of cutting and transportation of fuel wood for other people based on either their own permits or their clients\u2019 permits. In Akhmeta the head of the municipality council (pers. comm. 2015) explicitly mentioned that local people understand protective functions of forests against floods and other benefits. As these forests protect an important water catchment basin, supplying the Mingechevir Reservoir in Azerbaijan payments for ecosystem services would be thinkable as economic mechanism to fund forest protection and management in the area of the municipality. Pillar 2: Planning and decision-making processes Component 2.1: Stakeholder participation Fig. 8: Local stakeholder participation \u2013 Kharagauli 2007 Macharashvili (2012) in detail presented the problems of insufficient transparency and public participation in the reform of the forest sector, the development of its legislation as well as in the decisions on forest use, in particular on the allocation of concessions as well as in the elaboration of forest management plans. The NGO \u201cAssociation Green Alternative\u201d challenged a number of concession allocations in administrative complains and court cases, basing their claims on wrong data in the documents, inadequate concession terms and lack of public and in particular local community participation. Although the claims of Green Alternative were dismissed in lawsuits, finally four out of 12 concessions were annulled and two were substantially modified. The forest management planning procedure was modified and a new bylaw (#179/2013) enacted since the report of Macharashvili (2012). Participation in forest inventory and management planning is assessed in component 2.3. 203 In line with the facts presented by Macharashvili (2012) the Consultant found that information and participation at the local level and in particular of municipality organs is week, especially on all issues concerning the forestry concessions. All representatives of the four municipalities with concessions expressed serious dissatisfaction about the information available to them on concession and the lack of opportunities to participate in the decision making when the concessions were assigned. None of the municipality organs, neither administrations nor councils, had seen the concession contracts or received at least basic information on terms and conditions and maps indicating the boundaries of the concessions. Attempts by municipalities to receive concession contracts and maps with accurate concession boundaries from the NFA or the MNERP generally failed. One municipality even expressed doubts that the MENRP possesses maps with the concession boundaries. The lack of maps and of exact demarcation of concession boundaries makes it difficult to identify possible overlaps of concessions with former kolkhoz forests and other forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d. Even the contacts of the concessionaires the municipality had to find out by themselves. Municipalities were told on their request for information that \u201cconcession contracts are \u201ccommercial secret\u201d, which cannot be made accessible for the municipality\u201d (Gegeshidze, municipality administration, pers. comm. 2015). At best municipalities have received very general information about the concession areas. No mechanisms are in place that would oblige concessionaires to share information or to allow for influence of the municipalities on their work. It seems that in the context of the liberal economic reforms in Georgia the interests of perceived \u201cinvestors\u201d were much higher rated than those of the local communities and their self-governance organs. Now legal solutions of the issue are difficult to achieve. Some concession contracts might be legally problematic, and hiding them is therefor in the interest of concessionaires and state representatives involved. Generally Chinese companies dominate the concessions in the case study areas and have often longer contract terms and larger areas assigned than domestic companies. In one municipality a concession was assigned to a domestic company owned by the former head of the municipality. In the municipality Baghdati (Gegeshidze, municipality administration, pers. comm. 2015) the protection zone of a health resort was substantially reduced in favor of a concession. While access to information and public participation are week as far as concerning the concessions, in contrast mass-media campaigns and public perception can effectively hamper reasonable and sustainable forest management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af8b203b-d59b-415d-94e8-6379072ff5b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "af8b203b-d59b-415d-94e8-6379072ff5b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "007da62a399daf3748ecb415da7ccd7706d1ebf379d096d8ebb068ab4635817a"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b0e3024-93f1-4181-8068-38052d633cab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53159b6356ebf83f771eff5d65549494e5394c195da66f38051c96801cf54b4d"}}, "hash": "c2b5d961c49a4bb81192056a081097926a5770d3b3ba3b9ac071cd7d0ad19916", "text": "In Tbilisi mass-media and broad public are very negative towards any forestry works, and there is obviously little opportunity to counter with good arguments.

Similarly WWF in its forest transformation project has been influenced by this negative public attitude and refrained from any cuttings in artificial pine monocultures, which would have been necessary to support their transformation in close-to-nature forests (Michel 2014). At the other hand insufficient information and transparency and lack of public participation are major reasons for the negative attitude and general resistance towards any logging by the broad public, even if it would be technically meaningful. (Macharashvili, pers. comm. 2015) The size of Georgia\u2019s municipalities that correspond to the former districts may in the future hamper participation in decision making and forest management at the community level (village level). The sub-units of the municipalities in rural areas correspond to the former lowest level of local self- governance, the rural councils. These sub-units currently do not have their own status. Establishing some level of public self-governance of the sub-units, as considered in the context of changes to the Code on Local Self-Governance planned for 2016 (Magradze, municipality council Kharagauli, pers. comm. 2015), would allow for more substantial participation of local stakeholders in the communities. 204 Component 2.2: Planning and decision making on conversion of land from forest to non- forest and vice versa Generally, the change of the designation of land is not difficult to achieve. The change of land-use designation from forestry to other designation has often been misused for privatization of lands as forests cannot be privatized (Macharashvili, pers. comm. 2015). In the past some changes of designations had been done via the Ministry of Economy and National Agency of Public Registry under the Ministry of Justice, sometimes even without asking the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection and the National Forestry Agency (Machavariani, NFA, pers. comm. 2015). Formally any kind of changes in forest land require the formal approval by the MENRP, based on a request from the Ministry of Economy (Kavtarishvili, in lit. 2016) In the frame of the new Forest Code a more technical forest definition will be applied that is in accordance to the FAO definition. In case this will pass, the forests of Tbilisi would automatically be again designated as forests and consequently fall back under the control of the MENRP. (Amirgulashvili, MENRP, pers. comm. 2015) Succession areas in some cases have been included into the forest fund by changing the designation of the lands. Where people would ask for revision of this change of land designation this would be done quickly where land-owners can present their certificate. (Machavariani, NFA, pers. comm. 2015) In the case study area Baghdati the municipality (Gegeshidze, municipality administration, pers. comm. 2015) intents to do a full inventory of the forest lands and to exclude deforested lands form the forest fund and change their designation to pasture. Similarly the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure considers an inventory and proper determination of forested and deforested lands as a prerequisite for the transfer of local forests to the municipalities (Toklikishvili, MRDI, pers. comm. 2015). Component 2.3: Decisions on forest inventory and management planning The acting Forest Code in Art. 23 and 24 describes the forest inventory and management planning (FMP, Rus. lesoustroystvo - \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) which is supposed to be updated every ten years. The Forest Code in Art. 24 suggests that inventory is obligatory for planning of forest use, but management plans are not mandatory as a basis for issuing permits for the actual use of forests. Possibly some bylaws set stricter rules, but in the practice many forest areas are used that do not have updated FMPs. The areas covered by the FMPs do not necessarily match with municipality boundaries. The NFA has its own system of dividing the local forestry units, and those units might be smaller or larger than a municipality The agency in charge of the forest inventory and management planning is the NFA\u2019s Forest Inventory Department.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff097e7c-8ba7-4378-8809-b963b03522ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff097e7c-8ba7-4378-8809-b963b03522ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1ea2b8a55b78a49ac242a15f683c289d95a46f6819b0a7562a165631622f87b"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b7c8159-3364-4261-80dd-b6b541a9ec9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b73d4d062d9d33df9df5c04dcc6dc2f79779ca76a895969292b105750a558d47"}}, "hash": "20d079f37e4c24dfa119b5d510c75afdc58762786eb91e58801c45f947dc3fbd", "text": "This department determines the forest fund boundaries and prepares suggestions for their correction; draws cadastral plans; organizes the monitoring and inventory of the state forest fund, as well as the development of forest management plans.126 The forest inventory and management planning is conducted by contracted private companies, based on a tender.

The \u201cRules\u201d provide enough flexibility for the forest management body to elaborate and adopt specific ToR for each planning area (Machavariani 2014), which allows for a certain level of flexibility. The costs of the FMP are in the average 11 GEL/ha. The inventory is not always based on fixed sample plots. These are only used for planned cutting areas; otherwise general eye taxation is used. The inventory for each smallest homogenous parcel contains data on: species; general stand characteristics; height, average diameter (but not measurement of the basal area); density (\u201cpolnota\u201d and/or canopy closure); volume (based on old standard tables); dead wood, standing and lying. The inventory is done with software developed by \u201cGeographic\u201d that can be joined to GIS, but is not entirely satisfactory. A web-based application for the foresters to get mobile access to inventory data is currently in preparation. The management plan contains a determination of the target stand conditions. The TOR also require the determination of local demand for fuel and timber, but this is difficult to assess as local people would always claim higher needs to get access to surplus wood for sale. According to one service provider, in accordance to the TOR the FMP has to contain a large number of tables of limited use, which are often not understood even by the local forestry staff, but parts that people could understand are missing and local needs are inadequately reflected in the FMP. The interviewed service provider would prefer modern forest management plans, but so far the MENRP/NFA insisted in the old style, although by his opinion the FMP methodology is poorly understood in MENRP and NFA. (Bagaturia, pers. comm. 2015) Similarly the Deputy Head of the NFA (Machavariani, pers. comm. 2015) was not satisfied with the content of the recently elaborated FMP of Kharagauli. He found that the FMP was partly in old Soviet approach and style; ecological conditions as well as socio-economic aspects were copied and pasted from older documents, but not updated, and not integrated and considered in the management planning. Both, the private service provider and the NFA representative suggested that the separation of the inventory and the management planning and separate contracting might lead to more practically applicable, integrated management plans. A thinkable option would be that the experts of the NFA would themselves do the management planning, instead of letting the inventory company elaborate the plans. The Consultant would be concerned that such separation may make the integration of inventory results with the planning difficult and the inventory might become even less relevant for the planning than it is currently. While the Forest Code requires full public participation in the forest management planning, neither the \u201cRules\u201d (Government Decree #179) operationalize this requirement nor is there any other established mechanism in place for public participation in the practice. The \u201cRules\u201d include the following steps of information and participation (Machavariani, NFA, pers. comm. 2015): information about the FMP process is shared via internet; a meeting takes place at central level (but not necessarily at local level); the contractor reacts on comments received with responses and changes to the project. The interviewed service provider always meets in the process with heads of municipality, but this is not required by the \u201cRules\u201d (Bagaturia, pers. comm. 2015). Finally the FMP is to be approved by the MENRP. FMP are public documents and formally accessible for communal bodies. But visited municipality representatives stated that they are not informed about the results of the inventory and planning and the management plan is not shared with them. It seems that in the practice neither the NFA actively shares the FMP nor do municipalities make requests for access to them. For the forests of the municipality of Tbilisi an updated FMP does not exist. The results of the last inventory in 2006 were not processed and no management plan was elaborated.

On special request by the municipality, Merab Machavariani (Deputy Head NFA) held two meetings with local communities in which 25 people from all sub-units participated in one meeting and 45 people attended a separate meeting in one village only. However, nothing is known about the results of the inventory and planning and the management plan was not shared with the municipality. (Magradze, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015) In Baghdati (Gegeshidze, municipality administration, pers. comm. 2015) the most recent forest inventory and management planning are from 1985. The state budget is thought to have no funds allocated for the update of FMP. This, however, did not prevent the assignment of long-term concessions. The municipality would prefer to do the FMP themselves after the forests are handed over to it. In Tianeti the conduction of forest inventory and management planning is planned until the end of 2015 (Shetekauri, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015). In Akhmeta (Jugashvili, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015), similarly as in Baghdati, the most recent FMP is from 1986. The municipality does not have these materials, which are only kept in the NFA. The administration has only the map for Tusheti Protected Landscape, but obviously even not the inventory materials for these areas. A special management plan for Tusheti PL, for the period of 2014-2019, has been prepared by the Nature Conservation Agency of the Czech Republic (NCA CR) and Krkonose Mts National Park Administration (KNPA) (IUCN CCC 2014). The interviewed stakeholders did not mention this management plan and this plan has been approved only recently by Governmental resolution #272/2015 (17/06/2015). Its provisions for forest management are the application of the approach of close-to-nature forest management supplying local people with needed fuel wood and timber and prevention of bark beetle outbreaks and forest fires. An inventory and the development of rules for forest use are envisaged. The separate Management Plan for Tusheti Protected Areas (2014-2019) covers only the Tusheti Strict Nature Reserve and the Tusheti National Park and was approved by the Government of Georgia on January 2014 (IUCN CCC 2014). Machavariani (2014) suggests providing adequate technical assistance for the administration of Tusheti PL in the elaboration of simple and pragmatic ToR for their forest inventory and management planning. Component 2.4: Decisions on implementation of forest management activities Decisions on the implementation of forest management activities should be based on the approved and up-to-date FMP. However, as in most areas FMP are long outdated, decisions on the implementation of forest management activities are made on an ad-hoc basis. Currently the main silvicultural activities are practically on hold, with the exception of timber (and fuel wood) harvesting; no afforestation/reforestation, no early and mid-term tending (thinning), no pest, disease and forest fire control are implemented (Machavariani 2014). Cutting permits for fuel wood for personal use by the local populations are issued in the 207 municipalities by the local representations or forestry units of the regional forestry services of the NFA that would as well determine the specific locations and type of trees (species, dead or live) to be cut (representatives of municipalities in case study areas, pers. comm. 2015). No stakeholders mentioned if and in what extent higher levels of the NFA (regional forestry services or central level department for forest use in the NFA) are involved in the decision making on these harvest activities. But the ENPI-FLEG II CPC (Katarishvili, pers. comm. 2015) explained that \u201cusually the system is centralized and all decisions are made after approval from the NFA\u201d.

According to the Government Decree #242/2010 forest users with long-term licenses (concessions) shall be responsible for the correct marking of cutting areas. The Consultant could not obtain information in what extent, if at all, the NFA interferes in the decision making of concessionaires on their forest management. Decisions on permission of timber harvest for the needs of local people follow the procedure determined in the Government Decree #242/2010 (See also Component 1.3 of this case study). In Tusheti PL additionally any management and use has to be authorized by the MENRP because of 208 the protected area status. (Lagazidze, Tusheti PL, pers. comm. 2015) Pillar 3: Implementation, enforcement and compliance Component 3.1: Capacity of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations The capacity of forestry organizations declined over the years since the independence of Georgia. Staff numbers were cut several times. The NFA does not have own capacity to do forest inventory and management planning but contracts external private companies for this purpose. The capacity of the departments of the central level of the NFA is barely sufficient to fulfil its current tasks. In particular with the assignment of long-term concessions and the intended hand over of local forests to the municipalities the capacity of the NFA at local level was reduced to the bare minimum. The management structure of the NFA at local level is very thin. Usually the NFA in its local forestry units per district (municipality) has one head and ten forest rangers. These local representations are not economic units or enterprises, but belong to the regional forestry services and all management decisions are centralized. (Machavariani, NFA, pers. comm. 2015) The Consultant did not assess capacity of the regional forestry services of the NFA due to their not obvious role in the governance of local forests. In the case study areas the municipality representatives described the capacity of local NFA offices/forestry units as just sufficient for issuing of the fuel wood cutting permits, assigning of locations for cuts and some limited control, but not for implementation of planting activities or any other forestry works. In Kharagauli the local forestry unit is led by a forester who is supported by seven forest rangers (Magradze, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015). The NFA in Baghdati has one forester and 15 forest rangers. The head of the municipality administration was not knowledgeable about their qualification (Gegeshidze, pers. comm. 2015). The local NFA forestry unit in Tianeti has about 15 staff. None of the staff are forestry experts (Shetekauri pers. comm. 2015). In Akhmeta according to the head of the municipality council (Jugashvili, pers. comm. 2015) the local forestry unit is led by a forester (without special education) and employs 16 forest rangers (some with college education). The head of the municipality council Akhmeta noticed that the forest rangers are insufficient for the control of the forest areas and the compliance by the concessionaires. The National Forest Concept of Georgia provides for a substantial capacity development of state forestry organizations at central as well as local level. This includes the development of a country wide forest management organization with local units that would implement all practical forest management activities. Further, university and college education programs are now starting to provide sufficient qualified young staff for the intended development of the forestry organizations. (MENRP/NFA 2014, Amirgulashvili, MENRP, pers. comm. 2015) In the Ecology and Green Spaces Department of the City Hall of Tbilisi the capacity is only sufficient for some general oversight and planning, but any inspection staff for control on the ground (forest rangers) is missing. The head of the department would like to employ at least ten forest rangers, but so far he did not get a personnel budget allocated for this purpose. The department also has no own workforce for forestry and maintenance of city parks or trees.

According to IUCN CCC (2014) the administration recently consisted of nine employees. It lacked the capacity to carry out proper forest management. The essential infrastructure of the administration was very limited. There was still general lack of knowledge and experience among the staff. The administration of Tusheti PL had developed a concept on increasing the number of the staff and raising their qualification in the future. During the Consultant\u2019s visit in June 2015 the administration had a very knowledgeable Head of Administration (Eristo Lagazidze) and an educated Natural Resources Specialist (Giorgi Mezvrishvili) that would be in charge of leading all forestry related works. The administration owned one UAZ 4x4 vehicle. Because of difficult access the rangers of the administration can work only during a season of four months (June-September) in Tusheti PL. (Lagazidze, Tusheti PL, pers. comm. 2015) The other municipalities did not have any staff with even minimum capacity to lead and manage forestry related activities. In Kharagauli (Magradze, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015) the municipality does not have its own land-use administration or land-use expert and accordingly does not possess land-use maps. There is only a local representative of the Ministry of Agriculture, but he is not part of the municipality administration. Some of the municipality representatives interviewed by the consultant had clear ideas how to develop necessary capacity in the case that the forests are handed over. All representatives of the municipalities assessed the capacity of the local representations/forestry units of the NFA as very low. Some suggested that in case of transfer of forests to the municipalities these local representations with the respective staff might as well be taken over by the municipalities. In any case municipalities would be able to hire qualified people if forests are transferred. In Tianeti, e.g. it was mentioned that none of the staff in the local FA office/forestry unit are forestry experts, despite in municipality live people with background in forestry. These people could be hired if the municipality would take over the forests. (Shetekauri, municipality council, pers. comm. 2015) The head of the municipality administration in Baghdati (Gegeshidze, pers. comm. 2015) already has elaborated a local forestry development concept and presented clear ideas how to develop the municipality\u2019s capacity for communal forest management. The municipality would establish a forestry enterprise (Ltd), which would be 100% owned by municipality. Staff would be sent to training in Tbilisi and abroad. The enterprise would at the beginning have to get initial subsidies and would later become self-financing. Commercial operations would be used to fund the general operation of the enterprise and the social (non-commercial) functions of forests and forestry. The representatives of the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure noticed that the MENRP always refers to the lack of capacity at municipal level while the NFA itself has as well insufficient capacity for effective forest management (Tolkikishvili, Center for Reform of Municipality Management, pers. comm. 2015). Thus the argument of insufficient capacity of the municipalities is in some extent a pretext and possibly caused by reluctance in the MENRP and NFA to devolve authority to the local level as well as competition for possible state funding for capacity development in forestry and for forest management. Interestingly the forestry expert Bagaturia (pers. comm. 2015) could even imagine a hand over to the municipalities of the entire state forest fund outside the strictly protected areas and national parks. 210 Component 3.2: Forest law enforcement Limited information was collected on law enforcement. Illegal wood harvest sometimes involves groups of local people, 3-5 persons, who illegally harvest fuel wood and sell it to the local population (Katarashvili, CPC ENPI-FLEG II, pers. comm. 2015). Also sometimes local households based on their fuel wood harvest permits would cut higher amounts than indicated (various stakeholders, pers. comm. 2007 and 2015). Gegeshidze (municipality council Baghdati, pers. comm. 2015) mentioned that NFA staff would have tolerated illegal wood harvest by local people to gain political support.

Thus they might be more motivated to steal wood, while the NFA has insufficient capacity to prevent this illegal use. In Tusheti PL local people used forests illegally until 2012 because of the absence of legal access mechanisms and the same time lack of any law enforcement (Lagazidze, Tusheti PL, pers. comm. 2015). Communal ownership and management of forests may provide potential for improved law enforcement if local communities become again legitimate owners and managers of the forests. In Kharagauli the head of the municipality council (Magradze, pers. comm. 2015) still remembers social control in villages and traditional knowledge on forestry in the communities. Component 3.3 Administration of forest and land ownership and user rights Forest land ownership and historic kolkhoz forest lands as well as boundaries of municipalities and their sub-units are often poorly documented. Maps sometimes do not exist or are outdated. Land- use maps from Soviet times are schemes without geographic references. The NFA does not have clear knowledge on all forest what parcel belongs to what forest category and there is no complete land cadaster on forest lands and all boundaries would need to be re- identified. Bagaturia (pers. comm. 2015) tried developing such cadaster when in the past working in the NFA, but that time no staff was available for this work. This statement is in line with the Consultant\u2019s observations in 2007. That time in Kharagauli boundaries of the municipality and its sub-units were provided on the administrative map of Georgia (1:200,000) and on a cadastral map. Both versions showed significant inaccuracies. Some orientation was provided by the land-use maps from the 1980s defining the boundaries between major land-users (that time agricultural units \u201csovkhozes\u201d, \u201ckolkhozes\u201d and forestry enterprises \u201cleskhozes\u201d). Most agricultural land-users\u2019 areas became the land units of municipalities. The former kolkhoz forests together with the leskhoz (forest enterprise) areas became State Forest Fund managed currently by the NFA. (DFS, 2007) Neither detailed documentation of the boundaries of former kolkhoz forests nor updated maps of the forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d are available in the visited municipalities and probably all over Georgia. 211 The head of the municipality council in Kharagauli confirmed this situation (Magradze, pers. comm. 2015). The municipality does not have proper land-use maps. The head of the municipality administration of Baghdati considers a new mapping of the borders of all forests necessary as no accurate and up-to date documentation exists (Gegeshidze, pers. comm. 2015). In Akhmeta the head of the municipality council (Jugashvili, pers. comm. 2015) explained that the boundaries of municipality are well defined, but those of its sub-units are not. The forest map from 1986 is kept in the local office of the NFA only, but the municipality and the administration of Tusheti PL have maps showing the borders of the different protected areas in Tusheti. Documentation of the boundaries of assigned concessions is probably kept in the MENRP or some other state agencies (Possibly in the National Agency of Public Registry?) but is not available to the municipalities. Component 3.4 Cooperation and coordination Cooperation and coordination between the forestry sector organizations and the municipalities seem to depend more on personal contacts and the initiative of those involved than on established mechanisms. The Deputy Head of the NFA for many years has been involved in various projects and is very interested in collaboration at the local level. Thus he is in personal contact with municipalities that have expressed their interest in taking over local forests. The NFA cooperates well with the Forest Policy Service and in protected areas with APA. There is also some case-based cooperation, e.g. with the Ministry of Agriculture on problems related to fighting against box tree disease and with the Ministry of Interior regarding forest fires.

The Consultant has got the impression that contacts of the municipalities are even more intensive with the central level of the NFA than with its local level units. This might be related to the limited capacity and mandate of the local level of the NFA. Interestingly the existence of a regional level, the forestry services in the regions, was even not mentioned by any stakeholder. Cooperation between municipalities and concessionaires is virtually nonexistent in the case study areas. Component 3.5 Measures to address corruption and ensure transparency This component was not specifically assessed due to the inherent difficulty this subject presents. An in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of any measures to address corruption and ensure 212 transparency would be difficult in the frame of a short visit for a case study. Georgia during the last decade has very effectively eradicated corruption, and this is reflected in the forestry sector as well. No cases of bribery for access to fuel wood and timber at local level were reported by any stakeholder. The access to illegal fuel wood provided by NFA staff for gaining local political support, mentioned by Gegeshidze (Municipality administration Baghdati, pers. comm. 2015) was unspecific and seemed to refer to the past, but may possibly as well indicate a return of previous corrupt practices. However, the lack of transparency about the concession contracts provides reason for concern that violations might have happened when the concessions were assigned. Conclusions The forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d in Georgia are supposed to be under the authority of local self- governance bodies since many years. Latest in 2007 the legislative basis for the transfer of management responsibility and ownership has been in place. The hand-over, however, did not take place with the exception of the case study sites Tbilisi and Tusheti PL, which both present untypical situations, and two other areas mentioned by interviewed stakeholders, seemingly also representing very special cases. Stakeholders mentioned as reasons for the delay in the implementation of communal management of forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d: inconsistencies in the legislation, lack of up- to-date inventories, insufficient forest management capacity in the municipalities and lack of interest by local self-governance bodies. The consultant additionally noticed that lack of political will and resistance within the state forestry organizations likely have played a substantial role and may in some extent still do. There is a certain discrepancy between the expectations of the MENRP and the NFA in terms of technical capacity of the municipalities on one side and on the other side the decline of capacity within the MENRP, the NFA and its local representations, which has led to a generally unsatisfactory governance and management of forests under their jurisdiction. Similarly control of forest management and use by state, in particular the MENRP, has been weakened by cuttings of staff and budget. Also the assignment of state forests to commercial concessions reportedly did not lead to their sustainable management. At the same time the MENRP is concerned that transfer of local forests under the authority of the municipalities will lead to a loss of control by the MENRP and eventually to unsustainable forest use leading to their degradation. The cases of municipalities managing their forests in Tbilisi and Tusheti PL are untypical. Tbilisi\u2019s forests have been excluded from the forest fund and designated at \u201cgreen plantations\u201d. The municipality of Tbilisi has implemented very limited forest management activities in the recent past and despite these activities had been in accordance to the best practice and were even guided by a German forestry expert they have not been expanded onto other forest plots. So far the municipality did not establish a forest management unit that would implement regular forest management activities. The forests in Tusheti PL belong to the forests of protected areas and are only in a very restricted and limited extent used for supply of forest products. The administration of the PL is in the process of developing capacity for sustainable forest management. However, use restrictions, limited forest area and difficult decision making procedures may hinder the development of a viable forestry unit that could serve as an example for other municipalities. On the other hand the integration of forest management in the conservation of the wider landscape as PL and the development of not extractive use forms like tourism can improve the viability of the management unit and provide an interesting example with replication potential.

This situation raises the question of the future of these units and their functions in the perspective. Similarly, the current roles of the NFA\u2019s forestry services at region level and their perspective are not obvious. Potential perspectives of these organizational units are briefly discussed in section 4 of this case study. The representatives of the visited municipalities in Kharagauli, Baghdati, Tianeti and Akhmeta expressed their concerns about the currently weak governance and on the ground management of forests within the municipality boundaries combined with the insufficient satisfaction of the needs in forest products of local people and enterprises. They were all very interested in taking over responsibility and rights on the forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d and would generally like to take over as well forests that have never been \u201ckolkhoz forests\u201d. They would further accept a division of functions, by which the MENRP or the NFA would keep the mandate of supervision of control of forest management and use while the municipalities would manage the forests for the benefit of the local population with their employees or a specially established municipality owned enterprise. All interviewed stakeholders from the MENRP to local municipality representatives have criticized the long-term assignment of large logging concessions to often foreign enterprises. There seems to be consent that this approach should be faced out and no new concession contracts should be concluded. Beyond the results in terms of forest management and local economic benefits, which were generally described as unsatisfactory, the municipality representatives massively complained about a total lack of transparency about concession contracts and related rights, obligations, conditions and even boundaries of assigned areas. Although all or most concessions are assigned outside of the former kolkhoz forests, which were anyway economically less attractive, some of the concessions have negative impacts on forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d and on the infrastructure of the municipalities. Fig. 9: Pollard trees and fattening of pigs with acorns are relics of traditional forest use by local peasants, supporting the biological, structural and aesthetic diversity of local forest landscapes \u2013 Kharagauli 2007 The forest policy, as expressed in the National Forest Concept (MENRP/NFA 2014), is vague on communal forestry and the statements on \u201ccommunity forestry\u201d in absence of a specification of the term and any specific proposed actions remain purely declarative. The acting legislation, in contrast to the policy, provides a good basis for the development of communal forestry, and the handover of forest ownership and management to the municipalities. The Consultant agrees with the opinion of the Deputy Head of the NFA (Machavariani, pers. comm. 2015) that there is no need to wait for the adoption of the new Forest Code and subsequent bylaws, as suggested by the Head of the Forest 214 Policy Service of the MENRP (Amirgulashvili, pers. comm. 2015), but that the transfer to interested municipality can take place under agreements that could be concluded on the basis of the existing legislation. 4. Options and Recommendations Recommendations for the development of the governance of Georgia\u2019s forests and in particular of local forests can be made for different scenarios. The Consultant is not in a position to present a clear preference for one or another scenario. The principal scenarios, each with a number of possible modifications in terms of key elements of forest governance, might be: 1) Exclusive state ownership and management of all forests under the NFA or another more or less centralized state structure; 2) Communal management of all forests (with the exception of certain protected areas of national importance and under central management) with or without a division of functions and keeping in a central state forestry organization certain authorities on supervision and control as well as possibly management planning; 3) A combination of 1) and 2) with some forests owned and managed by the municipalities and other forests managed by local units of a central state forestry organization. The Consultant has got the impression that currently neither the NFA nor the municipalities have the capacity to implement proper management of forests on the ground. This capacity has to be developed because privatization of the forests is certainly not a considered option, and the concession approach has not delivered the expected results. If, as described by the Head of the Forest Policy Service (Amirgulashvili, pers. comm. 2015) and indicated in the National Forest Concept (MENRP/NFA 2014), new forest management organizations will be developed under the central state administration, it might be worth to consider the abandoning of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fdd6b7a-f188-4c46-b1b4-5a3fa02465e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fdd6b7a-f188-4c46-b1b4-5a3fa02465e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df4f965b0a76c67ec64de41edfbd5af7496cc015fa5c2b0194e7f78175767c3e"}}, "hash": "df4f965b0a76c67ec64de41edfbd5af7496cc015fa5c2b0194e7f78175767c3e", "text": "communal forestry approach and taking (or keeping) all forests under the respective management units of the developed state forestry organization. This approach might have advantages as all forests (possibly except those in protected areas of the categories strict nature reserve and national park that are excluded from any extractive use and active management) would be under one umbrella and could be managed in accordance to a unified system and at the same standard. Needs of local people and enterprises as well as participation of the local population and local self-governance organs could well be addressed without transfer of ownership and management responsibility. Given the currently extremely low capacity of the NFA at local level, a thinkable alternative would be to transfer forest management functions for all forests (also except those in strict nature reserves and national parks) to the municipalities, and not to keep any centrally managed state forest fund. The municipalities would establish their own forest management units or enterprises and carry out all forest management and use functions on their own. The NFA and/or a new forestry department within the MENRP would provide guidance, control and supervision to the local municipality forestry operations. The division of functions and the involvement of central level forestry organizations would ensure adequate management and protection of forests while the local level communal ownership would provide benefits and raise commitment at the local level. Also the approval of FMPs might remain in the mandate of the MENRP or the NFA. The role of the local communities or sub-units below the level of the large municipalities would require determination. The size of the forests under communal management by the municipalities would provide for effectiveness, efficiency and economic viability. For the third option of combining centralized state forest management of some forests with communal management of other forests, the question needs to be answered if it is effective and 215 efficient to develop the necessary capacity twice. This would mean establishing fully functional local forest management units under the NFA and in parallel municipalities would develop their own capacity. It needs to be assessed if other arrangements might not be more effective and cost efficient. The parallel existence of state and communal forests may cause the risk of fragmentation of forests and duplication of functions. The current situation and opinions expressed by some stakeholders give reason for concerns that only forests of limited economic value might be transferred to the municipalities while productive forests may largely or exclusively remain under the NFA. Such a division of the forest fund may lead to economically not viable communal forestry. The current situation seems to favour the third option despite its likely disadvantages. The reason might be that this option is perceived as balancing best different perceptions and interests, at least in the short term. The Consultant however recommends assessing carefully the advantages and disadvantages of different options. The communal forestry should be tested in suitable pilot areas before one or the other approach would be implemented in any large scale. Municipalities with a strong interest in taking over forests like Kharagauli and Baghdati might provide opportunities for pilot projects. Also Akhmeta with the initial experience of Tusheti PL and its emerging forest organization would be a suitable pilot area for the development of communal forestry. The findings of this case study show that in Georgia the way to communal forestry and governance of local forests through local self-governance bodies has been long, so far results are very limited and the viability of the approach is still uncertain. But the continuous interest of local communities in taking over rights and responsibility on the forests in their vicinity, expressed by their representatives at municipality level, suggests that it is time to start the implementation of the approach in a broader scale in pilot areas. The necessary legislation and concepts, and probably also the political will, are in place, but donor assistance will likely be needed for the initial stages of the implementation of communal forestry (Machavariani 2014). 5.

Introduction The following case study presents the findings from the Consultant\u2019s mission to Moldova during May 1-5, 2015. The Consultant visited three municipalities representing different typical situations in terms of forest conditions and capacity of local self-governance bodies and analysed the interaction between these aspects and the governance of the local forests. During the transition period forests that were formerly in the ownership of collective and state farms (\u201ckolkhoz\u201d forests) have not been privatized as were arable lands, but were handed over to the Local Public Authorities (LPAs) or municipalities (the prim\u0103ria)127 together with pastures and other commonly used areas. Most of these forests are now officially managed by municipalities. In total in 2009 the share in the forest fund of these communally owned forests was 10.7% while 82% of the forests were in state ownership and managed by Moldsilva; with a very small share of private ownership (and 6.4% belonging to the forest fund of Transnistria128). There can also be tree covered areas on communal lands that do not belong to the forest fund (e.g. shelter belts, tree and shrub vegetation on pastures) but nevertheless are supposed to be managed in accordance to the Forest Code. Municipalities are owners of a little less than 100,000 ha of forests and protection belts (World Bank 2015). The former kolkhoz forests were subject to heavy illegal use during the years of transition (collapse of Soviet Union and way to independence). After the transfer of these forests from the dissolved kolkhozes to the municipalities Moldsilva assisted in their protection. Between 2001 and 2014, Moldsilva planted officially ca. 60,000 ha of new communal forests on lands managed by LPAs. After 5 or 6 years, when these plantations were considered as established forest, Moldsilva started to hand the management of these new forests129 over to the respective municipalities in the ownership of which these areas are (T. Botnari130, Moldsilva, pers. comm. 2015). According to the Strategy for Sustainable Development of the Forestry Sector of Moldova (2001), by 2020 the total forest cover of Moldova is supposed to increase to 15% of the country area (compared to currently 13.7%) \u2013 a target achievable only through afforestation on private and communal lands. This fact makes the issue of governance of local forests even more relevant than it is at present (T. Botnari, Moldsilva, pers. comm. 2015).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "775f013e-0f3a-43de-b779-4511c03b808d": {"__data__": {"id_": "775f013e-0f3a-43de-b779-4511c03b808d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78b31aeb74fcef2fcec4aecb7cdff86476e979e793f1628abbe710db9401b242"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e8f8ced-e287-4fdd-9217-c23698a2ec09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d90bca080b926502cc53d9a0db97441a1256398ebec25c6477c911b8761fd1c"}}, "hash": "72d1b5158396b8d5348b2c4548b2ec7be6f7f68516054df88d1899bbd48bd539", "text": "comm. 2015).

In the commune Mereni the Consultant met additionally with: \uf0b7 Gheorghe Chiri\u0163\u0103, Forest inventory and management planning engineer. And in the commune Boghenii-Noi the Consultant met with \uf0b7 Victor Filipovici, forest engineer (former forest master of Boghenii-Noi community and, presently, chief of forest district Corne\u015fti of Moldsilva). In the State Agency Moldsilva the Consultant met with: \uf0b7 the Vice General Director Tudor Botnari; and with \uf0b7 the expert of the Department of forest protection, pest control and hunting management Dr. Victoria Covali. In the Institute for Forest Research and Management Planning (ICAS) the consultant met: \uf0b7 the Director Dumitru Galupa and the Deputy Director Ion Talmaci. 2.2 Study methods and areas visited The Consultant visited three municipalities and the capital city of Chi\u015finau and conducted semi- structured interviews with representatives of local municipalities, forestry experts at local level and national level. Due to the limited time for this study it was not possible to visit the administrations of local forest enterprises under Moldsilva. During his site visits the Consultant was accompanied by Aurel Lozan (CPC Moldova of ENPI-FLEG II, IUCN component) and by Nicolae Talp\u0103 (Forest inventory and management planning engineer of the Forest Research and Management Institute). The general study methods are explained in the method section of the Regional Study and at the beginning of the section on case studies. Mereni The municipality Mereni belongs to the district (rayon) Anenii-Noi and is located east of Chi\u015finau. The commune has about 6,500 inhabitants and is comparably flourishing, with a meat processing factory in the village and comparably good employment opportunities due to its proximity to Chi\u015finau. The commune is connected to the gas grid and most households use gas for heating with (guessed) only about 10% of the energy used by households being fuel wood. The total area of forest is 415 ha. The forests owned by the municipality are all of artificial origin \u2013 consisting of planted species only, or of planted species mixed with spontaneous vegetation that established after planting. The forest plantations are fragmented plots of several ten hectares each spread over the agricultural landscape and partly bordering pastures with some shrub vegetation and with used and abandoned fruit tree plantations. The forests include some walnut stands, but 219 plantations of young or regrown coppice of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) on heavy loamy soils dominate. These plantations seem to be of limited productivity due to site conditions and possibly also because of lack of maintenance, in particular thinning and regeneration assistance. Some groups of Crimean or black pine (Pinus nigra) are of older age than most black locust. We did not see any rejuvenation of the pine trees. The forest stands, largely or entirely, seem to be established on long-time deforested lands. Very few trees of autochthonous species are growing in the black locust plantations, mostly elm (Ulmus spec.) and only single oaks (Quercus spp.). Thus prospects of transformation of these plantations into more natural and more productive stands appear currently limited. However, if a proper management would be applied, there is a potential of transformation of these plantations into more natural stands, composed of native species. In this case only some black locust plantations may be kept in the future, if managed accordingly and their invasive potential being controlled.

The municipality is located in the district of Nisporeni, one of the districts with the highest forest 221 cover in the country. The municipality has about 3,500 inhabitants. 407 ha of forests are in the possession of the prim\u0103ria, with a large part being forest ecosystems of natural origin, but also including plantations and 25 ha recently reforested by Moldsilva on degraded communal lands. Key species are hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), oak (Quercus petraea) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). The soil conditions are considered not suitable for long-term cultivation of black locust and after few (one to three) harvest cycles the productivity drops drastically. Some plots of communal forest lands are temporarily handed over to Moldsilva for planting and maintenance of young plantations over the first seven years. After the young growth on these plots will be considered closed forest cover they will be returned into the management responsibility of the municipality. During the site visit forest plots of different composition \u2013 natural oak-hornbeam forest and plantations of black locust were shown. As far as could be judged without detailed assessment, the natural forests made a generally intact impression, while black locust plantations seemed to be of poor productivity. There is an old park in the town of Mile\u015fti, which is managed by the Prim\u0103ria as an arboretum with some impressive old trees. Boghenii-Noi Fig. 4: Oak forest in Boghenii-Noi \u2013 managed by the local community. The municipality belongs to the district of Ungheni, belonging to those districts with the highest forest cover in the country, and includes the villages Boghenii-Noi, Boghenii-Vechi, Mirce\u015fti, Izvoreni and Poiana. The total area of the municipality is approx. 3,033 ha, including the village areas. The municipality has approx. 2,000 inhabitants in 720 households. Most households use fuelwood for heating, consuming about 4 m\u00b3 per household and year. Maximum 5% of the households use coal as mean heating energy source. Thus the community is to be considered highly forest dependent in terms of heating energy; at the same time it is highly independent from Moldsilva\u2019s resources due to the availability of productive communal forests. 222 The total forest area of the municipality is about 700 ha, including 300 ha natural forest, dominated by oak (Quercus petraea and Qu. robur) as well as plantations of black locus and pine. The area size and composition date provided by Filipovici (head of municipality Boghenii-Noi, pers. comm. 2015) slightly differs from the data provided in the FLEG study on collective management of forests (Lozan and Kobernik-Gurkovskaya, 2012): According to the data in the FLEG study, provided by the community forestry personnel (such data are based on the provisions from the Forest Management Plans), forest resources of Boghenii Noi comprise 588.9 hectares of forest (more than half of it is of natural origin), 23.4 hectares of forest protection belts, and 59.7 hectares of other forest vegetation. Main species are: black locust (47%), oak (21%), hornbeam (7%), ash (5%), cherry (4.5%) and others species. The average age of the trees: black locust - 15 years, oak - 78 years, hornbeam - 44 years, ash - 66 years, cherry - 28 years. The majority of these forests in the past have been in ownership of private owners and/or monasteries, then in community ownership during Soviet times. The CPC considers the communal collectively-owned forests of Boghenii-Noi as the best example of co-existence of communities and forests in the country. People consider themselves as guardians of their own forests; they live in close relations with the forests they own and they seem to realize their forests are essential for their living.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a72debd1-8a8e-4cc7-9351-2245207ea583": {"__data__": {"id_": "a72debd1-8a8e-4cc7-9351-2245207ea583", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f281e74219487ffa7164bf43ffaa975405edba0c290a65c64bb54c1d65e93f00"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8994997-96e1-4a15-9733-1e0b0a5fbb7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64b7d050d1898a0fa47ee64dbfb49c20bc5b142ea10ceefa3452de113db8a810"}}, "hash": "97628ff7aaaa3de35a24aba5a5b7dedf95d8940b28f755a628c424df8f9ae2eb", "text": "The municipality of Boghenii-Noi partners with FLEG in the development of communal forestry.

Moldova has implemented political, legal and economic reforms. The political developments in Moldova are oriented towards institutional reforms at all levels of the central administration, as outlined in the Reform Strategy of Central Public Administration (Gov. Decree #1402/2005) and in the Government activity program \u201cEuropean Integration: Liberty, Democracy, Welfare\u201d (World Bank 2014). One element of these reforms is the development of the municipalities as self-governance bodies of the communes, with a certain level of autonomy and own decision making structures. The council and the head of the LPAs (so-called the Primar) are elected. The municipalities have authority to decide on forestry and other natural resource management issues on the lands within the boundaries of the commune. However, this decision making authority is limited to public lands in the ownership of the municipality and does not include any authority over protected areas (PAs) and forests in state ownership that are managed by the respective local units of national level agencies (Ministry of Environment and Agency Moldsilva). Further, decision making authority of the municipalities related to forests in their ownership is restricted as far as it concerns forest inventory and forest management planning (FMP) and decisions about the harvest of wood/trees in accordance to these plans. Decisions about the change of the land category of agricultural lands to forest lands for the purpose of expansion of forest cover are in the competency of municipality and district councils, but only for lands of fertility less than 40 scores in the 100 score fertility scale, while agricultural lands with a higher fertility level can be transferred into another land category only by decree of the national government. The national policy on forests was formulated in the Strategy for Sustainable Development of the Forest Sector of the Republic of Moldova till 2020 (Parliament Decision #350/2001). There is a need to elaborate and enact a new policy document that reflects the newer developments since the adoption of the strategy of 2001. This strategy emphasized the importance of restructuring the forestry sector and had the clear direction of handing over all communal forests to Moldsilva, including all newly afforested stands. In contrast, the current national forest policy seems to be oriented on the strengthening of a system of diverse ownership of forests with a significant role of the municipalities. This policy change is de-facto realized through a number of projects already implemented or under implementation such as Development of the Communal Forestry Sector in Moldova, the Moldova Soil Conservation Project, the Moldova Community Forestry Project, Community Support Program for Sustainable and Integrated Forest Management and Carbon Sequestration through Forestation and by activities on capacity development of communal forest owners by ENPI-FLEG. The communal sector transgresses together with the private forest sector. Thus, purely private forests (though small) owned by individuals or legal entities cover increasing areas. These so far are only planted forests as privatization of existing forests is not allowed by the Forest Code (1996), and tree vegetation originating from natural succession on private lands is not yet recognized as private forests. The area size of forests in communal or collective form of management increases, when a given commune plants forests on its lands, and this land is collectively managed by the commune\u2019s inhabitants. The Government of Moldova has established the target of expanding Moldova\u2019s forest cover from 224 currently 13.7% to 15% by 2020 as it is stipulated in the Strategy from 2001; thus effectively increasing the share of communally and privately owned forests. However, it seems that in the current policy the element of sustainable use of forest products and the assignment of secure user rights on these products as key incentive to establish and maintain forests is weakly developed. The government (according to T. Botnari, Moldsilva, pers. comm. 2015) retains the right on harvest of trees and would not assign such rights to private owners and leaseholders of state or communally owned forests. In previous (e.g. expressed in legislation like the Forest Code, 1996; Parliament Decision #350/2001) and current national policies the protective and environmental functions of forests are clearly seen as primary forest functions. This policy is reflected in the acting Forest Code that assigns (Art. 14) all forests of the Republic of Moldova to the \u201cfirst group as (forests) having exclusively an environmental protection function\u201d. This approach is only partly reflected in other regulations of the Forest Code and the bylaws that nevertheless allow for certain forest uses, including extractive uses.

However, the \u201cexclusive environmental protection function\u201d is often interpreted in ways that hinder sustainable forest management, provide disincentives for reforestation and forest maintenance and perverse incentives for use of forests for not forestry related purposes (\u201crecreational use\u201d, i.e. construction of cottages, restaurants and similar structures on leased forest lands). The policy as expressed in the legislation is thus contradictory and does not achieve the stated objective of forest conservation for achieving environmental benefits. Component 1.2: Legal and regulatory frameworks The key legal and regulatory documents determining governance of local forests are the Constitution, the Forest Code, the Land Code, other laws and a number of bylaws. The Constitution, along with propositions on environment and natural resources in Articles 37, 59 and 126, states in Art. 127 Property \u201c(4) All (\u2026) forests used to the benefit of the public at large (\u2026) shall constitute the exclusive province of the public property.\u201d The acting Forest Code (#887/1996, amended several times since then) defines the forest funds and the categories of ownership as well as competencies of local public administration authorities. Local public administration authorities own communal forests as well as lands covered by tree and shrub vegetation but not considered being part of the forest fund. Communal forests are not specifically regulated in the acting Forest Code, but the new edition that is currently under preparation by Moldsilva in cooperation with ENPI FLEG will contain own sections (Chapters) dedicated to private and communal forests and the specifics of their management. The Land Code (1991, amended several times since then, last in 2013) regulates the transfer of land between different categories, thus defining the procedure by which agricultural lands can be transferred (Art. 62 and 71) into lands of the forest fund. The Land Code as well as mentions the use of forest lands for agricultural land-use and the expropriation of forest lands. Component 1.3: Ownership and user right systems In Moldova forests can be in the ownership of the state (managed by Moldsilva), ownership of municipalities and in private ownership. The latter concerns only forests established by private land- users on formerly not forested lands. Already in 1918-1924 in the context of the land reform all forests were nationalized. With the 225 establishment of kolkhozes some of them established tree plantations, but few also got ownership of natural forests. After World War II many natural forests were handed over from the kolkhozes to the state forest fund, and after independence further 30,000 ha of former kolkhoz forests of different condition were by Government decision included into the State Forest Fund, managed by Moldsilva (D. Galupa and I. Talmaci, ICAS, pers. comm. 2015). Communal forests are managed separately from state (i.e. Moldsilva) forests that exist alongside communal forests within the administrative boundaries of the visited municipalities of Mile\u015fti and Boghenii-Noi. Despite separate ownership and management, people have access to the state forests too. Also there is a strong cooperation between the communal and state forest managers, namely at staff level and facilitated through various projects (including ENPI FLEG). In all three visited sites Moldsilva has assisted in the afforestation or reforestation of some areas (e. g. 25 ha in Mile\u015fti). These areas are in temporary management by this state agency. Responsibility and full ownership are given back to the municipalities after 7 years, when the plantation is considered as established closed forest cover. In Boghenii-Noi, according to the local informants (Filipovici and Filipovici, pers. comm. 2015), 200 ha of old grown former community or kolkhoz forest have been transferred to Moldsilva in the 1990s. The municipalities of Boghenii-Noi and Milesti would like to take such forests back, but Moldsilva resists against such a transfer. The transfer of forests from the State Forest Fund (i.e. forests managed by Moldsilva) to the municipalities, even the exchange of forest plots of equal size for realignment boundaries to achieve of larger sections, is considered legally not possible (T. Botnari, Moldsilva, pers. comm. 2015). However, long-term use agreements might provide opportunities to include sections of forests owned by Moldsilva into the management by municipalities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d60b4a6-fac9-4d10-9fbf-a17c9238704f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d60b4a6-fac9-4d10-9fbf-a17c9238704f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2a9f78eca1ee4b2a2d6ee89dec62d9232b378111e0b2e77f786f459f36aae73"}, "2": {"node_id": "09a99a11-3571-4d4b-99f4-3adcba308172", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76f4b762df5e06be3616057a2249f2870d1c17e67148c856ac133db70d54a030"}}, "hash": "74d482f0bb82385cd256de8699626517db2905eebbef46216a4a7df56d180974", "text": "Also municipalities can hand over the use rights on the local forests back to Moldsilva on the basis of collaboration agreements.

Outside of the three visited municipalities, on state forest land, the consultant observed that on leased forest lands quite significant structures were erected, among them cottages for personal use as well as restaurants, and that the lease of forest for \u201crecreational purposes\u201d rather allows for a step-by step transformation of forests into urbanized areas. The restrictions prohibiting the use of wood from leased forests actually may discourage the maintenance and rehabilitation of a productive tree cover. The municipality of Mereni has leased out to local households 20 ha of forests for hay making and recreation. The annual lease fee is MDL 300 per ha (approx. EUR 15). Despite this low contribution to the income of the commune, the lease of forests to local households is considered a success, as leaseholders would plant trees on leased plots and their presence ensures the protection against illegal use of larger forest units. In contrast to the prim\u0103ria Mereni, where nut trees in leased forest would not be allowed for exclusive harvest of nuts by the leaseholder, the prim\u0103ria Mile\u015fti leases for exclusive use some fruit trees to private leaseholders that would at the same time protect the forest. On the other hand, leaseholders are not permitted to cut of trees in leased forests, and even on private lands it is only possible after obtaining permission from the prim\u0103ria. 226 Fig. 6: Lease of forest plot in Mereni municipality Wildlife and hunting despite not restricted to forests are often considered in the context of forest resources. In Moldova hunting is de-facto poorly regulated and most game species are now on the red list and are not allowed to be hunted. In the reality illegal hunting occurs and many officials or influential people are practicing poaching (one of the interviewed stakeholders, pers. comm. 2015). Even ungulate species, which are common in other countries, have only very low population numbers due to intensive poaching. So far no examples exist where the municipality or community- based groups have obtained the right to protect, manage and use game animals (V. Covali, Moldsilva, pers. comm. 2015). The prim\u0103ria of Boghenii-Noi would be interested in obtaining the hunting and game management rights for the entire territory in the borders of the municipality (3,033 ha, inclusive the village areas in which no hunting is permitted). The 10 \u2013 15 local hunters would carry out control and monitoring on behalf of the commune and the entire community. This would prevent external hunters from unauthorized access to the area and avoid the damage caused by nonlocal hunters to wildlife, forests and agricultural lands. Moldsilva would be supportive to the development of a communal hunting and game management area in Boghenii-Noi. A new Hunting Law is currently under discussion. Hunting and game management areas are supposed to be auctioned to concessionaires, but de-facto any winning bidder would need to involve the local people. Division of blocks would be preferably in accordance to the boundaries of the municipalities (T. Botnari, Moldsilva, pers. comm. 2015). By the consultant\u2019s opinion the approach based on auctioning the game management rights is risky in terms of sustainability of hunting management and would effectively exclude communes from obtaining these rights. The development of an area-based game management system with exclusive or priority rights of local municipalities to take over this responsibility would likely be more effective to achieve sustainable use of wildlife as a complementary form of land-use. 227 Component 1.4: Mandates of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations The Agency Moldsilva is the central public authority, subordinated to Government, with the main responsibility to implement the state policy in the sectors of forestry and hunting. Moldsilva is responsible for issuing the regulatory framework for forestry (in technical issues rather than environmental ones). Thus, Moldsilva is not only in charge of the development of the state policy on forests, but as well of the implementation of this policy in all forests independent of ownership type.

Further, Moldsilva has the mandate of marking areas of communal forests in which cuttings are planned and determine harvest composition and amounts (\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0438). The competency of Moldsilva is in certain aspects limited to the State Forest Fund managed by them. In 2001 the Forest Code (Art. 20) was changed and Moldsilva lost the authority of state control on forests that were handed over to the state organs in charge of environmental protection. Also the agency does not have any more the authority of keeping of the cadaster concerning forest lands outside those managed by Moldsilva (D. Galupa and I. Talmaci, ICAS, pers. comm. 2015). Based on the afore mentioned change of the forest code and according to Gov. Decree #847/2009, the Ministry of Environment is responsible for regulating environmental protection and natural resources utilization (including forests). The Ministry of Environment exercises the thematic control on the activity of the forest enterprises through the State Ecological Inspection. The management of those protected areas subordinated to Moldsilva is also controlled by this entity (World Bank 2015). Further, cuts of any type and in any forest, including those in communal forests, have to be authorized by this State Ecological Inspection of the Ministry of Environment. The implementation of these forest cuttings are then controlled by this inspection. The councils of the prim\u0103ria have commissions on ecology, construction and agriculture, consisting of three deputies, making the decisions on forest management as far as these are in the competency of the prim\u0103ria. The municipality councils decide about the allocation to local households of wood that is harvested from the communal forests. If not delegated to Moldsilva, the practical forest management of communal forests is in the mandate of the prim\u0103ria, including planting, maintenance, harvest and prevention of fire and pest control as well as allocation for lease. The existing legal framework does not provide a clear definition of the roles of local public administration authorities and Moldsilva with regard to communal forests. The regulatory framework states that they have to cooperate towards the maintenance of communal forest vegetation, but neither clearly describes the scope nor the procedures for such cooperation (World Bank 2015). 228 Scheme 1: Overview of main mandates in the governance of local forests Organization Key mandates Government Definition of state policy Adoption of bylaws in Gov\u2019t. competence Change of land designation of agricultural lands with fertility >40% Ministry for Environment State Ecological Inspection Control of activities of all forest owners Approval of wood harvest Law enforcement Agency \u201cMoldsilva\u201d Approval of FMP Definition and marking of harvest areas and determination of harvest volumes Afforestation and maintenance of young growth as well as management of forest stands in case of temporary authorization by municipality Forest Research and Management Institute \u201cICAS\u201d Forest inventory and elaboration of forest management plans District council Change of land designation of agricultural lands with fertility <40% belonging to level II of local public authority Municipality (\u201cPrim\u0103ria\u201d) councils Forest management, including reforestation, maintenance, harvest of wood, protection, fire prevention, pest control etc. Sale of harvested wood and allocation to local households Allocation of forest plots for lease and conclusion of contracts Change of land designation of agricultural lands with fertility <40% belonging to level I of local public authority Component 1.5: Financial arrangements, economic instruments and benefit sharing The Local Public Authorities (LPAs) have their own budget and can make their own decisions about the use of these budgets.

The prim\u0103ria does not get other direct funding from the state budget, but earns local taxes (no share of the income tax, which is paid at the state level), collects fees for services, can sell or lease property and receive project funding (Law on local budgets). The prim\u0103ria is among other 229 tasks also responsible for education, making up one of the largest positions in the communal budget (E.

In Boghenii-Noi the prim\u0103ria sells timber and fuel wood local people, with priority allocation to vulnerable categories of the villagers (pensioners, multiple children families, disabled ones etc.). 90% is fuel wood, sold at prices determined by the prim\u0103ria under consideration of the local income situation (currently 260 MDL per m\u00b3), i.e. considerably lower than prices for wood sold by Moldsilva from the nearby state forestry units. The annual incomes earned by the municipalities from the sale of wood were not available. In Boghenii-Noi the earnings from the forest are sufficient to employ three forest rangers (\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438) and one forest master (\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0430) and to hire workers for carrying out the forestry works. The prim\u0103r of Mereni considers the available budget by far insufficient for effective forest protection and management. The prim\u0103r of Mile\u015fti intends to create a communal enterprise that would be in charge of certain communal environmental, cultural and service issues, including waste management, drinking water supply system management, canalization (after being installed), management of the park, maintenance and use of the \u201ckonak\u201d, a historic manor house as well as the management of the communal forest, by this creating a unit of sufficient size and budget to make the communal forestry activities financially possible. The communal enterprise is supposed to become self-financing and would employ one person that would be in charge of forest management. In contrast to communal forest owners that may need to cross fund forest management from other incomes, Moldsilva (as manager of the state owned forests) is able of self-financing from forestry and 98% of its income is created from harvesting of wood and from other forest use (NWFP, hunting, forest lease). The forests managed by Moldsilva provide a much higher amount of harvestable forest products per area size and per management unit than most communal forests. Pillar 2: Planning and decision-making processes Component 2.1: Stakeholder participation Stakeholder participation in the decision making process was not assessed as separate component here, but considered in the course of the following components as far as information was available. Component 2.2: Planning and decision making on conversion of land from forest to non- forest and vice versa Land categories are mapped by the Agency for Land Relations and Cadaster of the Republic of Moldova; these maps are publicly accessible. The assignment of lands to the forest fund, including lands that are temporary or permanently without forest cover, is done either in the process of forest 230 inventory and management planning or in the frame of the land cadaster. In the practice forest inventory and management planning covers only lands assigned to the forest fund in existing land- use documentation and does not change the designation of lands to categories. So far, areas with succession of tree and shrub vegetation on lands of other designation than forest are not properly mapped. ICAS suggests that this type of lands should be monitored together with forest lands. Necessary would be a functional and ecological definition of forest, the identification and change of land category designation and finally an inventory with full characterization of each plot (D. Galupa and I. Talmaci, ICAS, pers. comm. 2015). The Forest Code does not mention a minimum width of shelterbelts to be considered as forest. Thus shelterbelts are usually included in the category of agricultural lands. They stay mostly in communal ownership and have not been privatized with the bordering arable lands. ICAS would propose to include all shrub and tree vegetation that is not part of the forest fund into the forest inventory and planning, thus providing a basis for systematic management of these tree stands (D. Galupa and I. Talmaci, ICAS, pers. comm. 2015). The afforestation of agricultural land not covered by forest and its formal designation to the land-use category of forest is only possible in special cases, where the soil fertility or erosion problems justify such a transfer.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cd7fd3e-b833-4e43-b6f1-98136521c869": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cd7fd3e-b833-4e43-b6f1-98136521c869", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32236a41c8efd9cfdc9467332f11368827fc926fb1aac8275505960284528e49"}, "2": {"node_id": "00d45818-d3b8-4c3b-b528-d0690fa49128", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cd593eb8abb76675569f4aa8f9cef73d03e2f738701bffe671d23c254129ce4"}}, "hash": "439db69b4f8d394e029da953ae11bb38f25d52e6b77f277eb80589643f200ce9", "text": "According to the Land Code for the transfer of land from one the category of agricultural lands to forest lands a decision by local public authority level I (village/commune), when the land belongs to them, and by the LPA level II (district councils), when the land belongs to them, is required.

The Forest Code (Art. 8) defines that the government has the authority of deciding about the \u201callocation of lands of the forest fund for state and public needs\u201d, i.e. the government is authorized to decide about the transfer of forest lands into other land categories. Concerning the rules of such transfer the Forest Code (Art. 17) refers to the land legislation, but the Land Code does not provide any specific regulations either. In the visited municipalities during the last decades no forest lands were transferred into other land categories. Component 2.3: Decisions on forest inventory and management planning Forest inventory and management planning (FMP) is mandatory for the entire forest fund regardless of the ownership. All forest inventory and management planning is done by a specialized state organization, the state enterprise \u201cICAS\u201d (Forest Research and Management Institute) under the Agency Moldsilva. While the general methodology is the same for all forests, some simplification has been introduced for the communal forests possessed by the municipality councils. The revision period is ten years. FMP is considered a state task and should be financed by the state (Forest Code, Art. 73), but no funding is allocated by the state for the FMP, neither in communal nor in state forests. The FMP in the state forests is financed by the forest enterprises themselves from their income. The costs of forest inventory and management planning of communal forests (in 2012 about USD 10 per ha) are supposed to be funded by the \u201clocal budget\u201d, i.e. the budget of the respective prim\u0103ria. As these do not possess sufficient funds, these activities in communal forests are funded largely by international projects (in visited sites Mereni and Mile\u015fti by ENPI-FLEG I, Boghenii-Noi by grant from the Japanese government). In Boghenii-Noi a revision is required in 2015. So far no funding has been identified for the necessary new inventory and management planning. The municipality would be 231 able and ready to contribute limited funding as well as in-kind contributions to the next inventory and management planning. According to D. Galupa and I. Talmaci (ICAS, pers. comm. 2015), in communal forests only, annually 15,000 ha incl. shelterbelts should be covered. More than 20,000 ha of communal forests had a forest inventory and management planning since 2005. Thus, the larger part of communal forests does not have up-to-date inventories and management plans. In contrary, for the forests managed by Moldsilva the FMP are largely up to date, with no more than one year delay in updating. For the next year these activities are planned on 100,000 ha. The reason is that the forest enterprises of Moldsilva manage more productive forests and are thus able to pay for the FMP services provided by ICAS. As these FMPs are the basis for any forest use, there is as well economic pressure to allocate funds for inventory and planning. The procedure for forest inventory and management planning provides limited opportunity for local stakeholder involvement and for the consideration of needs and capacity at the local level. In the visited municipalities forest inventories and management planning were done with external project support. Thus prim\u0103ria staff and, where available, local forestry employees as well as interested local inhabitants were involved in the process. In the course of each forest inventory and management planning two conferences are formally required supposed to be hold at local level with participation of the municipality itself, Moldsilva, ICAS, the Ministry of Environment and the Academy of Sciences: \uf0b7 FMP Conference I \u2013 to present the intentions, the team and the purpose and area of the work; \uf0b7 FMP Conference II \u2013 to present the elaborated Forest Inventory and Management Plan. The managers of communal forests only possess the usual paper copies of maps and volumes, but no electronic data access and management system. The consultant was not able to review these materials. However, the overall impression is that in the materials of the forest inventory and management planning the focus might be more on allowable harvest, and less on the determination of stand specific silvicultural options, definition of development targets, activities and related costs and benefits.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa2eb065-f935-409a-a831-5a24a32b59bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa2eb065-f935-409a-a831-5a24a32b59bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60dcd6ec2a9cff859f5d5acb3abbee2a9d37941cb36b05f85a08b8b80e53d652"}, "2": {"node_id": "d57f7cb1-2322-4bc3-bc26-9a160b670e3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd4b90bf48c487e13948a85746e61e7e235290c072fae808421e6cce8d443a2a"}}, "hash": "04dcf41aa6b12c2a4c9bec5d51d2fd8571f44c4279f13062a90998aaacd0d9ab", "text": "Accordingly the prim\u0103ria in Boghenii-Noi and Mile\u015fti, where forest conditions allow for substantial wood harvest, referred much to these materials.

Component 2.4: Decisions on implementation of forest management activities Most of the decisions concerning the forest are made by the council of the municipality. Forest management activities have to be implemented in accordance to the requirements set by the approved FMPs during their ten-year revision period. Where the revision period of these plans expired without renewal of the plan, in practice decisions on forest management activities are made with reference to the outdated plans and under consideration of the actual situation. Areas of communal forests in which cuttings are planned have to be marked (with a special marking hammer) and harvest composition and amounts be determined by Moldsilva as the municipalities are not authorized to possess marking hammers. The authorization is required despite and in addition to the general approval of the forest management plan and serves mainly the purpose of confirmation of borders of cutting areas, to avoid that accidentally the municipality uses forests 232 managed by Moldsilva. In Boghenii-Noi the primar complained that the marking procedure is often postponed for months due to high workload of the respective Moldsilva staff. The municipality would be highly interested in taking over the authority of marking forest sections for cutting. As mentioned above, any cuts, including those in communal forests, have to be authorized by the local office (district level) of this State Ecological Inspection (SEI) of the Ministry of Environment. The council of the prim\u0103ria in accordance to the opinion of the prim\u0103ria\u2019s commission on social issues decides on the allocation of harvested fuelwood to needy and other families and applicable prices. The prim\u0103ria also decides on the allocation of communal forest for lease. Most or all afforestation and maintenance activities in newly afforested and reforested areas during the first 5 \u2013 7 years (e.g. in Mile\u015fti) are implemented by Moldsilva, not by the prim\u0103ria. In Mile\u015fti the municipality refers to own work force for most forestry works in older stands and intents hiring the workers in the future through a communal enterprise. In Boghenii-Noi community members are hired by the prim\u0103ria for the harvest for trees. Planting of trees and maintenance of young plantations is done mainly by their own resources of the commune, though assistance is provided by the neighbouring Corne\u015fti forest enterprise of Moldsilva. Access to NWFP for personal use is unrestricted and does not require any permit (Forest Code, Art. 32). The use of NWFP may be restricted in stands especially established for the production of these NWFP, as e.g. many walnut stands. Their use can be restricted and either only be possible for legal entities (Forest Code Art. 35) by the same procedure as for timber and fuel wood, or for anybody, but based on permits (Forest Code Art.38). In Mereni, the leaseholders have no exclusive rights on the use of walnuts on the leased lands, but have to allow free access. This possibly discourages the active planting and maintenance of walnut plantations by the leaseholders. In contrast, the prim\u0103ria Mile\u015fti leases some fruit trees to private leaseholders that would at the same time protect the forest.

Most communal forests are of low area size and the majority of communal forests consist of artificial forest plantations of low productivity. Thus, the incomes earned by most of these municipalities, despite the general opportunity to create income from NWFP, are too small for financing an own forest management unit. Moldsilva would be ready to take over the management or even ownership of these forests and some prim\u0103ria see this as the favourite option, e.g. the primar of Mereni (pers. comm. 2015). The municipality of Mile\u015fti plans the establishment of a communal enterprise as described above for integrating forest management with other communal tasks and creating by this the needed capacity. The situation of the municipality Boghenii-Noi which has full capacity to manage existing and potential additional forests in communal ownership, with four forestry staff employed and seasonal labour hired, is rather an exception among the forest owning municipalities in Moldova, but it should also become an example of how to manage local forests collectively. Component 3.2: Forest law enforcement During site visits and interviews the consultant got only limited information on law enforcement issues. Generally the level of violations, in particular illegal cuts, was considered low but still relevant by all stakeholders. In contrast, the total consumption of fuelwood in 2010 had been estimated at just below 1.1 Mio m\u00b3 per year, more than 2.5 times the official harvest. The scale of the imbalance indicates significant volumes of illegal harvesting. (Mitchell et al. 2015) Outside of the visited sites the Consultant noticed several obvious violations of the rules on lease of forests in form of erected permanent housing with massive fundaments. This might be an indicator that enforcement of law is weak at least in cases where the violators are wealthy and/or influential. In Mereni the head of the municipality considers management of the local forest by the commune itself not feasible due to lack of support to sustainable forest management and noncompliance with established rules by the local population. This includes unauthorized cutting of trees (signs also observed by the consultant) and the destruction of trees planted by the commune for reforestation/afforestation by grazing cattle owned by the local people. The municipality has insufficient financial means for implementing the necessary law enforcement activities. By handing over the management of local forests to Moldsilva, the primar wants to use Moldsilva\u2019s experts, funds and authority to achieve the conservation of the local forests, in particular by better law enforcement. In Mile\u015fti reportedly few illegal cuttings happened in both the nearby protected area and the communal forests. These violations have been attributed to outsiders, not to residents of the commune. The municipality collaborates with Moldsilva in the enforcement of law. 234 Fig. 7: Illegally cut black locust in Mereni In Boghenii-Noi the informants expressed the opinion that forests under management and ownership by the prim\u0103ria are actually better protected than those owned by Moldsilva. The reason is that the inhabitants of the municipality have an attitude of ownership and nobody would let go on any illegal cutting and unauthorized removal of forest products. (Filipovici and Filipovici, municipality and Moldsilva, pers. comm. 2015) Thus almost 90% of the population is actively participating in a kind of \u201ccollective guarding\u201d of the forests. This is a very positive sign of ownership attitude as generally protection of forests in Moldova is largely weak and illegal use is considered as a serious problem (Lozan and Kobernik-Gurkovskaya, 2012). The State Ecological Inspection (SEI), the subdivision of the Ministry of Environment responsible for law enforcement with regard to the use of natural resources (including forests and game), was presented by the interviewed stakeholders as body that in the first place enforces the compliance with laws and regulations by the forest owners and managers. However, the interviewed stakeholders also stated that the SEI is not sufficiently (and hinted on corruption from SEI officers) undertaking law enforcement in supporting them (local people) against illegal use by nonlocals. Component 3.3 Administration of forest and land ownership and user rights All visited municipalities had in their offices proper documentation (land-use maps) of the forest areas assigned to them. The importance of checking the borders of communal towards state forest was specifically mentioned for Boghenii-Noi (Filipovici and Filipovici, municipality and Moldsilva, pers. comm.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4ec9dfd-7275-468c-9b34-5ce003ee249c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4ec9dfd-7275-468c-9b34-5ce003ee249c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "125176ccf888c67d4223bc8ecaeb8ff5f6ad60ddc218ee82201d2c068eeebfb8"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f9d6606-4ab7-445b-bd6b-1092fc8c29fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f59d96b04b190363cab1fabfeeaa100b34b4860c16917d071b4f85a223f32970"}}, "hash": "c653f8ac244713929ca0d9b650a5eba23bdf6ad94e4e0efc6dadce96394bbded", "text": "comm. 2015) as a reason why Moldsilva keeps the right of marking forest for cuttings (T.

In Mereni the general good cooperation was reflected by the intention to hand over to Moldsilva the management rights and obligations for the communal forest, despite only few years ago, when the current head of the municipality was elected, he returned the use rights of the communally owned forests from Moldsilva back to the commune. In Mile\u015fti the head of the municipality explicitly mentioned that the prim\u0103ria collaborates well with Moldsilva and has good relations with the management of a protected area directly bordering the commune\u2019s settlement and forest areas. In Boghenii-Noi cooperation is well established with the local forestry unit and Moldsilva as well. The interviewed head of the municipality expressed the wish for more authority (right to mark cutting areas, wildlife management rights) and handing over of more forest area to the municipality. Component 3.5 Measures to address corruption and ensure transparency This component was not specifically assessed due to the inherent difficulty this subject presents. An in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of any measures to address corruption and ensure transparency would be difficult in the frame of a short visit for a case study. The above mentioned obvious and long lasting violations of regulations in form of erection of buildings with massive fundaments in leased forests indicate a potentially significant level of corruption. In the communal forests no obvious risks for significant corruption are visible. The risk of provision of undue benefits in form of cheap fuelwood or of selective purchase of services from certain inhabitants might be low due to the peer pressure and social control in the communes. Conclusions The history of the forest governance in the three sites seemed to have an impact on the quality of nowadays governance, in particular on the general ownership felt by the community members in the studied municipalities. In Boghenii-Noi the community has been the owner of the forests already since pre-Soviet times. This ownership attitude and related informal mechanisms have continued during the period when the community was collectivized as a kolkhoz. While collectivization of individual agricultural lands and reprivatisation after the end of the Soviet Union certainly led to significant changes, the collective management of the forest as common property of the community members continued throughout the Soviet and the transitional period. In contrast to Boghenii-Noi, the community in Mereni did not have community managed forests in the past. In this area all forests that are now in communal ownership have been established as artificial plantations during the decades of kolkhoz land ownership and recently during the last two decades. This \u201cKolkhoz\u201d mind-set, inherited from Soviet times and exacerbated by below explained lack of incentives, led to the understanding that the commonly owned goods actually belong to all and to nobody in particular. In the result, community members do not see their stake in the governance of communal forests. The development of understanding of common goods/common property management will take time but requires being specifically addressed in outreach, development of local governance and provision of tangible benefits to the inhabitants of the commune. The conditions of the forests in communal ownership are a key factor determining if governance of these forests functions effectively. In the visited sites, the municipality Mereni, owning the least 236 productive forests with extremely low potential for harvest of wood and NWFP, showed as well the least satisfactory performance in terms of governance. Incomes earned by the municipality from the forests are insufficient to finance any significant forestry activities. The obvious lack of ownership by the community members, as indicated by illegal cuttings and damage caused to young plantations by careless herding of livestock, cannot be addressed by hiring forest wardens by the municipality due to lack of income from the forests or other funding. For these reasons the head of the commune expects a much better forest management being implemented by Moldsilva than the commune could ever achieve. In the result he expects that the forest will be in better condition and fulfil protective functions as ecosystem services for the benefit of the commune and its inhabitants. In contrast, the higher share of productive forests in good conditions available in Mile\u015fti allows for the provision of fuel wood to community members, which in turn are refraining from illegal cutting, thus reducing the costs of forest protection.

The availability of moderate income will allow the community to employ a forester in the frame of the planned communal enterprise. The communal forests of the municipality Boghenii Noi can afford to provide minimum but enough income to sustain four staff positions and hire temporary labor for forestry works. In addition, the overall support of the community members reduces the costs of forest guarding. The three visited sites show that conditions of forests are not necessarily a result of governance, but more that forest conditions can have a decisive impact on the quality of governance. This may lead to a positive feedback, where forests in good conditions allow for the development of good governance which in turn enables a further improvement of the forest resources and areas. In contrast, poor forest conditions provide only insufficient resources to develop good governance of these forests, and in the result unsustainable use and lack of maintenance cause a further degradation of the communal forest. An important determining factor is the existence of incentives for sustainable forest management by the municipalities and by the community members. This is in particular a problem on private lands and in leased forests of communal and state ownership. Cutting of trees, even those planted on private lands, is only possible with permits. On leased lands no cuts can be permitted to the leaseholders. Thus, leaseholders can plant trees on leased lands, but would not be entitled to harvest the grown trees. At the other hand, NWFP, as e.g. walnuts, can be used by everybody without the option of providing exclusive, regulated access to leaseholders. The result is a lack of ownership by local people, even by leaseholders, and an open access dilemma. Nobody is interested in investing in the resource as no exclusive use-rights would offer a secure return for the investment made, and compliance with use restrictions can only be achieved by active law enforcement for which the municipalities lack the financial means. The disincentives for the sustainable use of forests, especially by private owners and leaseholders, limit the potential of forest lease for the municipalities to improve the governance of their forests. In Mereni, the primar sees the lease for personal recreation by local inhabitants as an incentive to plant trees on leased plots and protect larger forest units against illegal use just by their presence. The situation at the leased plot visited by the consultant did not support this statement as it looked more like encroachment of the forest edge by summer housing. Under the existing legal framework the lease of forests has limited potential to provide incentives to individuals and households, but bears risks that forests are transformed into other land-use types. Compared to the individual lease under the current system, sustainable use of forest resources through communal management of forests as common property has higher potential for the 237 development of incentives for community members to support protection and sustainable use of forests. This requires that governance of communal forests supports the development of a common property ownership by all inhabitants and that decision making on forest activities and access to forest resources is made in a democratic and transparent manner. In Boghenii Noi the analysis by Lozan and Kobernik-Gurkovskaya (2012) showed that local people are aware of what benefits the forests provide to them. Locals have realized that the more forests they have the more products (and benefits) from forests they might receive. Effective governance of Moldova\u2019s communal forests is challenged by the above explained factors. The situation in Boghenii-Noi and Mile\u015fti is positive, and these two are rare but good examples, whiles Mereni\u2019s forest governance is contrasting to these two by being in poor condition. The most of Moldova\u2019s communal forests are, however, similar to Mereni\u2019s forests - small forest areas, fragmented plots, artificial plantations of black locust of low productivity \u2013 and its local population, which is showing insufficient sense of ownership. However, despite these challenges the Consultant could see that the existing governance of local forests, with the support of international projects, has allowed for the expansion of communal forests by afforestation of unproductive lands and sites under erosion risk and that existing communal forests are partly in a satisfactory condition or have the potential of being developed into stands providing forest products and environmental services. 4. Recommendations The general recommendation is to maintain and further develop the system of communal forest ownership and management. The existing governance system is largely adequate, but modification might enable the overcoming of the above described challenges.

The Forest Code should be accordingly amended and describe more precisely the authority and mandates of different levels and agencies in terms of the different forms of forest ownership and management rights. Thus, e.g. the mandates of Moldsilva, the municipalities and the State Ecological Inspection would be described separately for state forest, communal forest and private forest. Further the new forest policy and the revised Forest Code should clearly state that Moldova\u2019s forests have multiple functions, including productive functions and provision of environmental services (e.g. soil protection and recreation). The current assignment of all forests to the \u201cfirst group\u201d with \u201cexclusively environmental protection function\u201d is misleading and does not facilitate the development of multifunctional and differentiated forest management. In the result forests in protected areas that should be left alone are in fact used, while restrictions on use options limit the incentives for the development of productive forests. In particular for private forest owners and leaseholders, regulations should be revised to remove disincentives towards sustainable forest management and prevent the transformation of leased forests into other forms of use. An important issue is the development of economically viable forest management in communal forests and the enabling of the municipalities to fulfil their functions in the governance and in the practical management of local forests. A revision of boundaries of communal and state forests can help to create larger units and allow for an economy of scale. Wherever municipalities are interested in taking back former kolkhoz forests into their ownership and have the potential to develop the necessary capacity and support by the community this should be encouraged and permitted. According to the ICAS representatives (D. Galupa and I Talmaci, pers. comm. 2015), the transfer of small sections of forests from Moldsilva to municipalities would be legally possible, but local capacity at the prim\u0103ria would first be required. Moldsilva has afforested 28,000 ha as new forests, of which 238 20,000 ha are on lands of the municipalities, the rest on lands of Moldsilva (D. Galupa and I Talmaci, pers. comm. 2015, contrasting higher figures presented by T. Botnari, Moldsilva, pers. comm. 2015). By the opinion of Moldsilva (T. Botnari, Moldsilva, pers. comm. 2015) the transfer of forests from the State Forest Fund (i.e. forests managed by Moldsilva) to the municipalities, even the exchange of forest plots, is not legally possible. However, long-term use agreements might provide opportunities to include sections of forests owned by Moldsilva into the management by municipalities. Such opportunities should be considered for the establishment of economically and administratively meaningful units. Alternatively in some areas the transfer of small forest sections to Moldsilva might be the better option, if communal forests represent only small fragments in a landscape with large state forests. By now FMPs cover only about 20% of all communal forest vegetation. By law and as a basis for their development and sustainable management all forests and other types of forest vegetation in communal ownership need to be covered by FMPs. However, because of the average low productivity it is not possible for the municipalities to finance the inventory and planning activities from their forest related income. It is also not realistic to expect municipalities to subsidize the elaboration of FMPs from their tight budget available for other pubic tasks. For these reasons the per-unit costs of elaborating FMPs should be reduced as much as possible, by applying a simplified methodology. The costs of the inventory and planning activities should be covered largely by external funding (international and national sources) while the municipalities should contribute a share and provide in-kind support. Municipalities owning small fragmented and low-productivity forests cannot be expected to keep the same level of capacity for forest management in terms of staff, funding, equipment and so on as do the forest enterprises under Moldsilva that manage much larger and more productive units. For this reason, where the additional assignment of productive forests to communal management is not possible, requirements in terms of the municipalities\u2019 capacities need to be adapted to their opportunities and needs.

This may provide an opportunity to create the necessary economically viable minimum size in terms of forest area and productivity. E.g. in one district, the Nisporeni rayon, ca. 4,000 ha of forests (and additionally silvo-pastoral areas) could be jointly managed by the involved municipalities. In the result necessary capacity can be developed and shared as such an enterprise would employ at least several forestry or agro-forestry professionals. A council of representatives from each prim\u0103ria would have the oversight of the enterprise. While this option has clear advantages in terms of economy of scale, it should be cared for that in all involved communities the mentioned sense of common property ownership is developed and maintained. Otherwise the joint enterprises might be perceived as another type of external, centralized governance and no obvious difference to state forests would be visible for the local people. This can adversely affect their willingness to refrain from illegal use and to support forest protection and sustainable management. Mereni The consultant recommends that before making any steps of transferring forest management to Moldsilva, the municipality should carefully evaluate other options. Given the current state and use of the communal forests it is not clear if Moldsilva can achieve any improvement of their condition. 239 The municipality should evaluate options like joining with neighbouring municipalities in the establishment of a joint communal forest enterprise or establishing a communal enterprise providing various services. In any case the development of a sense of common property ownership in the community will be required. The prim\u0103ria will need to employ a forest engineer, possibly on part-time basis, whose responsibilities would be to assist the municipality in maintaining forests to enhance their biodiversity and quality (both vegetal and animal/game) as well as to hire necessary local work force to carry out regeneration and other silvicultural works, that are aimed to increase the productivity of forests and their further improvement. The Consultant recommends that the prim\u0103ria seeks donor support for initial funding of these measures. Mile\u015fti The municipality is looking now for resources to update their FMP, which will expire this year. The municipality of Mile\u015fti also plans to establish a communal agro-forestry entity/enterprise which will help local population manage in a sustainable way their own communal forests and/or pastureland. This would greatly improve the management of local natural resources (mainly forests and pastureland) and will significantly contribute to conserving local biodiversity (including game species) and enhance community's capacity to face possible changes in environment (e.g., climate change). The potentials of establishing such an enterprise at inter-communal level should be considered for making use of the economy of scale. Then such a cooperative management at inter- communal level might be economically more viable. However, there are as well potential risks to be considered as a unit covering larger areas might negatively affect the sense of ownership by the local community members. Fig. 7: Well-managed communally owned mixed oak forest in Boghenii-Noi Boghenii-Noi The municipality of Boghenii-Noi is interested in updating their FMP right now, as it which will expire this year. Also, the municipality is interested in becoming entitled of owning a marking hammer and 240 doing the marking for cuttings on their own. This may improve their effectiveness of forestry works as delays due to late marking would be avoided. If it is not possible to authorize the municipality, Moldsilva should care that marking works are done in due time. The restitution of 200 ha of former kolkhoz forest that is now owned and managed by Moldsilva would further enhance the management of their communal forest. The transfer of ownership to the commune should therefore be considered and in case this turns out legally impossible, long term user and management rights for these forest sections should be assigned to the municipality. The Consultant recommends assigning to the municipality of a hunting and game management area corresponding to the borders of the commune. In case possible legal barriers for assigning game management directly to the prim\u0103ria, community-members may establish a community-based non- commercial organization with involvement of the prim\u0103ria to which the rights and responsibilities could be assigned. This would provide another element of integrated management of natural resources within the boundaries of the commune, complementing the management of forests, pastures and waterbodies. The rights and responsibilities of game management should be assigned for at least 10 years as a pilot, with the option of further extension. This case might be used as a pilot for the development of area-based hunting management by municipalities or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04e378e0-dd5c-48b0-af00-075f0c71eb11": {"__data__": {"id_": "04e378e0-dd5c-48b0-af00-075f0c71eb11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16242380a8443dca42cf22fb05e2c7f05134dd1533be569774724af3b0f4501f"}, "3": {"node_id": "55c05e54-41ab-4b7f-8150-63a4465fd502", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c96d183f3073ce676bec187c885099ff834cb2e8161d3d15d33edf8f3ba72b88"}}, "hash": "294b17514d6f14650e9250e1f51e57cc344e756b2aebee5095feae69770d7409", "text": "community-based organizations. 5.

Introduction The following case study presents the findings from a mission to Ukraine during May 6-12, 2015, as well as results of the analysis of reports and available official documents. The focus of this Case Study is on the specific situation of governance of local forests in three regions visited by the consultant, representing typical situations in terms of governance structure and forest conditions. More general information gathered during this mission is integrated in the Regional Study. For understanding the specifics of the cases studied in Ukraine a brief explanation of some of the terminology applied, in particular for the names of institutions, is necessary. Some terms are difficult to translate literally into English. Most important in the context of this study, in Ukraine the term \u201ccommunal\u201d is used for all administrative levels below the republic (called state), thus including the levels of region, district and sub-district. For this reason the term is put in quotation marks where referring to administrative territorial levels higher than the lowest administrative territorial level, i.e. the sub-district, here called the commune (without quotation marks). The following English terms are applied: Administrative territorial units State \u2013 refers to the state of Ukraine as country, i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55c05e54-41ab-4b7f-8150-63a4465fd502": {"__data__": {"id_": "55c05e54-41ab-4b7f-8150-63a4465fd502", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16242380a8443dca42cf22fb05e2c7f05134dd1533be569774724af3b0f4501f"}, "2": {"node_id": "04e378e0-dd5c-48b0-af00-075f0c71eb11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "294b17514d6f14650e9250e1f51e57cc344e756b2aebee5095feae69770d7409"}}, "hash": "c96d183f3073ce676bec187c885099ff834cb2e8161d3d15d33edf8f3ba72b88", "text": "to institutions belonging to the central republican level; Region \u2013 refers to the level below the republic level, District \u2013 refers to the level below the region level, Commune \u2013 refers to the level below the district level, can include several villages Rural Council \u2013 the local council at the level of rural communes, in Ukrainian silska rada (\u0441\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430) State forestry and other institutions State Forest Resources Agency (SFRA) \u2013 the central state body at republic level with its subunits managing state forest and fulfilling some roles in planning and control of management forests in other forms of ownership (\u201ccommunal\u201d and private); UKRDERZHLISPROEKT (\u0423\u041a\u0420\u0414\u0415\u0420\u0416\u041b\u0406\u0421\u041f\u0420\u041e\u0415\u041a\u0422) \u2013 the project enterprise in charge of forest inventory and management planning under the SFRA; Region State Forestry Administration \u2013 Region Administration of Forestry and Hunting Management, territorial unit of the SFRA at region level, not subordinated to the region council and administration; State Forestry Enterprise (SFE) \u2013 economic entity managing state forests, usually in charge of the state forests in the boundaries of one district; Region Environmental Department \u2013 Department of Ecology and Natural Resources belonging to the region administration; State Ecological Inspection \u2013 state agency under the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources; Minagripol \u2013 Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine. \u201cCommunal\u201d forestry institutions Region Forestry Enterprise (RFE) \u2013 \u201cCommunal\u201d forestry enterprise belonging to a region, e.g. HALSILLIS in L\u2019viv Region; District Forestry Enterprise (DFE) \u2013 \u201cCommunal\u201d forestry enterprise, managing \u201ccommunal\u201d forests within one or more districts, having the status of a legal entity, e.g. the so-called daughter enterprises of HALSILLIS in districts of L\u2019viv Region 243 Other terms ATO \u2013 anti-terrorist operation, official reference to the military operations in Donetsk and Lugansk regions against Russian occupation forces and Russia-backed insurgents; The following brief historical background is based on the explanations by experts from Transcarpathia (Hrubiy, formerly Minagripol, pers. comm. 2015) and may in some details differ from the situation in other parts of the country, especially in the east.

In Ukraine with the establishment of Soviet power in the 1920s and in the western part of the country in 1939 most forests were nationalised and included in state forest enterprises. Other forest areas together with arable lands and pastures were incorporated in the collective farms (kolkhozes) in the course of collectivization. Especially in forest rich regions of western Ukraine these kolkhoz owned forests made up large areas. E.g. in 1982 in Transcarpathia 140,000 ha of forests were in the possession of kolkhozes and other agricultural units, out of approximately 650,000 ha of forest lands. Fig. 1: Wooden church in L\u2019viv region. Until the 1970s most kolkhozes used the forests in their possession for the fulfilment of immediate needs without implementing a systematic silvicultural management. During the mid-1970s inter- kolkhoz forestry enterprises were established in some areas, because the forest use by the kolkhozes was increasingly recognized as unsustainable. These forestry enterprises were governed by a council formed by representatives of each kolkhoz. The kolkhozes tried to maintain the existing situation, i.e. the use of forests without significant investment in reforestation and silvicultural activities. The forestry enterprise did not fully function because the kolkhozes remained permanent land-users of the forest lands, while the forestry enterprises were only technical implementers that had to supply the needs of the kolkhozes. Although at least some experts were employed by the 244 inter-kolkhoz forestry enterprises, in most kolkhoz forests still until 1982 real sustainable forest management did not happen. In 1982 (in Transcarpathia) the first kolkhoz forests got a full forest inventory and management planning (FMP), and in 1983 first cutting areas were formally approved and the systematic implementation of forest management started. In 1992 the FMP were first revised and updated, but due to the difficulties after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, only a part of the inter-kolkhoz forestry enterprises got approved FMPs. During the 1990s a unique policy on land-use and forests was virtually inexistent. The organizational structure changed several times as the kolkhozes were restructured and renamed. The \u201cinter-farm forestry enterprises\u201d (Rus. \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044b) since 1996 became \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises that were reporting to the district councils, which would also decide about the production plans and other issues. In 1999 the renamed and restructured kolkhozes lost the permanent land- use rights on all lands except agricultural lands. In accordance to the Forest Code of 1996 all forests were supposed to be state owned and the state forestry enterprises were understood as the only permanent land-users of forest lands. With the dissolution of the restructured and renamed kolkhozes agricultural lands were transferred into private ownership. Some lands (e.g. many pastures) were not formalized as private property, as people feared loss of social subsidies (e.g. on gas) if owning too much land. Some lands where formalized as property of rural councils, others remained unassigned. The transfer of former kolkhoz forests into the state forest fund, managed by the state forestry enterprises, was only partly realized. The state forestry enterprises were not interested in taking over large areas of these forests, which they considered without (economic) perspective. Accordingly the state forestry enterprises wanted to incorporate only the good forest sections, and in the result in many areas no handover took place. Thus (in Transcarpathia) all forests remained in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership. The Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food (Minagripol) had in some areas the authority over the forests owned by agricultural units. In 2001-2003 this ministry established its own agency for the administration and management of the kolkhoz forests through own district level forestry enterprises. These enterprises were directly subordinated to the Minagripol, received a small budget subsidy for funding of FMP updates and of salaries of protection staff, did not have to share incomes with the higher level, but had to pay taxes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2643fe6e-13e7-4a86-8c80-22521ab2254d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2643fe6e-13e7-4a86-8c80-22521ab2254d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fa0ab0482eeac2a5ab79e3df9530db5e866ba35dcf38fe797abbc56963292a5"}, "2": {"node_id": "72a1d236-edf8-49d6-98a1-e5cc9fd8f8d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "421a96d9c5d3c4374c354e94fb3e87893c75a7456e26e5babcd001ba800a0f9a"}}, "hash": "f86a6312d4f9f47bf6a4a1f732047da9703790f8c4bf1d63a47591bdb625c8e6", "text": "In 2003 in Transcarpathia as well as in some other regions the land use rights on \u201ccommunal\u201d forest lands were formally assigned to a region forestry enterprise and the 13 district forestry enterprises lost their status as legal entities and became branches of the region forestry enterprise.131 This brief historical overview cannot be exhaustive nor does the Consultant claim that every detail is correct.

These enterprises that had been established on the basis of former kolkhozes were state enterprises that belonged to the Minagripol. These enterprises are now liquidated due to their big debts and the forests and the majority of staff are handed over to the state forestry enterprises.\u201d This statement partly contradicts Zhyla et al. 2014, stating that \u201ccurrently a liquidation commission works on forestry enterprises of \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership.\u201d 245 According to FORZA (2010) the total area of national forest land of Ukraine is 10.8 million ha (including 1.6 million ha of protected forests), the area covered by forest is 9.7 million ha, or 15.7% of the land area, and the area of forest under the management of \u201ccommunal bodies\u201d is 950 thousand ha (9% of the total forest area). All forest lands of Ukraine are currently under the jurisdiction of different ministries and state institutions, as follows (FORZA 2010): \uf0b7 State Forestry Committee of Ukraine: 7.4 million ha (68% of forest area); \uf0b7 Ministry of Agricultural Policy and Food: 1.8 million ha (17%); \uf0b7 Ministry of Defence: 0.2 million ha (2%); \uf0b7 Ministry of Emergencies: 0.2 million ha (2%); \uf0b7 Ministry of Natural Environment Protection: 0.1 million ha (1%); \uf0b7 Ministry of Transport and Communication: 0.1 million ha (1%); \uf0b7 Other ministries and institutions: 0.2 million ha (2%); \uf0b7 State reserve forest lands: 0.8 million ha (7%) \u2013 local decision making at Rayon (district) level. These numbers do not entirely fit with the stated afore \u201c950 thousand ha (9% of the total forest area) under the management of \u201ccommunal bodies\u201d\u201d. Additional forest lands that are assigned to the Minagripol are at least partly managed by \u201ccommunal\u201d forest enterprises. Former kolkhoz forests that have not been transferred to the state forest fund or incorporated into state protected areas are managed as \u201ccommunal\u201d forests by forestry enterprises at region level, which have at district level either daughter enterprises or branches. The total area and share of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests is difficult to assess as ownership and management rights vary. For instance in L\u2019viv, Vinnytsia and Transcarparthia about 25%, 38% and14%, respectively, of the total forest areas are managed by \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises, the forestry enterprises are owned by different levels of territorial administration, in the case of L\u2019viv and Vinnytsia by the region, in case of Transcarpathia by the state, represented by the Minagripol (?). Currently in the 25 regions of Ukraine \u201ccommunal\u201d forests in two regions are managed by district forestry enterprises only, in nine regions they are managed by region forestry enterprises with branches or daughter enterprises at district level, and in the remaining regions forests are managed by state forestry enterprises only (some under the Minagripol and/or transferred to the SFRA). Similar to other former Soviet Republics, already during the times of collectivization those forests that were considered of industrial value and formed larger forested areas were assigned to the state forestry enterprises, while smaller forest areas in agricultural landscapes and forests that were of low industrial potential due to site conditions and/or history of use by the rural populations were incorporated in the kolkhozes. While in the pre-Soviet period the communities managed their forests as common property, the Soviet collectivization destroyed this understanding. The mentality to take only but not to invest remained beyond the Soviet Union. Despite democratic representation in the rural, district and region councils so far the local people hardly see \u201ccommunal\u201d forest as \u201ctheir forest\u201d, and accordingly social control develops slowly.

The area includes 460 ha of protected area with different zones, partly allowing for forestry activities.

Reforestation uses the locally occurring species which are planted as stands mixed by species, but in 2014 for the first time non-native Douglas fir was planted. Fig. 4: Landscape with \u201ccommunal\u201d forests \u2013 Yavoriv district of L\u2019viv region. Transcarpathia (Hruby and Turis, formerly Minagripol, pers. comm. 2015) In the region of Transcarpathia \u201ccommunal\u201d forests currently cover only 90,000 ha out of about 650,000 ha total forest cover, of which 490,000 ha belong to the state forest fund, managed by state forestry enterprises, 10,000 ha are military forest, and the remaining are in PAs under the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. The area of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests shrank compared to formerly about 120,000 ha former kolkhoz forests because some areas had been included in PAs, and some districts already before 2001 by decision of the region council handed their forests over to the state forestry enterprises. The \u201ccommunal\u201d forests are managed by a regional forest enterprise with branches at district level. However, Oborska (in lit. 2015) explained that these forests were formally in permanent land-use by the Minagripol. These enterprises made losses and due to their high debts they were in the process of liquidation since 2014, with forests and staff being taken over by state forest enterprises. However, Zhyla et al. (2014) referred to these forestry enterprises in liquidation as enterprises in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership. The \u201ccommunal\u201d forests are largely mixed secondary forests of low value, while the state forests are mostly beech forests of more commercial importance. Beech forests are managed through shelter wood cuttings (German: Schirmschlag) and beech is used for furniture and charcoal. There is a local charcoal factory that processes beech wood but also uses now up to 30% wood from non-forest land (succession areas on abandoned agricultural lands). Vinnytsia region (Ivanets, VINOBLAGROLIS, pers. comm. 2015) The Vinnytsia region has 216,000 ha state forest and 130,000 ha \u201ccommunal\u201d forest, the latter being 250 in permanent land-use by the region forestry enterprise VINOBLAGROLIS (\u0412\u0406\u041d\u041e\u0411\u041b\u0410\u0413\u0420\u041e\u041b\u0406\u0421), with land-use certificates so far covering 100,000 ha and the certification of the remaining area being in process. Since 2000 additionally to the above mentioned forest area 10,000 ha of new \u201ccommunal\u201d forest have been planted on abandoned lands, but so far the land-use certificates were not yet issued to the region forestry enterprise. The region forestry enterprise was established in 2000. Until then the forests were still in the ownership of the kolkhozes. The enterprise has 21 district forestry enterprises (covering 27 districts). The district forestry enterprises are \u201cdaughter enterprises\u201d with own status as legal entities. Formerly they had been branches of the region forestry enterprise, but under the new tax system this was not practical anymore. The region forestry enterprise also manages 83,000 ha assigned hunting grounds (including wetlands and arable lands) with roe dear and wild boar as well as hare and ducks as main game species. For the management of the hunting grounds 12 rangers are employed and supplementary feeding and saltlicks are provided.

Findings While these findings refer to the elements of the governance frameworks (as explained in the method section of the Preliminary Report), the Consultant does not attempt to cover here all pillars and their components in all detail but presents the specific aspects identified at the visited sites and being of relevance for this case study. Pillar 1: Policy, legal, institutional and regulatory frameworks Component 1.1: Policies During the ENPI-FLEG II programme\u2019s national consultative committee meeting, one of the participants characterized the frequent and ongoing changes in policy as \u201creform diarrhoea\u201d, meaning that policies are reformed and change in such frequency and without proper \u201cdigestion\u201d that the organism, i.e. in that case the forestry sector, seriously suffers. 251 Since independence, and in particular with the transformation and privatization of the kolkhozes, the Government of Ukraine rather preferred the central management of all forests, in contrast to communal management of pastures as common property of villages. Until 2014 the policy was that all forests should be in the hand of a monopolist; this policy changed only by decree of the Cabinet of Ministers when Yatsenyuk became prime minister. The SFRA still has the official position that it would better if this agency would take over all forests in the country. (Turis, formerly Minagripol, pers. comm. 2015) The representatives of the L\u2019viv region council (Pyatak and Peshko, pers. comm. 2015) mentioned the decentralization policy of the government expected to impact as well on the governance of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests. More authority should be delegated to the basic level. In the result some of the local rural councils may expect to get the management authority on forests handed over, especially where rural communes are merged (currently 637, 50% reduction planned). The regional council intents to keep the existing forest management system, and it wants to continue managing the communal forests in a unified way in larger units. Zhyla et al. (2014) lamented the absence of a strategy for the development of forestry enterprises of communal ownership type. A national state policy of the forestry sector would be needed that would determine the functions of different institutions and ownership types as well as issues of separation of functions of management and control. Component 1.2: Legal and regulatory frameworks The key legal and regulatory documents determining the governance of local forests are the Constitution, the Forest Code, the Land Code, other laws and a number of bylaws. The most recent law governing Ukraine\u2019s forests and their management is the Forest Code of 2006, with last changes in December 2014. The Land Code of Ukraine from 2001 has been amended in accordance to this Forest Code. The development of the legislation on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests has been analysed by Zhyla et al. (2014) and is beyond the scope of this case study. The history of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests is characterized by inconsistencies, contradictions and gaps in the legal regulation of key issues in particular in relation to ownership rights (see section 1.3!). The Forest Code regulates the management of all forests in Ukraine, including forests of all forms of ownership, user-rights and protection status. The Forest Code, beyond the regulations what forests can be in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership and the assignment of user-rights on these forests to \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises, does not provide for differences between the management and use of \u201ccommunal\u201d and state forests. One difference is that FMP development and the implementation of forestry activities in \u201ccommunal\u201d forest have to be funded by the budget of the respective \u201ccommunal\u201d owner. Further, local self-governance organs have the authority and obligation to resolve conflicts about management and use of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests. A large number of bylaws regulate the details of the implementation of the forest code. Some bylaws, like the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers #655/23 July 2008 \u201cOn the confirmation of values for the calculation of the amount of damage caused to forest\u201d were adopted by the government, while a number of bylaws have been adopted at the level of the SFRA. Zhyla et al.

The Land Code defines the land categories depending on their designation (Art. 19). Lands designated for agriculture and lands designated for forestry form two different categories. This has impact on the inclusion of natural or planted forests on agricultural lands into the forest fund and the application of regular forest management. The Land Code provides the opportunity to change the designation of lands (Art. 20) as well as the change of ownership, including the transfer of state owned land into \u201ccommunally\u201d owned land (Art. 117). The authorities in charge of changes of the category designation and ownership of lands are defined in Art. 122 of the Land Code. There are as well other laws that influence forest management at local level, like the law \u201cOn local self-governance in Ukraine\u201d, defining the authorities and functions of local councils and administrations without specific reference to forestry enterprises, or the \u201cCode on administrative legal violations\u201d, defining the authorities of various officials in the context of law enforcement. Zhyla et al. 2014 found that 92% of interviewed persons involved in the management of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests (representative of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises, of administrations and of rural councils) expressed the need to improve the legislation on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests. Among other problem issues, they mentioned the indeterminate state of the staff involved in the protection of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests and the inadequate regulation of wood harvest, determination of prices and wood markets. Component 1.3: Ownership and user right systems Ownership in the context of this study concerns the ownership of land on which the forest is located, the forest and the user-rights related to them, and the ownership of the forestry enterprise. These objects can be, and usually are, owned by different subjects. The Forest Code of the Ukrainian SSR, acting until 1994, only mentioned state ownership of forests, which would be assigned to users for permanent or temporary use. This system was kept in the first Forest Code of Ukraine in 1994. The user-rights and ownership of former kolkhoz forests in the context of the liquidation of kolkhozes were regulated by two decrees of the Minagropol, which led in 2000-2001 to the establishment of \u201ccommunal\u201d or state enterprises, depending on the position of the respective district and region councils. These enterprises took over the user rights on the (that time) state owned forests that had been permanently assigned to kolkhozes. (Oborska, pers. comm. 2015) At the same time the Land Code of Ukraine (2001) first provided for the opportunity of \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership of forest lands which would be permanently assigned for land use by \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. This provision contradicted the Forest Code acting that time, which limited ownership on forests exclusively to the state. The adoption of the law \u201cOn delimitation of lands of state and communal ownership\u201d in 2004 further prohibited the handover of forests outside of settlements into \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership. Shelterbelts on lands of the land reserve, however, were transferred into \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership. (Zhyla et al. 2014) The Forest Code of 2006 in accordance to the acting Land Code established the existence of state, \u201ccommunal\u201d and private forest ownership. In \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership are forests within the boundaries of settlements (towns, villages). Also forests outside of settlement boundaries can be in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership under the condition that lands in state and \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership are delimitated. Permanent use by \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises would only be assigned for forests on lands in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership. But on lands in state ownership that have been assigned to 253 \u201ccommunal\u201d users earlier user-rights on forests would stay in force. (Zhyla et al. 2014) The issue of delimitation of lands in state and \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership, which is important for the determination of management of local forests, is discussed under component 3.3. The Land Code (Art. 56) also allows for the handover to natural persons and legal entities of degraded agricultural lands for the purpose of afforestation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a28927c-1ba9-4cb3-b5c8-311b74959599": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a28927c-1ba9-4cb3-b5c8-311b74959599", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79c7db8e8c166c1e8ba101099219403cbde54f50793ce6a0f662007fb00bdc2b"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a221d29-90c5-4924-82d9-81f19a7fbea9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5194dfe8ec3e4df003b5d997cec8c1a9e1c5c31fe5788fd9640231e797c4a67"}}, "hash": "6e085978b20e6cf7a212240cc94e4afa342b1f34be7bbd814201b880c0f6675f", "text": "In Vinnytsia region, the region forestry enterprise has certificates about permanent land-use for 100,000 ha, while the formalizing of the remaining 30,000 ha is still in process (Ivanets, VINOBLAGROLIS, pers. comm. 2015). In L\u2019viv region after the land reform the former kolkhoz forests stayed in the ownership of the rural councils, and a new management structure was developed with involvement of districts and the region. Thus in L\u2019viv region since 2000 all communal forests are owned by the local rural councils and by the district councils who have handed over the management function of the region (Pyatak, pers. comm. 2015).

This head of the rural council also contradicted the statement on the ownership of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests, denying that these forests were \u201con the balance\u201d, i.e. in the property, of the rural council, but of the region forestry enterprise. This illustrates that even immediately involved stakeholders have diverging opinions on key governance issues. Concluding, the ownership and use right scheme of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests seems to be as follows: \uf0b7 \u201cCommunal\u201d forest lands and the forests growing on these are owned by the commune132; \uf0b7 Permanent user-rights on the \u201ccommunal\u201d forest lands are assigned (or in process of being assigned) to the region forestry enterprise; \uf0b7 Management of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests is delegated by the region forestry enterprise to district forestry enterprises or district forestry units; \uf0b7 Region forestry enterprises are \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises, owned by the region council, possibly co-owned by district councils; \uf0b7 District forestry enterprises are legal entities, daughter enterprises of and owned by the region forestry enterprises, or alternatively district forestry units are branches of region forestry enterprises. This scheme of ownership seems not always fully developed. Many of the interviewed stakeholders did not seem to have a clear understanding of the ownership and use-rights. In particular the ownership of lands and the permanent use-rights are not always formally certified. The ownership and use-right system in Transcarpathia seems different, as there the Minagropol according to some statement (Hruby and Turis, formerly Minagripol, pers. comm. 2015) either owns forestry enterprises and/or is in charge of state owned forest not belonging to the SFRA. Forests can also be leased by natural persons and legal entities. Leaseholders have to pay annual lease fees and a one-time fee for \u201ccompensation of damage. There is no limit on the size of leased areas but usually small areas are leased to avoid large compensation payments. This decision 132 In Smolyn rural council of L\u2019viv region the Consultant was told (Shanova, pers. comm. 2015) that the region forestry enterprise is now formalizing the land ownership of the forest lands. So far it is only owner (or permanent user) of the forests, but not of the lands on which they grow, which are owned by the rural council. The process was already started before the current head rural council was elected and the current stage of the process is unclear. The rural council would like to keep the land ownership if still possible. 254 making on lease requires agreement from the rural council, the region forestry enterprise and the region state forestry department (pers. comm. Ivanets, Vinnytsia 2015). This involvement of various parties also illustrates the unclear ownership and user-rights on forests and forest lands. All harvest of wood and timber is done by the forestry enterprises or their contractors. Private persons and other legal entities are not permitted to cut standing trees or even collect logging remnants or dead wood. Local people have access to forests independent of the ownership type and can use NWFP for their personal needs. Military forests are also accessible for people as any other forest; only during exercises access is temporarily restricted. In the practice NWFP are harvested by everybody without restrictions, where enough resources are available (blueberries, mushrooms, wild strawberries and blackberries in Yavoriv district of L\u2019viv region, Smolinets, Shanova, pers. comm. 2015) also for commercial purposes (sold at the market). With the open access to NWFP resources no restrictions can be established in the interest of their sustainable use and forestry enterprises are not obliged to adapt their felling activities to the interest of NWFP users. In Vinnytsia the only forest permits not related to use of wood are issued by the regional forestry enterprise for the placement of beehives in forest areas (Ivanets, VINOBLAGROLIS, pers. comm. 2015).

The Consultant was not able to study the bylaws that formalize these mandates. He therefore relies here on the statements by interviewed stakeholders which may in some extent reflect their perceptions but not entirely be in accordance to the bylaws. The State Forest Resources Agency (SFRA) is the main state body in the forestry sector. Until 2012 the mandate of the SFRA included the right to bring up suggestions for new legislation. At the same time the SFRA carried the functions of execution of laws and control of this execution. This multiple mandate provided the agency with a position of being able to make its own rules, implement them as seen appropriate and without real external control. After 2012 a part of the authorities of the SFRA has been changed aiming at a separation of legislative, execution and control functions. The SFRA is now formally subordinated to the Cabinet of Ministers with the supervision carried out by the Minister (not Ministry) of Agrarian Policies and Food. The state forests within the management authority of the SFRA are managed by the state forestry enterprises that are subordinated to the region state forest administrations in each region. These region state forest administrations are the territorial structures of the SFRA and should not fulfill economic (business) functions, but do so in the reality by interfering with the state forest enterprises. Thus the SFRA for the state forests through its structures still carries the mandates of general supervision, administration, forest management and control. Further, the agency for forest inventory 255 and management planning Ukrderzhlisproekt is a structure of the SFRA. The territorial structures of the SFRA, the region state forest administrations and the state forestry enterprises are not subordinated to the respective region, district or rural council or their local administrations. The State Ecological Inspection executes in a limited extent external control on the management of state forests as well as \u201ccommunal\u201d and private forests. It has to approve the areas where in accordance to the FMPs main use felling (final logging) is planned to be carried out, but does not influence on reforestation and silvicultural activities. The communes, as the basis level of local-self-governance, which includes maximum 2-3 villages, do not take any decisions about the management of forests, but have a person in charge of land division that may participate in the definition of forest areas. The mandates on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests are more distributed over various institutions: \uf0b7 The SFRA, despite having no longer the mandate of legislative initiative, is mainly determining the overall forest sector policy and strategy of the state and through the development of bylaws directly influences on key aspects of forest management on the ground and on the economic situation of the forestry enterprises, independent of the type of ownership and user-rights of the enterprises and the forests they manage; \uf0b7 The agency Ukrderzhlisproekt under the SFRA is the only institution authorized to carry out the forest inventory and management planning (FMP); \uf0b7 The regional state forest administrations issue forest cutting permits for main use felling and certificates of origin for export of timber, and control all forest users, independent of forest ownership, including the region and district forestry enterprises; \uf0b7 The State Ecological Inspection approves the size of annually harvested areas and amounts felled and deals with violations of forestry regulations in \u201ccommunal\u201d forests, \uf0b7 In L\u2019viv and Vinnytsia regions the region forestry enterprises coordinate, monitor and control the management of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests by the district forestry enterprises and make decisions on forest use; \uf0b7 The district forestry enterprises fulfil similar functions as the state forest enterprises do: they carry out all forest management activities in the frame of the FMP, propose cutting areas, issue forest cutting permits (except permits for main use felling that are issued by the region state forestry administration), hire and oversee contractors; \uf0b7 The region forestry enterprises are controlled by and report to the region councils, while the district and rural councils do not have any direct authority over the district forestry enterprises which report to the region forestry enterprises; \uf0b7 District councils participate in appointment of directors of district forestry enterprises and make the decisions on lease of forest lands; \uf0b7 Rural councils participate in the recruitment of the local lesniks (foresters at lowest level) and participate in decisions on lease.

In contrast to the state forestry enterprises the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises do not possess the authority of issuing protocols and penalties for violations of forest regulations, but have to rely on the State Ecological Inspections to deal with offenders. The region forest enterprise in L\u2019viv region complained about too much involvement from outside, notably from the SFRA and its region state forestry administration and the Ministry of Ecology and 256 Natural Resources.

In what extent the State Ecological Inspection already fulfills such an external control function did not become clear to the Consultant, but it is certainly an option to develop this mandate of this inspection, which is independent of the forestry administrations. On the other hand Zhyla et al. (2014) quoted that almost all stakeholder involved in the management of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests considered as serious insufficiency of the current system the lack of a central state organ in charge of overall forest management independent of the type of ownership. Component 1.5: Financial arrangements, economic instruments and benefit sharing The region and district forest enterprises are entirely self-reliant in financial terms and do not get any state support for their regular operations. In L\u2019viv region the district forestry enterprises pay a share of their income to the region forestry enterprise. The amount is calculated by the region forestry enterprise in accordance to an approved calculation method on the basis of the economic situation of the district and region forestry enterprises and agreed by the board of directors. The region forestry enterprise in turn provides certain services to the district enterprise and makes use of the economy of scale, serving them like an association, e.g. through the implementation of joint programs or keeping of specialized experts in the staff that would not be affordable for individual district forestry enterprises. The annual income of the region forestry enterprise HALSILLIS in L\u2019viv region is 60 Mio UHR of which 20% is spent for taxes. The income taxes of the region and district forestry enterprises go to the region budget and the profit is used by decision of the respective region or district council. The 258 costs of the FMP activities are paid by the region forestry enterprise and a contribution from the region budget.

Incomes of the district forestry enterprises are mainly from the sale of fuel wood and timber. For leased areas the district forestry enterprises receive the \u201ccompensation of damage\u201d, which is at the beginning of the lease calculated and paid for the entire lease period. The amounts depend on the forest tree species of the leased area and is in the range of 50,000 \u2013 200,000 UHR/ha. Leaseholders usually take only small areas to avoid large compensation payments. There are no cross-subsidies between wealthier and less wealthy district forestry enterprises, but in L\u2019viv region none of them is making losses. The Consultant has the impression that self-financing by district forestry enterprises may have the positive effect of preventing in some extent the implementation of unnecessary forestry activities. Representatives of district forestry enterprises (Tisyak, district forestry enterprise Yavoriv, pers. comm. 2015) complained that state forestry enterprises manage larger forests in better condition than those managed by the district forestry enterprises. Further, state forestry enterprises are said being subsidized by the state budget while the district forestry enterprises do not get state budget support. While the first claim is understandable, given the history of state and \u201ccommunal\u201d forests, the second claim could not be verified by the Consultant, but larger subsidies seem unlikely. The findings of Zhyla et al. (2014) showed that most of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are financially entirely self-reliant. Only 20% of the respondents mentioned other funding sources, exclusively contributions by the local budgets, but nobody mentioned any co-financing from the state budget or from special funds. Zhyla et al. (2014) reported that these enterprises consider the management of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests underfunded, as compared to the management of the state forest fund by state forestry enterprises. 90% of the interviewed representatives of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises lamented about significant financial shortages and consequently lack of sufficient staff, affecting the viability of the forestry enterprises. As main reason for financial shortages the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises stated the poor composition of the timber assortment available for harvest and sale. Also the productivity of the forest stands, i.e. their annual increment and available age classes, limit the sustainable annual harvest. Further the compared to state forests higher expenses of forestry operations due to the fragmented patterns and small size of the forest areas is an important factor contributing to the unsatisfactory income situation of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. The reason for these limiting factors is in the origin of a large part of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests in plantations established as protective forest on land not suitable for agriculture like shallow soils, gullies, and similar sites. Also shelterbelts or windbreaks established for the purpose of amelioration of agricultural lands have been included into the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests and contribute to low production figures per managed area unit. Beyond the funding of its forestry operations, the region and district forestry enterprises and the forests managed by them directly contribute to local livelihoods. Rural councils get direct financial benefits from the harvest of wood, a share of the fee for the use of natural resources or stumpage fee (Soviet term \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0451\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430). The payments of stumpage fees for main use go now entirely to the state budget, but for intermediate use the stumpage fee is shared as follows: to the rural council 25%, district 25%, region 50% (figures by Yamyk, rural council Voronovitsa (Vinnytsia), pers. comm. 2015). In Seredkevychi (L\u2019viv) the Consultant was told that forest enterprises (of all forms of ownership) pay stumpage fees per amount of harvested WFP and that the shares of the rural council in case of main use felling are 50%, in case of other cuts (maintenance, sanitary) 100%. This seem to be the formerly applied shares as the head of the rural council was aware about recently changed distribution mechanisms and amounts but did not know the figures (Smolinets, pers. comm. 2015).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5528a9e2-4095-4465-98f5-f0fe64ef8894": {"__data__": {"id_": "5528a9e2-4095-4465-98f5-f0fe64ef8894", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00c1f5d5d3637080254d8e7a80a835951f901d9673cdc20101131836ca163240"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f162787-b889-4c3e-98d5-8fb0c333dfb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "027a06d7ac799f46b07c32a498bd11996ae6fb08199c38be854f805ef10abf78"}}, "hash": "536d1fde35c6bb8b3cff77204ed8cc6903e9c63f41d053230b700418cce01191", "text": "comm. 2015). Independent of the ownership type, the introduced reduction of the share of the 259 stumpage fees received by rural councils by 100% (main use) or 75% (intermediary use) is seriously affecting the budget of rural councils in areas with significant forest cover and will undermine their commitment and support to the protection and sustainable use of forests.

Due to the different stand conditions, in the state forests main use logging dominates and thus the rural councils receive little income from stumpage fees, despite compared to \u201ccommunal\u201d forests similar or larger areas covered by state forests (confirmed by representatives of rural councils in Smolyn and Vinnytsia, pers. comm. 2015). The harvest of timber and the transportation of the logs cause damage to local roads. The forestry enterprises justify the damage they cause by the stumpage fees paid (representatives of rural councils, pers. comm. 2015). This interpretation at least deserves further assessment as stumpage fees are hardly sufficient to invest in major road repair. With the change of the shares of the stumpage fees the rural councils and districts receive much less than before and nothing from main use felling. Direct economic benefits for the local populations are important to develop a sense of ownership and ensure compliance with rules and restrictions. One of the benefits is employment of local people. In L\u2019viv region the region forestry enterprise stated that district forestry enterprises can do forestry works by themselves and hire local workforce (Peshko, pers. comm. 2015). However in the visited communes Seredkevychi and Smolyn the heads of the rural councils (pers. comm. 2015) told that all forest enterprises do not officially employ local people, but only informally with in-kind payment in form of wood or cash from sold wood; but local people would prefer official employment. Compared to the state and military forestry enterprises, the district forestry enterprise was thought to contract more external companies for carrying out forestry works instead of hiring local workforce. The deputy head of the rural council in Vinnytsia (pers. comm. 2015) said that the state and district forestry enterprises both hire local temporary workers and pay in cash (preferred by locals), but could imagine that possibly in remote areas the practice might be different, i.e. informal payment in form of wood. Access to forest products is another benefit local people receive from the forests. The director of the Yavoriv district forestry enterprise (Tisyak, pers. comm. 2015) clearly stated that no fuel wood cut or collection by private persons can be permitted. However, in Seredkevychi (Smolinets, pers. comm. 2015) cut remnants are used by local people. The forestry staff is said to agree with this, but this is seems unofficial and not accounted for. Fuel wood is bought by local people from state and district forestry enterprises. In Vinnytsia fuel wood prices are similar at state and \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. And both pay workers in-kind with fuel wood, which is at least partly locally resold (Yamyk, pers. comm. 2015). The region forestry enterprises as well as the district forestry enterprises provide some fuel wood for free or at reduced prices for social institutions and poor or otherwise eligible families. The regional forestry enterprise in L\u2019viv stated that fuel wood and timber of a value of 3 Mio UHR were delivered for free for local needs in the villages in one year (Peshko, pers. comm. 2015). The Yavoriv district forestry enterprise (Tisyak, pers. comm. 2015) allocates fuel wood (5 m\u00b3/household and season) to the local people at prices much below market value, to invalids and ATO participants for free. In one commune alone they have 16 applicants, but the provision needs to be agreed by the region forestry enterprise. In Vinnytsia region 3 % of harvested wood goes for 25% of the normal price to poor people, ATO participants, Afghan war veterans and other needy households (Ivanets, pers. comm. 2015). The rural council Voronovitsa in Vinnytsia also reported that the district forestry enterprise supplies fuel wood at lower prices for social institutions, poor families, ATO participants, while the 260 state forestry enterprise does not do this (Yamyk, pers. comm. 2015). While HALSILLIS, the region state forestry enterprise explained the decision making mechanism of subsidized fuel wood allocation as follows: \u201cFor the provision of subsidized or free fuel wood or timber the local rural council makes a request via the district forestry enterprise to the region forestry enterprise, which in turn submits the request to the region council as the owner\u201d (pers. comm.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11f62fb6-ceb0-4432-b2fd-3a6599ade992": {"__data__": {"id_": "11f62fb6-ceb0-4432-b2fd-3a6599ade992", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "374be31384961e83f930aec410a706abcb48af99406b1d8e087c30ae9a8d5bf4"}, "2": {"node_id": "46dd453c-8777-40c0-8d01-bb1dda109668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67ed0488bf48a8527254eb731dd97ccf599ef86bed538de9b4c7648040b80f32"}}, "hash": "fdd76f9ee72ab8e88fafc5be686a4d774dae8fb35f28b83bc46291df5e4e7761", "text": "comm. 2015), the head of Seredkevychi (Smolinets, pers. comm. 2015) denied that such official mechanism is in place for the allocation of fuel wood and timber to local communes or community members.

The Yavoriv district forestry enterprise (Tisyak, pers. comm. 2015) says they deliver timber with priority to sawmills owned by local people. All \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises deliver now timber to the ATO zone for construction of fortifications. Access to NWFP is an important benefit for the local people in some regions, e.g. in L\u2019viv. In the commune of Smolyn NWFP are harvested in forests independent of the ownership by everybody without restrictions, also for commercial purposes. Mushrooms and berries are sold at the market and there would be even potential to start a small processing enterprise. But timber harvest methods heavily impact on NWFP and after clear cuts impenetrable vegetation develops on clear cut areas. (Shanova, pers. comm. 2015) The available information shows that \u201ccommunal\u201d forest management is less economically viable than the management of state forests, with the reason mainly found in the stand characteristics. Major differences between financial contributions of state and \u201ccommunal\u201d forests to the budgets of rural councils are caused by the different shares of stumpage fees for wood cut in main use felling and intermediary use and their proportion in the harvest in these forests. The application of the same stumpage fee shares for all types of ownership and the allocation of shares do not support the development of a sense of ownership for \u201ccommunal\u201d forests in rural councils and districts. Although some \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises apparently deliver more subsidized or free fuel wood for social needs, the economic benefits for local people from forests are similar for all ownership types. Pillar 2: Planning and decision-making processes Component 2.1: Stakeholder participation Information on stakeholder participation in the planning and decision-making process on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests is partly contradictory. Zhyla et al. (2014) that the acting legislation provides the local communes with sufficient authority to decide on a broad range of issues in the activities of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. However, local people by their opinion are not aware about their authority and do not have the knowledge and skills to realize their rights of participation. Zhyla et al. (2014) mention the existence of levers of influence, but these are not explained in the report. Local people are said being convinced that decisions are made at region and state level only. This is seen by the experts as being correct in some extent; and they come to the - somehow contradictory - conclusion that participation of local people mainly depends directly on the leader and staff of the forestry enterprises. Some of the directors are at the same time members of the respective councils, which might provide opportunities for stakeholder involvement, but as well bear the risks of conflicts of interest. 261 One of the authors of the study commented to the Consultant (Boroska, in litt. 2015) that local rural councils rarely intervene into the work of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forest enterprises, and thus there is little conflict. On the other hand the local people, due to their passiveness do not participate in the management of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forest and often do not see a difference between state and \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership of forests. The director of the Yavoriv district forestry enterprise (Tisyak, pers. comm. 2015) bluntly stated during the meeting with the Consultant: \u201cThe law does not require any public participation of local people; the district forestry enterprise is only required to agree with the region state forestry department and with the region environmental department.\u201d This attitude probably reflects the legal situation, but there seem to be at least some internal orders requiring a minimum level of communication with the rural councils. This district forestry enterprise claimed that before logging it informs the local rural councils about the location of the cuts, planned harvest amounts and stumpage fee expected to be paid.

In Smolyn the Consultant was shown this information letter which stated the area locations (forest parcels) and area sizes, type of cutting (sanitary selective, sanitary \u0441\u0443\u0446\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430), reference to the forest cutting permits and the expected total amount of stumpage fee of 34344 UHR. The information on the amount of harvest and timing of the logging were not included. These rural councils do not receive such information from the state forestry enterprise. After the Consultant\u2019s visit the district forestry of Yavoriv informed all rural councils about the locations and amounts of cutting and the stumpage fees to be transferred to the budgets of the rural councils (Zhyla, in lit. 2015). The heads of the rural councils in Smolyn and Seredkevychi complained that they do not possess any economic information on local operations of the district forest enterprise, how much wood is harvested, for what price it is sold and what income the \u201ccommunal\u201d forest creates. The rural councils do not have a voice in the FMP decision making and no local meetings take place in the frame of the elaboration of the FMP. Also special forestry activities, like cut areas, are not agreed with the rural councils. Local people would ask for more participation, and even have protested the transportation of logged trees (mainly because of damage to roads). The heads of the rural councils would prefer more ownership rights at their level and more participation of the community in the decision making process, but no mechanisms are established. Both rural councils concluded that the level of participation is the same and for local communities no real difference exists between \u201ccommunal\u201d, state and military forest enterprises. Communication and participation entirely depend on the directors of the forestry enterprises. In this context it is notable that in 2011 the state forestry enterprise held an official meeting with the heads of rural councils. The invitation was still kept in one of the rural council offices and this was a memorable event, indicating the general rarity of formalized participation at this level as well as the high interest in such participation. Also the deputy head of the rural council Voronovitsa (Vinnytsia) stated (Yamyk, pers. comm. 2015) that relations with the \u201ccommunal\u201d and state forestry enterprises are generally similar. But there the rural council has more collaboration with the district forestry enterprise, that informs the rural councils about planned activities, and the councils can comment and influence. This participation of the rural council existed already before the FSC certification of the district forestry enterprise, but became more systematic due to the certification requirements. The director of the region forest enterprise (Ivanets, pers. comm. 2015) complained that there were \u201cno real interest and active participation of local people\u201d, but \u2013 contradicting himself - brought up an example where foresters had to clear trees under an electric power line but local people protested against this activity! Component 2.2: Planning and decision making on conversion of land from forest to non- forest and vice versa The delimitation of lands by categories, including land of agricultural designation and lands for forestry, is done in the frame of the land-use planning. The State Land Agency is in charge of the mapping of the land categories. Rural councils, with participation of district forestry enterprises, prepare general plans (land-use) for their areas that are confirmed by the region councils. Forest land is not allowed to be sold, but agricultural land can be private. Conversion of forest land into lands of other designation rarely seems to happen officially and requires a decision by the Cabinet of Ministers. More often conversion takes place illegally and sometimes lease of forests can be a starting point for such conversion. For instance in Rakhovskiy rayon of Transcarpathia the forestry enterprise was liquidated and the forest integrated in PA fund, except 7,000 ha that were 263 illegally logged by local people. This area was than formally transferred into the land reserve and removed from the forest fund. After that encroachment with tourism infrastructure and weekend homes took place. Especially kolkhoz forests after the dissolution of the kolkhozes were grabbed and transferred into other lands of other designations. (Hruby, formerly Minagripol, pers. comm. 2015) After the land privatization large areas of agricultural lands were abandoned. These lands are either of low fertility and/or as there is no full cadaster of land shares from privatization, some people have certificates about areas of a certain size without these plots being actually defined. Abandoned agricultural lands, on which forest develops due to succession, still remain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea9f0a51-9cc0-4f59-b3dc-0cf15b993aef": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea9f0a51-9cc0-4f59-b3dc-0cf15b993aef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "517096f81a3702f5dabba732a044f518c23656ca8747b3aae1bc3f42ea34af06"}, "3": {"node_id": "582ac7ce-e5e1-442a-a06c-705a64697187", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb3ee0d6a66b23b6acde37fb4f904c3120702974ee3f01eea8dc16d44416ddb4"}}, "hash": "828d043e02b6f44c6e8bfd2eb45018bbae1ec137412f7f204b5f4fb4e14ee43f", "text": "in the category of agricultural designation, even if fully forested. At the same time it is legally prohibited to clear this land from the forest grown there. But if owners reclaim these lands they would cut the trees anyway without actual persecution. (Zhyla, pers. comm. 2015) The (not verified) information (Hruby, formerly Minagripol, pers. comm. 2015) that a charcoal producing factory in Transcarpathia processes uses now up to 30% wood from non-forest land (i.e. succession areas on abandoned agricultural lands) also indicates a lack of consideration of such forests in the official forest management. Changes of land categories and designations require a difficult and lengthy procedure. Before the designation of such agricultural land can be changed to forest, the land-use agency needs to declare the land as \u201cdegraded\u201d. The \u201ccommunal\u201d forest enterprise can prepare a project about the change of land category to forest land. The Territorial Administration of Land Relations (Rus. \u0422\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c) at region level would have to decide about this project. This agency represents the state administration, i.e. the State Land Agency, at region level and has the land-use planning competency at region and district level, but is not part of the self-governance structures. So far due to lack of funds no special inventory of succession areas took place and these areas are not covered by the forest inventory and management planning because of being located outside the designated forest areas. The same issues concern the designation of afforestation areas as forests. E.g., since 2000 the region forestry enterprise in Vinnytsia has afforested 10,000 ha of abandoned lands, but so far no certificates were issued to the region forestry enterprise (Ivanets, pers. comm. 2015). The exchange of areas between state and \u201ccommunal\u201d forest for alignment of boundaries is theoretically possible, but seems rarely or never to happen. Lands under shelter-belts are considered forest lands. However, many foresters have suggested excluding these shelter-belts from the category of forest lands. Component 2.3: Decisions on forest inventory and management planning (\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) In Ukraine forest inventory and management planning (FMP) are carried out by the enterprise \u201cUkrderzhlisproekt\u201d under the State Forest Resources Agency. The requirements for FMP are the same for all types of ownership of the forests. FMPs are obligatory for permitting of any forest use. The FMPs contain general taxation data on stands and based on this determine the allowable harvest during the FMP period. The FMP do not contain recommendations or binding requirements on reforestation activities and silvicultural objectives, like the determination of target species composition (Oborska, pers. inf. 2015). Some local foresters stated that their FMP does not provide enough flexibility for the determination of intermediary or main use, and that this determination was only made by the age of the stands, applying a silvicultural approach based on clear cutting and age class forests. 264 Participation of stakeholders in the process of forest inventory and management planning is realized through advice by the respective forestry enterprise to the FMP team and through the FMP meeting. The FMP meeting in case of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests takes place at region level and involves various stakeholders, including representatives of representatives of SFRA, of the region environmental department, region and district forestry enterprises, the region, council as well as NGOs. Statements about the representation of district and rural councils were contradictory. While Ukrderzhlisproekt (pers. comm. 2015) claims that these levels are involved and their opinions considered, various stakeholders in L\u2019viv region reported that district and rural councils are not represented and do not have a voice in the FMP decision making. No meetings are held about FMPs for district forestry enterprises, in contrast to FMPs for state forestry enterprises. Thus the local participation in decision making about \u201ccommunal\u201d forest is even less than about state forests.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "582ac7ce-e5e1-442a-a06c-705a64697187": {"__data__": {"id_": "582ac7ce-e5e1-442a-a06c-705a64697187", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "517096f81a3702f5dabba732a044f518c23656ca8747b3aae1bc3f42ea34af06"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea9f0a51-9cc0-4f59-b3dc-0cf15b993aef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "828d043e02b6f44c6e8bfd2eb45018bbae1ec137412f7f204b5f4fb4e14ee43f"}}, "hash": "fb3ee0d6a66b23b6acde37fb4f904c3120702974ee3f01eea8dc16d44416ddb4", "text": "As the region forestry enterprises have the overall management and control and organize the FMP activities, they seem to be responsible for the low level of local participation.

The succession areas on abandoned agricultural lands are in reality forest, but there is no formal mandate to include these areas into the FMP. (Ukredrzhlisproekt, pers. comm. 2015) The FMP services are to be paid by the forest owner. In the case of state forest enterprises the services are financed by the state (via the State Forest Resources Agency) while \u201ccommunal\u201d forest enterprises have to finance the FMP on their own or with support by the region budget. In Vinnytsia the FMP is financed from the region budget (Ivanets, pers. comm. 2015). The costs of the FMPs were about 5000 \u2013 6000 UHR/1000 ha in 2008 and due to inflation are now higher. Ukrderzhlisproekt partly funded from budget, partly from payment for services. (Chayka, Ukrderzhlisproekt, pers. comm. 2015) Currently FMPs exist for most \u201ccommunal\u201d forests but some areas require revision. For instance, in L\u2019viv Region the last FMP were approved in 2001 and the revision is not yet finished for all areas (Peshko, pers. comm. 2015). In Vinnytsia region FMP were updated in 1995, 2005 and 2014/15 (Ivanets, pers. comm. 2015). Where no up-to-date FMP exists, annual cuts are defined by Ukrderzhlisproekt based on the old FMP. The FMP for \u201ccommunal\u201d forests of the region is based on a generalized compilation of the local FMPs that are prepared per district forestry enterprise. (HALSILLIS staff, pers. comm. 2015) The enterprise has developed an electronic data management system that has been tested in the practice. Data collection is done with tablets and remote sensing, with backup on paper. Ukrderzhlisproekt keeps the data base and hands the final materials to the leskhozes in hard copy and as shape files with attribute tables. So far electronic FMP cover 50% of all forests in UKR and are planned to be elaborated for all forms of ownership. The forestry enterprises can access data electronically via a WebGIS with Google Earth background but cannot enter own data. Additionally the Ukrainian National Forestry University, L\u2019viv, with support of ENPI-FLEG II is developing GIS training modules for local foresters. Local forestry enterprises can access forest inventory and 265 management data, which have been provided by Ukderzhlisproekt, via free GIS software. Component 2.4: Decisions on implementation of forest management activities The decisions on the implementation of the forest management activities are mainly made by the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises themselves, in particular by the district forestry enterprises or by the local branches of region forestry enterprises. The rural councils as well as the district councils do not interfere with these decisions. Certain decisions, as explained below, have to be agreed with or taken by the \u201ccommunal\u201d owners of the forestry enterprises, i.e. in L\u2019viv and Vinnytsia region by the region council, or by state forestry or environmental agencies. Fig. 6: Clear cutting after forest fire - L\u2019viv region.

These reforestation projects are confirmed by the region forestry enterprise. The State Environmental Inspection does not influence on the implementation of reforestation and silvicultural activities, despite these activities have a major impact on the future composition and structure of the forests, determining their biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services. For enterprises under the SFRA electronic accounting and accompanying original documents are mandatory for timber and timber products. Such requirements do not exist for the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises, but timber materials have to be accompanied by a document in standard format. Information on decision making about lease of forest lands is contradictory, possibly reflecting different practices in the regions. Either forest enterprises, with involvement of rural councils, can lease out plots on short-term lease, while long-term lease (up to 49 years) has to be done via the district level (pers. comm. Oborska 2015), or decisions on lease are made by the region council, with agreement from the rural council, the region forestry enterprise and the region state forestry department (Ivanets, VINOBLAGROLIS, pers. comm. 2015).

Implementation of the forest management activities District Forestry Enterprise State Forestry Enterprise The use of NWFP for personal use, and in the practice as well for small-scale commercial purposes, does not require any permits and no formal decisions are made on such forest uses. Hunting quota for game species not listed in the Red Book are decided by the region state forestry administration based on survey data provided by the game are manager. The region state forestry administration issues hunting permits to game are manager, in the case of the hunting grounds assigned to the 267 \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises in Vinnytsia region, to the region forestry enterprise, which would only have to pay for issuing of the permit but no fee for the use of the resource and can sell the hunts to hunters via the district forestry enterprises. (Ivanets, pers. comm. 2015) Pillar 3: Implementation, enforcement and compliance Component 3.1: Capacity of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations A full capacity assessment of the forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations is not possible in the frame of this case study. The capacities of the SFRA and its state region forest administrations as well as their state forestry enterprises have not been specifically assessed. The SFRA was not visited by the Consultant and no up-to-date and specific information on the capacity of this agency and its subunits, in particular of the state forestry enterprises, was available. The fact that forests managed by the state forestry enterprises are larger and less fragmented and have higher timber volumes and better qualities and anecdotal information from stakeholders suggest that their financial situation and accordingly their capacities are better than those of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. The forest inventory and planning agency of the SFRA, Ukrderzhlisproekt, provided the impression of meeting the main capacity needs in terms of financing, available technology and equipment as well as qualification of staff. The FMP is one-sided focussed on wood harvest; there are deficiencies in public participation in the process; and socio-economic, environmental and nature conservation aspects are possibly insufficiently considered. The reasons might be either in the approach and guidelines determined by the SFRA and/or in the capacity of the staff of Ukrderzhlisproekt. Zhyla et al. (2014) reported that the majority of interviewed representatives of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises assessed the financial and personnel capacity of their enterprises as insufficient. Close to 40% of the interviewed representatives assessed their own knowledge of the legal and regulatory framework as insufficient. The capacity of the visited \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises in terms of financial situation, staff and equipment seemed adequate. The region forestry enterprises can provide certain services and make use of the economy of scale by purchasing equipment or employing specialized experts in the staff that would be beyond the financial opportunities of district forestry enterprises, e.g. in the case of HALSILLIS in L\u2019viv region", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49cb288d-b0d8-4f06-bff0-d29517b4dfbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "49cb288d-b0d8-4f06-bff0-d29517b4dfbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb60bbfd482cb2b6763cec5d5e257fac4a17be08ae65a1e8a0c3be6aef205a85"}, "3": {"node_id": "35f534bf-4ea3-4ac4-8494-7846f23a9334", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f969c2bc3ff32a8064e23671e0e33e88dbfe31a380542e78847eaa7f81adb47a"}}, "hash": "6899508d23e958ecb5418102f694222afb55d6fc52d4be0219a0806f447e64c8", "text": "two lawyers that serve all district forestry enterprises. The capacity of forestry enterprises to involve local people and other stakeholders seemed rather low. Most forestry staff showed an attitude of considering local people more likely as potential offenders and public participation as an undue interference in their own sphere. Little knowledge of and interest in involvement of local communities, common property approaches and stakeholder participation was observed by the Consultant, most notably in Vinnytsia and with reference to the FSC certification. The local councils (rural, district and region) not always have members or staff with the expertise that would be necessary to make decisions or provide opinions on forest related issues. Most of the representatives of councils owning \u201ccommunal\u201d forest enterprises interviewed by Zhyla et al. (2014) assessed their own knowledge as only low or medium. Some of the councils have members that are at the same time leading staff of the forest enterprise, thus representing technical expertise in the council while bringing in conflict of interest. 268 Component 3.2: Forest law enforcement The interviewed stakeholders provided the Consultant only with limited information on law enforcement issues. Repeatedly representatives of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises mentioned their compared to state forestry enterprises limited law enforcement authority. The \u201cCode on administrative legal violations\u201d does not provide the staff of \u201ccommunal\u201d forest enterprises with the power to deal with and penalize offenders of forest legislation, in contrast to the staff of state forestry enterprises that has such authority. This unequal authority of staff of forestry enterprises of different form of ownership is reportedly reflected in the bylaw on forest protection. The limited law enforcement authority of staff of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises requires the involvement of the State Environmental Inspection in case of detection of violations. Illegal forest use includes unauthorized wood harvest by local people for meeting their own needs and illegal logging for sale. The first seems sometimes tolerated by forestry staff as long as remaining in a small scale. In contrast, the latter is allegedly often done with active involvement of the forest enterprises and involves corruption over several levels of authority. Claims that \u201ccommunal\u201d forests have a higher level of illegal use than state forests were denied by most stakeholders and the level of violations was assessed as either the same or even lower than in state forests. This might partly be caused by the generally higher availability of commercially interesting wood resources in state forests. In Voronovitsa the local people already see the \u201ccommunal\u201d forest as being \u201ctheir forest\u201d; and the work of the district forestry enterprise is now more accepted, while formerly people felt alienated and there was more disagreement, but violations still happen (Yamyk, deputy head of the rural council, pers. comm. 2015). Zhyla et al. (2014) reported that representatives of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises see a key reason for violations in the long undetermined legal status and ownership of these forests. These uncertainties caused abuse of power by rural councils and unauthorized forest use by local people. Recently cases of legal violations and conflicts substantially decreased due to the consolidation of the ownership and user-rights of these forests, improved communication and collaboration between forestry enterprises rural councils and communities. Component 3.3 Administration of forest and land ownership and user rights The issues of administration of forest and land ownership and user rights are closely linked to the ownership and user right systems, described in component 1.3 of pillar 1 \u201cPolicy, legal, institutional and regulatory frameworks\u201d. The issue of delimitation of lands in state and \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership has not yet been solved entirely (Zhyla et. al. 2014): In 2011 12.4% of forests on state owned lands were managed by \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. With a law \u201cOn amendment of several legislative documents of Ukraine related to the delimitation of lands in state and communal ownership\u201d (1.1.2013) those lands are considered as being in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership, on which objects in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership are located and which are in permanent land-use by \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises, including lands of the forest fund. By this law the delimitation of state and \u201ccommunal\u201d land was eased, but the \u201ccommunal\u201d administration were obliged to formalize the permanent land- use rights of the \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises until 1.1.2014.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35f534bf-4ea3-4ac4-8494-7846f23a9334": {"__data__": {"id_": "35f534bf-4ea3-4ac4-8494-7846f23a9334", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb60bbfd482cb2b6763cec5d5e257fac4a17be08ae65a1e8a0c3be6aef205a85"}, "2": {"node_id": "49cb288d-b0d8-4f06-bff0-d29517b4dfbd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6899508d23e958ecb5418102f694222afb55d6fc52d4be0219a0806f447e64c8"}}, "hash": "f969c2bc3ff32a8064e23671e0e33e88dbfe31a380542e78847eaa7f81adb47a", "text": "This process was not finalized in many locations, and for some \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises the administrative costs of this process were beyond their financial capacity.

E.g. VINOLAGROLIS in Vinnytsia region has already certified 269 permanent land-use rights for 100,000 ha of its forests, while the issuing of the land-use certificates for the remaining 30,000 ha in in permanent use is still in process. Also the land-use certificates for about 10,000 ha lands, newly afforested since 2000, have not yet been issued to the region forest enterprise. The problem that shares of individuals were not properly documented in the land reform of former kolkhozes is one reason for the development of natural forest succession on abandoned agricultural areas. With the certification of these parcels as individual property parts of these forests are cleared. An inventory of actually forested lands and their formal inclusion into the forest fund, where appropriate, would allow of the inclusion of such areas into sustainable forest management, possibly in private, \u201ccommunal\u201d or state ownership. The documentation of other user-rights like lease of forest and assignment of hunting grounds was not shown to the consultant. However, problems in regard of such user-rights were neither mentioned by any stakeholder nor in the report by Zhyla et al. (2014). Fig. 7: Scheme of the forests of the region forestry enterprise VINOBLAGROLIS - Vinnytsia region. Component 3.4 Cooperation and coordination The mandates of different agencies, enterprises, representative and administrative bodies in relation to \u201ccommunal\u201d forests require cooperation and coordination. These seem to work well between the district and region forest enterprises and with the region councils as well as with region state forest administrations and the State Environmental Inspection. In contrast, cooperation and coordination between \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises and district councils and administrations and between forestry enterprises of different ownership type were barely mentioned by interviewed stakeholders. The cooperation and coordination with the rural councils has been explained and analysed in the 270 section on component 2.1 of Pillar 2 \u201cPlanning and decision making process\u201d. At this level mechanisms of cooperation and collaboration seem to be insufficiently developed, mainly because of the subordination of the forestry enterprises to a higher administrative level and the lack of formal mechanisms of cooperation and coordination of the forestry enterprises with the rural councils. In this situation the determining factor of cooperation and communication is the relationship between the individual heads and staff of the rural councils and the local district forestry enterprises. Component 3.5 Measures to address corruption and ensure transparency Due to the lack of specific information on corruption issues this subject was not specifically analysed in the frame of this case study. Ukraine has been suffering from abundant corruption in all sectors and reports about grabbing of forest land for development of housing or illegal logging facilitated by forestry enterprises show that the forest sector was not an exclusion from this problem. The ongoing reform process in the country is supposed to address especially these problems. It is however, still early to assess the success of these reforms. The stakeholders interviewed by the Consultant did not report any recent or current cases of substantial corruption in relation to \u201ccommunal\u201d forests. Compared to ownership and management at the level of rural councils, the ownership of \u201ccommunal\u201d forest lands and forestry enterprises at higher administrative levels impedes the development of local ownership and social control in the communities. The unofficial use of local work force with in-kind or unaccounted cash payments is the most obvious and widespread issue, which is as well found in state and military forestry enterprises. At local level further small scale corruption is possible in relation to the use of services by forestry enterprises, priority access to timber and provision of fuel wood below market prices. Conclusions The case study shows the complexity of the governance of local forests in Ukraine. The historic developments during the Soviet period and after independence have left a system, where different forms of ownership of forests exist parallel. While private ownership so far does not play an important role in the areas covered by this Case Study, forests of local importance and similar history can be in \u201ccommunal\u201d and state ownership. The existence of two different forms of ownership and the related parallel structures raises the questions what the differences in terms of impact between both systems are, if it is reasonable to keep in the perspective both types of ownership and under what circumstances. The following main conclusions can be drawn from the findings of this study: The difference between both forms of ownership in terms of centralization and devolution of authority to the local level is marginal.

All \u201ccommunal\u201d forests are owned by or in de-facto possession of higher level administrative units and managed by forestry enterprises that report to the region level. District forestry enterprises are owned by the region forestry enterprises and are not subordinated to the district councils. Key elements of planning and decision making on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests are identical between \u201ccommunal\u201d and state forests, and the same agencies are in charge of these elements. This concerns in particular the authority of Ukrderzhlisproekt and of the region state forestry administrations. The participation at local level does not depend on the form of ownership but more on the interest of all involved parties. Thus from a perspective of local influence on decision making the difference is rather marginal and \u201ccommunal\u201d forests just belong to a different but still not local level of state 271 structures. In the visited areas the benefits the local people receive from \u201ccommunal\u201d forests seem to be slightly higher than those from state forests. This impression of the Consultant might be biased by the focus of the study on stakeholders involved with \u201ccommunal\u201d forests. In particular, support to poor people, ATO participants and social entities were brought up as examples for direct benefits the state forest enterprises would not deliver. The Consultant did not study if this lack of support from state forestry enterprises is really the case or if state forest enterprises in the visited areas and/or in areas without \u201ccommunal\u201d forests deliver similar immediate social-economic benefits. The access of local people to forest resources like fuel wood, timber and NWFP neither formally nor in the reality depends on the form of ownership of forests and forestry enterprises. The rural councils\u2019 shares of stumpage fees from logging operations are generally identical for all forms of forest ownership. The reportedly higher shares in some rural councils of stumpage fees from \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are entirely caused by the specific stand composition and the resulting harvest types imposed by the FMPs. Income taxes are fed into the budgets at the level to which an enterprise belongs. Thus the income taxes of district and region enterprises benefit the budgets of these levels, but not the basis level of the rural councils. Profits belong to the owner of the forestry enterprises, in the case of district daughter enterprises to the region forestry enterprise, and in the case of the region forestry enterprise to the region (and, where co-owner, district) councils. In most cases due to the difficult economic situation of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises, the income taxes paid by and the profit of the enterprises might not be very high. In any case the basis level or commune is not involved and does not receive any other financial contributions than it receives from the state forestry enterprises operating within the boundaries of the commune. In the frame of this case study the performance of the state and \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises in protection and development of the forest stands could not be assessed. There are, nevertheless, indications that differences might be small and not caused by the different ownership types but rather by the history of the forest stands in these different ownership types. \u201cCommunal\u201d forestry enterprises reported about smaller, more fragmented and less productive forest stands, compared to those owned by the state forest enterprises, and related lower production potential and in the result financial problems. The separation of these less productive from the more productive forests in different economic units prevents actually that income from productive forests can be used for the maintenance and improvement of forests of lower production potential. Potentially \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises could have fewer problems with enforcement, and local people could contribute to forest protection against illegal use and support fire prevention and other works. The assigned ownership, possession and management of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests at region level and the little difference in direct benefits between \u201ccommunal\u201d and other forests largely discourage such local ownership and contributions by local people. Further, the \u2013 compared to state forestry enterprises \u2013 limited law enforcement authority of staff of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises hampers the protection of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests from illegal use. Some experts and stakeholders suggested that in some regions the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprise show quite a good performance and have the capacity to compete with the state forestry enterprise. From an economic perspective this makes sense, as long as no parallel public structures have to be maintained that would not be necessary in the case", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16b9167a-5bd9-4b38-aa8b-ebaccc986d4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "16b9167a-5bd9-4b38-aa8b-ebaccc986d4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22fce005c3415ea0711097cc4b2395d5f81deefa7d468ae3607ccd6fe01c5321"}, "3": {"node_id": "c28d00c5-90c7-48be-9d98-b98fe63fb42c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccef00f9498154bf054990da16e5b396104bfecfcacecc4bbb2d9e616b87b579"}}, "hash": "4ff81e7b96bf4c09424a721389a2f83470bdf85b731c9fcd836e194db8d3815a", "text": "of only one type of ownership. As long as each district or state forestry enterprise manages forest stands large enough to allow for the economic viability of these enterprises, they may exist in parallel. However, the effectiveness of the duplication of higher level structures might in some cases be questionable in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. 272 From the studied local cases and the analysis provided by Zhyla et al. (2014) the Consultant preliminary concludes that the differences between the state forests and the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests are small and the benefits of the parallel existence of the two governance systems are at least not obvious. In the current form, the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests present rather region level centralized management than real communal ownership. 4. Recommendations Given the ambivalent conclusions, recommendations have to consider different options for the future development of governance of forests in Ukraine. General issues are to be addressed, e.g. the separation of the functions of policy and strategy development, of economic or user functions and of control and oversight. This concerns both, state and \u201ccommunal\u201d forests. Other issues to be addressed are the position, functions and authorities of region state forestry administrations, the systems of issuing permits, the inventory of forests on lands of other designation than forestry and their inclusion into the forest fund, the improvement of local participation and the development of sense of local ownership and support. The system of forest inventory and management planning should be further developed with a stronger orientation on silviculture and on the development of close-to-nature forestry approaches as well as a strengthening of stakeholder participation, in particular at the level of the communes. In areas where the parallel existence of state and \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises is not effective and economically viable an integration of one form with the other might be considered. This could be the integration of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests into the state forest fund, as already done in some regions. In that case, at least for specific forests of local importance, local communes and communities might become more involved in decision making and some management tasks might be delegated to local communes, enterprises or even individuals. It might as well be thinkable to integrate some state forest on the basis of ownership or permanent user-rights into the \u201ccommunal\u201d forest fund. Independent of the form of ownership, at local level more intensive participation and involvement as well as more tangible direct benefits from the sustainable use of forest resources, for local people as well as for communities as whole, would contribute to more sense of ownership and higher willingness of local people to contribute to the protection and management of local forests. Specific recommendations addressing rather immediate improvement of the effectiveness of the existing \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry management (based on suggestions by Zhyla et al. 2014 and own findings of the Consultant): \uf0b7 The staff of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises should have the same enforcement authority as the staff of state forestry enterprises by enacting of one bylaw on forest protection and according changes in the \u201cCode on Administrative Responsibility\u201d; \uf0b7 Consideration of the establishment of an independent state forest inspection service; \uf0b7 Finalization of the certification of ownership and user-rights on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests; \uf0b7 Improvements of the legislation, e.g. simplified procedure for the change of designation of lands; \uf0b7 An inventory of succession areas, and transfer of suitable areas into the forest fund and assignment to \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises; \uf0b7 Change of the sharing system of the stumpage fees towards allocation of much higher shares, or even full amounts, to the rural councils in the administrative borders of which the forest is harvested; 273 \uf0b7 Development of more intensive participation and involvement at local basis level and with the local people. 5.

TRAFFIC report: Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan iv EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Despite shark fin being a \u201ctraditional\u201d Chinese product, the trade and marketing of it (and to a lesser extent manta gill plates) changes rapidly depending on where and how profits can be made. Almost every aspect that the research has looked at is dynamic in a way that would have been difficult to predict from the first study (Clarke 2004) ten years or so ago. Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have had a long and varied history in the trade of shark fins. Together they account for more than 90% and 70% of the global import and (re)export, respectively, between 2005 and 2011, based on FAO import data1. Recent declines in the global trade have also been reflected in the import and (re)export2 of shark fin from these three countries and territories. However, possible illegal shark fin trade could indicate that the trade decline of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan may not be as substantial as the official data have recorded. Given the lack of knowledge about the scale of under-reporting in mainland China, it is possible that the extent of the decline may be much lower than available data suggest. This report takes a comprehensive look at how the shark fin trade is changing in the three study areas, and provides recommendations to stakeholders to improve compliance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and increase traceability of the trade in shark fins and mobulid ray gill plates. CITES trade Based on the CITES species trade data between 2003 and 2013 (Annex 1), global reported shark fin imports and (re)exports were 7,720.7 kg and 1,495.6 kg, respectively. During this period, Hong Kong reportedly accounted for 90% of global reported CITES shark fin imports. This is largely explained by Hong Kong\u2019s import of 6,933.4 kg of Basking Shark Cetorhinus maximus fins from Norway during 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2102, with only 9 kg of this re-exported to Malaysia in 2006. The next largest importer was Spain, which only reported 602 kg of Porbeagle Shark fin Lamna nasus imports during the same period, which pales in comparison to Hong Kong\u2019s record on CITES-listed shark fin trade. Singapore, the other important global hub for the shark fin trade, only reported 68 kg of shark fin (Basking Shark) imports in the same period. Hong Kong\u2019s dominance of CITES-listed shark fin trade is not surprising considering it handled 50% of the global shark fin trade (Clarke 2004), and imports shark fin from more than 100 countries 1 FAO FishStatJ March 2015. http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en 2 (re)export included export and re\u2010export v TRAFFIC report: Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan and territories. Hong Kong re-exports around 50% of its imported shark fin, with more than 60% of this going to mainland China. As one of the top five shark catchers globally, 70% of Taiwan\u2019s shark fin export was to Hong Kong between 2005 and 2014. Taiwan has been identified as one of the hotspots for some of the world\u2019s most threatened shark species (Brautigam et. al. 2015). However, surprisingly there is no record of exports from Taiwan to Hong Kong of CITES-listed shark fin species. Customs trade Overall there are significant declines in the shark fin trade recorded in all three countries and territories based on the officially recorded Customs data. A reduction in shark fin imports and (re)exports began to appear in 2005, and was especially pronounced from 2009 onwards. Hong Kong and Taiwan\u2019s decline in shark fin trade was moderate in comparison with mainland China. Hong Kong\u2019s imports and Taiwan\u2019s exports of shark fin were both stable between 2005 and 2011, but dropped significantly in 2012 and 2013, and remained at low levels in 2014. Trade between Hong Kong and mainland China followed a similar pattern.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c45d5ff-fc87-4619-b00e-7314a1fb889f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c45d5ff-fc87-4619-b00e-7314a1fb889f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/shark-fin-and-mobulid-ray-gill-plate-trade-mainland-china-hong-kong-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Shark fin and mobulid ray gill plate trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/shark-fin-and-mobulid-ray-gill-plate-trade-mainland-china-hong-kong-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1af56315cef0dafcf2e00c39fb63cb5a96a9ff53c7af30c23ec624d4febca4d1"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d9938ef-3fcc-4911-aada-1d605c3ea6a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/shark-fin-and-mobulid-ray-gill-plate-trade-mainland-china-hong-kong-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebd367531340ac947141d6a40d4396507e966719b6e5aaba07c3f253c0ea7a49"}}, "hash": "b81c213dba26cd4a96c357d0cfbec44d1fb16abc3a625465788da81235933fd7", "text": "Trade between Hong Kong and mainland China followed a similar pattern.

The (re)export trade from Hong Kong, however, has been somewhat offset by increases in trade with Viet Nam. Viet Nam has since become Hong Kong\u2019s largest shark fin exporting receiver during 2010, 2013 and 2014. This trade reached a peak in 2010, but has slowed down in the latter years. Likewise, Viet Nam has replaced mainland China as the largest importer of Hong Kong\u2019s sea cucumber (re)export since 2004 (To and Shea 2012). It is possible that Viet Nam is not the final place of consumption or processing destination, but could instead be used as a transit point for re-routing wildlife products, e.g. to mainland China. The Customs records of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan for the shark fin trade are not recorded in coding systems that are easily compared. Taiwan uses 11-digit Custom codes for five different shark fin commodities. Hong Kong and mainland China both use an eight-digit Customs code system, shark fin in mainland China is considered as one commodity and aggregated into a TRAFFIC report: Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan vi single Customs category, while Hong Kong separates raw and processed shark fin into five different shark fin commodities. Due to these differences, the total (gross) annual import and (re)export volumes of shark fin, without separating different commodities, from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were used for comparison. The import and (re)export data comparison reveals that Hong Kong\u2019s system of capturing trade data is more thorough than those used by mainland China and Taiwan. Hong Kong reported higher volumes of trade with Taiwan, regardless of imports and (re)exports (Annex 6). The differences were especially large for trade from Hong Kong to Taiwan. This may be because of Taiwan\u2019s import tariff, which provides less incentive to report accurately compared with Hong Kong, which is a free trade port. A similar pattern was also found for the trade between Hong Kong and mainland China. Hong Kong reported much higher export volumes (around 46 times that of mainland China\u2019s reported import volume) to mainland China. However, Hong Kong reported fewer imports from mainland China than were recorded by the China Customs as being exported to Hong Kong from mainland China. A major crackdown on the shark fin industry was taken in mainland China at the end of 2012 because of the violation of import tariff regulations (Anon., 2014d). This case indicated that some shark fins (re)exported from Hong Kong to Viet Nam eventually entered mainland China. Online markets Only a limited amount of shark fin advertisements and sellers were detected due to the \u201cNo shark fin sales\u201d policies of several e-commerce platforms. Some shark fin e-commerce stores were found on business to business (B2B) websites which had the ability to handle large inventories of shark fin and shipments. There were more advertisements of mobulid ray gill plates found on websites which may be due to a lack of related restrictive policies of the e-commerce platforms for this product, recognizing shark fin is on the prohibition list. However, most of the advertisements and sellers of mobulid ray gill plates were on consumer to consumer (C2C) e-commerce websites. The sellers and consumers of mobulid ray gill plates tend to deal in small amounts of product at any one time. Most mobulid ray e-commerce shops were located in southern China and sellers in Hong Kong are likely to be serving the southern China market as well. In contrast, shark fin e-commerce shops are located along the whole coast of mainland China. In total, 85% of all e-commerce shops with identified locations are situated near or south of Shanghai; 79% of those shops are found in Guangdong Province. vii TRAFFIC report: Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan An earlier survey found that Guangzhou was the centre for mobulid ray gill plates trade (Heinrichs et al. 2011). Based on the geographic distribution of e-commerce shops, it appears as though the market for mobulid ray gill plates is limited to four coastal provinces in southern China, especially in Guangdong, and most likely consumed by households as a tonic, as opposed to being consumed in restaurants and hotels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2defbf7f-0c42-43bd-b3fd-03cc1f6c60a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "2defbf7f-0c42-43bd-b3fd-03cc1f6c60a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/shark-fin-and-mobulid-ray-gill-plate-trade-mainland-china-hong-kong-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Shark fin and mobulid ray gill plate trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/shark-fin-and-mobulid-ray-gill-plate-trade-mainland-china-hong-kong-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee87f54f4695a8ed40ed6775d09859179f19c726c5ba8e825f3a7c89095025ff"}, "2": {"node_id": "13ea7a17-88a4-4604-92c1-0efdd90c5e76", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/shark-fin-and-mobulid-ray-gill-plate-trade-mainland-china-hong-kong-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "663896b485c9ab38e178a7e57d97601b4c2c4c3e31783698e9c05e518204385a"}}, "hash": "af23dc87293495d8dc9f19040ed51afb172f89ad7e846a3b8a34417dae0c0b9c", "text": "Shark fin consumption is still relatively robust along the coastal cities, and may start to expand to inner cities along the Yangtze River.

Physical market This survey showed that shark fins are still commonly available in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, even with rising levels of awareness about the unsustainable exploitation of sharks globally and the government of mainland China\u2019s No Shark Fins policy3. Most of the premises that sell shark fin also offer other products, such as dried seafood and high-priced Chinese medicines. The shark fin premises in Guangzhou/Shenzhen and Hong Kong provided a higher variety of shark fin categories4, on average 3.3 and 3.4 shark fin categories respectively, than stores in Beijing/Shanghai (3) and Taiwan (2.5). Shark fins accounted for a higher percentage of the goods sold within premises in mainland China (34% in Beijing/Shanghai and 39% in Guangzhou/Shenzhen) than those in Hong Kong (18%) and Taiwan (21%). These dried food stores in Hong Kong and Taiwan are therefore less reliant on selling shark fins for their income. In general, prices for shark fins were higher in Taiwan and Hong Kong than in mainland China. Based on the responses from shopkeepers, the fins available in Taiwan and Hong Kong are mainly from locally processed sources, 81% and 76% respectively. The figures seem higher for the existing processing factories, especially in Hong Kong. This may result from the fact that part of the processing, such as drying, is conducted in Hong Kong. In contrast, 37% and 14% of shark fin types found in Beijing/Shanghai were processed in Guangdong and Hong Kong, respectively. Only 3% of shark fin categories offered in Guangzhou/Shenzhen were processed in Guangdong, 3% were processed in other locations in mainland China, and none were processed in Hong Kong or Taiwan. 3 The general policy for official receptions, the purpose of which is anti\u2010corruption, was launched at the end of 2012, when Xi Jinping took the position as the president of China. A more detailed policy came out in December 2013 to ban official expenditure on shark fins, birds\u2019 nests and protected wildlife products. 4 \u201cCategory\u201d of shark fins refers to the different shark fin products available in the shops. It is not equal to species of shark, but is instead a combination of species, fin position and even quality or size of shark fin. Some frequently available categories included Jin Shan, Yan Jian, Hai Hu and Gou (caudal). TRAFFIC report: Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan viii Sixty-seven percent of shark fin categories sold in Taiwan were primarily sourced in Taiwan (as opposed to \u201cimported\u201d). In contrast, only a limited proportion of shark fin categories available in Beijing/Shanghai (4%) and Guangzhou/Shenzhen (6%) were sourced in China. At the same time, only 11% of shark fin categories found in Beijing/Shanghai and 2% of those found in Taiwan were imported from Hong Kong. Only 1% of shark fin categories found in Hong Kong were claimed to be imported from Taiwan. Jin Shan Fin5 was the most commonly reported shark fin type by interviewees in Hong Kong (83% of surveyed shops) and Beijing/Shanghai (77% of surveyed shops). A common trade route for this type of shark fin is for it to be imported, or to have transited from San Francisco, USA, regardless of the species. In Beijing/Shanghai, 20%, of shark fin categories were claimed to be imported from the USA.

Similar to online markets, the physical markets that offer mobulid ray gill plates for sale were more concentrated in southern China. Of the markets that sold mobulid ray gill plates in Hong Kong, their product diversity, price category and range were lower than those in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The following recommendations are made in relation to shark fins and mobulid ray gill plates, which are relevant to stakeholders in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan: \uf06c Hong Kong, as the largest shark fin trading hub, handling up to 40% of global shark fin trade from more than 100 countries/territories, as well as roughly 90% of imports in CITES-listed species between 2003 and 2013, recorded in UNEP-WCMC\u2019s CITES Trade Database. However, large inconsistencies in the data exist between trade volume recorded by UNEP- WCMC and those recorded by Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (7 t compared to 85.823 t during the 11 year period, respectively). Hong Kong, as well as the top 20 shark fin (re)exporting countries/territories, should improve their monitoring and reporting of the shark fin and manta ray gill plate trade to ensure it meets basic reporting requirements under CITES. This could include periodically examining the CITES as well as Customs data with trade partners to identify the possible gaps. To identify/label CITES shark fins and manta ray gill plates separately from mixed species shipments to increase the accuracy of information reporting and recording on the species and volume, as well as issuing appropriate CITES documents for trade. \uf06c Mainland China and Taiwan should ensure that all sharks and rays harvested by and landed in their jurisdictions are legally acquired, traded with the correct species name and with appropriate documents. It is advised that a traceability system for CITES listed shark and ray species could be developed and applied from harvest to the point of first export in all shark and ray catching countries/territories. \uf06c The responsible CITES authorities in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan should enhance awareness of regulations on the shark fin and manta ray gill plate trade to other relevant authorities, such as Customs, quarantine and coastguard, in order to increase the detection of illegal trade. Relevant trainings, including species and products identification, should also be provided if necessary.

TRAFFIC report: Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan xii BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION The life history traits of sharks and rays, which are generally long-lived, mature late and have few offspring, make them particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation. As top predators, sharks play a critical role in ocean ecosystems. Marine sharks and rays are highly threatened, with populations of many coastal and offshore species in serious decline. According to a comprehensive 2014 study (Dulvy et al., 2014), around 25% of all sharks, rays and chimera species (Chondrichthyes) are threatened with extinction due primarily to overfishing, whether targeted or incidental. The 16th Conference of the Parties to CITES in 2013 resulted in the listing of seven species of commercially exploited shark species in Appendix II of CITES (Annex 1). They are: Oceanic Whitetip Shark Carcharhinus longimanus; Porbeagle Lamna nasus, three Hammerhead sharks Sphyrna lewini, S. mokarran and S. zygaena, and manta rays Manta alfredi, M. birostris. The listing of the above species did not come into effect until September 2014, delayed by 18 months to enable Parties to resolve the related technical and administrative issues. Countries and territories have to record the trade of CITES species according to their national regulations and report the records annually to the CITES Secretariat. CITES regulates international trade in threatened species, whether it involves live or dead specimens or their parts and derivatives (CITES, 2016). CITES includes species in three Appendices, according to the degree of protection they need. Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction. Trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cc76b15-b05f-47dd-822c-debcaf634213": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cc76b15-b05f-47dd-822c-debcaf634213", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/shark-fin-and-mobulid-ray-gill-plate-trade-mainland-china-hong-kong-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Shark fin and mobulid ray gill plate trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/shark-fin-and-mobulid-ray-gill-plate-trade-mainland-china-hong-kong-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80ea04a34341f61a2bcf05431a2629fed77488265c63e5cc0c68ccd34c39797a"}, "2": {"node_id": "0bf9f928-5db7-40c1-90e0-67c9a9092b4a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/shark-fin-and-mobulid-ray-gill-plate-trade-mainland-china-hong-kong-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e243f4988e9b9c1553746b8a64c07560c073ae8b637370a716d607e56c842bc4"}}, "hash": "a3bab3f96d2023456b7961da9bc57c30da3ff08609b3136a127b4ca5b7c96851", "text": "Trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances.

Due to its high price, consumption of shark fins also denotes high social status. In Hong Kong, for example, shark fin is most commonly consumed at wedding and birthday banquets (Anon., 2011a). It is this aspect that has gained the most attention as a driving cause for shark population declines. 1 TRAFFIC report: Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan Mobulid Ray gill plate usage Mobulid Rays (\u8760\u9cbc, \u9c7c\u5f6d\u9c7c, \u89d2\u9c7c\u5f6d, \u9ed1\u9c7c\u5f6d, \u89d2\u71d5) are considered medicinal animals in the Chinese Medicinal Animal Book, dating back to 1983 (Anon. ed., 1983). Two species, Mobula japonica and Manta birostris were included under Mobulidae in the book. The gill plate and brain of the Mobulid Ray are considered to be medicinal ingredients. The gill plates of both species are believed to have detoxification and anti-inflammatory functions and are used to treat exanthema. They are also used to treat child measles and boils (Anon. ed., 1983). According to advertisements on e-commerce websites, in addition to detoxification and anti- inflammatory properties, mobulid ray gill plates also have anti-cancer and prolactin functions. Many advertisements recommend putting mobulid ray gill plates into a stew with other common ingredients for a couple of hours before drinking as a tonic to strengthen the body\u2014a non- traditional medicinal use. General shark fin processing procedures Fresh or frozen fins go through various stages to end up with dried processed fins \u2013 which is the commodity usually found in retail and wholesale dried food markets in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. These processing stages include drying, soaking in hot water, removing scales, skins and bones, bleaching and drying for package (Mundy et al. 2015). It is estimated that fresh shark fins lose around 75% of their weight after drying, and another 65- 70% after the removal of scales, skin, bone and meat (Anon. 2013a). Shark fin processing factories started to move from Hong Kong to mainland China, such as Jiangmen in Guangdong, from 1986 onwards (Kwong, 2013). Because of air and water pollution, the regulation relating to \u201coffensive trades\u201d8 was applied to shark fin processing in 1986 (Kwong, 2013). This research is intended to increase understanding about the current market dynamics of shark fins and mobulid ray gill plates in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, in order to improve compliance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and increase traceability of the trade in shark fins and mobulid ray gill plates. A current problem of shark and mobulid ray consumption is that most of the supply in the market are unsustainable, untraceable and sometimes illegal. 8 \u201cOffensive trades\u201d is a term related to polluting business activities. A Schedule of Offensive Trades was declared based on Section 48 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance and Declaration of Offensive Trades Notice. http://www.pland.gov.hk/pland_en/tech_doc/hkpsg/full/ch9/ch9_app_6\u20102b.htm TRAFFIC report: Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan 2 METHODOLOGY CITES trade data9 on eight species and two genera of sharks and rays (Annex 1), from 2003 to 2013, were accessed and downloaded from the CITES website on 15th October 201510.

There is no separate Customs code for different shark fin commodities. The code was amended in 2012, to change the description from \u201cdried shark fin (Customs code 03055920)\u201d to \u201cshark fin (Customs code 03057100)\u201d. Mainland China has two other Customs codes starting with 1604 for preserved/prepared shark fin products. Preserved/prepared products reported under 1604 are processed products, the recorded trade volume, in weight, may include other ingredients and packages. The trade data from these two codes were not included in this research to avoid any double counting. According to Dent and Clarke (2015), mainland China started to record the trade of frozen shark fins from May 2000, but under the same code as frozen shark meat. It is therefore not possible to estimate the share of frozen shark fin from the trade of frozen shark meat for mainland China. At the time of publishing this report, mainland China did not yet have a specific Customs code for frozen shark fins. 9 CITES trade data from trading partners were used for Taiwan, which is not a Party to the Convention. 10 The CITES Trade Database was developed and is maintained by UNEP\u2010WCMC on behalf of the CITES Secretariat, and can be accessed via the CITES website http://trade.cites.org/. 11 China Cuslink Company, Ltd 3 TRAFFIC report: Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan Hong Kong also uses eight-digit Custom codes, but the coding system is not equivalent to mainland China\u2019s system. Hong Kong has Customs codes for five different commodities of shark fins, which are dried shark fin with cartilage, dried shark fin without cartilage, shark fin, salted shark fin with cartilage and salted shark fin without cartilage (Annex 2). The Customs code for \u201cshark fin\u201d (0305-7190) was created in 2012 to record trade for shark fin commodities not elsewhere specified or indicated (NESOI). Hong Kong Customs codes also separate raw and processed shark fins. Hong Kong\u2019s Customs data were obtained from the Census and Statistics Department (CSD), which keeps import and (re)export data for Hong Kong SAR. According to Clarke (2002), shark fins with cartilage, commodity description in the Hong Kong Customs coding system, are considered raw and unprocessed material, and shark fin without cartilages are considered processed (with skin, cartilage and meat removed). Clarke (2002) also reported that the Customs code description of \u201cshark fins salted or in brine, but not dried or smoked\u201d actually covers \u201cfrozen\u201d shark fins. Hong Kong changed some of its shark product codes in 2012, including the re-classification of wet shark fins as frozen shark meat (Anon. 2014b). To get around this for the purpose of analysis, the frozen shark meat code had to be adjusted for the years 2012 to 2014 in order to capture the proportion that is salted (frozen) shark fin with cartilage (Eriksson and Clarke 2015). Dent and Clarke (2015) reported that HKCSD confirmed, in November 2013, that shark fin traders are advised to report frozen shark fins as frozen shark meat rather than as salted shark fins. \u201cDogfish and other sharks, frozen, excluding fillets, livers and roes\u201d is the full description for frozen shark meat, which did not exclude the \u201cfins\u201d and was the only shark related Customs code in Hong Kong with \u201cfrozen\u201d in the code description. This may be the reason for HKCSD\u2019s advice to traders. However, Hong Kong has reinstated separate commodity codes for frozen shark meat and frozen shark fins since January 2015 (Dent and Clarke, 2015). Hong Kong also has two Customs codes starting with 1604 for preserved/prepared shark fin products. The trade data from these two codes were not included for this research to avoid being double counted.

Taiwan\u2019s Customs data were obtained from the Bureau of Foreign Trade in Taiwan. Taiwan also has three Customs codes starting with 1604 for preserved/prepared shark fin products. The trade data from these three codes were not included in this research to avoid being double counted. FAO shark fin trade data between 2005 and 2011 were obtained from FishStatJ to understand the data reporting from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The most updated FAO shark trade data were available only up to 2011, before the release of this report. Searches of seven Chinese-language e-commerce websites were conducted between April and October 2015, to document the shark fins and mobulid ray gill plates availability on e-commerce platforms. The surveyed websites included the two Chinese language business-to-consumer (B2C), one Chinese consumer-to-consumer (C2C), three Chinese business-to-business (B2B) and one English language B2B websites (Table 9). To understand the shark fin and mobulid ray gill plate markets in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, 150 dried food product retail outlets from seven cities were selected for quantitative market surveys between May and June 2015 (Table 1). A range of publications, especially in Chinese, on the trade in shark fin and mobulid ray gill plates in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were reviewed to identify key locations for the survey to plot the trade in this region. Qualitative surveys, including in-depth interviews with sixteen managers or owners from shark fin trading/ wholesaling/retailing companies, were also conducted. Both quantitative and qualitative surveys were conducted by professional market surveyors, working with a pre-designed survey questionnaire (Attachment 1). For the quantitative market surveys, trained market surveyors posed as potential buyers to collect information on shark fin and mobulid ray gill plate trade, including product categories, price, species used, origin, etc. Information on shark species and shark fin were recorded based on the responses of interviewees, but not the judgement of surveyors. Eight cities were selected for market surveys based on the information related to high-end consumption, high population density, and the prevalence of a high number of shark businesses: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Puqi12 in mainland China, Hong Kong as well as Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan. 12 Only quantitative surveys were conducted in Shenzhen; and only qualitative surveys were conducted in Puqi. 5 TRAFFIC report: Shark Fin and Mobulid Ray Gill Plate Trade in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan Table 1.

There was no record in the UNEP-WCMC database, where the CITES data are hosted, of the trade in any ray species, but the rays and a number of shark listings did not come into effect until September 2014 so they may not appear in the available data sets. Four species of shark and one genus of sawfish (Pristis spp) were traded by mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan between 2003 and 2013. In total, mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan imported shark species from eight countries and (re)exported to four countries. However, only Hong Kong reported imports of the fins (6,933.4 kg) \u2013 Basking Shark Cetorhinus maximus fins from Norway \u2013 and reported the (re)exportation (9 kg) of fins from this same species to Malaysia. Mainland China and Taiwan recorded trade in shark meat or live sharks, but not in fins. Singapore reported that a further 39 unknown units of Basking Shark fins, originating from New Zealand, were re-exported to Hong Kong in 2007, but Hong Kong did not report their import. Globally, after Hong Kong, the next largest importer of fins from CITES-listed species was Spain, which reported only 602 kg of Porbeagle Shark Lamna nasus fins imported from Japan during the same period. Based on the import declarations in the UNEP-WCMC managed CITES trade database, mainland China only reported the importation of 6 kg of Basking Shark derivatives from Australia between 2003 and 2013 (Table 2). However, the USA (2 pieces of skin), UK (1 carving), Norway (700 kg of meat) and Germany (3 teeth of Appendix I Pristis spp.) all declared exports of shark products to mainland China between 2003 and 2013 (Table 2).

Even though information on the countries/territories of \u201corigin\u201d was recorded in the CITES trade data, there is some inconsistency as the origin of some species was not within their distribution range, for example, Cetorhinus maximus from Indonesia. Hong Kong had greater reported imports of CITES shark products than mainland China and Taiwan. In contrast, records suggest that (re)exports were greater in mainland China, where many small quantities of Basking Shark, Great White Shark and Whale Shark specimens to the USA and South Korea were declared by these importing countries (although without corresponding declarations from mainland China), compared with Hong Kong\u2019s only record of (re)export of 9 kg of Basking Shark fins to Malaysia in 2006 (Table 3).
