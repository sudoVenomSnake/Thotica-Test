 in the pharmaceutical trade, absenteeism of health workers, and informal payments in many countries in the region (UNDP 2008b), all of which are likely to contribute directly to poorer quality services. The factors that contribute to vulnerability to corruption in the health sector are similar to those in education: relatively large budgets, huge staff, shortages of hospital facilities especially in remote and rural areas, construction contracts, running of institutions, purchase of drugs and other supplies, large size of operations including in far-flung locations that make supervision difficult, inadequate accountability, low salaries and monopoly over public provisioning. In addition, asymmetric information between medical professionals and users of health services facilitate corruption, allowing health professionals, drug companies and even insurance agents to collude and gain unintended benefits at the cost of lay people.

NGOs and lobbyists have cam- paigned for revisions in the law as they see it as fuelling and facilitating the or- gan trade instead of regulating it and protecting the poor (Azfar and Azfar 2009). Activists clearly state that the law was originally designed to facilitate the organ trade to benefit politicians and bureaucrats from organ donations, trafficking and transplants. Trade in or- gans bring in big money for military hospitals. In a study conducted in India in 2001, 96 per cent of the participants sold their kidneys to settle debts. The average amount received was US $1,070. Most of the money received was spent on debt repayment, food and clothing. About 86 per cent of the participants re- ported deterioration in their health sta- tus after nephrectomy. Average family income declined by one-third after ne- phrectomy and the number of partici- pants living below the poverty line increased. Three-fourths of the partici- pants were still in debt at the time of the survey (Goyal et al. 2002). Siphoning public funds- There are sev- eral mechanisms by which public funds are siphoned off. As in education, one of the most common of these is the cre- ation of \u201cghost workers\u201d i.e. staff who show up on account books but do not actually exist (Transparency Interna- tional 2006). For example, in the Health Sector Risk Area Validation Survey 2004 of Bangladesh \u2018..16 per cent of the em- ployees were found fully absent\u2026\u201d (World Bank 2007). In Papua New Guin- ea, there were at least 2000 unattached officials doing no work, a large number of ghosts on the pay roll, lack of control over growth in casual employees (many of whom do not work in return for their pay), and extraordinary high rates of absenteeism. A significant proportion of the 78,000 public servants on the payroll are non-productive and some non-existent (World Bank 2003). Siphoning off funds in the process of procurement is especially visible in the drug supply chain and at the hospital level. Owing to the complex supply chain and management of the drugs and medical supplies, from the R&D run by pharmaceutical multi-nationals to the availability of drugs at a primary healthcare centre, it is difficult to distinguish between poor management practices, neglect and outright corrupt practices. However, what a number of case studies and national-level studies have shown is that drugs and related medical equipment and supplies are often not available to users at the health- delivery point or are substandard. This has a significant negative effect on public health. Bribery: Informal payments- From the users\u2019 point of view, probably the most direct form of corruption is bribery. Bribery increases the cost to consumers, restricts access and worsens health outcomes. Bribery skews quality of service in favour of those who can pay. South Asia, followed by East Asia, has the highest incidence of informal pay- ments worldwide (Azfar and Azfar 2009). \u201cA comparative study in five South Asian countries (Bangladesh, In- dia, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) found that in all but Sri Lanka most pay- ments were ex ante demands from pro- viders. Bribes are required in all five countries for hospital admissions, to obtain a bed, to receive subsidized med- ication.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c815ef17-5eca-43ad-b7e3-74a0491864ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "c815ef17-5eca-43ad-b7e3-74a0491864ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35396a1cc3525572325fc99fc1b9702a2f3f08bbd0e7f929428127ca07243489"}, "2": {"node_id": "53cc2ed1-9596-4a7a-badf-61b2d5db262c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6ce0113261046d39ae7ed67e48b875802108d93518562fc6f51a3f4802acc19"}}, "hash": "887ed7f4b77faf973ef9082880c2130a1a3f5d741959e86d5f749368e38578d6", "text": "In Bangalore, India, citizen feed- back surveys revealed that informal payments were made to ensure proper 23 treatment, that they were typically de- manded by providers, and 51 per cent of those interviewed indicated they had paid bribes in government hospitals and 89 per cent in hospitals in small cities; they had also paid informally in the pri- vate hospitals (24 per cent).

On average 7.3 per cent of total household spending goes to paying for healthcare (Banerjee et al. 2004). Although studies show that the size of informal payments made by the poor tends to be lower than that by the rich, these payments constitute a higher percentage of the overall income of the poor (Lewis 2006). It is also pos- sible that in some cases payments lead to the sale of assets and an increase in debt payments.

Source: Lewis 2006. 24 Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development Personnel-related corruption- Given the high staff requirements in health (as in education), the selling of public po- sitions, absenteeism, postings (reloca- tion), etc., are widespread, especially at lower levels. The selling of public posi- tions is further exacerbated by nepo- tism, political and military influence in postings, and non-transparent and unfair treatment at the time of hiring. Staffing on such a basis undermines discipline and harms service quality. However, the percentage of people who said that public positions in the health sector are sold is higher outside of Asia. In Bosnia and Herzegovina surveys of officials and citizens reported that 75 per cent thought bribes were required to obtain positions and for promotion. In Ghana 25 per cent of jobs were alleg- edly bought in government hospitals. In Uganda 20 per cent of municipal of- ficials acknowledged that the practice occurred in the health sector, whereas in the Philippines 3 per cent noted it (Lewis 2006). Although these figures may not be strictly comparable, they give an indication of magnitude of the problem. Absenteeism, the sale of public positions and other forms of personnel-related corruption are clearly visible to users. While this might appear to be more of a management issue than an act of cor- ruption, at high levels of prevalence and with implicit collusion of those in au- thority, it undermines service delivery and systems, frequently leading to the closure of public facilities. It therefore compromises outcomes at the primary level, especially in rural areas (where typically there is just one provider). Such endemic corruption contributes to apathy and contempt for the state pro- vision of services. It can also force the poor to pay for private-sector services and therefore creates a higher cost bur- den for them. Lewis (2006) observes that absentee- ism rates cluster around 35-40 per cent but is as low as 19 per cent in Papua New Guinea and as high 60 per cent in rural Bangladesh and Uganda. Absenteeism or low-level attendance varies across healthcare staff. In a study of rural health clinics by Chaudhury and Ham- mer (2003), it was found that on aver- age, 35 per cent of staff and 42 per cent of physicians were absent across the clinics visited in Bangladesh. A study in Rajasthan (India) revealed that over the course of 18 months nurses were only at work in villages served by the sub- centre 12 per cent of the time (Baner- jee et al. 2004). Moreover the pattern of absences, and therefore closure of facilities, followed no pattern, meaning that patients found it difficult to predict where they could access healthcare. Absenteeism is higher in rural areas due to problems of access and difficulties in supervision. Chaudhury and Hammer (2003) find that absenteeism in the most isolated rural areas is 74 per cent as compared to 42 per cent for all rural health centres surveyed. Multivariate analysis showed that living outside the service village, being female and poor road access increased the likelihood of absenteeism among physicians. Absen- teeism was associated with clinics in disrepair as well as with lower patient demand, suggesting that absenteeism compromises quality and quantity of services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c9d3da5-0f1c-4ad7-bb62-2644739f8a61": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c9d3da5-0f1c-4ad7-bb62-2644739f8a61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac374440c6dfaf6430a8b6bdff2b05af44c4ebcf59f18a7198888f936d952958"}, "2": {"node_id": "b44ba6f6-1d4d-43b7-a0a3-13017c21e5c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01728c66e3645e227cd1c82f993ca6b8c682b49a74de5e320dac404c96e14d1c"}}, "hash": "2389f72d1d0df0a68fd35447362883af1f38fe1d2145af1caf9a7f64c276bc44", "text": "Corruption with theft: Stealing goods - A World Bank (2007) study in Bangla- desh notes the most common symptoms of pilferage as: \u2022 Drugs not being properly recorded in the register of drug stocks. \u2022 Misuse of drugs including dispensed drugs being resold. \u2022 Discrepancies found between the registration of drug deliveries and drug supply. 19 See citations in Azfar and Azfar 2009. 25 \u2022 Inconsistencies found between pre scriptions and registers.

Cohen (2002) found that 32 per cent of users had prior knowledge of theft in government pharmacies in Costa Rica. Corruption may extend be- yond the illegal acquisition of medicines. While conclusive evidence is not avail- able, there are signs of apparent collu- sion amongst bidders, an absence of real competition, and pressures on purchase committees to seek the lowest possible price, irrespective of quality. Negligent regulation- Poor or inade- quate regulation facilitates corruption in the pharmaceutical industry, for ex- ample in professional associations. Khan (2006b) observes that in Pakistani professional medical circles cronyism and favouritism are considered normal. The award of honorary membership is viewed as an extension of the same cro- nyism. In one instance in Pakistan the College of Physicians and Surgeons awarded a Fellow of the College of Phy- sicians with Surgeon\u2019s Distinction even though he did not have a first author publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Part of the justification given for such a relaxed approach to qualification may be the very poor ratio of specialists to patients. In the case of Pakistan, for ex- ample, the ratio is 1 psychiatrist to 1 million population. Private sector involvement is evident through links between medicines pre- scribed and \u201cperks\u201d received by doctors from the pharmaceutical industry. As Khan (2006a) notes, \u201csome of the many inducements on offer include: sponsor- ing attendance at conferences, under- writing symposia, all-expenses-paid trips for self and spouse for a drug launch abroad, free drug samples and expensive gifts (watches, air condition- ers, briefcases, laptops, etc.). Other methods include funding a physician\u2019s family wedding, holidays and other events of this nature. One of the latest incentives is for the pharmaceutical company to provide the physicians with a down payment for a new car (in re- turn for 200 prescriptions for the com- pany\u2019s expensive drug).\u201d Cohen et al. (2006) divide corruption in the pharmaceutical sector into various stages: (a) manufacturing, (b) registra- tion, (c) selection, (d) procurement, (e) distribution, and (f) service delivery. They provide a corruption vulnerability assessment for each stage and demon- strate the complexity of the problem. They also produce a set of refreshingly realistic recommendations, which cate- gorize the possible responses in terms of their expected effectiveness and their political feasibility. \u2022 5.3 Effects of corruption in health services Several studies have observed a significant relationship between corruption and adverse health outcomes, such as child and infant mortality and low birth weight.19 This can reflect the fact that basic preventive measures such as vaccination programmes have been undermined. Families already in distress from illness often face the added anxiety of unpredictable extra costs, or being driven towards the private sector. Gupta et al. (2000), using data from 89 countries, found that the coefficient of the log of child mortality and infant mortality is 0.37 and 0.35, respectively. This implies that a two-point change in the corruption rating would halve child and infant mortality. Lewis (2006) shows that immunization rates 19 See citations in Azfar and Azfar 2009. 26 Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development are greater in places which are better governed. More honest countries invariably have higher immunization rates, although there is a large variation in immunization rates in corrupt countries. Azfar and Gurgur (2005), in their survey in Philippines, found that corruption reduces immunization rates, delays the vaccination of newborns, discourages the use of public health clinics, reduces the satisfaction of households with public health services and increases the waiting time of patients at health clinics. The cost of laxer regulation is substan- tial. Although no specific study exists on the cost of regulation to the poor, it is possible to contextualize regulatory environments for cause and effect. One example is the poor regulation of men- tal-health care in Pakistan with poor regulation and control of drug supplies. This may be assessed by a simple ratio comparing the sale of drugs and avail- ability of psychiatrists. There are just 150-200 registered psychiatrists in Pak- istan, but in one year (July 2003 to June 2004) the psychotropic drug sale was worth US $ 46.77 million (Khan 2006a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44eaff2a-7fb1-4e43-9715-aeafb6efb83a": {"__data__": {"id_": "44eaff2a-7fb1-4e43-9715-aeafb6efb83a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb2c8a47a15afd562b2498cf6166c2e1793bc374c7f650cb32f680c318deebce"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc3f79b4-edba-40c5-9044-7af97da13323", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a97828a70f65de0479eff6e1e238ee7e12bea3f630ac9e4ddf3b0c4b893157df"}}, "hash": "b3901f8261594d080d7bd7ffddc3947e82cf9de304600ca7cec79088b3881f96", "text": "This suggests that a very high share of drugs was prescribed or bought without prescription.

Neither the pharma- ceutical industry nor the state appears to regulate the production and sale of these drugs. Asymmetric knowledge between experts and patients facilitates such corruption. How does this affect the poor? First, there is a clear link between poverty and mental illness, making them more likely to need treatment. Second, gen- eral practitioners in low-income areas may well prescribe a drug which is un- suitable or even ineffective, but which is very expensive. The patient, who does not know that the drug is over-priced or inappropriate, may pay for it , even if this means cutting other consumption or going into debt. Azfar and Gurgur (2005) found that corruption in the Philippines affects ru- ral and urban communities differently. In the urban areas, demand for public healthcare is more \u201ccorruption-elastic\u201d \u2013 i.e. use of public health facilities by household declines more rapidly in re- sponse to higher corruption incidence. In contrast, households in rural areas with few alternatives, suffer through longer waiting times or late immuniza- tion of infants. Rural residents are less satisfied with public health services as compared to households in urban areas facing the same level of corruption. The evidence of the negative effects of corruption in health services is compel- ling enough to demand solutions. \u2022 5.4 Uprooting corruption in the health sector Reducing corruption in health and other government services will require combined action from above and below. From above, governments will need to ensure more transparent and better managed services; from below, users can work together to understand cor- ruption better, ask the right questions and resist it. Examples of action from the region are presented below. 27 Reducing Informal Payments in Cambodia- In Takeo Provincial Hospital in Cambodia in 1996, the monthly revenue from informal payments was estimated at US $13,750 \u2013 about five times the monthly hospital payroll and about 45 per cent of the total budget. Since then the hospital has reformed the way it works. It has, for example, replaced informal payments with formal user fees and the revenue from these to pay bonuses to staff. Overall, patients are now paying less in official fees than they did in informal charges, and they know that the fees will be consistent and predictable. This has transformed the operation of the hospital, which treats many more people at a lower cost (Barber et al. 2004). Radio power in India- The radio pro- gramme \u2018To be Alive\u2019 is broadcast on state radio in the poor rural region of Kutch, a district in Gujarat (India). It is done by semi-literate rural people trained by a human rights organiza- tion to be amateur radio reporters. Of- ten a whole team of reporters carries out \u2018radio raids\u2019. For example, they di- rected one at a doctor who was charg- ing women for delivering babies at a community health centre \u2013 a free ser- vice for the poor. This sparked a gov- ernment inquiry into illegal charging at primary health centres across the country (BBC News 2005). Removing fake drugs in Mekong coun- tries- In the Mekong subregion- Cam- bodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunan Province of China \u2013 it was found that all countries were using substandard or fake anti-malarials in 2003. With the combined support of the US Pharmacopeia Drug Quality and Information Programme, USAID, WHO, and national and local governments, the regulatory authorities in these countries have been improving com- munications and cooperation across borders. They have been able to notify each other of the circulation of fake drugs and remove them more quickly from all outlets (Campos and Pradhan 2007). New prescriptions in China- In June 2006, China\u2019s legislature adopted the sixth Amendment to the Criminal Law, stipulating that staff members of schools and hospitals will face criminal penalties if they seek bribes or receive kickbacks or commissions. The former Commissioner of China\u2019s State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) was subsequently convicted for accepting more than US $850,000 in bribes. The government launched a large-scale in- vestigation among the SFDA staff pos- sibly involved. All drug licenses were to be re-issued. The Ministry of Public Health now requires hospitals to sepa- rate the procurement of drugs from the writing of prescriptions so that neither hospitals nor doctors benefit from pre- scribing particular drugs (Wei 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75aa2c61-fff0-42c7-b209-ef972db19c14": {"__data__": {"id_": "75aa2c61-fff0-42c7-b209-ef972db19c14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78cc9492e0d849a6a6688c2b52a2eaa680abd17063e42388fad51f5b67d5b1a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "50408338-1ab1-42be-a0fd-95fcb94a2564", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "373566715bc7a72f4e59f09c045ec93e5f46923d97dd7c208120586560aa01ca"}}, "hash": "c0fd76346f7596aeaa23022ae7beb10a0683791c538db7185f0446369c4736f9", "text": "Although measures for tackling corruption depend on national circumstances, these examples indicate that both pressure from the top and from below have obtained important key results.

Access to water, sanitation and electricity is of great significance for human devel- opment and the poor depend much more upon public provisioning of such neces- sities. However, this sector is \u201cmarred with corrupt practices\u201d (UNDP 2008b). Gupta et al. (1998) in their cross- coun- try study found that corruption reduces the effectiveness of social spending, which has several adverse consequenc- es, particularly for the poor. Figure 6.1 plots World Bank CCI (2007) and popu- lation share with improved sanitation (2005) to explore the pattern between the two indicators in 177 countries. The basic message is that corruption under- mines access to improved sanitation in many countries, including most of those in Asia Pacific. The provision of utilities requires large investments for infrastructure-based services (DFID 2002). This makes it a high-risk sector for corruption. In ad- dition, whether provision is public or private, utilities tend to be provided by monopolies: economies of scale make it more efficient to have a single provider for services like water, sanitation and electricity. This results in an unequal relationship between supplier and con- sumer with copious opportunities for corruption: consumers have nowhere else to turn. Moreover the essential nature of basic utilities (it is impossible to do without water for even a day) undercuts the bar- gaining power of consumers. Shortages are another significant contributory fac- tor. Underinvestment contributes to low coverage and poor quality, putting a pre- mium on whatever is available. Extend- ing coverage requires large-scale up- front investment for basic infrastructure, which by itself also creates the potential for corruption. Transparency Interna- tional (2002) in its survey of corruption in South Asia identified lack of account- ability and monopoly among the reasons for corruption in the public services, Corruption in utilities Source: World Bank 2008; UNDP 2007. 6 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 2.50 2.00 1.50 1.00 0.50 0.00 -0.50 -1.00 -1.50 -2.00 -2.50 Control of corruption index 2007 Population with improved sanitation (%) Hong kong, China (SAR) Newzealand Australia Figure 6.1: Access to improved sanitation and control of corruption 29 includ ing water, sanitation and electric- ity. Both demand and supply sides pro- vide room for corruption. \u2022 6.2 Types of corruption in utilities: Examples from \ufffd Asia\ufffdPacific Corruption in utilities happens, both on the demand and supply sides. Both grand and retail corruption is observed. The World Bank estimates that in highly corrupt countries project corruption accounts for 30-40 per cent of resources in the water and sanitation sector (Wa- ter Integrity Network 2006). Investments, which are already limited, are further dissipated through corrup- tion. In the Philippines, several studies have estimated the misuse of resources in public works at between 20 per cent and 40 per cent (ADB et al. 2005). This is partly because corruption can \u2013 and does - emerge through the whole cycle: Pre-project collusion- Construction com- panies participating in contracts have ways of colluding with other bidders, financing agencies, or with officials in executing agencies, before there is a proposal. A contractor with insider con- nections can influence a contract\u2019s iden- tification and creation as well as its specification, tender conditions, prepa- ration, and design. Rigging tenders and bids- Contractors can collude through coordinated bids in such a manner that their preferred can- didate wins - on the understanding that the others will be designated as sub- contractors or as winners for future projects. In many cases, officials are aware of the bid rigging. When this hap- pens, the project costs include the \u2018grease money\u2019 to be paid by the pre- agreed winner, and a certain percentage goes to the agency\u2019s personnel.

Then when all this corruption results in substandard works, new opportunities arise to prepare inflated bills for repairs and maintenance. In the Philippines in 2005, an ADB study found that \u2018deeply-rooted\u2019 corruption was increasing costs of power projects, delaying their implementation and pro- viding Filipino households and busi- nesses with electricity services that were both unreliable and expensive \u2013 two to three times the prices in other countries (Sohail and Cavil 2009). It said corruption was involved in almost all phases of a project, from tendering and bidding to operation and mainte- nance as well as in privatization and the awarding of independent power-pro- ducing contracts. Retail or petty corruption- Particularly with monopolies, staff of utility agen- cies can supplement their salaries by colluding with clients to provide servic- es \u2018informally\u2019 \u2013 by selling them water supplies, carrying out repairs for side- 30 Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development payments, falsifying meter readings, or making illegal connections. When people need supplies of water or electricity that are in short supply, they have little choice but to bribe. A Transparency International Bangla- desh\u2019s Baseline Survey on Corruption (1997) found that 60 per cent of urban households either paid money or exert- ed some form of influence to get water connections, and that nearly one-third of urban households had their water bills reduced through an arrangement with the meter readers (Sohail and Cav- ill 2009). Consumers are often willing to pay bribes just for convenience of procuring services; even honest consumers will be discouraged by long queues to pay bills and be tempted to turn to the services of \u2018middle men\u2019. For the simplest routine, legal or necessary functions such as getting a connection they may have no choice but to make \u2018grease payments\u2019 or pay \u2018tea money\u2019 or \u2018speed money\u2019. Theft through illegal connections- For electricity supplies much of the cor- ruption is linked to illegal connections from the main line. Since this can be detected quite easily, a middleman is needed to encourage the electricity de- partment inspector to turn a blind eye. Illegal connections can be temporary, for example, for the wedding of a local big-wig or a public meeting of a political party. They can also be near-permanent like in urban slums or commercial es- tablishments. Individually, bribes may take quite small payments but these soon add up. In some countries around half the power disappears in the form of \u2018system losses\u2019. One survey on corrup- tion in eleven public services in India focused on retail corruption faced by the \u2018common man\u2019 in accessing public services. The study found that the elec- tricity service was the second most cor- rupt basic public service and that nearly 65 per cent of the corruption involved issues of billing and grant of new con- nection (Transparency International India 2005). Persistence in private operations- Even when the utilities are privately run, cor- ruption may not disappear. The utilities company may, for example, invite mu- nicipal staff to visit its headquarters, paying for both the ticket and stay. But certain types of corruption tend to be lower. The cities of Kolkata and Mumbai in India, for example, have had private utilities for decades where commercial procedures tend to be better than those of state-owned corporations. They also have stronger accounting systems that discourage theft. As a result their \u2018com- mercial losses\u2019, including those from theft, are usually around only 12-15 per cent, less than half of those incurred by the state-owned utilities, which are typically in the range of 30-35 per cent (Gulati and Rao 2007). Also in India, the state of Orissa privatized the distribu- tion of electricity in 1999. Since then there have been significant improve- ments, including improvements in bill- ing and collection.

The situation is worse in the rural ar- eas, and more so for the poorest fami- lies. Electricity supplies too can be er- ratic as many parts of the region suffer from low voltage operations or frequent power outages. These data overestimate access since the quality is often low. Water supplies, for example, can be intermittent and polluted by fecal matter from leaking septic tanks. This has serious health implications. Each year millions of children die as a result of diarrhea and other diseases caused by unclean water and poor sanitation, compounded by er- ratic power supplies to health facilities. For businesses and households that rely on public grids, inadequate power sup- plies severely limit the technology they can use and their range and duration of economic activities. The direct economic losses from cor- ruption can also be huge. Estimates by the World Bank suggest that 20 to 40 per cent of water sector finances are lost to dishonest and corrupt practices (Stalgren 2006). It has been estimated that if the water sector operated in a transparent fashion, and corruption were eliminated, 20 to 70 per cent of re- sources could be saved. Kaufmann et al. (2004) reviewed the performance of in- frastructure services (water, sewerage, electricity and telephones) in 412 cities in 134 countries. They found that cor- ruption has significant and substantial effects on both access to services and on the quality of service delivery. The transition from corrupt to uncor- rupt institutions can often be difficult. Bangladesh offers a recent example when the interim government imple- mented far reaching and effective mea- sures to prevent, identify and punish corrupt acts. However, this inadvertent- ly worsened the situation of the poor since businesses were finally paying taxes and passing these on as price in- creases to consumers. As a result, there were dramatic increases in the prices of such essentials as fish and rice, which are staples in the diet. Many business leaders report that procedures that used to require merely a bribe or a quick call to the right contact now demand paper- work in triplicate with multiple rounds of approvals. Thus, although citizens have welcomed the tough stance on cor- ruption, their support could be eroded by rising prices (Wax 2007). \u2022 6.4 Uprooting corruption in utilities Utilities are essential for the daily lives of people than thus their well-being. It is thus important to address corruption both from the demand and the supply side. There are signs of change, though much remains to be done. Here are some examples from around the region. A single window cell in India - At the end of the 1990s, the Hyderabad Metropoli- tan Water Supply and Sewerage Board introduced a number of customer- focused service delivery reforms. This included a process of consolidated applications for new connections \u2013 pre- viously a major source of corruption. Rather than filing an application in their 32 Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development local district office, customers now go to the Board\u2019s headquarters to a \u2018Single Win- dow Cell\u2019 (SWC), which manages all the related activities, such as obtaining a road-cutting permit or land surveying. The Board publishes the fee schedule for various plot and connection sizes in its of- fice and in the press \u2013 reducing the oppor- tunities for staff to levy excess charges. The process has been designed as a one- visit operation so the customer rarely leaves the SWC without an \u2018application token number\u2019, the equivalent of a receipt for acceptance of the application. Cleaner water supplies in Cambodia- The Phnom Penh Water Supply Author- ity has improved hugely over the last decade and coverage of the city has in- creased from 25 per cent to 90 per cent over the past ten years. Between 1999 and 2006, the number of household connections for the poorest people in the city has risen from 100 to over 13,000 (ADB 2006). This has been achieved by creating an autonomous and transparently-run authority in which staff are given greater responsi- bility and are paid according to finan- cial performance. Although the tariffs were increased, a portion of the reve- nue garnered was used to subsidize connections and bills for the poorest people. Automated billing and collec- tion systems have replaced often-cor- rupt bill collectors. Inspection teams penalize those with illegal connections and encourage people to report them. Customer service has been improved with a free phone number and a 24- hour repair team for water leakages. Staff associated with illegal connec- tions are removed or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64d96236-5bac-4ad5-9a50-a082c46404cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "64d96236-5bac-4ad5-9a50-a082c46404cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef6a2f0344db989a0a3df3b93c347f9710d74deaf1757b3192e0bee251135ff4"}, "3": {"node_id": "44b2003a-605f-4d00-b3a3-26ece2403ece", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f990659c290d57c4d3df95925492d0765652dcf5ef88ec7dbfb685adfa3ccde5"}}, "hash": "a27bbadfcda7ad7c1d65ca91307a5c893c2f069831ddf66188e4665fe63e20a8", "text": "punished imme- diately. However, importantly, employ- ees are seen not only or even primarily as sources of problems, but as a major part of the solution. Clean energy in Bangladesh\u2013 The Rural Electrification Board and its rural elec- tric cooperatives (Pally Bidyut Samities, or PBS) are expanding electricity ser- vices in rural areas. They have protected themselves from corrupt practices through a number of innovative ar- rangements. First the Board of each PBS is selected by consumers. Then the me- ter readers are hired on one-year con- tracts that can be extended to three years with good performance \u2013 after which the meter reader has to seek a different career, which is not difficult if they have a good record. Every year the management of each PBS negotiates an agreement that includes targets for sys- tem loss, collection efficiency, revenue and cost of supply per kilometre of line, and debt repayment. The PBSs use in- dependent consulting firms to survey rural areas, identify potential consum- ers and design the electricity distribu- tion network. They also display on a no- tice board the list of lines to be installed \u2013 this helps to reduce the risk of corrup- tion and nepotism in investment deci- sions and help to avoid the construction of uneconomical lines. Reducing collusion in Pakistan - The Lo- cal Government and Rural Development Department (LGRDD) in Azad and Jam- mu Kashmir, Pakistan, works in remote areas of the state, but keeps a tight rein on activities through field visits and bi- annual meetings. It has eliminated pri- vate contractors for all but the most technically complex of the 1,260 schemes; instead, its technical staff work with community members who provide the required labour and orga- nize the purchase of supplies. In sum, there are limited the opportunities for \u2018cream skimming\u2019 and collusion. Moreover, the employees take great pride in their work and in reducing corruption. Most 33 technical staff were not told at the time of their hiring that they would have to do so much community work. \u201cI thought I was hired as an engineer,\u201d one employee re- called. \u201cThen I found out I was going to be an engineer, a community organizer, a po- liceman, and a labourer.\u201d Over time, tech- nical employees have formed close bonds with the communities to which they are assigned (Davis 2004). Many of the strategies for uprooting corruption involve greater investment to minimize the shortages that encour- age people to pay bribes. Public corpo- rations will need to improve standards of management and operate in a more transparent fashion. But consumers, too, can take direct action for better ser- vices. This will have a positive impact on people\u2019s lives, as can be seen from the examples given above. 34 Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development The way forward proposed is a combi- nation of \u2018top-down-plus-bottom-up\u2019 pressure from both ends operating syn- ergistically (UNDP 2008a, Rajivan 2009). Pressure from above through political will can be sustained through people\u2019s expectations, checks, and support from below; just as much as pressure from above can trigger expectations and con- ditions for the operation of pressure from below. This strategy underscores the point that just as the motivations for corruption lie inside and outside of gov- ernments, the responsibility to fight cor- ruption cannot be that of governments alone. To be successful, anti-corruption strategies must leverage motivations for checks and balances at all levels that en- courage voices against corruption \u2013 rec- ognizing that people by and large prefer everyone else to be honest rather than corrupt. While all forms of corruption need to be tackled, from a human development perspective reducing those that hit the poor the hardest should be prioritised. Hauling the rich and powerful before the courts may grab headlines but the poor will benefit more from efforts to curb corruption that plagues their ev- eryday lives, especially corruption in health, education and public utilities sectors. While details and priorities need to be guided by national circum- stances, there are some common points under the overall sandwich strategy of \u2018top-down-plus-bottom-up\u2019 which to- gether could create a tipping point20.

These measures would need to be complemented by rigorous systems of monitoring and control that can detect corruption swiftly and pun- ish it severely. While it is necessary to strengthen na- tional civil services, what is probably more important is to build capacity at the local level. Social services are the do- main of sub-national and local levels of government necessitating a focus on lower tiers of government and local bod- ies. Many countries in the region are de- centralizing several functions to lower tiers of government. However, this is proving difficult as local officials or in- stitutions lack the necessary funds or skills. Combined with weak systems of monitoring and control, this can decen- tralize corruption and possibly make it more widespread. Governments and donors will clearly need to invest much more in local gov- ernment. In doing so, they should be able to capitalize on the knowledge and Way forward 7 20 The Asia Pacific HDR proposes a seven point agenda: (1) Join with international effort-join the United Nations Convention Against Coruption and the Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative; (2) Establish bench marks of quality - for anticorruption agencies, for example, and for the national media; (3) Strengthen the civil service; (4) Encourage codes of conduct in the private sector - including professions such as lawyers and accountants; (5) Establish the right to information; (6) Leverage new technology; and (7) Support citizen action. 35 experience of honest public officials who can suggest the most effective forms of control that will limit the op- portunities for corruption, while sup- porting their efforts to carry out their duties responsibly. Establish right to information- One of the most powerful ways of controlling corruption is by ensuring that citizens are privy to most of the same informa- tion as their governments. Countries in the region could enact laws on the right to information (RTI), indicating genuine political will at the highest level. This can provide the right signals to elected representatives, bureaucrats and busi- nesses as well as citizens. We now have some tried and tested models to follow, including that of India, which has one of the most progressive acts in the devel- oping world. Such a right can be a pow- erful preventive measure \u2013 its very exis- tence operating as a deterrent. However, fulfilling the right to informa- tion requires much more than legisla- tion \u2013 it also demands a new public ethos of openness and appropriate training of public officials. From the outset, therefore, public officials need to be engaged and convinced about the value of RTI and to develop the capacity to deal with requests promptly and ap- propriately. At the same time, the media and other parts of civil society have to learn how to use RTI systems responsi- bly. This could be fostered by public campaigns on TV, radio, the internet and newspapers, explaining what type of information is available and how to apply for it. RTI facilitates greater people\u2019s voices but unless informed citizens and CSOs learn to operate it, thus generating pres- sure from below, a mere paper right will be ineffective. The Asia Pacific region has already experienced the positive ef- fects of the RTI. In India, for example, public hearings mobilized by CSO action have helped limit public-works corrup- tion in Rajasthan (UNDP 2008a). Leverage new technology- Much corrup- tion thrives in the gloom, in the obscu- rity of dusty files and complex adminis- trative systems. Information technology and e-governance, however, offer fresh opportunities to make administration more open, transparent and neutral, re- ducing the layers and number of face- to-face interactions. This way, it breaks the monopoly of corrupt officials and allows citizens to keep abreast of ad- ministrative processes. Information technology has already shown its value in a number of countries by speeding up court processes and systems of land registration. It is also, for example, al- lowing public utilities to establish \u2018one- stop shops\u2019 where all the elements re- quired to achieve a new power connection are brought together for customers\u2019 convenience, without re- quiring them to traipse from one office to another with multiple bribes de- manded en route.

New technology can also contrib- ute to better monitoring of the use of natural resources, through satellite im- aging, and even at a more modest level using digital cameras to monitor the daily performance of education and health services. Support citizen action- Some of the most striking successes in addressing cor- ruption have occurred where local or- ganizations have taken the initiative to monitor public works and investigate the extent to which officials and con- tractors have fulfilled their commit- ments. This has enabled civil society organizations, local communities and local governments to work together to supervise public projects. Given that lo- cal governments usually have a limited capacity to monitor projects themselves, they could take greater advantage of these opportunities by regularly pub- lishing the basic information on con- tracts to facilitate citizen auditing.

Preface This indexing exercise aims to demystify the principles and calculations in indexing, taking up the case of the human development index. It demonstrates that indexing is a simple idea and the actual steps can be mastered by anyone with basic high school mathematics. The document is in three sections. Section one is about measuring human development and, in particular, covers the idea of indexing, its strengths and limitations, principles of calculating an index and actual steps in the calculations. It shows how the HDI is used to represent, very simply, three dimensions of the aggregate human condition of a particular geographic area. Section two contains an exercise based on data for three imaginary countries \u2013 Masalabad, Guinea Town and Messifeng. The exercise requires the calculation of the HDI for each and \ufb01nally comparing the three values to draw conclusions on ranking to help compare the three imaginary countries. The repetition in calculations \u2013 repeating the steps three times for the three countries is expected to help in \ufb01rmer understanding and learning. Section three pro- vides the solutions.

The concept The human development concept brings together observations and experiences from around the world placing human beings at the centre of development concerns, in con- trast with the primary pursuit of economic ends. The importance of people has been recognised from as far back as Aristotle, going on to Adam Smith, and even Arthur Lewis, to the extent that he emphasised the importance of economic growth because it expanded choices. This was lost sight of in development writing in the 1960s and 1970s, but revived by Amartya Sen in the 1980s. Today human development is com- monly understood as enlarging people\u2019s choices to have a meaningful and creative life with human dignity. Human develop- ment is multi-disciplinary rather than just economic, focuses on people, not markets and incomes. Incomes, while no doubt im- portant, are treated as the means to a better human condition rather than ends in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0a106ec-8f67-4a3b-936a-3b752a39a717": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0a106ec-8f67-4a3b-936a-3b752a39a717", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cracking-hdi-human-development-indexing-exercise", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Cracking the HDI: Human Development Indexing Exercise", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cracking-hdi-human-development-indexing-exercise", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9dac7fe25e8928f5935a2d3c8f2289c9584de593bd94c6ac8a7e6e704518569"}}, "hash": "f9dac7fe25e8928f5935a2d3c8f2289c9584de593bd94c6ac8a7e6e704518569", "text": "them- selves. II. Concept to measurement: The Human Development Index The concept of human development is clear- ly much broader than the various measures that capture numerically some of its impor- tant aspects. The most well known aggregate measure is the Human Development Index (HDI).1 The concept and the HDI are quite distinct - the two should not be confused. The HDI was developed as an alternative to the gross domestic product (GDP), to moni- tor the overall status and progress of nations. The GDP aims to present an aggregate pic- ture of the economic status of a nation for a year, while the HDI aims to represent an aggregate picture of the broader human condition. Measuring human development involves using speci\ufb01cally selected variables or indicators and aggregating them to cre- ate summary indices. The HDI has become a flagship summary measure to represent hu- man development achievements of a partic- ular geographic area,2 for a year. It captures three dimensions: a) a long and healthy life b) knowledge c) a decent standard of living A good question to ask is why go beyond the GDP in measuring progress of nations? GDP limits itself as a measure of aggregate mar- ket activity, leaving out non-market sources of value. It is an inadequate mean of income. The limitation of income also as an exclusive 1 Other commonly used indices are the Gender-related Development Index (GDI), the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) and the Human Poverty Index (HPI). 2 Usually a country, but also for sub national units and country clusters or groupings. Human Development Indexing Exercise 1 measure of development becomes evident as we recognize that many choices do not depend on income. For example, even a rich landlord in a rural area may not have access to reliable electricity or underground sanitation; a female may be considered old enough to marry at 15 years of age in certain communities depriving her of education and other freedoms. Moreover, income is subject to diminishing marginal utility and an ex- clusive focus on per capita income does not take into account how income is distributed or utilised. III. Strengths and limitations of the HDI The strength of composite indices, like the HDI is that being a single number it is simple to present. It can be used as a powerful ad- vocacy tool to catch the attention of policy makers, media and NGOs which can expand the debate to focus on human outcomes. Another strength is that a composite index can offer a multi dimensional view of social and economic phenomena by capturing a broader information set. For example, the HDI attempts to capture the health, educa- tion and income related achievements in one single \ufb01gure. Indices also help monitor progress, facilitate comparisons across time and geographical areas and help in setting measurable targets. The HDI, for instance, can be calculated at sub-national level to convey a more analytical view of the living conditions as depicted by the three dimen- sions of the index. Composite indices however do have their limitations. Any index is only a summary \u2013 much more limited than the broader con- cept it sets out to measure. The HDI for ex- ample, is far more limited than the concept of human development, just as the GNP is far more limited than the concept of economic prosperity of a nation. The HDI cannot pro- vide a complete picture of human develop- ment as many critical aspects of the human condition cannot be quanti\ufb01ed. Even for aspects which can be quanti\ufb01ed, it is some- times difficult to obtain consistent and reli- able data across time and space. Nevertheless, the HDI has proved to be a useful shorthand way to map the human conditions, that go beyond material wellbe- ing. It is wider than Gross Domestic Product /Gross National Product per capita, which represents economic conditions only. IV. Principles in indexing Indexing is neither difficult nor a mystery \u2013 anybody with high school mathematics can do it once he knows the logic behind it. This exercise is meant to take the reader through the logic and sequential steps involved in the calculations. Once the logic is clear, it can even trigger off ideas to modify and custom- ize the index for other applications. Typically, indexing is a simple process of ag- gregating individual variables or indicators to obtain one summary measure. Since in- dividual indicators are expressed in different units of measurement, they cannot be com- bined together unless they are made scale free. This is the \ufb01rst step.

All indicators have to be made unidirectional \u2013 say by taking re- ciprocal values for some. Following this, the scale free values are given desired weights (a subjective decision) before completing the aggregation. While these are general prin- ciples, in speci\ufb01c cases different formulas are used to combine different indicators. This exercise will take you through the steps of calculating the HDI based on the formula used in the global Human Development Re- ports (HDRs). Information is presented on three imaginary countries. The reader will be expected to select appropriate indicators relevant for the HDI, calculate the HDI using the formula, compare the HDIs for the three countries and draw suitable conclusions. V. Calculating the HDI Calculating the HDI includes the following steps. Step 1. Obtain actual data for the relevant indicators This may be the most time consuming part. As seen above, the HDI captures three dimen- sions \u2013 a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. Indicators for each of the dimensions can be seen in Table 1.1. Step 2. Convert dimension indicator(s) into unit free values to facilitate aggre- gation through construction of dimen- sion indices The indicators used are measured in differ- ent units. For example, life expectancy at birth is in number of years, the literacy rate and enrolment are in percentages, and GDP per capita is in US Dollars. They cannot be Table 1.1: Three dimensions of the HDI, indicators and corresponding goalposts Dimension Indicator Maximum value Minimum value A long and healthy life Life expectancy at birth 85 25 Knowledge Adult literacy rate (%)* Combined gross enrolment ratio in education (%) 100 100 0 0 A decent standard of living GDP per capita (PPP US$) 40,000 100 Note: (*)The goalpost for calculating adult literacy implies the maximum literacy rate is 100%. In practice, the HDI is calculated using an upper bound of 99%. Source: UNDP 2007. Human Development Indexing Exercise 3 added as they are. For aggregation they have to \ufb01rst be made comparable. In order to do this we \ufb01rst calculate separate, scale free sub indices for each dimension. This can be done in different ways. The HDI uses the method called \u2018division by own range\u2019, the range be- ing the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the respective indi- cators.3 The maximum and minimum values are called the goalposts of the indicators. Identify goalposts for each indicator. This means the maximum and minimum value for each indicator. Theoretically life expec- tancy, literacy and enrolment as well as in- comes can be zero at a minimum. But to be more meaningful, minimums are taken to be lowest values observed historically by go- ing back 30 years. Regarding the maximum values, theoretically income could be in\ufb01nite \u2013 leading to a division by in\ufb01nity. For life ex- pectancy it is not immediately clear what the maximum should be. Of course for literacy and enrolment 100 percent makes sense as the maxima. For the HDI maximum values are those that can be envisioned in the next thirty years. For example, when looking at GDP, economic growth rates can indicate that maximum income that richest countries are likely to achieve by 2020 is US$ 40,000 (in 1990 US$ PPP). Calculate dimension indices. These are calcu- lated using the formula: Dimension Index = actual value \u2013 minimum value maximum value \u2013 minimum value Each difference in indicator value from its minimum is divided by its range (max - min), using \ufb01xed values or goal posts in order to get unit free numbers. The value of dimen- sion indices vary between 0 and 1. Dimension 1: Long and healthy life The indicator used to measure this dimen- sion is the life expectancy at birth.

First, to determine each component index by simply calculating the index for the each of the two component indicators. The second step involves aggre- gating the individual component indices into the Education Index by giving appro- priate weights. In this case adult literacy is considered more important and given a 3 One could also divide by the mean values of the dimension indicators. Cracking the HDI 4 higher weight of two-thirds and enrolment a weight of one-third.4 Thus, combining the adult literacy index (with two-thirds weight) and combined gross enrolment index (with one third weight) gives us the Education In- dex for this dimension. Education = 2/3 + 1/3 Index (Adult (Gross literacy enrolment index) index) Dimension 3: A decent standard of living The standard of living is measured by using GDP per capita (PPP US$). Per capita income is the total value of the \ufb01nal goods and ser- vices produced by a country in a given pe- riod of time and divided by the population at mid-year. In order to maintain global com- parisons the measurement is made in US$ with purchasing power parity (PPP) \u2013 i.e., a measure that equalises the purchasing pow- er of different currencies by converting all to a common currency. The GDP per capita index is calculated using the same dimension index formula. However there is one difference here. The logarithm of income is used in the formula instead of the actual income \ufb01gure. The reason for this is that income needs to be discounted since unlimited income is not required to achieve a respectable level of human development. Moreover, income is subject to diminishing marginal utility. Until 1999, income above a cut-off point (world average per capita income) used to be drastically discounted. From 1999, however, a more gradual dis- counting is done throughout by using the logarithm of income. Step 3. Final aggregation of the scale free dimension indices to obtain the HDI Finally the HDI is calculated by calculating the simple average of the three dimension indices i.e. adding the three indices and div- ing by three. VI. In sum The methodology explained in this exer- cise is the standard one used in the global HDRs. However, each country may come up with their customized indices using the simple principles of indexing explained here - i.e. identi\ufb01cation of appropriate indicators, identi\ufb01cation of corresponding goalposts or average values, calculation of dimension indices to make the indicators unit free and \ufb01nally combining them, either by assigning equal or different weights. The global HDI assigns equal weights to each dimension and hence it is a simple average of the three dimension indices. 4 One can, of course, choose other weights. Ultimately the decision on relative weights is a subjective one. Human Development Indexing Exercise 5 Section two Human development indexing exercise Name: ______________ Country: ______________ I. Instructions The exercise consists of (i) calculating the HDI for three imaginary countries (Masala- bad, Guinea Town and Messifeng); (ii) rank- ing the countries according to the HDI value obtained; and (iii) based on the HDI index, indicating whether these countries would be among the high, medium, low human development countries. To facilitate your calculations, indicators for demography, income, education, health and environment are provided for each country at the end of this exercise. Moreover, the maxi- mum and minimum value for certain com- mon indicators are given in Table 2.1 below. To make the exercise even simpler, here is the log of some numbers. You will need to refer to this table (Table 2.2) for the calcula- tion of the HDI. To assist you even further, here\u2019s the formula for dimension index (the indicator for which you are interested to calculate an index): Dimension = actual \u2013 minimum Index value value maximum \u2013 minimum value value Table 2.1: Goalposts for common indicators Indicator Maximum value Minimum value Life expectancy at birth (years) 85 25 Adult literacy rate (%)* 100 0 Combined gross enrolment ratio (%) 100 0 GDP per capita (PPP US$) 40,000 100 Note: (*)The goalpost for calculating adult literacy implies the maximum literacy rate is 100%. In practice, the HDI is calculated using an upper bound of 99%.

In contrast to these regional giants, the region also holds 14 least Developed Countries (lDCs) (account- ing for almost 40 per cent of the global population in lDCs), of which five are landlocked countries and several are small island developing states including the Maldives and pacific Island countries. In addition, there are countries recovering from decades of prolonged con- flict, like Afghanistan, Nepal, sri lanka and timor leste; some in low levels of conflict such as pakistan, that are encountering the twin challenges of rebuilding their economies and polities. still others are undergoing political transition from monarchies to constitutional re- gimes like in Bhutan and tonga. Indonesia and the philippines are recent entrants to middle income status and some like thailand and Malaysia are dealing with the challenges of trying to move beyond middle income status. prior to the global economic crisis the region had been making strong gains. Aggregate trends in social and economic indicators are impressive. the Asia pacific region as a whole has had remarkable success in reducing poverty. In 1990, almost half the region\u2019s people lived in extreme poverty, but the proportion is now down to one quarter. Nonetheless, the region is still home to 60 per cent of the world\u2019s poor. the Asia pacific is the fastest growing region in the world, sustaining an annual average growth rate of 7.4 per cent from 2000 to 2009 in east Asia and 5.9 per cent in south Asia. the Asia-pacific region weathered the global food, fuel and financial crises better than other parts of the world, and indeed was an early achiever in the recovery stakes. Asia is one of the few regions which managed to grow despite the most serious global crisis since the Great Depression. Regional economies have been affected but less so than other developed and developing regions. the recovery in the region is also currently seen to be faster and more pronounced than elsewhere. Nonetheless, impacts are still significant. the crises ap- pear to have affected the Asia pacific developing countries through two main channels. the first \u2013 a financial shock with the collapse of equity markets, depreciation of local currencies, limited international credit availability and increase in the cost of credit. the second \u2013 a real economic shock stemming from declining demand for exports, tourism and migrant workers. employment losses have been more severe than GDp losses largely because the worst affected productive sectors have been those that are export-oriented and more labour intensive. As employment declined sharply in these export-oriented sectors it cre- ated negative multiplier effects across other sectors. the effects on social sectors and on human development conditions have been marked and it is estimated in the joint esCAp/ ADB/uNDp Asia pacific Regional MDG report 2009/10 that in 2009, the crisis trapped up to an additional 17 million people in extreme poverty. this number is expected to rise to 21 million in 2010. 4 uNDp ReGIoNAl BuReAu foR AsIA AND the pACIfIC the region as a whole is an early achiever for a number of Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators: reducing gender disparities in primary and tertiary education; stopping the spread of hIV and AIDs and tB; and halving the proportion of people with access to safe drinking water. the region is also on track to achieve three other MDG targets: halving the proportion of people living below the us$ 1.25 per day poverty line; gender parity in second- ary education and ensuring universal access of children to primary school. however, progress remains slow in many other areas. the region is lagging in reducing hun- ger, ensuring that children complete a full course of primary education, reducing mortality of infants and children up to 5-years old, ensuring access to clean water in urban areas and basic sanitation everywhere. Moreover, these regional aggregates mask considerable varia- tions between sub-regions and countries. In particular, the region\u2019s 14 lDCs have made slow or no progress on most of the indicators, and several pacific Islands countries are regressing or making no progress on a number of indicators.

Within countries, disparities have increased, largely because of low employment intensity of growth and lack of emphasis on rural development. In this context, as Asia strives to return to a high growth path, it must find ways to get back to more inclusive growth to accelerate poverty reduction. the current as well as previous economic crises coupled with regular natural disasters has highlighted the importance of effective social protection to cushion the impact of adverse economic developments. however, the coverage of basic social protection programs is very low in Asia and the pacific. for the region as a whole, only 30 per cent of the elderly receive pensions, only 20 per cent of the unemployed and underemployed have access to labour market programs and only 20 per cent of the population has access to health care assistance. In many countries, the main social safety net is via product subsidies (e.g. on fuel and rice), which is often fragmented and not targeted. Asia can therefore make some headway by consolidating multiple schemes into more coherent programs. there is also sig- nificant scope to move from product subsidies to more targeted and equitable cash transfer schemes. Clearly Asian and pacific economies need to look for home-grown solutions that build on local conditions and on traditions such as self reliance and family orientation. the 2010 Asia pacific Regional human Development Report on Gender highlighted that despite the region\u2019s many economic gains, in many instances women across the region continue to be held back and disadvantaged. the Asia pacific region has made progress in addressing gender equality in life expectancy, school enrolment and labour force participation, with the most rapid gains occurring in east Asia and the pacific. In south Asia, by contrast, large gender gaps remain in basic areas such as education, health, nutrition and employment opportuni- ties. some stark numbers highlight the enormity of the challenge. south Asia has the highest prevalence of malnutrition rates in the world in 2007. More than 41 per cent of children were underweight compared to less than 27 per cent in sub-saharan Africa. More women die in childbirth in south Asia (500 per 100,000 live births) than in any other part of the world except sub-saharan Africa. this ratio is more than 3 times higher than in east Asia and the pacific. Nearly half the countries in south Asia and more than 60 per cent of the countries in the pacific do not have laws on domestic violence. east Asia has made more progress on enacting such legislation. uNDp Administrator Miss helen Clark launches the 2010 Regional human Development Report on Power, Voice and Rights: A Turning Point for Gender Equality in Asia and the Pacific on March 8, 2010, International Women\u2019s Day, in New Delhi, India. left to right: Mr. Ajay Chhibber, uNDp Regional", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45805734-e522-4538-8f5b-3f83acaf4c9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "45805734-e522-4538-8f5b-3f83acaf4c9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "RBAP 2009 Results Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6e0ade3bab20bcc39060e3bed4eb8c0d62304e9244cb504db7d4a48d72c0ba6"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3f23171-f8a1-43ed-8ff9-95929808a31e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d717c5edf72155f32e2266c682bc3618a38028767a95236d249b38feb7a62c7"}}, "hash": "104e8879dfefe28ecb75efd964f4fe66a24e3d686d08020bae915a1a5a30cb10", "text": "Director for Asia-pacific;

Afghanistan is also uNDp\u2019s largest program overall. other significant programs include China (us$ 73 million), Bangladesh (us$ 72 million), Indonesia (us$ 64 million), Nepal (us$ 37 million), Myanmar (us$ 34 million), India (us$ 34 million) and pakistan (us$ 31 mil- lion). following the executive Board decision in January 2009, uNDp resumed work in the Democratic people\u2019s Republic of Korea (DpRK).

Strengthened UNDAFs: An unprecedented number of new uN Development Assistance frameworks (uNDAfs) will be developed in the Asia pacific region between 2009 and 2013, nineteen of them between 2009 and 2011. uNDAf\u2019s provide a single coherent over- arching strategy which identifies the ways in which all uN agencies will respond to the respective government\u2019s development agenda. this is a significant opportunity and uN country teams have been encouraged to make a step change in the relevance and quality of this next generation of uNDAfs.

In order to support this \u2018step change\u2019, in 2009, the uN Development Group Asia pacific, chaired by the uNDp Regional Director and comprising other uN agencies working in the region, provided strategic guidance for uN country teams preparing uNDAfs, supported by a regional quality assurance mechanism, again led by uNDp, which provided technical support to country teams in the uNDAf process. More strategic country programs: In its own country programs, uNDp is moving to improve the quality of assistance through streamlining the number of activities, scal- ing upwards the size of programs, and positioning assistance to support governments through the provision of appropriate and timely policy advice while recognizing the need to ensure policy assistance is also supported by program interventions. the ability to demonstrate and communicate results is key and a significant investment was made in 2009 to strengthen the capacity in this area within country offices. Stronger policy input: A high-level Advisory panel to guide uNDp\u2019s strategy and priori- ties in the Asia pacific region has been established and met for the first time in May 2010. A regional policy unit has been established in New York to enable greater responsiveness to addressing emerging regional issues. RBAp has identified three key regional policy pri- orities - gender, climate change and social protection \u2013 which will be the focus of major analytical work and be the subject of succeeding Regional human Development Reports. The Regional Human Development Report on gender was launched in New Delhi in March 2010 and will be supported by operational and advocacy guidance for uNDp country teams to take forward the key findings. Analysing the impacts of the global economic crisis and working with countries to address them is an ongoing task. uNDp\u2019s keynote 2009 publication titled Asia Rebounds but Lasting Recovery Needs a New Paradigm provides an analytical platform for taking this forward. 10 uNDp ReGIoNAl BuReAu foR AsIA AND the pACIfIC Streamlined and strengthened Regional Centre: A major review of the set up and operations of the Regional service Centres was undertaken in 2009. As a result, RBAp has embarked upon a major restructuring of the Asia pacific Regional Centre (ApRC) which will see co-location of all practice teams in Bangkok, establishment of a south Asia poverty unit in Colombo, and maintenance of the pacific Centre in fiji. It will lead to stronger practice and cross-practice engagement in support of country programs and greater integration with RBAp hQ. In 2010, the regional program will also be reviewed and aligned more closely to add value to key regional priorities. New partnerships: A number of new partnerships are evolving which will strengthen uNDp engagement with middle income countries in the region to support greater south- south cooperation. the following sections detail development outcomes in the Asia pacific to which uNDp has contributed in 2009. Many of the achievements have only been possible through con- sistent and sustained assistance from uNDp over several years; are generally only possible if done with government leadership; and are often delivered in partnership with other stakeholders and development partners. 11 Poverty Reduction and MDG Achievement the Asia-pacific region has an enviable record in socio-economic development in the last three decades. there are, however, four significant challenges. the first is the largest mass of income poverty in the world. over 900 million people \u2013 larger than the combined popu- lation of North America and Western europe - live in extreme poverty. the second is the persistence of hunger in the midst of high growth. the third deprivation relates to high unemployment and underemployment. finally, progress on MDGs is severely hampered by an alarming rise in inequality across the region. Many countries of the region have been striving to overcome this quartet of development challenges. until recently, the global economic and trade environment was viewed by most countries as supportive of poverty reduction, with outward oriented development policies yielding impressive results. however, the ongoing global economic crisis following the food and fuel price shocks, and growing climate change threats, has the potential to undo years of progress towards MDG attainment and poverty alleviation in many countries of Asia and the pacific. there is as yet little empirical data to track the impact of the global economic crisis on MDG progress in the region. however, employment declined sharply in export-oriented sec- tors, causing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c9725dd-5824-418a-b8f5-ed9e5f5b327a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c9725dd-5824-418a-b8f5-ed9e5f5b327a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "RBAP 2009 Results Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "716ff5997aa7200ce3d668fc4151399943b409cc0fbf87f8861416adb48ddad5"}, "3": {"node_id": "2886bb7a-4ade-4e06-9006-963bc70826bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0947c3d5e91867bcb45aee58b73a00110482ebfdbd9afe74453dd2b2f60172dc"}}, "hash": "98ddd35252c40fa3384d7178289b99e39988a2de804a1dab7a3a9acc35e820a7", "text": "negative effects across other sectors. the effects on social sectors and on human development conditions have been marked and it is estimated that in 2009, the crisis trapped up to an additional 17 million people in extreme poverty. uNDp, as part of its ongoing and long- term partnership with the uN economic and social Commission for Asia and the pacific (uNesCAp), and the Asian Devel- opment Bank (ADB), prepared the annual regional MDG report titled \u2018Achieving the Millennium Development Goals in an era of Global uncertainty\u2019. the previ- ous regional MDG report \u2018future Within Reach\u2019 depicted the pre-crisis confidence that the region was on the right path to achieve the MDGs. the current regional MDG report highlights the post-crisis scenario and the sense of urgency to move forward, and how fiscal stimuli and social protection mechanisms could be put into place to accelerate MDG progress and prevent reversals. launch of the Regional MDG Report on Achieving the Millennium De- velopment Goals in an Era of Global Uncertainty on 17 february, 2010, in Manila, the philippines. from left to right: Ms. Noeleen heyzer, uN esCAp executive secretary; Ms. ursula shaefer-preuss, Vice president of ADB for Knowledge Management and sustainable Development; Mr. Ajay Chhibber, uNDp Regional Director for Asia-pacific. photo: Rositsa todorova, uNDp 12 uNDp ReGIoNAl BuReAu foR AsIA AND the pACIfIC uNDp published a major analytical study in 2009 on the global financial crisis and the Asia pa- cific Region titled, Asia Rebounds but Lasting Recovery Needs a New Paradigm, based on evidence from 14 country case studies, and which was a significant contribution to understanding of the ongoing and potential impacts of the crisis at the regional and country level. It identified for policy makers specific country measures that can be undertaken to address stability, protect the vulnerable and contribute to a return to sustainable and rapid pro-poor growth. uNDp organized two regional and six national events to highlight the social impact of the global crisis with senior government officials and other stakeholders. uNDp and other partners supported the Government of Vanuatu to convene a pacific Conference on the human devel- opment dimensions of the global economic crisis in february 2010. policy makers, civil society organizations and the private sector from 16 pacific countries along with regional organizations, development partners and uN agencies reviewed how the crisis was affecting pacific countries at macro and community level and government responses across the region. the Conference raised awareness of the need to protect vulnerable groups and development gains. Additional sub-regional conferences will be supported by uNDp in south Asia and east Asia in 2010. the various reports and conferences had a significant impact and provided a strong ratio- nale for governments and policy makers to: \u2022\ufffd protect\ufffdsocial\ufffdsector\ufffdresources \u2022\ufffd re-evaluate\ufffdexisting\ufffdsocial\ufffdprotection\ufffdprograms\ufffdor\ufffdinitiate\ufffdnew\ufffdones,\ufffdbetter\ufffdtarget- ing the vulnerable \u2022\ufffd improve\ufffdthe\ufffdlegal\ufffdand\ufffdregulatory\ufffdenvironment\ufffdfor\ufffdthe\ufffdprivate\ufffdsector \u2022\ufffd focus\ufffdon\ufffdenhancing\ufffdresilience,\ufffdespecially\ufffdin\ufffdareas\ufffdsuch\ufffdas\ufffdfood\ufffdsecurity,\ufffdagricultural\ufffd production and productivity \u2022\ufffd re-orient\ufffdeconomies\ufffdto\ufffdlow\ufffdcarbon\ufffddevelopment\ufffdand\ufffdbuild\ufffdresilience\ufffdfor\ufffdthe\ufffdfuture \u2022\ufffd use\ufffdinformation\ufffdand\ufffdcommunications\ufffdtechnologies\ufffdto\ufffdtransform\ufffdthe\ufffddelivery\ufffdof\ufffd social services, improving accessibility and reducing long term costs. In the face of the economic crisis, uNDp worked with countries to monitor and ameliorate the human development impacts of the crisis, and in particular maintained a strong focus on assisting the vulnerable and those living in extreme poverty. one of the key challenges emerging from the crisis is the relatively weak social protection systems in place in Asia and the pacific. the economic crisis presents an opportunity to initiate or broaden social protection programs. efforts to support national initiatives for social protection will be a key focus for uNDp in the region going forward.

A mid-term evaluation of the program has found that it \u201cis one of the best examples of poverty alleviation programs in Bangladesh, with a very relevant strategy to pull deprived women out of poverty\u201d. India has 320 million people living under the poverty line. Introduced in 2006, the National Rural employment Guarantee scheme, the world\u2019s largest cash for work program, provides a guarantee of 100 days of employment each year to every rural household which demands it. the scheme, which is still in its early stages, has been successful in some important ways. uNDp India has been a key partner of the Government of India in the implementation of the job guarantee programme, which ensures 100 days employment a year to every rural household. uNDp India helps enhance the capabilities of government, locally-elected representatives, civil-society and communities for more accountable governance for all, especially the marginalised. photo: Jay Mandal/ uNDp India 2010 14 uNDp ReGIoNAl BuReAu foR AsIA AND the pACIfIC It now reaches all 615 rural districts, more than 44 million households have been provided with employment, and over 3.5 billion person days of employment have been generated. the enhanced wage earnings have led to a strengthening of the livelihood resource base of the rural poor in India, have reduced distress migration, and have become an extremely important buffer against both the employment shocks generated by the economic crisis (as migrant workers returned home to their villages) and against the drought that has swept across large parts of rural India in the summer of 2009. In 2009 the program had significantly high work participation of marginalised groups including scheduled Castes (30 per cent), scheduled tribes (22 per cent), and women (49 per cent). thus far, more than 3.7 million works have been undertaken (of which 2.3 million remain in progress), covering water con- servation, rural connectivity and land development. Nonetheless, there have been some constraints to the operation of the scheme and uNDp has partnered with the Government of India since 2006 to help improve the overall gover- nance, implementation and monitoring of the program. uNDp has provided technical sup- port for data analysis, strengthened management information systems, introduced innova- tions such as functional literacy classes for workers (5000 workers), financial literacy (3000 workers) and skill building and livelihood training (5000 workers), developed information kiosks and community radio programs to enhance the legal awareness of the rural poor to access the scheme; and supported improved access to wage payments. In Nepal, a major uNDp microfinance program helped create over 8000 new entrepreneurs (of which 68 per cent are women) and over 8000 new jobs. In 2009, the Government adopted uNDp\u2019s pilot micro enterprise development program as a national program, allocating ad- ditional funds and expanding to 18 districts. uNDp\u2019s human Development Initiative (hDI) in Myanmar has been operating since 1994, with the current phase commencing in 2003, providing humanitarian support directly to the rural poor through community based organizations targeting food security, the environment, primary health care, hIV/AIDs, training and education. the human Development Initiative provided assistance to almost 8,000 villages in 2009, covering almost 20 per cent of the townships across Myanmar, reaching more than three million people - about 6 per cent of the population. A wealth-ranking exercise in December 2009 indicated that 12 per cent of the hDI\u2019s beneficiary population - made up of the poorest people in the communities - moved up to a higher wealth category. In 2009, the microfinance program expanded its coverage to over 100,000 new clients, with clients now totaling almost half a million borrowers \u2013 97 per cent of them women. over half a million loans amounting to around us$ 47 million were disbursed in 2009 with a repayment rate of al- most 100 per cent.

In 2009, uNDp\u2019s support to profit-sharing arrangements that link farmers and scientists to address farm level problems, the technology task force (ttf) project, was formally made a national program by the Vice premier responsible for poverty Reduction. By 2009, through a network of 70,000 \u201cscientist practitioners\u201d some 1 million farmers benefited, with a resultant increase in annual incomes ranging from 9-26 per cent. the scheme, currently in 1,800 of China\u2019s 2,872 counties, will be expanded to 80 per cent of counties within 5 years, with the aim of providing ttf practitio- ners to all villages within 10 to 15 years. In Pakistan, uNDp\u2019s program to generate employment and increase income for garment work- ers particularly women has to date created over 6000 jobs for women who receive us$ 65 per month. the program provides skills development for workers, enabling the garment industry to adapt in a challenging global economy. the evaluation of the program in 2008 found that the intervention is in the right direction towards increased employment and income generation opportunities for the poor and reducing their vulnerability to economic and other shocks. In Nepal, uNDp programs ensured nearly 7000 households were linked to electricity created by 27 new mini-hydros and community infrastructure projects in conflict-affected districts benefitted 163,000 households. uNDp delivered training in financial literacy to over 1000 people in Vanuatu and Nauru in 2009, 60 percent of whom were women, which resulted in an increase in savings accounts opened and in actual savings of 2.3 million vatu. Cumulatively, nearly 44,000 mainly rural people in fiji, solomon Islands, tonga and Kiribati have received financial literacy training with training now institutionalised in 36 national organizations. In Bangladesh, uNDp has a strong focus on urban poverty reduction in 23 cities which saw over 900,000 poor, particularly women and children, benefit from improved physical infrastructure, security of tenure, apprenticeships and vocational training, education grants to boys and girls and health and nutrition initiatives. A further 7 million square kilometers of land was cleared of landmines in Cambodia, ex- panding economic opportunities by increasing the availability of land for agriculture. Supporting pro-poor policies uNDp continued its support to countries to strengthen MDG analysis across the region and implement pro-poor policies. In the face of the economic crisis and constraints on govern- ment revenues, countries in the region did well to protect spending on social sectors critical to achieving the MDGs.

Capacity building activities associated with uNDp\u2019s support have exposed local fiscal and tax administration officials to greater interaction with central government decision mak- ers and international practices.

In the Philippines, the hIV/AIDs epidemic is moving from \u2018low and slow\u2019 to \u2018hidden and growing\u2019 due to rapidly increasing infections amongst migrants and men who have sex with men. uNDp provided capacity building assistance to strengthen the leadership and insti- tutional capacities of national, regional, and local partners through increased knowledge, skills, and understanding of hIV and its emerging situation. policy support was provided for developing effective strategies for a sustained response to hIV/AIDs and strategic informa- tion to inform the formulation of the 5th AIDs Medium term plan. In Indonesia, uNDp supported the National AIDs Commission (NAC) to provide training to 33 provincial and 150 district/city AIDs commissions in order to strengthen their role as re- sponse coordinators at sub-national levels. uNDp also supported the institutional strength- ening of NAC, evidenced in a successful Global fund Round 8 proposal which will provide us$ 120 million over 5 years to support an effective and sustainable hIV/AIDs response. uNDp also supported the NAC at the national, provincial and district levels to strengthen the decentralized responses to hIV in three provinces. 19 2009 Results RepoRt A multi country study on the time use pattern of women in the context of hIV was completed in the Pacific region. It resulted in a set of substantial policy recommendations that were adopted for implementation of gender responsive hIV programs by Ministers of health for pacific Island Countries. A joint uNDp and uNAIDs publication on Enabling Effective Responses to HIV in Pacific Island Countries provided drafting instructions for human rights-based legislative reform. In the Maldives, uNDp contributed to enhanced hIV prevention knowledge and services to the target groups through the launch of the first mass media campaign on hIV. Drawing on lessons learned in other countries, facilitated by uNDp, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs addressed hIV issues for the first time during friday prayers. In India, uNDp supported the first study on levels of hIV related stigma to inform policies and programs. uNDp also supported the National AIDs Control organisation (NACo) to develop a gender and hIV policy. uNDp is supporting NACo to address gender equality in the roll out of the policy on Greater Involvement of people living with hIV. uNDp in partnership with uNAIDs and ADB developed a model regional tool to help countries estimate short, medium and long-term resources needed for comprehensive hIV responses has significantly broadened the approach of costing beyond the health sector only. It has been used in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Mongolia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka. uNDp supported large-scale studies to assess the socio-economic impact of hIV on people living with hIV and their households in China (in five provinces), Indonesia (seven prov- inces) and Cambodia (nationwide).

Women are playing a growing role in building democracy, especially at the grass roots, but their influence over decision making at the sub-national and national levels remains severely limited. the number of women in parlia- ments in the Asia pacific averages 18 per cent in east Asia and 20 per cent in south Asia in 2008. A number of elections in the region in 2009 saw women make important gains in representation. Key results to which UNDP contributed Indonesia conducted successful elections in 2009, with a voter turn-out of 72.56 per cent for the presidential elections and 70.96 per cent for legislative elections. the elections resulted in an increase in women\u2019s representation in the national parliament from 12 to 18 per cent. uNDp support focused on the voter education campaign which reached 34 million tV view- ers, 6 million radio listeners and 3.6 million people accessing the print media. Civil society organizations delivered voter education messages to 2 million women, first time voters and marginal groups and communities in remote areas. Building on successful 2008 national elections, the Bangladesh electoral Commission (BeC) managed successful upazila elections, the first held for 18 years, with a voter turn our of 70 per cent. With uNDp support, the electoral roll was updated with 4.6 million additional persons, and practical efforts were made to ensure women and other marginalized groups became registered voters. through voter ID cards, many people were provided for the first time with a formal identity document. eight national electoral acts were revised in the lead-up to the elections, continuing the reform program initiated in 2007, enabling more effective electoral management. public confidence in the BeC is high with a reputation for independence and transparency. uNDp facilitated visits to the BeC by officials from Republic of Korea, Nepal and Bhutan to learn from Bangladesh\u2019s experiences. the continuous updating of Bangladesh\u2019s state-of-the-art voter list is bringing democratic reform closer to the people, and securing past wins for the future. photo: uNDp Bangladesh 22 uNDp ReGIoNAl BuReAu foR AsIA AND the pACIfIC Village elections were also held in Timor Leste, supported by civic and voter education pro- grams resulting in a voter turn-out of 68 per cent of the population and with women winning 27 per cent of 24,000 village level elected positions. Reflecting successful capacity building efforts, uNDp provided scaled down assistance in 2009, focused on policy and strategic advice compared to 2007 when its support also encompassed major logistical assistance. the Timor Leste parliament passed a resolution on Gender Responsive Budgeting and the Government drafted a Gender equality law and issued a Gender and Culture statement that accompanied the 2010 National Budget statement. these high level policy successes were led by the Women\u2019s parliamentary caucus which is supported by uNDp and uNIfeM. Bangladesh\u2019s parliament was supported by uNDp with an induction and training program for newly elected parliamentarians. In Bhutan, the transition to democracy was supported by uNDp through training for Mps and secretariat staff on streamlining legislative processes, strengthening the work of parlia- mentary committees and engaging with the media. In Pakistan, uNDp assisted with the formation of the Women\u2019s parliamentary Caucus, launched under the leadership of the speaker of the National Assembly, and providing a forum for inter-party and bicameral policy development for gender equality and advocacy. some 10,000 potential women leaders at the village level were trained in public policy dis- course to participate in and potentially contest the 2010 local government elections. In Fiji uNDp finalized the national civic education curriculum in consultation with civil so- ciety partners, followed by a training of trainers. this work has enabled the delivery of civic education to 13 per cent of the adult population in fiji.

In Solomon Islands, uNDp supported provincial governments to improve their financial management systems, with the result that for the first time in many years they have been able to provide adequate data for an effective audit process. In Vietnam, participatory and pro-poor planning and budgeting processes have been piloted and institutionalised in six provinces with uNDp support. uNDp also supported a series of policy research papers on public administration which helped generate policy debates and discussions amongst stakeholders. India institutionalised gender budgeting, informed by a small pilot on gender budgeting implemented by uNDp. Cambodia has developed a 10 year national program for sub-national democratic devel- opment. following the adoption of this organic law, uNDp is providing broad capacity development support, which in 2009 saw all newly elected district and provincial councilers and their staff at provincial and district level trained in their new roles and responsibilities. uNDp supported national systems and structures to deliver us$ 82 million in investments to reduce poverty, improve health and education and deliver extension services. Papua New Guinea launched its national Anti-Corruption strategy (NACs) in December 2009, which uNDp supported through the provision of technical assistance. uNDp\u2019s partnership with the Sri Lankan Commission to investigate allegations of bribery and corruption (CIABoC) supported a major corruption awareness campaign which saw the number of complaints received increase by 17 per cent compared to 2008. the Commission received a 24 per cent increase in its budget compared to 2008. Strengthening civic participation and public dialogue parallel to work on strengthening the public sector uNDp is working to strengthen civic en- gagement, access to information and ensuring the voices of marginalized groups are heard. In 2009, uNDp embarked on a range of initiatives that aim to strengthen participation and voices of civil society groups, including those of indigenous people, through assessments, policy dialogues and improved communication mechanisms. 29 2009 Results RepoRt Key results to which UNDP contributed In Lao PDR, uNDp piloted a community radio initiative which resulted in significant health and education improvements and provided lessons for community radio replication in the 47 poorest districts. In Nepal, uNDp has trained indigenous people\u2019s organizations to assess information and communication needs and engage with policy makers, resulting in an action plan for an improved media sector with more inclusion of marginalized voices. In Cambodia, through \u2018equity Weekly\u2019 \u2013 a current affairs tV program implemented jointly with the Ministry of Information \u2013 uNDp has brought citizens voices to the public domain to raise issues important to civil society with public officials, members of parliament and the senate, experts and other citizens.

An additional 212 women were recruited into the police force, bringing the total number of female police officers to 699. to date, 700 illegal armed groups have been disbanded and close to 50,000 illegal weapons collected. A key event in 2009 was the holding of presidential and provincial Council elections, for the first time managed by the Independent election Com- Afghanistan: Afghanistan: Contributing to Human Security and Development 31 mission of Afghanistan, the result of assis- tance by uNDp over several years to build its capacity. While there were some issues with the electoral process, including allegations of fraud which were investigated, uNDp\u2019s support for the elections was an important and necessary contribution. the need to ensure better delivery of services is fundamental for stability and to demon- strate a peace dividend to the people of Af- ghanistan. As part of this effort, Afghanistan\u2019s first sub-national governance policy has been formulated with uNDp support. this policy, based on the collaborative work of 23 government institutions, will be the engine of Afghanistan\u2019s sub\u2013national public Admin- istrative Reform process. uNDp also contin- ued major efforts to build the capacity of the civil service, delivering leadership training for 800 senior officials and financial, office, procurement and project management skills to 650 mid-to senior level officials. ongoing mentoring support continued to be provided by Indian civil servants. Work also continued to implement over 1,100 small infrastructure projects prioritized by the local communities. these helped fill immediate gaps in physical infrastructure to promote agricultural pro- ductivity and rural livelihoods. Between 2006 and 2009, 185 work days were generated for each of the 184,226 laborers who benefited under this initiative. As uNDp moves forward in Afghanistan there is a need to maintain a tight strategic focus to the program (in line with the new Board approved Country programme Document 2010-2013), look comprehensively at peace-building and conflict analysis to inform programs, focus on secure provinces with a view to demonstrat- ing a development dividend, and coordinate closely with other key development partners. the overall security environment may impact on uNDp\u2019s ability to undertake development programs and contribute to outcomes and will need to be monitored closely.

Key results to which UNDP contributed In May 2009, the cessation of a three decades long civil war in Sri Lanka also brought with it the internal displacement of 300,000 people, the need for re-integration of ex-combatants and the need to address recovery in the conflict-affected north. By the end of 2009, just over half of the internally displaced people (IDps) had been able to return to their district of origin. uNDp worked with the government to provide legal identification documentation to over 29,000 people who had lost their documents to facilitate freedom of movement and access to basic services. uNDp scaled up mine action activities \u2013 including human resources support to the Government on the uNDp-supported project improves high- land crops cultivation aimed at maximizing productivity of the alternative livelihoods sector in resettlements in Ampara District in sri lanka.

A national plan for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants has been developed and was with the sri lankan Cabinet by the end of the year. uNDp also led the development of an early Recovery plan for eastern province, a site of major conflict in earlier years, particularly supporting local government capacity, a critical stepping stone to a lasting resolution to the conflict. In Nepal, a key benchmark that has been worked on over two years, was the signing in December 2009 of an Action plan by the relevant parties, enabling the discharge and rehabilitation of 4008 disqualified Maoist army personnel. uNDp also assisted the Constituent Assembly in the drafting of a new Constitution including through supporting a wide ranging consulta- tion process involving civil society outreach to 125,000 people through democratic dialogues across the country, garnering 2000 submis- sions. A Centre for Constitutional Dialogue has provided an additional venue for over 25,000 people to be informed of the process. uNDp supported the formation of a Constitutional Assembly Women Caucus which has become a cross-party platform to promote women\u2019s rights in the constitution building process. In Timor Leste, more than 70,000 people were successfully returned and reintegrated into their communities and all 65 camps were closed. uNDp contributed to this national effort in promoting the reintegration of IDps by supporting the Government to organize 688 mediations and 38 community dialogues to ensure sustainable reintegration. As part of this process, uNDp supported 10 NGos to facilitate the return of IDps in 9 districts. Pakistan\u2019s crisis in the North West frontier province and the federally Administered tribal Areas (NWfp/fAtA), triggered by the intensification of an extremist insurgency in the north- west and an extensive military operation in response to it, saw the internal displacement of over 2 million pakistanis and significant damage to private and public property and people\u2019s livelihoods. uNDp focused strongly on early recovery measures by supporting the provincial Relief, Rehabilitation and settlement Authority (paRRsA) at the provincial and district level to strengthen its coordination and assessment functions and to assist the departments in preparing the foundations for recovery. uNDp also worked closely with the government and other uN agencies on the Conflict early Recovery Initial Needs Assessment and provided cash grants and toolkits to 71,000 IDps and training and cash for work for another 20,000.

Natural Disasters the Asia pacific region confronts over 70 percent of the world\u2019s natural disasters in any given year (in terms of people affected). the human de- velopment impact of such disasters in terms of dislocations, loss of lives and property damage is very severe. Disasters threaten aspirations and hamper the achievement of the Millennium De- velopment Goals. Bangladesh and Bhutan were hit by Cyclone Aila in May. In september and october, eight countries across the region (from samoa to India) were struck by a series of disasters \u2013 tsunami, earthquake, typhoons, flooding - with a resulting loss of life of over 3000 people and destruction of livelihoods and increased vulner- ability. Damage to infrastructure was estimated at over us$ 17 billion. uNDp was instrumental in each of these countries in assessment of damages and loss, early recovery planning, coordination and delivery of recovery assistance. Key results to which UNDP contributed uNDp\u2019s leadership in ensuring that early recovery approaches are addressed as rapidly as possible following a disaster has yielded positive impact in Myanmar in the ongoing response to Cyclone Nargis, which affected the livelihoods of 2.4 million people in 2008 and left an estimated 138, 370 dead or missing. A recent Impact study of uNDp\u2019s early recovery program one year on found that: 71 per cent of households considered their lives had been \u2018noticeably improved\u2019; for more than 50 per cent of recipients the agri- cultural inputs provided had \u2018made a difference\u2019; more than 60 per cent of those engaged in the fishing industry (which was completely destroyed) have fully recovered their liveli- hoods; and more than 75,000 households were able to restart agriculture, fishing or trad- ing activities by accessing microfinance loans.

Key results to which UNDP contributed As a result of uNDp\u2019s support in institutionalizing end to end tsunami early Warning systems in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Thailand and India countries were better equipped to issue alerts than they were four years ago. Indonesia was able to issue a warning within 5 minutes of detection of a major earthquake in september. the program has helped develop Indian ocean wide standard operating procedure for early warning systems and supported the participation of 18 countries and coastal communities in the drill in 2009. A major pub- lication on the titled Tsunami: Innovations, Breakthroughs and Change, was launched at an event at the uN in New York and brought together key lessons learned from the response operation for application in future disasters. uNDp\u2019s ongoing collaboration with Sri Lanka\u2019s Disaster Management Centre (DMC) resulted in the revision of the Disaster Management Act and the development of a corporate plan for the DMC (2009-2013), bringing disaster management to the forefront of the national development agenda.

Meeting rising energy needs while at the same time reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a major chal- lenge for the region. Climate change is a growing area of uNDp engagement in the Asia pacific. uNDp assists countries in directly reducing carbon emissions through the promo- tion of renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transport programs, including piloting technologies that can be scaled up for wider application and thus transform energy policies and markets. uNDp plays a key role in supporting many countries develop further their national frameworks and programs for an effective response to climate change. the uNDp-Gef partnership in the Asia pacific covers 21 climate change mitigation projects at the implementation stage in 11 countries worth us$ 493 million (20 per cent Gef and 80 per cent other co-financing). Collectively, the portfolio brought about a total of 16.26 million tonnes of Co2 emissions avoidance in 2009, bringing the cumulative total over the last five years to a reduction of 51.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. Key results to which UNDP contributed In Malaysia, the Building Integrated photovoltaic (BIpV) technology Application project has been making strong progress since 2005 in mitigating climate change, reducing carbon emissions by 1703 tonnes, including 937 tonnes (55 per cent) reduced in 2009 alone. pho- tovoltaic technology converts solar radiation into direct current electricity. the project has helped reduce green house gas emissions from the power sector but more importantly has helped reduce the long term cost of photovoltaic technology. the project has transformed the local photovoltaic market, contributing to energy security and offsetting a significant percentage of conventional peak energy requirements. Moreover, since its inception, it has reduced by 19 per cent the cost of building integrated photovoltaic systems, with further reductions expected. the project has also contributed to the formulation of a national green technology policy which consists of national renewable energy action plan and the application of the feed-in tariffs (fIt) mechanisms for on-grid BIpV systems, an offshoot scheme which provides financial incentives for homeowners to install photovoltaic tech- nology in their homes. In India, a successful pilot to generate power from coal bed methane is now being replicated in 200 additional sites. Methane, a greenhouse gas, is considered to be 21 times more harm- ful than carbon dioxide. Methane is absorbed in coal seams and the surrounding strata and 40 uNDp ReGIoNAl BuReAu foR AsIA AND the pACIfIC released during coal mining. however, when recovered from the coal beds, methane can be used as a source of energy as it is a remarkably clean fuel. through the uNDp/Gef/Govern- ment of India project, methane was extracted from two well known coal mines in Dhanbad and power generated at a competitive price. taking into account both the recovered gas and the utilisation of the captured methane, the annual carbon dioxide reduction from just two mines, was an estimated 180,000 tonnes. the electricity generated supplied 400 house- holds, providing them with power for the first time. Coal based methane can potentially account for seven per cent of the installed capacity for electricity generation in India. A uNDp India- supported innovation that demonstrates the commercial feasibility of recover- ing and utilizing methane gas released during the process of coal-mining has been scaled up by the Government of India. photo: Beno\u00eet Marquet / uNDp India Given the vulnerability of the Pacific Island region to climate change (half of the 8 million population of the pacific live within 1.5 km of the shoreline which is at risk of coastal deple- tion from sea-level rise), this is a special area of focus.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf560103-07dd-4ba9-9610-f7f32447e0bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf560103-07dd-4ba9-9610-f7f32447e0bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "RBAP 2009 Results Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7ae8d9441445f435d03ab5a78431ffe2514768e87ce1f7b8cffadff44b8eb76"}, "2": {"node_id": "d198d886-20ef-4edc-994b-75e098c9fd09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d06bb077eb95e028b02a7a73d220617594d55d462cf526494246e17ba8c5e09"}}, "hash": "505289d6760b44167ac905d0991074cf1ebd171afaee729cafc91973eae5d505", "text": "\u2022\ufffd In\ufffdthe\ufffdlead-up\ufffdto\ufffdthe\ufffdDecember\ufffd2009\ufffdCopenhagen\ufffdCOP\ufffd15\ufffdmeeting,\ufffdUNDP\ufffdand\ufffd south pacific Regional environment programme (spRep) provided joint support to the pacific Island Countries (pICs) resulting in the development of a pacific position paper which facilitated the effective participation of pIC negotiators, and substantive support as well as logistical and media support throughout the conference resulting in high publicity to the pICs. \u2022\ufffd Over\ufffdthe\ufffdlast\ufffd5\ufffdyears,\ufffdfunding\ufffdof\ufffdmore\ufffdthan\ufffdUS$\ufffd90\ufffdmillion\ufffdhas\ufffdbeen\ufffdleveraged\ufffd by uNDp for the pacific to support the design and implementation of adapta- tion initiatives at the national level. this is complemented by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25766b1d-b6b7-4e04-a122-d2c27eddf8a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "25766b1d-b6b7-4e04-a122-d2c27eddf8a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "RBAP 2009 Results Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7de8366785f26972e86d64c1fac9d4a2221afcd6af035d37f3aa91daea4b80c3"}, "3": {"node_id": "691bea9b-433c-4269-b1e2-22ad8d47c12e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c0ff581f6b06c1bc2d9feb279ee21afb2d9d10d86827eea3e2abd910a731bd0"}}, "hash": "b0068204cfaf43de9e693b2ccc2f8a8ea470c99466107d0651f0bc475e3c24a2", "text": "community level adaptation initiatives. 41 2009 Results RepoRt \u2022\ufffd In\ufffdline\ufffdwith\ufffdParis\ufffdprinciples,\ufffdUNDP\ufffdand\ufffdthe\ufffdAsian\ufffdDevelopment\ufffdBank\ufffd(ADB)\ufffd were instrumental in the establishment of the pacific Development partners in Climate Change involving the pacific regional organizations, donors and civil society organization to work together as a knowledge sharing and partnership mobilization forum. Indonesia undertook a greenhouse gas inventory as well as an assessment of vulnerability and climate change adaptation and developed an action plan to address climate change, including setting up the National Council for Climate Change (NCCC). uNDp provided sup- port for data collection and facilitation of national dialogues for this process and for the development of the NCCC work plan on mitigation and adaptation. uNDp has assisted 32 of China\u2019s provinces and regions respond to climate change. By the end of 2009, a total of 17 provincial/regional governments in China had endorsed and pro- mulgated provincial climate change programs, 13 had established climate change divisions within their focus on supporting low carbon growth strategies and the requisite capacities to plan and manage them. In Cambodia climate change has been systematically integrated into the revised national strategic development plan and baseline analytical work, supported by uNDp, has been completed to inform the development of a national climate change strategy in 2010. In Niue, with uNDp support, fossil fuel energy consumption has reduced by 40 per cent through the use of energy efficient light bulbs and increased use of solar household units. uNDp also provided policy and advisory support for the design and implementation of renewable energy projects in palau, Republic of Marshall Islands and fiji. Biodiversity Conservation Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation is accelerated by climate change. In 2009, uN- Dp-Gef supported 29 biodiversity conservation projects in 16 countries, with total financ- ing of us$ 280 million (33 per cent Gef and 66 per cent co-financing). In 2009, the projects supported the establishment of 15 new protected areas totaling 2,347,889 hectares, adding to the ongoing program work in an existing 22 protected areas covering a total area of 4,114,127 hectares. the projects helped mainstream biodiversity in production landscapes/ seascape, develop the sustainability of protected areas and safeguard biodiversity. 42 uNDp ReGIoNAl BuReAu foR AsIA AND the pACIfIC Key results to which UNDP contributed In Cambodia, the landscape Conservation project (CAlM) in the Northern plains influenced a wide range of sectoral policies relating to forestry, agriculture, tourism and infrastructure development. In 2009, the project focused its work on improving national and provincial capacity to demarcate the permanent forest estate to serve as a model for similar initiatives. With demarcation, the project was able to reduce land grabbing and speculation within demarcated sites. Changes in institutional arrangements reduced ad hoc clearance of land for agriculture and for other purposes. the adoption of an innovative and highly replicable approach to improve household incomes through the cultivation of conservation-friendly \u201cIbis rice\u201d enabled families to increase incomes through the sale of such rice at a premium thus reducing the pressure to convert wetlands into rice fields. the project is now devel- oping a Reducing emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (ReDD) project to provide long-term financial support for the Northern plains landscape. In China, the Coastal Biodiversity project in the south China sea was, by working with lo- cal fishery regulations, able to halt illegal fishing and implement rescue operations to save and release of endangered species caught in fishermen\u2019s nets in the waters between the provinces of fujian and Guangdon. the project supported the development of policies and regulations, such as zonation and joint fishery administration, to ensure biodiversity conservation. the project has instituted user fees and part of the collections is allocated for marine biodiversity conservation. uNDp supported Mongolia to undertake a review of its environmental legislation, institu- tions and commitments as a prelude to a 4 year environmental law reform plan. In Pakistan, with uNDp support environmental education has been formally included as part of the National education policy 2009 and a national curriculum for environmental education at school and college level has been adopted. uNDp\u2019s partnership with the Sri Lankan Ministry of the environment resulted in the devel- opment of an environment sector road map which fed into the development of the Govern- ment\u2019s \u201cGreen sri lanka\u201d policy launched in mid 2009 which identifies 10 key priority areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "691bea9b-433c-4269-b1e2-22ad8d47c12e": {"__data__": {"id_": "691bea9b-433c-4269-b1e2-22ad8d47c12e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "RBAP 2009 Results Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7de8366785f26972e86d64c1fac9d4a2221afcd6af035d37f3aa91daea4b80c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "25766b1d-b6b7-4e04-a122-d2c27eddf8a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0068204cfaf43de9e693b2ccc2f8a8ea470c99466107d0651f0bc475e3c24a2"}}, "hash": "1c0ff581f6b06c1bc2d9feb279ee21afb2d9d10d86827eea3e2abd910a731bd0", "text": "43 Partnerships and South-South Cooperation In 2009, two landmark partnerships were agreed: a strategic partnership with China for tri- lateral cooperation to support developing countries, particularly in Africa; and the establish- ment with the Republic of Korea of the uNDp seoul policy Centre for Global Development partnerships. the Centre will undertake policy analysis and research on global partnerships", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb4d6299-c4c6-4b45-bbb4-73b5bb5127ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb4d6299-c4c6-4b45-bbb4-73b5bb5127ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "RBAP 2009 Results Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fca6930fa403bb4bd9b3bc6b507bc25dfd4bfbd531a402f882edc4d25a1bfd5e"}, "3": {"node_id": "dfffdff4-eca9-4e74-9580-ac4b1c80bc83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rbap-2009-results-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccd8f254de327cd501b2210bb01aacf6eff93988bcd9be2b2ae80d17d687c6a6"}}, "hash": "dba128bd0d7d7cbdbcd3ba93540ba248a765ddd1665727b301e7a95cd9c4ba21", "text": "in international development, with particular emphasis on the role of new and emerging donors in a changing international aid environment. these partnerships build on existing strong south-south cooperation in the region. since 2005, the uNDp-supported International poverty Reduction Center in China (IpRCC) has held 20 training workshops, bringing together close to 500 participants from Asia, Africa, south America, oceania and Central Asian countries. high-level training programs organized by IpRCC have deepened the south-south exchanges between China and other Workshop on poverty Reduction policies and practices in China, with participation of 37 African officials from 19 African countries, July 2009. photo: uNDp China 44 uNDp ReGIoNAl BuReAu foR AsIA AND the pACIfIC developing countries, engaging active discussions across countries on topics such as natural resource management and poverty reduction, agricultural and rural policies, management and monitoring of poverty reduction funds and rural financing.

In January 2009, uNDp and India jointly organized an international seminar to share the Indian experience of the National Rural employment Guarantee scheme (NReGs) and cross learning with countries in Africa and latin America. uNDp and India jointly hosted the first ever Asian Conference on Conditional Cash transfers (CCt) in November sharing practical experience from latin American countries and bringing Asian countries with CCt programs together. the Asia Pacific Aid Effectiveness Community of Practice and Capacity Development for Development Effectiveness (CDDE) Facility jointly supported by uNDp, ADB, the World Bank and Japan works with Asia pacific partner countries to provide sustained support for their efforts to promote accountability and transparency in the management of aid. It has a strong focus on peer to peer exchanges. In August, a delegation from timor-leste, Nepal and laos visited Cambodia to learn from its experience in designing and implementing Aid Information Management systems (AIMs). the Government of sri lanka, together with Cambodia and Nepal, partnered with eleven other countries in the region to build capacity to influence the international aid policy process and provide a systematic articu- lation of evidence and concerns from Asia-pacific to the oeCD DAC\u2019s Working party on Aid effectiveness (Wp-eff). 45 Future Directions uNDp is making a strong contribution to the development progress of its partner countries in the Asia pacific. In order to ensure assistance remains focused and relevant, the following are priority areas for uNDp in the Asia pacific in 2010 and beyond: Increasing focus and momentum toward achieving the MDGs: the special MDG review summit to be held in New York in september 2010 presents a major opportunity to generate renewed commitment to reach the goals, and identify remaining gaps in MDG achievement and how best to fill them. With the new generation of uNDAfs and Country program Docu- ments (CpDs) currently being developed, uNDp support within countries will be positioned strategically and coherently in support of national priorities, the MDGs and sustainable de- velopment. linked to a stronger strategic focus for uNDp programs in country is the related ability to contribute to transformational development outcomes at the national level and to report on uNDp\u2019s contribution to those outcomes. Strong focus on gender: Achieving gender equality promotes human development and is central to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. progress towards the MDGs is lack- ing the most where the needs of women and girls are not prioritized.

ESCAP supports member States with sound strategic analysis, policy options and technical cooperation activities to address key development challenges and to implement innovative solutions for region-wide economic prosperity, social progress and environmental sustainability. ESCAP, through its conference structure, assists member States in forging a stronger, coordinated regional voice on global issues by building capacities to dialogue, negotiate and shape development agenda in an age of globalization, decentralization and problems that transcend borders. A key modality for this strategy is the promotion of intraregional connectivity and regional integration. ADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance. UNDP is the UN\u2019s global development network, an organization advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life. UNDP is on the ground in 166 countries, working with them on their own solutions to global and national development challenges. UNDP\u2019s network links and coordinates global and national efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, including the overarching goal of cutting poverty in half by 2015. UNDP helps developing countries in building national capacities and sharing solutions to the challenges of: Democratic Governance, Poverty Reduction, Crisis Prevention and Recovery, Environment and Energy, and HIV/AIDS. UNDP also helps developing countries attract and use aid effectively. Achieving the Millennium Development Goals in an Era of Global Uncertainty Asia-Pacific Regional Report 2009/10 iii ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 This is the latest in a series of reports for Asia and the Pacific on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Coming in the midst of the global financial and economic turmoil, it should offer a unique opportunity to redress the information balance \u2013 to register the impact on the poor and the implications for the achievement of the Goals. However, it is difficult to offer a fully up-to-date report since reality has been moving too fast for the MDG data to keep pace. Judgements about whether countries across the region are on or off track to meet the Goals must be based on longer-term trends. This report therefore supplements these trend data with a close analysis of the most recent information and uses this to signal how the crisis is playing out \u2013 who is likely to suffer and why. Just as important, it tries to identify opportunities for action \u2013 showing how the countries of Asia and the Pacific can better protect their people from this and future crises. It identifies the most vulnerable countries and the MDGs at greatest risk. As a starting point for action it considers cur- rent fiscal stimulus packages and how these could be reshaped so as not just to boost growth but also better benefit the poor. It also considers the types of social protection that countries of the region could use to protect their most vulnerable people. And it looks at ways of rebalancing Asia\u2019s economies to make them more self-reliant and resilient \u2013 and serve as sturdier platforms for inclusive and sustainable development. Above all, it emphasizes the importance of stronger regional cooperation. This is the world\u2019s most dynamic region. Indeed in the next few years Asia and the Pacific may have to serve as the engine that pulls the global economy out of recession.

MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 For selected MDG indicators it places each country or country group into one of four categories: early achiever \u2013 already achieved the 2015 target; on track \u2013 expected to meet the target by 2015; off track: slow \u2013 expected to meet the target, but after 2015; off track: no progress/regressing \u2013 stagnating or slipping backwards. Prior to the economic crisis, Asia and the Pacific had been making impressive gains. The region as a whole is an early achiever for a number of indicators: reducing gender disparities in primary and tertiary education; stopping the spread of HIV and AIDS and tuberculosis; ensuring a proportion of protected area to maintain bio-diversity, reducing consumption of ozone-depleting substances, and halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water. The region is also on track to achieve three other important targets: gender parity in secondary education, ensur- ing universal access of children to primary school, and halving the proportion of people living below the $1.25-a-day poverty line. This progress is heartening, but these region- al aggregates inevitably mask considerable variations between subregions and country groupings. Among the subregions, the great- est advances have been in South-East Asia which has already achieved the targets in 11 out of the 21 assessed indicators, and it is on track for another four. Next come the North and Central Asian countries that as a group have already achieved the targets in nine of the indicators. South Asia has also made good progress on eight indicators, but it is mov- ing slowly in many others. As a group, the Pacific Island countries have been less successful \u2013 re- gressing or making no progress in 11 indicators and advancing only slowly in another two, those for infant and under-five mortality. There are similar disparities between country groups.

Most of the MDG indicators are reported as national averages. To reflect some of the important types of disparity within countries, the report looks more closely at under-five mortality and the proportion of under-five children underweight. One of the most consistent contrasts is between rural and urban areas \u2013 and in many countries, even as the overall rates Overview In recent years the Asia-Pacific region, along with the rest of the world, has been assailed by a series of global crises, first the energy and food crises, and more recently the financial and economic crisis \u2013 all of which have presented threats to development and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This report assesses the likely impact. First it tracks progress towards the Goals on the basis of data collected prior to the economic crisis on 21 out of the 60 official MDG indicators. Then it considers how this progress might be hindered by recent events. Drawing from the lessons of the crisis, the report also explores measures to make regional economies more socially resilient to economic cycles. 2 are coming down, these disparities are widening, clear evidence that millions of rural children are dying needlessly. Another persistent disparity in under-five mortality is between boys and girls. In rural areas of India, for example, in 2005-06, there were 89 deaths per thousand live births for girls, compared with 76 deaths for boys. Under-five mortality also varies significantly according to household wealth. The largest disparity is in the Philippines \u2013 66 deaths per thousand live births in the poorest quintile compared with 21 in the richest. Mortality rates also vary according to the level of education of the mother. In Viet Nam, for example, for children of mothers with primary education the child mortality rate is 27 deaths per thousand live births, while for those whose mothers had no education the rate is 66. Similar disparities are evident for the proportion of children under-five who are underweight. Again, there are often sharp rural-urban contrasts, and in some cases disparities have been widening. Malnutrition data also reveal gender disparities \u2013 though many countries have made progress. Cambodia, India and Nepal, for example, have managed to reduce disparities, and their rates for girls and boys are now very similar. In Turkey, on the other hand, while the overall malnutrition rate is relatively low, the risk remains higher for girls. New threats to the MDGs Many countries across Asia and the Pacific have demonstrated that some MDGs are indeed within reach. However, most of the assessments of MDGs progress in this report are based on data gathered before the 2008 global economic crisis. What effect will the crisis have, for example, on poverty? At this stage there are relatively few empirical data that register the impact. Nevertheless, it is possible to make some assessment of the likely damage by starting from projections of lost economic growth. Since economic growth helps reduce poverty, slower growth will correspondingly mean that fewer people will escape from poverty. Data on the differences between estimates of economic growth made before and after the onset of the crisis enable a calculation of the total number of people across Asia and the Pacific who will remain poor. On the basis of the most recent estimates of economic growth, in 2009, the crisis could trap an additional 17 million people on incomes of less than $1.25 a day, and another 4 million in 2010. This represents a huge opportunity cost \u2013 21 million people are almost equivalent to the entire population of Australia. This crisis has indicated that the region is still vulnerable to setbacks, which, in an era of globalization, can be transmitted from anywhere in the world. The Asia-Pacific region is connected to the global economy through multiple channels, including trade, tourism, foreign direct investment (FDI), official development assistance (ODA) and remittances. Each country\u2019s vulnerability will depend on two main factors: first, the extent of its integration into the global economy; second, its capacity to cope, which will depend on such issues as macroeconomic stability, institutional strength and level of social development. Based on these factors, the report calculates for each country a \u2018vulnerability index\u2019. Overall, it finds that the Asia-Pacific region has a similar coping capacity to Latin America and the Caribbean but it is less exposed to the crisis. Compared with Africa, Asia and the Pacific is more exposed to the crisis, but it is in a much stronger position", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b47600be-c8e2-4452-ad01-6b9997de479c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b47600be-c8e2-4452-ad01-6b9997de479c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9824911f1bd4f812cd94cc88bf9b705ae0f5bb5b94918ab6859638e17bd7e147"}}, "hash": "9824911f1bd4f812cd94cc88bf9b705ae0f5bb5b94918ab6859638e17bd7e147", "text": "in terms of coping capacity. Among the Asia-Pacific country groups, the Pacific Islands are the most exposed and generally have lower coping capacity. The least developed countries (LDCs) in Asia and the Pacific also have a lower capacity to cope but are less exposed. The landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) in Asia and the Pacific are less exposed as the LDCs, but usually have greater coping capacity. South Asia and South-East Asia have similar exposures, but the latter has greater coping capacity. The indices of exposure and coping capacity can be combined to derive an overall index of vulnerability. Each country\u2019s vulnerability can then be considered in the context of its MDG achievement to assess how far it is at risk for each goal. For poverty and child malnutrition, for example, People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Nepal, which have high incidences and are making slow progress on these indicators, appear to be at greatest risk. They are also among those at highest risk for primary enrolment, along with the Solomon Islands, Pakistan, and Vanuatu. 3 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 This type of impact analysis offers a useful snapshot, but indicates little about how this burden will be distributed among the most vulnerable groups. Among those likely to be hurt most are women, who constitute the majority of Asia\u2019s low-skilled, low-salaried, and temporary workforce that can easily be laid off during economic downturns. Moreover the current global economic crisis has reduced the demand for migrant labour \u2013 and women form nearly two-thirds of the total Asian migrant population. Another channel through which women\u2019s income would be affected is via reduced flows of microfinance \u2013 for which women are the principal clients. These different channels will have first-round im- pacts that could directly affect women\u2019s incomes and livelihood opportunities, with implications for the achievement of MDGs 1 and 3. Indirectly, however, second-round impacts at the household level will also have implications for the achieve- ment of other MDGs. The loss of female income is likely to have a greater impact on health and edu- cation, as women tend to spend a greater propor- tion of their income on meeting the basic needs of household members. At the same time, the strat- egies that households adopt to cope with falling incomes tend to disproportionately affect women and girls; experience with past crises has shown, for example, that, in these circumstances, girls are highly vulnerable to being withdrawn from school. In countries with high child mortality rates, the fall in household incomes could further increase the number of infant and child deaths, with dispropor- tionate effects on women and girls. Fiscal impact of the crisis Another major concern is that the global economic slowdown is cutting into government tax revenues, and causing or increasing fiscal imbalances \u2013 forc- ing governments to respond, either by borrowing, with a corresponding rise in debt, or by cutting expenditure, with potentially serious implications for the MDGs. Based on previous patterns in the region, a 1 percentage point fall in per capita GDP growth translates on average, depending on the country, into a 0.5\u20130.8 percentage point decrease in the growth of per capita private health spend- ing, a 0.5\u20130.7 percentage point decrease in the growth of per capita public health spending, and a 0.3\u20130.5 percentage point decrease in the growth of per capita public education spending. To check what has actually happened so far on the fiscal front during this crisis, the report examined the situation for a select set of twelve countries for which data were readily available: Bangladesh, China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Thailand. Prior to the crisis, nine of these twelve countries had achieved either fiscal balances or surpluses. But the crisis soon took its toll and by 2008 only six countries were still in balance. All expect higher deficits (lower surplus) in 2009 compared with 2008, and seven expect to run budget deficits in excess of 3.5 per cent of GDP, a level often beyond which sustainability is likely to be undermined. In general the countries of this region have been relying less on external debt and more on domestic debt \u2013 made feasible by high domestic savings coupled with a slowdown in private investment. The good news is that none of the governments surveyed here has reduced expenditures on the social sector, either in total or specifically on education or health \u2013 though Samoa is an exception in the case of health. Indeed most have increased their investment and, despite the prospect of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c8524c4-ae8e-4a9e-87bc-d5515a383208": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c8524c4-ae8e-4a9e-87bc-d5515a383208", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "430f560f6074a288ff5178279ac2021575655d951d88479c46092bb1262cddf5"}}, "hash": "430f560f6074a288ff5178279ac2021575655d951d88479c46092bb1262cddf5", "text": "higher deficits, appear determined to protect social-sector spending. Protecting the MDGs through fiscal stimuli The global economic crisis \u2013 and any future crises \u2013 could therefore have serious implications for the achievements of the MDGs. How can countries protect their people? The richer countries can rely to some extent on \u2018automatic stabilizers\u2019 such as progressive income tax regimes which, as people\u2019s incomes drop, permit them to pay a smaller proportion of their incomes as tax. And if workers lose their jobs they will usually get unemployment benefits. Developing countries generally do not have these options. Instead they usually have to make specific responses. For rich and poor countries alike, an alternative, or a supplement, to automatic stabilizers is a \u2018fiscal stimulus\u2019. To compensate for the loss of export demand from the developed economies, and to boost domestic demand, many governments in Asia and the Pacific have thus 4 increased public expenditure on infrastructure, such as roads and power supplies, while also cutting taxes on some goods and services. If fiscal stimulus packages have a strong compo- nent of social expenditures, this is likely to produce a double dividend \u2013 not only boosting growth more rapidly but also accelerating progress to- wards the MDGs. To what extent have the pack- ages in Asia and the Pacific been \u2018pro-MDG\u2019? Thus far the picture has been mixed. In most countries, a large part of the stimulus package can be termed \u2018MDG-neutral\u2019 in the sense that the measures do not directly address MDG issues, though the poor might still benefit indirectly. In a few countries, the stimulus package includes elements that are pro- MDG. How much difference would it make if countries followed the pro-MDG path for their stimulus packages? This can be estimated in rough terms by considering the likelihood that poor and the non- poor will spend money rather than save it \u2013 their different \u2018propensities to consume\u2019. The poor have a higher propensity to consume, so any pro-MDG government spending is likely to prompt further expenditure by the poor and thus have a higher multiplier than MDG-neutral spending. An examination of the content of China\u2019s package, for example, suggests that close to a quarter of the stimulus was pro-MDG, while the rest was MDG-neutral. Had the whole package been pro-MDG then not only would the poor have benefited more there would also have been a greater economic boost \u2013 not 21.3 per cent but 38.0 per cent accumulated over several years. Similarly, in the Philippines a stimulus that was fully pro-MDG would, accumulated over several years, have increased GDP by 12.0 per cent rather than the 6.2 per cent that the current stimulus package is expected to deliver. This represents the total increase over a number of years, with the largest increases in the initial years and the impact gradually tapering off. Considering the fiscal packages in terms of their pro-MDG bias should give some indication of their general benefit for the attainment of the MDGs. But it is also possible to assess the scale of the ben- efit. The report estimates that the greatest con- tribution of the stimulus packages is for poverty reduction, followed by health and education. In the Philippines, for example, using the country multi- plier, the stimulus package would reduce the pov- erty rate by 7.5 per cent and the under-five mortal- ity rate by more than 3.8 per cent. Again, however, this represents the total accumulated impact of the stimulus over a number of years. Securing the MDGs through stronger social protection Many Asia-Pacific countries could expand their very limited automatic stabilizers by strengthening their systems for social protection \u2013 which includes social insurance, social assistance, labour market services, a range of social services, particularly for women and children, and many types of local funds such as microcredit schemes. Social protection is becoming a priority because as countries become richer they are in a better position to protect their citizens. Another reason is that, in an era of globalization, they recognize that they have become more vulnerable to global crises that jeopardize hard-won gains in human development. Moreover, the surge in global trade and financial flows has been accompanied by rising social and economic inequality, while modernization has steadily undermined traditional form of community support, especially in the expanding urban areas, making older people in particular much less secure. A further source of vulnerability is the increasing frequency of natural disasters \u2013 some of which could be linked to global warming. All these hazards pose specific threats to the poor who are usually most exposed to major hazards and who also have to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98b13cfe-11b5-468d-acbf-b0d0fca8014e": {"__data__": {"id_": "98b13cfe-11b5-468d-acbf-b0d0fca8014e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9ec17811af49fc52be808f9c04632f7370b53bd3f9ae9c41aabd2f70a63584a"}}, "hash": "d9ec17811af49fc52be808f9c04632f7370b53bd3f9ae9c41aabd2f70a63584a", "text": "contend with catastrophic household events \u2013 major illness, for example, family breakup, or the premature death of the main household earner. As a result, households that can survive in normal circumstances can suddenly find themselves sinking below the poverty line. Achieving the Millennium Development Goals will bolster social protection. If, for example, people can escape from poverty they will live in more secure environments and will be much less vulnerable. By the same token, stronger social protection is also likely to foster the achievement of the MDGs. For example, households that are better insulated against catastrophes will feel more confident 5 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 about committing themselves to new enterprises or technologies that can help them escape from poverty. Conversely, failures in social protection will undermine MDG achievement. If households, for example, face a sudden financial shock they may have to divert microcredit loans from productive investment into consumption. And, desperate for income, they may withdraw children, particularly girls, from school in order to work. Household expenditure on health, especially of women and girls, is also likely to be curbed in times of financial insecurity. Asia-Pacific countries already have most of these forms of social protection. Many countries have schemes of social insurance, for example, but these usually reach only a small proportion of the work- force \u2013 generally government workers and some of those employed in the formal sector. Across Asia and the Pacific, only 20 per cent of the unem- ployed and underemployed have access to labour market programmes, such as unemployment benefits, training or public works programmes, including food-for-work programmes. Only 30 per cent of older people receive pensions. Expenditure on social protection in most Asia- Pacific countries tends to be small relative to GDP, though it can represent a high proportion of government budgets. There are four main sources of finance: taxation, reprioritizing expenditures, official development assistance, and borrowing. Of these, the most important in the future is likely to be taxation, since, even in some low-income countries, there is scope for increasing fiscal space by reforming their tax systems and improving the efficiency of tax collection. In some countries, however, the potential for additional tax will be limited in the short run, partly for reasons of political economy and also because of the extent of the informal economy. Taxation should therefore be combined with other sources of finance. This region should certainly be able to do more. Prior to the current crisis, it had been growing at an average annual rate of 8 per cent \u2013 creating economic resources that can and should be allocated to building systems capable of reaching all members of society at all times. And there are signs that countries are moving towards more comprehensive social protection systems \u2013 from extending cash transfers to offering guarantees of employment. Opportunities for cooperation The economic crisis of 2008 may not have started in Asia and the Pacific, but its impact here was immediate. What might the region do in future to protect itself \u2013 and the MDGs \u2013 from such contagion? In the short term, the most practical way of filling the gap left by declining exports is through a fiscal stimulus. In the medium and longer term, however, many countries will want to generate domestic demand in a more sustainable way by increasing household incomes and consumption, alongside boosting corporate investment. How can households be induced to save less and consume more? This depends on why people are saving. One reason could be to smooth incomes over the lifetimes of household members. Governments who wished to address this would need to consider increasing child benefits and old-age pensions. Another motive for saving is to set aside funds for emergencies: households will want to provide for unforeseen exigencies such as sickness or loss of income. Governments could respond with stronger social protection and more secure access to public health care or education, which would not only help achieve the health- related MDG targets but also reduce anxiety about having lower savings. Another motive for saving is to finance anticipated expenditure \u2013 to pay for expensive consumer goods, for example, or children\u2019s schooling. Policies to counter this would involve better credit so that households could make more balanced choices between current and future consumption. Consumption is also likely to increase if a greater share of national income goes to the poor. Investing in the capacities and capabilities of the poor is also likely to increase their contribution to GDP thus ensuring a more inclusive pattern of growth.

But policies should not just aim to alter the choices of households. Governments will also want to give appropriate incentives to the private sector \u2013 through policies on exchange rates, taxation and subsidies \u2013 to make it more profitable for companies to invest in sectors that are oriented 6 less towards exports and more towards meeting domestic demand, and especially the needs of the poor. For example, by avoiding undervalued exchange rate, governments can divert resources from tradable sectors into non-tradable sectors. As well as reorienting their economies more to- wards domestic markets, many countries can also consider diversifying their export markets so as to become less dependent on demand in the West. They can, for example, boost trade within the re- gion by liberalizing trade regimes and improving transport links, and simplifying customs and in- spection procedures. Cooperation would be par- ticularly valuable for the trade in food, and could include grain banks that are maintained in each country but readily accessible to others. Many subregions in Asia and the Pacific have very little trade between their constituent countries \u2013 a gap which represents a major opportunity for realizing trade gains and strengthening regional resilience. Closely connected with flows of trade are flows of FDI, on which restrictions might be eased. Some countries, particularly in South Asia, maintain complex rules governing FDI flows. Regional cooperation would also benefit from better integrated financial markets to facilitate cross- border investment in both equity and bond markets. A major step in this direction would be faster progress with the Asian Bond Market initiative. Regional cooperation can also be fostered by greater cooperation on monetary policy and on currency markets. One the most significant steps has been the Chiang Mai Initiative through which countries can pool currency reserves. Another is the Asian Cooperation Dialogue, which is an informal meeting to promote greater coordination amongst the region\u2019s central banks. Despite these laudable efforts, the recent crisis has exposed weaknesses in coordination amongst the region\u2019s monetary authorities. In addition to strengthening regional financial cooperation, Asia-Pacific governments will also have to play an important role in redesigning the global financial architecture \u2013 articulating their specific concerns and experiences. The global economic crisis has been widely pre- dicted to affect international migration and re- mittances adversely. Initial reports supported this expectation, with evidence of decelerating remit- tances in some countries. But as the crisis unfolds, it is becoming clear that the patterns of migration and remittances may be more complex than was previously imagined. Though growth of remittance flows moderated in some countries, overall flows remained resilient. In fact, in several countries (such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Nepal and Sri Lanka) remittance inflows have actually in- creased rather than declined so far. In this crisis, it seems likely that those affected are more likely to be migrant men employed in such sectors as man- ufacturing or construction in receiving countries, than migrant women who are often employed in domestic service. Nevertheless, those migrant workers, men and women, who manage to keep or find employment may face inferior working condi- tion or reduced wages. These contractions may re- duce the flow of remittances. In 2009 remittances to East Asia are expected fall by around 6 per cent and to South Asia by around 4 per cent. At present, migration policy in the region is largely unilateral, with most of the power in the hands of the countries of destination who can try to control the arrivals and working conditions of migrants. Instead, it would be better if countries of origin and destination could cooperate more closely, either through bilateral agreements, or memoranda of understanding \u2013 which set out broad frameworks to address common concerns. Another possible outcome of the crisis is a drop in development assistance. The major donor countries, facing falling tax revenues and the costs of massive fiscal stimulus packages, might feel the need to curtail overseas aid. Thus far, this does not seem to have happened. Indeed in April 2009 in London, the leaders of the G-20 countries committed themselves to significantly increasing the funds available to the developing countries. At this stage it is not clear how much of these commitments have actually come through in 2009. Any reduction in ODA would hit some of the LDCs, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and some Central Asian countries for which aid represents well over 10 per cent of gross capital formation. Much of the increase in the volume and share of aid committed to social sectors is towards government and the development of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fac7229-7c7a-483a-bc90-7bb2452f5a38": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fac7229-7c7a-483a-bc90-7bb2452f5a38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d41c1382460788dfb18ccc193c8f4da3635d76eb7937a78d3fa3633297d755d5"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c07f00c-9bd4-4b74-8f4c-a4b759e71f39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1750101d54432d722bda92088cebe019fae5879f3323bad60743247754f55e65"}}, "hash": "d1620d47416d9d4e2392481f30a15263255b8c790b8c077326a9d6ea02259a5c", "text": "civil society, while the 7 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 share allocated to education has fallen \u2013 raising doubts about the effectiveness of aid for helping achieve the MDGs. Nowadays, more aid is arriving as a result of South-South cooperation from other developing countries in the region \u2013 notably China, India and Thailand which, for some of the recipient countries, are the largest sources of aid. Stronger cooperation across the region \u2013 via agreements on trade, finance, labour migration and development assistance \u2013 could thus make the region more resilient to future crises and bolster the capacity of many of the poorest countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 9 hapter Tracking the MDGs \u2013 trends and prospects In recent years, the Asia-Pacific region, along with the rest of the world, has been assailed by a sequence of global crises, first the energy and food crises and, more recently, the economic crisis triggered by the Western financial meltdown. As a result, the region is facing additional threats to development and to the achievement of the MDGs. This report will examine these threats in detail at the end of the chapter, but it begins by telling the story so far, using the most recent data on 21 out of the 60 official MDG indicators from the Global Millennium Development Goals Indicators Database \u2013 which generally reflect the position prior to the economic crisis (UN, 2009). To judge whether countries are on or off track to achieve the MDGs, it assesses past performance and assumes countries will continue along similar trajectories. But history is not destiny. Even in the face of crises, countries can secure their position and improve their prospects. For those that have so far made good headway, this will mean implementing policies that help them to protect their gains and sustain their progress. For countries that have been less successful, it will mean diverging from the predicted path and getting back on track to meet the MDGs by 2015. For classifying the progress of countries and regions, this report uses the same system as in previous regional MDG reports. For selected indicators, based on trends of progress since 1990, the report places each country or country group into one of four categories: Early achiever \u2013 Already achieved the 2015 target On track \u2013 Expected to meet the target by 2015 Off track: slow \u2013 Expected to meet the target, but after 2015 Off track: no progress/regressing \u2013 Stagnating or slipping backwards Based on this classification, Table I-3 presents the progress of 55 Asia-Pacific countries on selected MDG indicators. Table I-1 summarizes the data for various subregions and country groups. For details of the methodology for assessing whether coun- tries are on or off track, please see Annex 1. Decades of progress Prior to the global crises, Asia and the Pacific had made impressive gains in some of the MDG indicators. As indicated in Table I-1, the region as a whole is an early achiever for a number of indicators: reducing gender disparities in primary and tertiary education; stopping the spread of HIV and AIDS and tuberculosis; ensuring a proportion of protected area to maintain bio-diversity, reducing consumption of ozone-depleting substances, and halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water. The region is also on track to achieve three other important targets: gender parity in secondary education, ensuring universal access of children to primary school and halving the proportion of people living below the poverty line.

Between 1990 and 2005, Asia and the Pacific reduced the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day from 1.5 billion to 979 million \u2013 all the more impressive given that over the same period the region\u2019s population increased by some 800 mil- lion. Box I-1 \u2013 Revised poverty estimates In 2008, the international poverty line \u2013 below which people are assumed to be living in extreme poverty \u2013 was revised from $1.08 per day (1993 PPP prices) to $1.25 (2005 PPP prices). This new line represents the average of the national poverty lines of the world\u2019s poorest 15 countries, two of which are in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 Nepal and Tajikistan. This revision followed a 2005 expanded round of data collection in the International Comparison Programme (ICP). This gathers comparative data from more than 100 developing countries on the prices of goods and services \u2013 such as food, housing and transport. Compared with the 1993 round, the 2005 ICP round enabled a considerable improvement in poverty estimates, not just because of a more realistic poverty line, but also because of an improved survey design and the availability of a larger number of household surveys. As before, the price levels in different countries are adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). This is because market exchange rates for currencies only reflect purchasing power in terms of goods that are traded internationally, while consumption, particularly by the poor, includes a proportion of non-traded goods, including services, as well as certain food staples. The $PPP figure represents a conversion into US dollars that assures parity in terms of purchasing power over commodities, whether or not these are traded internationally. The World Bank maintains a website, PovcalNet, which enables users to calculate poverty estimates using various poverty lines for individual countries and groups of countries. http://go.worldbank.org/NT2A1XUWP0. ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 11 However, even this good progress will not be sufficient to achieve all the MDGs by 2015. The Asia- Pacific region has been slow in reducing hunger, ensuring that girls and boys reach the last grade of primary education, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and providing basic sanitation. To reach the goals, from now to 2015, countries in Asia and the Pacific need to give a big, final push \u2013 stepping up their efforts through focused MDG programmes and projects. One issue on which it is difficult to make an accurate assessment, however, is maternal mortality \u2013 which is of particular concern given the large number of women across the region dying from causes related to childbirth (Box I-2). The reduction of CO2 emissions is one indicator on which all subregions are regressing. Disparities between subregions and country groups The estimates for the Asia-Pacific region as a whole inevitably mask considerable variations between subregions and country groupings. Table I-1 shows that, amongst the subregions, the greatest progress has been in South-East Asia, which has already achieved 11 out of the 21 assessed indicators and is on track for another four. Next come the North and Central-Asian countries which, as a group, have already achieved nine of the indicators. The same group of countries, excluding the Russian Federation, have achieved nine of the indicators and are on track on two more \u2013 though they are progressing slowly on another three, and regressing in another six, including those related to poverty, HIV and TB. Box I-2 \u2013 Measuring maternal mortality Most developing countries find it difficult to estimate maternal mortality. Indeed on this indicator even the developed countries that have the advantage of more complete systems for vital registration suffer from misclassification and underreporting. An alternative is to use household surveys to ask about the deaths of women in that household from causes related to childbirth. But because for each family maternal mortality is a relatively rare event this requires a large sample size to produce a statisti- cally significant result. Increasing the sample size is costly and may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals. As a result many countries, such as Indonesia, when carrying out their demographic and health surveys use the \u2018direct sisterhood\u2019 method \u2013 also asking women within the sampled households whether any of their sisters have died.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "029486d9-7c6e-4bf8-a44f-70dced5fa095": {"__data__": {"id_": "029486d9-7c6e-4bf8-a44f-70dced5fa095", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4636674eb1f6d45afeed45666334ec5f4b3ce7af1a08c5a493efa1ddd98aa003"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3f5826f-e057-45c8-9606-b0cc847610ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "814f950cdf6e6597a39cf6c2a6f4659e24baec0c6bde9ee1de2c3759daaa8586"}}, "hash": "39acc7ea03ac23c4213be17481759c6c1b950cade0e36796dfc994fd5252741b", "text": "This generates more data on maternal deaths, but those reported will generally have occurred some 6-12 years prior to the survey.

To produce better quality estimates and calculate regional and global aggregates WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank, and UNDP have developed a methodology for adjusting national data to make them more internationally comparable. For this pur- pose they divide countries into three groups, which are of roughly equal numbers. The first group have complete civil registration systems and good systems for attributing causes of death so their data are not adjusted. The second group consists of countries that use a range of methodologies so the estimates for these countries are adjusted to take these differences into account. The third group comprises countries that lack appropriate data and whose maternal mortality levels have to be predicted using a statistical model. These adjusted global estimates are calculated every five years and published one or two years after the refer- ence year. This exercise was carried out in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. The 2005 estimates used an improved methodology. While this should give more reliable results it means that the 2005 estimates are not comparable with those of earlier years. To make a comparison, a separate exercise was required using the 2005 methodology to re-estimate the 1990 data, though this was only used to arrive at global, regional and subregional figures (box figure). As a result there are no internationally comparable trend data at the national level. Box I-2 continued >> 12 The Asia-Pacific region includes the world\u2019s two most populous countries \u2013 China and India \u2013 so the region\u2019s overall achievement on poverty, as on other indicators, will be swayed by their performance. To illustrate this, Table I-1 also shows the performance of different country groupings that exclude Asia\u2019s two giants. Thus \u2018Asia and the Pacific excluding China and India\u2019 on some indicators has performed worse than the region as a whole: it has progressed only slowly in ensuring primary enrolment, and regressed on HIV prevalence. On the other hand, this group of smaller countries has done better on gender parity in secondary educational attainment on which it is an early achiever. Starting from a low base on many MDG indicators, South Asia has made good progress on eight indicators, but is progressing only slowly on many others. Given the weight of India in subregional aggregates, it is also useful to consider \u2018South Asia without India\u2019. This grouping is on track for poverty, but progressing slowly on primary enrolment and the provision of clean water supplies, and regressing in HIV prevalence and forest cover. As a group, the Pacific Island countries have been less successful \u2013 regressing or making no progress in 11 indicators and advancing only slowly in another two, those for infant and under-five mortality. Papua New Guinea is home to almost 70 per cent of the Pacific Island countries\u2019 population, so estimates for the subregion are inevitably affected by this country\u2019s performance. Table I-1, therefore, presents estimates for the Pacific Island countries excluding Papua New Guinea. This subgroup has made better progress on gender equality in education and is also moving forward, albeit slowly, on ensuring that births are attended by skilled health professionals. However, it should be noted that the accuracy of Pacific Island aggregates for many indicators is hampered by a shortage of data (Box I-3). Box I-3 \u2013 Routes to faster MDG progress in the Pacific The Pacific Island countries have been making slow progress on the MDGs. To some extent this reflects slow economic development in general, but it is also linked with a general weakness in institutions and a lack of capacity for management and implementation \u2013 including the ability to gather the necessary data. Pacific Island governments want to scale up their MDG efforts and allocate resources more effectively and efficiently. For this they will need more accurate estimates of the costs of service delivery, so that they can better integrate MDGs into national budgets and 0 200 400 600 Maternal Mortality (per 100,000 live births) 1990 2005 Southern Asia South-Eastern Asia Oceania Eastern Asia Note: The regional groupings here are those in the 2009 Millennium Development Goals Report.

Some are now altering their approaches, though it will take some time for these efforts to bear fruit. The Pacific island countries also have difficulties in tracking the MDGs. Some of the problems arise because most of the countries have small populations. The indicator on maternal mortality, for example, for which the denominator is 100,000 live births, is difficult to apply in a country with only a few thousand people. And, for this and other indicators, a relatively small number of events can cause wide fluctuations in national rates. There are also concerns that the MDG indicators fail to address specific concerns in the Pacific. In education, for example, the problem is not so much coverage as quality. Moreover, on many issues a lot of the necessary data remain unavailable, especially at the sub-national level. This is partly due to inadequate systems for data collection and management. In the past, national statistical offices have had quite narrow mandates \u2013 dealing mainly with censuses, national surveys, compilations of financial, trade and immigration statistics, and extracts from birth and death registries. The MDGs, however, require many new types of data which, thanks to the wider availability of information technology, may come from diverse sources, including other government departments and line ministries. In this new information environment, the chroni- cally understaffed and under-resourced national statistics offices face being overwhelmed or overlooked, even though they retain the power to declare information official or otherwise. Recognizing these and other issues, in 2005 the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders adopted the Pacific Plan, which envisaged incorpo- rating the MDGs in National Sustainable Development Strategies \u2013 using Pacific-relevant indicators. At the national level, some countries have established task forces to facilitate and monitor MDG progress. Two countries have also agreed additional goals that reflect national priorities. The Cook Islands has an MDG9 on Improved Governance, and Niue has one on Population Development. The countries of the Pacific should also be able to rely on international support. Australia, a major donor, has reemphasized its com- mitment to the MDGs through a major programme of Pacific Partnerships for Development. The UNDP has also provided leadership and assistance to most countries in compiling National MDG reports and organizing national and regional workshops on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting. A regional MDG network could also help countries share information resources and good practices. There are similar disparities between country groups. The region\u2019s 14 least developed countries have made slow or no progress on most indicators \u2013 performing well only on gender equality in primary and secondary education and on reducing the prevalence of HIV and TB. Comparison with other global regions The Asia-Pacific region as a whole has made more progress than Sub-Saharan Africa but less than Latin America and the Caribbean. The comparison between these three global regions is encapsulated in Figure I-1 for six indicators. In these charts, the size of the bubbles is in proportion to the population currently affected. The sloping line divides each chart into two parts: if the bubble is above the line, since 1990 the values on that indicator have increased; below the line they have decreased. The colours correspond to those of the on- or off-track progress symbols. As these charts show, the Asia-Pacific region lags behind Sub-Saharan Africa only on under-five children underweight, but is typically behind Latin America and the Caribbean on most other indica- tors \u2013 coming close only for primary enrolment. The charts confirm, for example, that Asia and the Pacific is on track for reducing poverty \u2013 though the region\u2019s average poverty rate is still higher than that in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Asia-Pacific region has the largest number of poor people. Indeed these charts emphasize the reality that, because of its larger population size, on most indicators, Asia and the Pacific has the greatest numbers of people affected \u2013 a particu- larly serious situation for underweight children, under-five mortality and rural sanitation, for which the region as a whole is off track. 14 60 50 40 30 20 10 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 10 20 30 40 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 50 100 150 200 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 100 200 300 400 500 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 150 100 50 60 50 40 30 20 600 500 400 300 200 100 $1.25/day poverty, current level $1.25/day", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb7f17ff-f2f4-4999-bce6-1fdbd3883842": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb7f17ff-f2f4-4999-bce6-1fdbd3883842", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4a18c22b7e828bd754d8b345bc10dd6e00b90b6d5c37fc9b57888ffefac1462"}, "3": {"node_id": "165193e2-efad-4135-a2f3-cee9093118b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8e93ecdc13ef822a0d624e95f46cf0fbe7c3486f806523afeca3b9e93ccf852"}}, "hash": "c4e6fa201ac5c54c8eccdb84c3e2d7200d1201fd4b31001fd143d1bc976b14c4", "text": "poverty, 1990 level Underweight children, 1990 level Primary enrolment, 1990 level Under-5 mortality, 1990 level TB prevalence, 1990 level Sanitation, rural, 1990 level Under-5 mortality, current level Primary enrolment, current level Underweight children, current level TB prevalence, current level Sanitation, rural, current level Sub-Saharan Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Asia Pacifc Asia Pacifc Asia Pacifc Asia Pacifc Asia Pacifc Latin America & Caribbean Latin America & Caribbean Latin America & Caribbean Latin America & Caribbean Latin America & Caribbean Asia Pacifc Latin America & Caribbean Figure I-1 \u2013 Asia and the Pacific compared with Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 15 In the case of rural sanitation, for example, the Asia-Pacific region has more than 70 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people who are affected \u2013 which in 2006 amounted to more than 1.3 billion people. This is illustrated in Figure I-2 for this and other selected indicators, showing that Asia and the Pacific is also home to over 70 per cent of the world\u2019s under-five children underweight, 68 per cent of people infected with tuberculosis and the same proportion of those living in extreme poverty. Even on indicators for which Asia and the Pacific has made significant progress, it still has a large number of people who live in deprivation.

For most indicators, the slow progress or setbacks in achieving the MDGs will have serious gender implications. When resources are short, women and girls are typically hit hardest \u2013 and shoulder most of the burden for coping with any additional pressure on the household. By the same token, however, achieving the Goals will have particular benefits for women, providing them with more opportunities and greater security, while enabling them to strengthen their capabilities (Table I-2). Figure I-2 \u2013 The Asia-Pacific region\u2019s share of the developing world\u2019s deprived people, selected indicators 16 MDG indicators Gender dimensions Extreme poverty Poverty has a greater impact on women, since they have to cope with the effects on the family. Poverty is one of the principal causes of gender inequality. Education, primary secondary and tertiary Failing to hit gender targets on education will not just deprive women of their rights it will also affect the prospects of their children. When women are empowered through education they are likely to have fewer children. They are also in a stronger position to ensure that their children are healthy and well nourished and go to school. Infant mortality Globally more boys die during infancy than girls, but in some Asian countries, notably China and India, the situation is reversed. South and East Asia have also seen a new form of female disadvantage in the form of sex-selective abortion. HIV and AIDS Women, and especially those who have little power in sexual relations, are more vulnerable to HIV infection. Rural water supplies Women and girls can spend hours each day fetching water. Better access to safe water will free them for other activities. Table I-2 \u2013 Gender implications of failing to attain MDG targets Source: UNIFEM 2008a, 2008b Just as setbacks in each of the MDGs can have repercussions on women\u2019s welfare and empowerment, so the lack of progress in gender equality will also have a critical impact on the achievement of other MDGs. Conversely, gender equality helps accelerate the achievement of the MDGs, and progress in gender equality in one goal often contributes towards progress on a number of others.

Yet a significant proportion of women continue to lack access to reproductive health care. The proportion of deliveries attended by skilled staff was as low as 11 per cent in Nepal, 19 per cent in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 23 per cent in Pakistan, and 43 per cent in India. However, there has also been some notable progress: in countries such as Viet Nam, Sri Lanka, and China, the figures reached 85, 87, and 87 per cent, respectively (UNIFEM, 2008b). Women\u2019s education is strongly associated with having fewer children, fewer of these children dying in infancy or childhood, better nutrition for children, and a greater likelihood that children will be sent to school. Gender equality is therefore both a goal in its own right, and a prerequisite for the achievement of the other MDGs. Unfortunately, the only target under MDG3 focuses on eliminating gender disparity in education. Two other indicators, gender disparity in wage employment and participation in national parliaments, cover the broader aspects of gender equality, but the lack of concrete targets has hampered progress. Not surprisingly, many women continue to face discrimination in the formal sector through lower earnings and fewer benefits, and are forced to work in the informal sector where earnings are low and working conditions poor (UNIFEM, 2008b). In East Asia and the Pacific, around 60 per cent of women are in vulnerable employment; in South Asia, the proportion is much higher at 84 per cent (ILO, 2008). Meanwhile, in subregions such as South Asia, women\u2019s share of waged non-agricultural remains dismal \u2013 for every four men only one woman has a non-agricultural paid job (UNIFEM 2008a). The share of women in parliaments has now reached 15 per cent in South Asia and 11 per cent in East Asia and the Pacific, Nevertheless, the region is still unlikely to reach the critical mass level of 30 per cent by 2015, and without major efforts will take decades to reach parity levels of 40 to 60 per cent (UNIFEM 2008a). ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 17 Disparities between countries Asia and the Pacific is a huge and diverse region with countries that vary greatly in size and level of development: it has three of the world\u2019s most populous countries, but also many Pacific Island states that have only a few thousand people. This makes it difficult to present meaningful inter- country comparisons across the whole region. The best approach therefore is usually to look at contrasts across subregions within which neighbouring countries might be expected to have some similarities. For this purpose, a convenient measure for comparison is the proportion of indicators for which each country is off track \u2013 though this also needs to be considered in conjunction with the proportion of the 21 indicators for which the country can actually provide sufficient data for assessing trends. South and South-West Asia The data for this subregion are summarized in Figure I-3. All the countries except Afghanistan and Maldives have reported on more than 80 per cent of the 21 indicators assessed in this report. However, more than half the countries are off track on at least 40 per cent of these indicators. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 % Indicators Of Track % Indicators Data Available Afghanistan India Bangladesh Nepal Pakistan Turkey Bhutan Iran (Islamic Republic of) Sri Lanka Maldives Figure I-3 \u2013 South and South-West Asia, proportion of reported indicators for which countries are off track The country with most scope for improvement is Afghanistan, which is off track on more than 70 per cent of its reported indicators \u2013 and the indicators missing include those on poverty and education on which it would probably not fare well either. India has reported on all 21 indicators, but is off track in more than half of these \u2013 making slow progress towards the goals of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, completion of primary education, gender equality in tertiary education, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health or extending basic sanitation. In 2005, the country had 471 million people living on less than $1.25 a day, and in 2006 had 318 million people without basic sanitation. Bangladesh reports on more than 80 per cent of the indicators but is off track on half of these \u2013 with slow or no progress on poverty reduction, on education, on improving maternal health, on forest cover or on extending services of clean water and basic sanitation.

Pakistan is in the same position as Nepal in aggre- gate terms \u2013 though the composition of indicators covered and the corresponding achievements dif- fer. The country has been successful on poverty, on which it is an early achiever1, and is on track for basic sanitation. On the other hand, Pakistan has made no significant progress on child mal- nutrition and is moving only slowly on under-five mortality, and on maternal health. It has also made slow progress on halving the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water. Turkey and Bhutan are off track on more than 40 per cent of their reported indicators, while the Islamic Republic of Iran and Sri Lanka are off track on one third. A commendably strong performer is the Maldives, which despite being one of the subregion\u2019s five LDCs is an early achiever on 9 of 16 reported indicators and on track on another three. North and Central Asia Most countries in this subregion have reported data on more than 90 per cent of the indicators. The exceptions are the Russian Federation and Turkmenistan, which report on 85 and 50 per cent of the indicators respectively \u2013 and are off track on half of these, including those on child mortal- ity (Figure I-4). It should be noted, however, that on most of these indicators the Russian Federation already had quite starting levels in 1990. Kazakhstan and Tajikistan are off track in 50 per cent or more of the indicators \u2013 making slow progress on child mortality, for example, and none on health. Uzbekistan is in a better position, but on poverty has actually regressed: between 1998 and 2003 the proportion of people below the poverty line increased from 32 to 46 per cent. Other countries in the subregion appear to be doing better, but their records are still mixed. For poverty, Azerbaijan is an early achiever and Armenia is on track, but neither has made progress on child malnutrition. On the other hand, for child malnutrition Kyrgyzstan is an early achiever and Georgia is on track, but both are regressing on poverty. Pacific Island countries Here it is especially difficult to assess progress be- cause of a shortage of data. For example, no coun- try has sufficient information on poverty, and only a few have data on education or HIV. On the basis of the available data, Papua New Guinea has made less progress \u2013 off track on almost 70 per cent of reported indicators \u2013 and those missing include those on poverty, education and gender equality (Figure I-5). The country is, for example, making slow progress on child mortality, clean water and basic sanitation. However, most countries in the su- bregion that offer sufficient data have made slow progress on child and infant mortality, and slow or no progress on providing their people with clean water and basic sanitation. South-East Asia Most countries in South-East Asia have reported data on more than 80 per cent of the indicators (Figure I-6). The exceptions are two wealthy coun- tries, Brunei Darussalam and Singapore, and two LDCs, Timor-Leste and Myanmar.

The Philippines is also off track in more than 40 per cent of the 21 indicators, including poverty, hunger, infant mortality and maternal health. Malaysia\u2019s performance may appear similar, but this is only because on indicators such as access to improved water sources and basic sanitation the country had already achieved high levels \u2013 more than 93 per cent. Indonesia\u2019s main challenges towards achieving the goals are in reducing hunger, halting the spread of HIV, forest cover and providing safe drinking water and basic sanitation. The country has made very good progress in ensuring that boys and girls reach the last grade of primary education \u2013 between 2001 and 2006 the proportion increased from 86 to 95 per cent. It has also substantially reduced the under-five mortality rate, which between 1990 and 2007 fell from 91 to 31 deaths per thousand live births. A positive note is also struck by the good performance of Thailand and Viet Nam, which are off track on less than 20 per cent of the indicators. On poverty, for example, Viet Nam between 1993 and 2006 reduced the rate from 64 to 22 per cent, and between 1994 and 2006 reduced the proportion of under-five children underweight from 45 to 20 per cent. Thailand had good levels on most indicators even in 1990, and was still able to maintain progress. East and North-East Asia The data for East and North-East Asia are summa- rized in Figure I-7. This offers a somewhat mislead- ing picture for the Republic of Korea, which started in 1990 with its indicators at high levels, leaving less scope for further advances. However, it can be noted that the Republic of Korea has made slow progress in gender equality in tertiary education: between 1991 and 2007 the ratio of female to male students rose from 49 per cent only to 67 per cent. Macao, China has low indicators coverage, less than 40 per cent, and it is off track on half of them. It is also one of the only two ESCAP members, the other is Papua New Guinea, to have regressed in gender equality in primary education: between 1991 and 2007 the ratio of girls to boys fell from 96 to 92 per cent. Data availability is also weak for Hong Kong, China, with coverage of a little over 40 per cent, and it had regressed in primary education: between 2001 and 2005, enrolment fell from 97.5 to 94.9 per cent. Mongolia reports on all the indicators. It also has one of the best records on gender equality in education, with more girls than boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education, but it has made slow progress in reducing poverty and infant ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 21 Figure I-7 \u2013 East and North-East Asia, proportion of reported indicators for which countries are off track mortality and in providing access to clean water and basic sanitation. It is difficult to assess the progress of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea since, although it reports on more than 60 per cent of the indicators, these do not include those on poverty, education, or gender equality. For its reported indicators, the country has not made progress on reducing child and maternal mortality or on providing basic sanitation. China has demonstrated some of the subregion\u2019s greatest advances, especially in poverty: between 1990 and 2005 the poverty rate fell from 60 to 16 per cent. On the other hand, China has made slow progress in reducing child mortality and in providing basic sanitation. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Korea, Republic of China, Macao SAR Korea, Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Mongolia China China, Hong Kong SAR % Indicators Of Track % Indicators Data Available Disparities within countries Most of the MDG indicators are reported as national averages.

This section therefore moves beyond national averages and looks at various types of disparities \u2013 based not just on gender (Box I-5), but also on rural or urban location, or on wealth. For this purpose it uses two indicators \u2013 under-five mortality and the proportion of under-five children underweight \u2013 for which many countries can offer disaggregated data via demographic and health surveys (DHS). Under-five mortality Under-five mortality is one of the most sensitive indicators, not just of health but also of poverty conditions generally since young children are less likely to survive a poor", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5c1e6ef-672f-457c-9716-2dbecfff155e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5c1e6ef-672f-457c-9716-2dbecfff155e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05756fabc26a83d26f31e02dfa45eb0a904ca71793e4971df60be98523fab1aa"}}, "hash": "05756fabc26a83d26f31e02dfa45eb0a904ca71793e4971df60be98523fab1aa", "text": "socio-economic environment (Box I-6). Although almost all Asia- Pacific countries have managed to reduce national levels of under-five mortality, they have been more successful in some locations than others. One of the most consistent disparities is between rural and urban areas. This is illustrated in Figure I-8 for selected countries that have suitable DHS data. In Armenia, for example, while the under- five mortality rate came down in both rural and urban areas, it did so by a greater proportion in the urban areas and, as a result, the ratio between the urban and rural rates increased \u2013 from 1.59 to 1.62. Indeed the ratio increased in almost all these countries \u2013 clear evidence that many rural children are dying needlessly. The greatest increase in the ratio was in Viet Nam \u2013 from 1.51 to 2.20. This is also a country that demonstrates wide geographical disparities \u2013 with infant mortality rates, for the ten-year period preceding the 2002 DHS, varying from 16 per thousand live births in the Central Coast region to 52 in the Northern Uplands. On the other hand, in India the story is more posi- tive: the ratio fell from 1.70 to 1.59. This probably reflects the success and reach of national-level government programmes like the Universal Im- munization Programme and the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness strategy which have been implemented success- fully in many rural areas. Papua New Guinea also reduced the rural-urban ratio \u2013 from 2.56 to 2.00 between 1996 and 2006, though of these countries it still has the second-highest ratio. 22 Box I-5 \u2013 Gender disparities in MDG progress Although many countries do not regularly report sex-disaggregated data that would help track the gender dimensions of MDG targets and indicators, the available data on outcome indicators of poverty, such as education, poor nutrition, and poor health, and evidence from case studies, suggest that gender disparities persist. In the case of nutrition, for instance, case studies show that women are more likely to suffer the consequences of hunger and malnutrition \u2013 since in most societies households tend to distribute food first to the male breadwinner, then to the boys, and finally to the girls and women. Women also tend to bear the burden of feeding the family; empirical evidence shows that women in poor households typically take on the responsibility of making food available, either by producing or purchasing it (UNIFEM, 2008b). In education, discrimination, coupled with programmes whose design and delivery are gender-insensitive, has reduced the opportunities for girls\u2019 education. Parents and society in general often attach little value to girls\u2019 education, a trend which is exacerbated by the imposition of user-pay policies and other education fees. When faced with a difficult choice of whom to send to school, poor families will typically favour boys over girls. For the region as a whole gender differences in enrolment and literacy ratios these have narrowed, but in a number of countries the disparities remain significant. While gender differences have been narrowing at the primary level, progress has been slower in secondary and tertiary education (UNIFEM 2008a, 2008b). In combating HIV and AIDS, recent estimates show that there has been a steady increase in the number of HIV-positive women. In Asia, the female proportion of adults living with AIDS nearly doubled between 1990 and 2007 \u2013 reaching 29 per cent (UNIFEM, 2008a) The 2008 AIDS Commission Report for Asia has estimated that 50 million women are at risk of contracting HIV from partners or husbands who engage in unprotected multiple sexual relations or who are injecting drug users. Meanwhile, a 2008 study by UNIFEM of four South-East Asian countries found that the pandemic is increasingly assuming a woman\u2019s face; in Laos in 2006, men constituted 57 per cent and women 43 per cent of the people living with HIV and AIDS, while in Cambodia between 1997 and 2006 the proportion of those living with HIV who were women increased from 38 to 52 per cent. It also found that more new infections resulted from women contracting HIV from their spouses and partners; in Thailand, for example, between 1990 and 2007, for women the proportion of new infections from partners or spouses increased from 37 to 38.7 per cent, while for men in 2007 the proportion of new infections coming from partners or wives was only 9.6 per cent. Finally, on environmental sustainability, anecdotal evidence indicates that since women often ensure food security, and do the bulk of water and household fuel collection, so their time burdens are likely to increase if the supply and quality of natural resources are undermined by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dcd0a1e5-d77f-40c4-9b4b-2b13524c5c3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dcd0a1e5-d77f-40c4-9b4b-2b13524c5c3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8aa205d3ae1bed6e81133908d75e0ba9bad75c1d19b14b2106f66f4c0e5af8c"}, "3": {"node_id": "21a89710-2c2c-4599-9b39-50fa7b4f29e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cc278bd5e490733eebf80fb4cc3b19c9abab915ee2adf931bca1ff0d84b478e"}}, "hash": "fd9ca19d037a03dd5812f6dd64ff9369fa06326171d83be754108d191b6c77db", "text": "environmental degradation and climate change (UNIFEM, 2008a). Box I-6 \u2013 Children at risk During an economic crisis those most at risk of permanent damage are children. Adults who come under stress will suffer, but their children may die. Adults who go hungry can later recover, but their children may be permanently stunted. Adults who lose their job may find other work, but if their children drop out of school they may lose their chance of education forever. It is also worth noting that in some households where adults lose their jobs, children are forced into economic activity to supplement the loss in household income. Consequently, they may drop out of school altogether or combine school and work, in which case their education performance suffers (ILO 2009c). Some of the education effects were evident in the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In Indonesia, enrolment in secondary education fell by up to 11 per cent and dropouts increased, especially among the poor. In Thailand, many children failed to make the transition between elementary and middle school or between middle school and high school. And in the Republic of Korea many children dropped out of school or moved from the private to the public education system, placing further stress on overcrowded facilities (UNESCO, 2000). A recent study estimates that, if unaddressed, the current crisis could increase rates of maternal anaemia by 10\u201320 per cent, the prevalence of low birth weight by 5\u201310 per cent, childhood stunting by 3\u20137 per cent, and child wasting by 8\u201316 per cent. In severely affected countries, the overall under-five child mortality could increase by 3\u201315 per cent. (Bhutta, 2009) Source: Patel (2009) ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 23 Nevertheless, advances in equality cannot be taken for granted. Bangladesh, for example, between 1996 and 2004 managed to reduce the ratio considerably, from 1.40 to 1.07, only to see it rise again in 2007, to 1.22. Another persistent disparity in child mortality is between boys and girls. This is illustrated in which compares infant mortality rates in India for male and female children in rural and urban areas. In 1998-99, in rural areas there were 117 deaths per thousand live births for girls, compared with 106 deaths for boys \u2013 a ratio of 1.10. By 2005-06, the rural gender disparities had widened \u2013 with rates of 89 for girls and 76 for boys \u2013 a ratio of 1.17. On the other hand, by 2005-06 in urban areas the situation was more balanced; indeed the rates for girls were below those of boys. Wide gender disparities generally reflect different forms of social discrimination (Box I-7).

A recent study in India, for example, found that girls were five times less likely than boys to be hospitalized for a childhood illness. The imbalances in the Pacific, on the other hand, are more difficult to explain, since this subregion does not generally exhibit strong patterns of gender discrimination. In these and other countries, it will be important therefore not just to monitor overall child mortality rates, but also the gender balances, and address the social factors that contribute to high death rates of girls. A high proportion of these deaths occur in the neo-natal period, and child mortality is also closely linked to maternal mortality. So reducing the gender discrimination that contributes to the deaths of women will also help more infant girls survive (ADB, 2006).

This is illustrated for a selection of countries in Figure I-10, which shows the mortality rate for each wealth quintile \u2013 from the poorest to the richest 20 per cent of the population.

A child whose mother has no education is less likely to survive to the age of five than a child whose mother has completed a full course of primary schooling. This is illustrated in Figure I-11. Of these countries, the greatest contrast is in Viet Nam: for children of mothers with primary education the child mortality rate is 27 deaths per thousand live births while for those whose mothers had no education the rate is 66. Interestingly, the lowest disparities among these countries are in the three LDCs. Some countries also offer sufficient data on child mortality disparities to indicate a trend. These show, for example, that the disparities decreased in Nepal and the Philippines, and remained constant in Indonesia, but increased in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Turkey, and Viet Nam. These disparities illuminate the inter-linkages across the MDGs \u2013 and suggest, for example, that promoting universal primary education (MDG2) and gender equality (MDG3) will also help reduce under-five mortality (MDG4).

Why should this be so when South Asia does not seem to fare as badly on many of the factors that might influence levels of malnutrition \u2013 income, food availability, health care and education? Even in South-East Asia the proportion of children underweight is strikingly high at 21 per cent. Earlier studies have found that one of the main causes is low birthweight. Women who are themselves undernourished tend to give birth to low-birthweight babies who are likely grow up as underweight children (Osmani and Bhargava,1998). These women are undernourished largely as a result of discrimination which means that they are likely to be in poor health before and during pregnancy. This picture for South Asia has been confirmed by an ESCAP modelling exercise for this report, using more recent data. The results are shown in the table below. In Model 1, child nutrition data from around the world were correlated with a number of contributing factors \u2013 poverty, the availability of antenatal care, urbanization, sanitation and food availability. These factors could, it seems, account for most of the variation in nutrition levels in Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean \u2013 predicting values close to the actual ones. For both South Asia and South-East Asia, however, this model\u2019s predictions were some way off. For South Asia, however, a second model that incorporated the additional variable of low birthweight brought the data into line. In this subregion low birthweight seems to be a critical factor.

In Turkey, on the other hand, while the overall rate is lower the risk of malnutrition remains higher for girls. In Armenia, both the overall rate and the girl-boy ratio have increased.

The greatest achievements have clearly been for poverty and for gender equality in education. But for some other goals, notably on child nutrition, child mortality and provision of basic sanitation, many countries are still moving too slowly. Moreover, gains at the national level can mask stark disparities within countries. The estimates above are based on data gathered before the 2008 global economic crisis. The section below highlights challenges to MDG achievement posed by the global financial crisis. The series of recent crises has put the achievement of the MDGs at risk. The global economic crisis start- ed in the West, but has subsequently been trans- mitted to the Asia-Pacific region through a number of channels including trade, equity markets, foreign direct investment, official development assistance and remittances. While the slowdown is likely to be felt first in higher unemployment, particularly in the export and tourism sectors, the effects are likely to ripple through Asia-Pacific economies, reducing employment and job creation, and leading to cuts in household and government budgets \u2013 with eventual consequences for the MDGs in terms of higher levels of poverty and threats to standards of health and education. The impact of the crisis on economic growth and poverty At this stage the empirical data to register the impact of the crisis is sparse. However, it is possible to estimate the likely damage by starting from projections of economic growth. Table I-4 shows two sets of estimates of economic growth, for 2009 and 2010. The first set was made in 2007, before the onset of the economic crisis, and the second in September 2009 by which time the contours of the crisis had become better defined. Comparing these two sets of columns enables an estimate of lost \u2013 or postponed \u2013 economic growth. The Philippines economy, for example, had previously been expected to grow by 5.6 per cent in 2010 but is now projected to grow by 3.3 per cent. From these growth forecasts it is possible to estimate the effect on mean consumption expenditures and hence on rates of poverty: since economic growth helps reduce poverty, slower growth will correspondingly mean that fewer people will escape from poverty. For details of the methodology, please see Annex 2. By late 2008 and early 2009, when the impact of the economic crisis was initially felt in Asia-Pacific, particularly through the trade channel, the forecasts of GDP growth of many Asia-Pacific countries were even lower than the numbers presented in Table I-4 \u2013China was expected to grow by only 6.5 per cent in 2009 and 7.5 per cent in 2010 (IMF, 2009e). These earlier estimates of GDP growth reflected the expectations at a time when the success of fiscal stimuli packages was unknown. Initial estimates of the effect of such reduced growth highlighted the potential of the crisis for pushing millions of people into poverty. Wan and Francisco (2009), for example, concluded in early 2009 that by 2010 the number of additional people trapped in poverty in Asia and the Pacific based on the $1.25-a-day poverty line would be 64 million, and based on the $2-a-day line, 70 million. Chen and Ravallion (2009), also using earlier data, and another methodology, produced estimates of 73 million ($1.25 a day) and 91 million ($2 a day) for the world as a whole. By mid-June 2009, the World Bank produced estimates of additional 35 million people in Asia trapped in poverty in 2009 (World Bank, 2009c). However, as many countries started to introduce large fiscal stimuli packages almost simultaneously, and their effects started to be felt in the real economy, forecasts of GDP growth were revised, reflecting the optimism with the 2009/10 economic performance of countries such China and India. On the basis of the revised estimates of economic growth of the 23 countries listed in Table I-4, in 2009 the crisis would trap an additional 17 million people below the poverty line of $1.25-a-day, and 21 million based on the $2-a-day poverty line. The crisis is expected to continue to have an impact on economic growth in 2010 with a cumulative increase of 21 million people in poverty based on $1.25-a-day poverty line, and 25 million based on the $2-a-day poverty line.

The Asia-Pacific region is connected with the global economy through multiple channels, including the trade in goods, tourism, foreign direct investment (FDI), official development assistance (ODA) and flows of remittances. The capacity of countries to cope with the crisis will depend on a number of factors, including their macroeconomic stability, their institutional capacities and their levels of social development. 2 These estimates of additional poverty due to the crisis are only indicative and may not capture the true extent of the problem. Some aspects of the methodology used \u2013 the assumption that incomes are log-normally distributed, or that the relation between GDP and household con- sumption during the crisis is similar to that without crisis \u2013 may lead to an underestimation of the additional number of people trapped in poverty. Further, these are estimates of the addition to the stock of poor people in 2009 or 2010. They do not capture the transient nature of poverty \u2013 that is people moving in and out of poverty \u2013 driven by the continuously changing state of the economy.

And in each country some social groups will be more vulnerable than others. However it can also be useful, even in general terms to envisage how a crisis might impinge differently from country to country.

Papua New Guinea, compared with other Pacific Island states, relies less on tourism and remittances (both account for less than 1 per cent of GDP), on ODA (5 per cent of GDP) or on FDI (2 per cent of GDP). It is reassuring to note that the region\u2019s two most populous countries are less vulnerable to the crisis. China, for example, although more exposed than India, has higher levels of reserves that make it better able to cope. Risks to the MDGs Each country\u2019s vulnerability can then be consid- ered in the context of its MDG achievement to as- sess how far it is at risk for each goal. The analy- sis presented in annex 3 indicates that among the countries studied, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Nepal are facing great- est risks in achieving MDG 1, given its combination of high poverty and high vulnerability. India and Bangladesh are also slow movers on poverty and have high poverty rates, but are less vulnerable to the crisis. Tajikistan appears the most vulnerable, due, among other things, to its exposure to remit- tances, but it has already achieved the poverty goal, and continues to make progress, so on this indicator is less at risk. For child malnutrition indicator too, the countries at greatest risk are Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Nepal. Armenia and Pakistan which have much higher levels of malnutrition also are the most vulnerable. India and Bangladesh, which have the highest under- five children underweight rates \u2013 48 and 46 per cent respectively \u2013 but appear less vulnerable to the crisis. The countries at greatest risk on child mortality are Cambodia, Pakistan and Solomon Islands. The countries at greatest risk on primary enrolment are the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Cambodia, Pakistan and Nepal. The effect on women Broad estimates of the impact of the crisis on poverty also say little about how this burden will 34 be distributed amongst the most vulnerable groups within the poor. Among those likely to be hurt most are women. Women constitute the majority of Asia\u2019s low-skilled, low-salaried, and temporary workers \u2013 part of the flexible workforce that can easily be left behind during economic downturns. Many have lost their jobs in export manufacturing, including garments, textiles and electronics \u2013 and in tourism and related services (Box I-9). For example, in Thailand between May 2008 and May 2009, the number of unemployed women increased by 47 per cent while the number of unemployed men increased by 15 per cent. In Sri Lanka, between the first and second quarters of Box I-9 Employment impact of the crisis The crisis, through the various channels identified in this chapter,, has affected the working and living conditions of people in Asia and the Pacific, underscoring the need to revitalize efforts to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young people \u2013 MDG target (1B). Prior to the onset of the global economic crisis in 2007, the ILO estimated that there were some 86.5 million people unemployed in the Asia-Pacific region. The number of unemployed is projected to rise to more than 98 million in 2009, an increase of nearly 12 million (ILO, 2009b). Between 2007 and 2009, the regional unemployment rate would thus increase from 4.7 to 5.1 per cent.

In Indonesia, between February 2008 and February 2009, the number of employees expanded by only 1.4 per cent while the number of casual workers not in agriculture increased by around 7.3 per cent. In Thailand, between the first and second quarters of 2009, as a result of an expansion in government employment, the number of waged employees grew by 0.6 per cent while the number of own-account workers increased by 3.2 per cent, and contributing family workers by 3.3 per cent. This underlines the need for stronger systems of social protection, including unemployment insurance, and for extending the coverage of social security to the informal economy. These issues are discussed in Chapter III.

In countries with high child mortality rates, the fall in household incomes could further increase infant and child deaths, with disproportionate effects on women and girls (Sabarwal, Sinha and Buvinic, 2009). Another channel through which women\u2019s income might be affected is through reduced flows of microfinance \u2013 for which women are the principal clients. As a result of the global crisis, microfinance institutions that get their funds from local and international commercial banks are likely face tighter credit markets \u2013 with implications for millions of women borrowers. In India, for instance, around 500 commercial, regional and cooperative banks are indirectly involved in microfinance and may choose to scale back much-needed loans to women. Box I-11 \u2013 Households under pressure rely more on women\u2019s work As households come under pressure, women have to work even harder \u2013 as the providers of last resort. In Indonesia, for example, in 1997 and 1998, following the Asian financial crisis, analysis of the Indonesian Family Life Survey revealed that the proportion of the male labour force employed decreased by 1.3 per cent, while the proportion of the female labour force employed increased by 1 per cent. When unpaid work was also included, work increased for both men and women, but only by 1.3 per cent for men compared with 7 per cent for women. A survey conducted by the Indonesian statistical office sixteen months after the onset of the crisis also revealed household coping strategies \u2013 with an increase in labour market participation for older married women with children. Similarly in the Philippines, between 1997 and 1998, both male and female labour force participation rates increased, but while the weekly work hours of employed men fell, those for employed women rose \u2013 partly because women working at home did more work on subcontract. Moreover, women in the Philippines typically spend almost 8 hours a day on housekeeping and child care compared about 2 and a half hours for men. Women are also severely affected by any reduction in publicly provided social services and social safety nets. Because of their traditional gender roles, women depend more on such services. Cuts in such spending will therefore hurt women and girls more, and potentially lead to reversals in gains made in gender-related MDG targets (UNIFEM, 2008a; UNIFEM, 2008b). Protecting the gains The global economic crisis \u2013 and any future crises \u2013 could therefore have serious implications for achievements of the MDGs \u2013 with some countries and social groups especially exposed for particular indicators. How can countries protect their people from the impact of such events? The next chapter will consider their options for tailoring economic stimulus packages so that they not only serve to kick-start sluggish economies but also lay firmer foundations for long-term development.

Governments can, however, take measures to protect their citizens, designing fiscal stimulus packages that can both help revive economic growth and also aid progress towards the MDGs. The world has suffered a once-in-a-century financial crisis that has dragged the global economy into a recession. As indicated in the previous chapter, countries across the region are expected to suffer a slowdown in economic growth, some even slipping into a recession. This will have adverse consequences for the poor, and slow progress towards achieving MDGs. In the richer countries, governments that wish to protect citizens during a steep downturn do not need to rely entirely on new policies. They can instead depend to some extent on \u2018automatic stabilizers\u2019 such as progressive income tax regimes which, as incomes drop, permit people to pay a smaller proportion of their incomes as tax. And if workers lose their jobs they will usually get un- employment benefit. During a recession these stabilizers help dampen the effects of an economic downturn by transferring resources from govern- ments to citizens. They also have the advantage of kicking in automatically, so they work quickly and then fall away when the recession is over. Moreover they are usually well targeted and do not leak away to many unintended beneficiaries. Many developing countries, however, generally do not have these options.

For rich and poor countries alike, an alternative, or a supplement, to automatic stabilizers is discretionary fiscal policy. This involves the government stepping in with new measures. On the revenue side it may, for example, reduce tax rates \u2013 such as the standard VAT rate \u2013 and on the expenditure side it may accelerate public spending on infrastructure so as to generate additional employment. A government may make such adjustments on a regular basis in an attempt to fine tune the economy or generally promote long-term economic growth. But when it does so on a large scale at times of severe economic crisis, in the hope of quickly restoring economic growth and employment, this is considered to be a \u2018fiscal stimulus\u2019. Some people are doubtful about the value of fiscal policies in general on the grounds that they distort economies and can be badly timed and ineffective. Instead, they would prefer to use monetary policies \u2013 typically by adjusting interest rates. Proponents of fiscal policies argue, however, that, when interest rates are already very low, fiscal policies are the only option. Such policies are particularly appropriate when the problems are caused not by low productivity or weak infrastructure but rather by external shocks that have left the economy with excess capacity that might usefully be absorbed by a surge in demand. In fact, evidence from both advanced and emerg- ing economies indicates that both tax cuts and higher public spending can work \u2013 though these fiscal packages need to be carefully designed 40 (IMF, 2008). Of the two, tax cuts tend to be less ef- fective, or at least slower acting, since tax payers may choose to hoard their gains rather than spend them. Government spending on the other hand should deliver a boost more quickly. However, some forms of government spending, such as on infrastructure development, by their very nature, are not easy to turn on or turn off in response to changing economic conditions. Moreover they of- ten take effect only after a time lag, so cannot turn the economy around quickly. Another problem with government spending is that, after a reces- sion is over, it is usually politically difficult to cut spending \u2013 which tends to be \u2018sticky downwards\u2019. One way of avoiding this is to lock such policies to indicators that reflect the economic cycle \u2013 so that, similar to automatic stabilizers, fiscal meas- ures appear and disappear according to economic circumstances rather than to political expediency. Fiscal impact of the crisis A government\u2019s capacity to undertake such stimulus packages will depend, however, upon its fiscal health. This in itself will have been damaged by the economic slowdown through falls in tax revenue, both direct and indirect, resulting in fiscal imbalances. The government may respond either by borrowing, with a corresponding rise in debt. Or it could cut development expenditure \u2013 with potentially serious implications for the MDGs. Based on previous patterns in the region, a 1 percentage point fall in per capita GDP growth translates on average, depending on the country, into a 0.5\u20130.8 percentage point decrease in the growth of per capita private health spending, a 0.5\u20130.7 percentage point decrease in the growth of per capita public health expenditure, and a 0.3\u20130.5 percentage point decrease in the growth of per capita public education spending (Wan and Fransisco, 2009). In Fiji, for example, a one percentage point decrease in economic growth in year one translates into a 0.6 percentage point fall in the growth of per capita public health expenditure in year 1, a 0.2 percentage point fall in year 2 and a 0.1 percentage point fall in year 3 \u2013 so the total fall is 0.9 percentage points. Based on historical experience, the short-term impact seems likely to be greater on private compared with public health expenditure, and somewhat lower on public education. But per capita public expenditure on education is usually far higher than that on health, so the per capita reduction in education expenditure will be far higher. To check what has actually happened so far on the fiscal front during this crisis, this section examines the changes in fiscal deficit, indicators of debt sustainability and public expenditure on social sectors, in particular education and health.

The Asian financial crisis of 1997, for example, resulted in a reduction in health spending (WHO 2009). This time, however, this does not appear to have happened, or at least not yet. Apart from Samoa, none of the governments surveyed here for whom data are available for FY-2009 has reduced expenditure on the social sector in total \u2013 or specifically on education or health (Table II-5). Indeed, most have increased them and, despite the prospect of higher deficits, most appear determined to protect social-sector spending. This may not be too difficult. As seen earlier, most run fiscal deficits of less than 3.5 per cent of GDP. In many countries the economies are now showing signs of recovery, so they should be able to protect their social sectors. And even those South Asian countries with deficits around 5 per cent or more should not find this too difficult, as economic growth has remained reasonably high throughout the crisis period and is showing some signs of acceleration. Moreover, high domestic savings should, in principle, enable some countries to maintain social spending and also support their economies with financial stimulus packages. And since they have low debt service ratios they also have scope for raising more external financing. When the crisis passes, countries should then be able to reduce the counter-cyclical components of expenditures while making efforts to generate more revenues, for example, through reforms in taxation that will enable them to reduce the deficits.

Current fiscal stimulus packages in major economies Fiscal stimulus packages appeared on a large scale around the world from 2008. To combat the recession, and prevent the global economy sinking into depression, the governments of the world\u2019s major economies announced some dramatic measures. The US Congress, for example, approved a $787 billion stimulus package; the Chinese Government announced 4 trillion Yuan spending plans; while the stimulus packages of major European countries France, Germany and the UK add up to $146 billion (Table II-6).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6fac027-1424-4b08-938a-bc3486de9237": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6fac027-1424-4b08-938a-bc3486de9237", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66e226030021a692bbdf2f057a57674196be6eba5fd9da78422b627cd8d78de6"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8085291-09fb-405a-ac13-03a8bbb1fa6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e50f75a0e4965c11a391e6dd69e7ab206439cde1a4492c97c660bf856b61563"}}, "hash": "12fc1bbc2871d9fd9e5bc06e45203d4fd4938a823971a0e4734623bd57176427", "text": "Country Size of package Types of stimulus National currency (billions) US $ (billions) As percentage of GDP USA $ 787 787 5.5 Public spending, tax cuts, France \u20ac 26 36 1.3 State investment, support for state-owned enterprises Germany \u20ac 59 81 2.3 Public spending, tax cuts, incentives for auto purchases U.K. \u00a3 20 29 1.4 VAT cut to 15 per cent, infrastructure investment Japan \u00a5 27,000 298 5.3 Direct cash payments, public projects, tax refunds for new houses China CNY 4,000 585 13.3 Infrastructure, low-cost housing, tax cuts India Rs.1,860 38 3.5 Infrastructure spending Russian Federation RUR 1,576 53 3.8 Tax cuts Note: The analysis here uses a cut-off date of June 30 2009 Source: UNDP, 2009 Table II-6 \u2013 Stimulus packages of some major countries 45 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99913efd-5daa-4eb2-b2b0-1bd876987cee": {"__data__": {"id_": "99913efd-5daa-4eb2-b2b0-1bd876987cee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa80e3acbaf32815210e23d83a90874ef69863d6b0820d5d33307bbf355d4b52"}}, "hash": "fa80e3acbaf32815210e23d83a90874ef69863d6b0820d5d33307bbf355d4b52", "text": "OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 Each country has designed its own package in accordance with its own fiscal conditions and the perceived and actual severity of the economic slowdown. China has had the largest package \u2013 benefiting from strong reserves and low debt, it was able to commit 13.3 per cent of GDP. India, on the other hand was fiscally more constrained so its efforts were on a smaller scale at about 3.5 per cent of the GDP. Since these packages are to be implemented over several years, however, even the apparently huge US and Chinese packages will amount only to 2 per cent of GDP per year. Having so many countries introduce such packages simultaneously should in principle deliver an economic boost to the whole world. But the global impact has to some extent been muted by protectionism. The bill authorizing the US package, for example, has a \u2018buy American\u2019 provision which stipulates that construction of public buildings and public works generally should use US iron, steel, and other manufactured goods \u2013 limiting the opportunities for global participation. France and Germany have taken a similar stance in their support for domestic auto industries. Estimating the multiplier effect The prime objective of the fiscal stimulus packages has been to restore economic growth. In Asia and the Pacific this has primarily meant compensating for the loss of export demand from the developed economies. What will be the effect? This will depend not just on the size of the packages but also on the \u2018fiscal multipliers\u2019 and the composition of stimulus measures. One of the key insights of British economist John Maynard Keynes was that government spending would not just create demand directly but also have a \u2018multiplier effect\u2019 \u2013 as workers employed on government projects, for example, in turn spent their income they would stimulate further demand which would ripple through the economy. Thus the impact of the initial stimulus could be multiplied two or three times. A more pessimistic view was that instead of triggering greater private expenditure, government spending would \u2018crowd out\u2019 private expenditure \u2013 in which case the multiplier might be much smaller, or even turn negative if government investment displaced a potentially larger volume of private investment. There are two major techniques for estimating such multipliers. One, based on macroeconomic models, has concluded that multipliers tend to be higher in the short term than the long term. In Japan, for example, for the period 1977-1989, such modelling suggests that the short-term multiplier was 1.30 in the first year but dwindled to 0.86 in the third year perhaps because the crowding out effect became more significant later on (OECD, 2000). Another technique \u2013 using \u2018reduced form equations\u2019 \u2013 finds that the multipliers are smaller: one study has estimated that for US government spending in the post-war period the short-term multiplier was only 0.8. Another analysis for five OECD countries for the period of 1960-2000 concluded that the short- term multipliers varied considerably from country to country \u2013 1.3 in Germany but only 0.3 in Canada and the UK (Blanchard and Perotti, 2002) \u2013 and that in some cases they turned negative. The IMF (2009) provided a survey of fiscal multipliers for several countries based on past studies. The study indicated that the size of the fiscal multiplier is country-, time-, and circumstance-specific. According to the study a rule of thumb is a multiplier of 1.5 to 1 for spending multipliers in large countries, 1 to 0.5 for medium-sized countries, and 0.5 or less for small, open countries. The five crucial determinants of the fiscal multiplier are as follows: the size of the fiscal stimulus, its composition in terms of the balance between government expenditure and tax cuts, the magnitude of automatic stabilisers, the amount of fiscal space and the extent of taxation of the financial system, and the housing and equity markets (Chhibber and Palanivel, 2009). Government spending, which enters the economy straightaway, will tend to have a larger multiplier than tax cuts since the richer social groups may simply hoard the benefits of lower taxes by adding them to their savings. But there can also be differential impacts even within various forms of government expenditure. Investing in many large infrastructure projects, for example, takes time to organize so will benefit the economy only in the future. Another important consideration is whether the stimulus benefits primarily the rich or the poor. Expenditure for the poor is likely to kick in more quickly since the poor are likely to spend any income more vigorously.

Biasing stimulus packages towards the MDGs Towards the end of 2008 or early 2009, in response to the crisis, a number of Asia-Pacific economies announced stimulus packages, some of which were quite large in relation to GDP (Figure II-1). In most cases, they were aiming to boost economic growth by reviving aggregate demand. Often they involved expanding public expenditure on infrastructure, such as roads and power supplies, combined with cuts in taxes goods and services, especially fuel, along with subsidies for exports and cuts in infrastructure. If fiscal stimulus packages have a strong compo- nent of social expenditures this is likely to produce a double dividend \u2013 not only boosting growth more rapidly but also aiding progress towards the MDGs. To what extent are the packages in Asia and the Pacific serving this dual purpose? To estimate this, they can be divided roughly into two parts. The first part consists of spending on social, pro- poor sectors which might be termed \u2018pro-MDG\u2019. Bangladesh, for example, allocated 12.8 per cent of its package for social protection \u2013 measures that provide a social floor that can cushion the impact of the crisis on the poor and vulnerable groups such as poor women (Box II-1). The second part consists of investment in non-social, non-poor sectors, ex- penditures which might be termed \u2018MDG neutral\u2019. This is not to say that \u2018MDG-neutral\u2019 expenditure will not also be beneficial for the MDGs, merely that it will do so indirectly and give them a smaller boost than the pro-MDG expenditure. Also, infrastructure projects sometimes contain pro-poor components, but as detailed information on these projects are not readily available, for the sake of simplicity these have been classified as \u2018MDG-neutral\u2019. Table II-7 breaks down the content of Asia-Pacific fiscal stimuli packages into these two types of expenditure in qualitative terms. This shows a mixed picture. China, Hong Kong, China, the Philippines, Malaysia, and India have largely taken a fairly traditional path of investing in large-scale infrastructure \u2013 which can be regarded as MDG neutral. However these countries may also have pro-MDG expenditure. China, for example, has an allocation for low-income housing, and for improving rural living standards, health care and education.

On the upside, new spending on basic social services such as health, education, and basic sanitation represents investments that would not only allow the poor continued access to essential services, but also reduce the pressure on women to take on unpaid work (Fukuda-Parr, 2009). Fiscal support to firms in export- and labour-intensive industries and SMEs could also help mitigate job losses among women, who in these sectors make up the majority of workers. Likewise, targeted fiscal support to consumers in the form of cash transfers or subsidies could cushion the impact of the crisis on women. The same is true with social protection schemes. Much would depend on how the targets are identified and informed, and how resources are ultimately allocated to gender-responsive measures. Targeting women is critical, since programmes which tackle both life- cycle and work-related vulnerabilities, such as the burden of childcare, lead to more sustainable social benefits.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bd7aec7-ef52-4387-9e1c-8267f92c857f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bd7aec7-ef52-4387-9e1c-8267f92c857f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de15579858a3adb04edf400191604705a3b8c59fc88306db1b36cc84c290d458"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e914c79-af81-4812-be49-81bff7ee15b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55b2477b7225f9706d5d2c2c4cb4b3b4ca02fe8471afd1e0728225a8de450c51"}}, "hash": "3423bb0a9f8a276432368b9a12ad0abbb79613b39c36c2fa365df63b80f62538", "text": "Pro-MDG MDG- neutral China Sichuan post-earthquake reconstruction; rural development; environmental protection; low-rent housing; social services Large-scale infrastructure projects; technical innovation Hong Kong, China Social services Job creation and internships; capital outlays for infrastructure; salary tax reduction The Philippines Benefits to social security Government employment; rehabilitation of public buildings; infrastructure development; tax cuts Malaysia Guarantee for private companies; direct budget spending; equity investment; public private partnerships; projects including airport expansion Thailand Cash handout to low income groups; subsidies for education, utilities, and transport; rural development; low interest loans for small firms Singapore Infrastructure; health and education development Bank lending; tax measure and grants; cash, utilities, and tax rebates; employee training Indonesia Labour-intensive infrastructure projects; subsidies Corporate tax incentives; guarantees and discount; pay increases for government staff India Expansion of National rural employment guarantee scheme and the women fund (Rashtriya Mahila Kosh) Higher spending on infrastructure; access to credit and protection of employment; capital injections in banks; removal of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5ae0277-cdbc-4365-a0a5-e938a3e65890": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5ae0277-cdbc-4365-a0a5-e938a3e65890", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb8a142a20297c221de01e350a79e5ab8ec8c32b3f309e5a8a947a137647364d"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f04f8d4-4e83-4ca1-a606-610398a2c25d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e0d55d7e6022725ffcd1f1ffab89806816323776f7a51cd1ca2dd1677501d88"}}, "hash": "87e512a58e94c9ce7de3f5794d50946cb77dbb3114ab6636ad120bb8a982d7e9", "text": "cap on external borrowing; raising limits on corporate bonds; lower service tax rates; lower ad valorem taxes; increased living allowance for government employees Table II-7 \u2013 Character of fiscal stimulus packages in selected Asia-Pacific countries and economy 48 How much difference would it make if countries made more efforts to follow the pro-MDG path? This can be estimated in rough terms by considering the likelihood that the poor and the non-poor will spend money rather than save it \u2013 their different \u2018propensities to consume\u2019. The poor have a higher propensity to consume, so any pro- MDG government spending, especially in the way of a direct transfer to the poor, is likely to prompt further expenditure by the poor and thus have a higher multiplier than MDG-neutral expenditure. On this basis it is possible to decompose the overall fiscal multiplier into two parts \u2013 the pro-MDG multiplier and the MDG-neutral multiplier \u2013 and estimate their separate contributions to growth. The methodology for this is presented in Annex 4. This exercise has been carried out for a number of countries or territories and the results are presented in Table II-8. In China, for example, the stimulus package is 13.3 per cent of GDP. Using the value of 1.6 as an estimate of China\u2019s multiplier 4 Thus, if only 2 percent of GDP is spent out of the stimulus package in China in the first year (as is likely as mentioned earlier in this chapter) and the multiplier value realized in the first year is only half of its total value, then the GDP increase in the first year resulting from the stimu- lus is only 1.6 percent while the total increase is 21.3 percent. would result in a total increase in GDP of 21.3 per cent, spread over a number of years. The impact on the first year would depend on the proportion of the stimulus package actually spent in the year, and the extent of the multiplier value realized within the first year. An examination of the content of China\u2019s packages suggests that close to a quarter of the stimulus was pro-MDG, while the rest was MDG neutral. Based on the propensity to consume, the multiplier for pro-MDG spending was estimated at 2.9 while that for MDG-neutral spending was only 1.2. On this basis, about 41 per cent of the increase in GDP resulting from China\u2019s stimulus would come from its pro-MDG component.

In China, for example, the resulting GDP increase would have been not 21.3 per cent but 38.0 per cent. But the gains would be proportionately even larger for the other economies, whose packages had a much lower pro- MDG bias. In Hong Kong, China the corresponding increase would have been from 8.4 to 18.8 per cent, in the Philippines from 6.2 to 12.0 per cent, and in Viet Nam from 13.6 to 25.8 per cent. Simple calculations of this type can only give a general indication of what might happen. The actual scale of the boost will depend on many underlying assumptions and judgements about each stimulus package. One task, for example, is to distinguish between new measures that form part of a stimulus package and those which simply represent developments in ongoing government policy. So while it may be relatively easy to classify ad hoc measures and announcements as stimulus measures, it may be more difficult to identify measures that are embedded in the current budget (Box II-2). A further matter of judgement concerns the choice of the elements of the package to be considered pro-MDG. Some infrastructure development \u2013 such as that designed to promote green growth \u2013 can also be considered pro-MDG (Box II-3). Box II-2 \u2013 Indian budget stimuli for 2009-2010 will benefit the poor India\u2019s first budget stimulus, along with monetary measures to facilitate the flow of funds to productive sec- tors, is expected to help the country maintain about 6-7 per cent growth in 2009. Much of the stimulus came in the form of tax relief to boost demand, along with greater expenditure on public projects to create employ- ment and public assets. The 2009-2010 budget maintains this expansionary fiscal stance, but also directs more of the spending to the poor, and targets more resources towards women. One of the principal channels is the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) which in 2008-09 provided employment opportunities to around 45 million households. In 2009-10 the NREGS budget will be more than doubled and it will be amalgamated with other schemes relating to agriculture, water resources, land resources, and rural roads. There will also be a fivefold increase in the budget of Rashtriya Mahila Kosh \u2013 the National Credit Fund for Women Fund. This will enable it to extend its microcredit services to women, and develop new activities. The budget also allows for greater expenditure on infrastructure. It increases the allocation for highways by 23 per cent and railways by 46 per cent. Expenditure on urban infrastructure via the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission has been increased by 87 per cent along with other measures to provide the urban areas more with more housing and basic amenities. Source: Kalinga Times, 2009 51 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 There are also judgements to be made about the size of the various multipliers. The estimates of multipliers used in these examples are drawn from separate individual country studies. Given the importance of determining the impact of stimulus packages, and the faith placed on them by governments to compensate for any loss of growth due to the global recession, a more rigorous study to estimate multiplier values in Asian developing countries appears necessary. Nevertheless, this study indicates that they may have some grounds for optimism \u2013 though much depends too on the extent to which governments actually implement these stimulus packages.

The total benefit, assuming reasonably long-term multipliers, may not be realized until some time after the initial investment. To simplify matters, but still arrive at some indication of the overall dimensions, it is assumed here that the growth takes place at the same time as the fiscal stimulus, which also means that the population remains constant \u2013 so the rate of GDP growth is the same as the rate of GDP growth per capita. This will result in an overestimation but would still give a sense of the general scale. The results are shown in Table II-9, using the same multipliers employed in Table III-8. This shows that the largest percentage changes in the indicator values are for poverty, followed by those for health and education. In the Philippines, for example, the stimulus package could have reduced the poverty ratio by 7.5 per cent and the under-five mortality rate by 3.8 per cent. Box II-3 \u2013 Stimulating green growth in the Republic of Korea The world is facing both an economic crisis and an environmental crisis, which includes global warming. While gov- ernment stimulus packages generally focus on restoring economic growth, they can also promote more inclusive and sustainable development by ensuring that this growth is \u2018green\u2019. The Republic of Korea has shown a strong commitment to \u2018greening\u2019 the economy and has designed its stimulus package, worth around 3 per cent of GDP, to direct growth along a low-carbon path. Some 80 per cent of the package is dedicated to measures which, over the next four years, will create almost one million green jobs.

Seeking a double dividend Each country that introduces a stimulus package will have mixed motives \u2013 generally hoping to boost economic growth in both short and long terms. For some countries the threat of an economic downturn can provide an opportunity to increase spending on large-scale infrastructure that will build a platform for greater productive capacities in the future. For other countries, however, the major objective may be to protect the poor so they will be looking to focus the boost more on social safety nets.

In future, rather than sim- ply reacting to emergencies and other contingencies as they arise, the countries of the region should instead be able to offer much greater long-term socio-economic security, based not only on a solid foundation of human rights and social inclusiveness, but also on a commitment to equitable economic development and achieving the MDGs. Both developed and developing countries, aiming to reduce the vulnerability of the poorest house- holds, have been expanding their systems of social protection \u2013 which can include social insurance, social assistance, labour market services, various social services particularly for women and children, and many types of local funds such as microcredit schemes (Box III-1). Developed countries are now particularly concerned about the ageing of their populations and are seeking to achieve generational equity. As dependency rates rise, they have to find ways of sharing resources between today\u2019s workers and the growing number of older dependents, in ways that are both financially prudent and sustainable. For the Asia-Pacific developing countries, the challenges are different. They have more limited government resources and a significant proportion of their workers are in the informal sector. Generally, therefore, their systems of social protection are more limited. Nevertheless, as states achieve higher growth and become richer, they should be in a better position to protect their citizens. If they are to ensure sustained progress they will have to achieve the MDGs in a more equitable and inclusive way. In particular, they need to address the impact of globalization. Globalization, by fostering economic growth has helped reduce poverty, but it has also heightened risks and exposed many more people to international price shocks. Many people have failed to benefit from globalization and have been pushed to the margins. International food and fuel prices especially have become much more volatile: between January 2006 and June 2008 international prices of food grains, which account for more than half of total calories in developing countries, increased by 150 per cent. Globalization has also accelerated international financial flows, but in so doing has heightened the potential for transmitting global financial crises. The Asian crisis in the late 1990s and the current economic crisis have demonstrated that suddenly declining output and rising unemployment can jeopardize hard-won gains in human development. With no, or very small, unemployment benefits the unemployed \u2013 women in particular \u2013 usually end up as casual, own-account or family workers, and there is now evidence of faster rise in these types of employment in several Asia-Pacific countries following the economic crisis. According to the ILO, in East Asia more than half the workforce is in unstable \u2018vulnerable employment\u2019, while in South- East Asia and the Pacific and in South Asia the proportion rises to 60 per cent or more (ILO, 2008). Meanwhile, other forms of modernization and migration have undermined more traditional 56 Box III-1 \u2013 Social protection terminology Different countries provide social protection in diverse ways \u2013 according to their own values, traditions and institutional and political structures. They can also use different terminology. This report uses the following terms: Social protection \u2013 This is the overall umbrella term and its usage has evolved considerably in the past few decades. In general it is a society\u2019s set of policies and programmes designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability \u2013 and includes both statutory and non- statutory provisions. In this report it is used in an inclusive sense, building upon the frameworks developed by the ILO, ADB and the World Bank. Thus social protection programmes can prevent individuals from slipping into poverty (employment guarantee and insurance), promote opportunities and economic risks (crop insurance) while also transforming communities and societies (human capital and health). It may have each of the following components. First, social insurance, which provides benefits such as unemployment pay. This is often based partly on prior contributions by beneficiaries. Second, social assistance, which could be universal, such as free or subsidized public food distribution, or targeted, such as conditional cash transfers. Third, social services, typically including affordable housing, electricity, and basic health care services, such as child care, maternal care and immunization, which are provided free to children or other target groups. Fourth, labour market policies such as establishing unemployment offices or providing retraining that reduces workers\u2019 vulnerability. Fifth, a child protection component to ensure that tomorrow\u2019s leaders and teachers are protected.

Social insurance \u2013 The underlying principle is that of shared risk across the whole society. Its mechanisms are often embodied in national legislation. Certain events trigger payments \u2013 such as unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, maternity benefits or old- age pensions. The schemes are usually funded by contributions from up to three sources: individuals, employers, and governments. The benefits paid often vary according to the level of contribution from the individual: those who contribute more or work longer, for example, typically get higher payments. However, more recent social insurance schemes are strengthening the redistributive component. Social assistance \u2013 This refers to those parts of social protection systems that are funded from general government revenues and by some NGOs and international donors. Benefits are paid according to need and bear no relation to what beneficiaries have paid as taxes. Indeed the beneficiaries are very often those who have paid the least tax. This would include, for example, food subsidies and emergency food distribution. In some countries such systems are called \u2018social safety nets\u2019; in others they are termed \u2018welfare\u2019. Social services \u2013 These are some essential and basic services and are included in social protection because they often substitute for missing markets. The provision of free or subsidized health services for children and pregnant women, safe water and basic electricity fall under this category. Social funds \u2013 These consist of agencies or programmes that give grants to communities for small-scale development projects that involve the active participation of local actors, such as community groups, local governments and NGOs. These funds typically finance a wide variety of socio-economic infrastructure, from health services to water supplies to micro-finance. Social funds are often concerned with local development and hence contribute to social protection. Social safety net \u2013 This is another term for social assistance, which tends to be used more in developing countries and at times of emergency. Social security \u2013 This term is used in different ways. Sometimes it corresponds to social insurance, sometimes it corresponds to social protection because it affords greater security to society. 57 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 forms of household and community support, especially in the expanding urban areas. In these circumstances, children, women and older people especially, can become much less secure. And in the coming decades the share of the elderly in most Asian and Pacific populations is also expected to grow: according to current projections, between 2000 and 2025 the number of people aged 65 years and above will more than double. A further and dangerous source of vulnerability is the increasing frequency of natural disasters \u2013 some of which are linked to global warming \u2013 including floods and droughts. Finally, the Asia Pacific region has the world\u2019s highest population of displaced persons. A special set of interventions is needed to protect, reintegrate and rehabilitate displaced people, particularly in post-conflict countries. Individuals are, however, not just subject to shocks transmitted through the economy or the environment, they also have to deal with catastrophic household events \u2013 sudden illness, for example, family breakup from forced migration, or the premature death of the main income earner. Poor households are especially threatened. This is partly because they are more exposed \u2013 living in difficult conditions and lacking the assets that might buffer them against shocks. But they are also less able to cope. Poor communities have always had to be resilient and have developed remarkable abilities to manage risk. Nevertheless, living perpetually on the brink, they can suddenly be plunged into greater poverty. For example, when food prices spiral the poor have to concentrate on getting enough to eat \u2013 even at the expense of the family\u2019s education or health. As a result, in the absence of effective social protection systems, many households that can survive in normal circumstances suddenly find themselves struggling below the poverty line. Since the poor cannot afford most forms of insurance they should be able to rely on public provision to make up for the \u2018missing market\u2019. When the backbone of informal systems of support comes under stress, people should be able to turn for support to more formal systems. This can be supplemented by contributions from different elements of civil society, NGOs, community groups and society at large \u2013 participating in the design, management and delivery of social protection. Many countries in the region are now therefore re-examining ways of offering better protection to their citizens. This is not just to respond to the risks arising from the recent crises but also to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20c6b49d-8861-4b46-8a15-303e31c060d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "20c6b49d-8861-4b46-8a15-303e31c060d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca4e5aaacefedbc66a2398f2c130f9f390cf9d49c96f92d2795eb48791ae6c54"}}, "hash": "ca4e5aaacefedbc66a2398f2c130f9f390cf9d49c96f92d2795eb48791ae6c54", "text": "provide a foundation for more robust economic development, since economic growth is unlikely to be sustainable unless the gains are equitably shared. The best way to achieve the MDGs is thus through inclusive and pro-poor growth, along with increased social justice, investment in human and physical capital, and the provision of productive employment. This will enable people to protect themselves more effectively and take advantage of many pathways out of poverty. Social protection and the Millennium Develop- ment Goals Social protection measures are not explicitly included within the MDGS, but they can be critical to achieving them. At the same time, policies aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals will also address many forms of insecurity. Social protection and the MDGs thus have a symbiotic relationship. For example, households that are less prone to economic failure will feel more confident about committing themselves to new enterprises or technologies that might help them escape poverty. Even more directly, the forms of social protection that serve to support the health and welfare of children and mothers will promote the goals related to child survival and gender while increasing future productivity and output. Conversely, failures in social protection will undermine MDG achievement and increase vulnerability. Households faced with a sudden financial shock may, for example, have to divert microcredit loans from productive investment into consumption. And, desperate for income, they may withdraw children, particularly girls, from school in order to work. They will also have less to spend on health especially on preventive care. They are thus forced to take measures that are against their long- term interests. The following sections explore in greater detail the ways in which the Millennium Development Goals are closely allied to social protection. 58 MDG-1 \u2013 Eradicate extreme poverty Social protection directly contributes to the achievement of MDG1 by transferring resources to the poor, smoothing their incomes and protecting their assets, while also building community assets \u2013 human and physical. It also allows people to take informed risks. When individuals and households feel vulnerable, they may engage in \u2018adverse behaviour\u2019 that reduces their chances of escaping from poverty. They might, for example, choose less risky but also less rewarding activities. Thus rather than investing in more productive assets they might hold jewellery or cash. Rather than trying to raise crop yields they may plant drought-resistant but low-yielding varieties. And rather than specializing in one or two productive ventures they may try to smooth their income by working in a range of smaller but less productive activities. Better social protection will also reduce household vulnerability by buffering the impact of current and future shocks. For poor families, this should enable them to rise above the poverty line. For those who are a little better off, it should provide a cushion that would keep them floating above the line even after a severe shock. MDG-2 \u2013 Achieve universal primary education Providing primary education for all children has many benefits for society. Empirical evidence confirms the close link between family income and the education of children. A family that experiences a severe shock such as the illness of a breadwinner, may well pull a child out of school and send him or her to work, both to augment income and to pay for the costs of medical treatment. But this immediate response can have serious long-term consequences. Social protection can also improve the quality of education by encouraging parents to send their children to school on a regular basis. Some of the most comprehensive schemes are conditional cash transfer programmes, which have been very successful in Mexico and Brazil, for example, and are now being introduced in Asia and the Pacific. The Asia-Pacific region also has a long history of programmes to encourage attendance, such as school-feeding programmes. Another option, as with Bangladesh\u2019s food-for-education programme is to provide a subsidy to the whole household if the children are going to school. There have also been transfer programmes at times of emergency: during the 1997 financial crisis, Indonesia, for example, mounted a large scholarship programme to safeguard enrolment. Some social protection programmes can even increase the number of schools. Although traditional labour-intensive public works programmes focus on providing temporary income to their workers, they can also create and maintain infrastructure such as school buildings or access roads. Targeted social funds can also be used to rehabilitate schools and make them more child-friendly.

The risks women face can be gender specific, or they could be intensified or imposed on by gender discrimination. Many countries are therefore adopting a two-pronged approach \u2013 mainstreaming gender while also specifically promoting social protection and gender equity. Social protection can reduce gender disparities and empower women \u2013 while challenging existing social relations. However, much will depend on programme design and implementation. In Indonesia, for example, following the Asian financial crisis, job creation schemes often failed to cushion the impact on women\u2019s employment and income. This was partly a result of gender bias, not only in the type of work provided, which often required physical strength, but also in the process of selecting participants. This outcome is not inevitable. In India\u2019s National Rural Employment Guarantee programme around 40 per cent of the workers are women. Moreover, women\u2019s employment opportunities can be enhanced by expanding the concept of \u2018public works\u2019 to include employment-intensive social infrastructure projects and service delivery \u2013 such as auxiliary health care, care for the elderly, childcare, early childhood development, and 59 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 youth development. These activities attract and employ women while lessening their burden of unpaid work (Dejardin and Owens 2009, and Elson 2008). Ongoing labour market activities, including training and other schemes, are also important for promoting gender equality \u2013 and are likely to increase the demand for girls\u2019 education. Informal community-based mechanisms such as social funds and micro-insurance schemes can also make an important contribution to gender empowerment (Box III-2). However, these informal mechanisms should not be treated as replacements for publicly-provided mechanisms. MDG-4 \u2013 Reduce child mortality; MDG-5 \u2013 Improve maternal health; MDG-6 \u2013 Combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases MDGs 4 to 6 are grouped together because of the similarity in the social protection interventions that address them. Affordable and quality healthcare services will contribute to all these goals, but they can be supplemented by social protection interventions such as widows\u2019 and orphans\u2019 pension benefits for HIV and AIDS, community care for improved maternal health and nutrition provision for infants. Many countries in Asia and the Pacific have made impressive strides in improving maternal health, reducing child mortality, and in combating HIV and Box III-2 \u2013 Informal mechanisms for social protection Many non-governmental organizations can make a valuable contribution to social protection. In India, for example, the Self-em- ployed Women\u2019s Association (SEWA) offers a number of informal social protection mechanisms. It works primarily in microfinance but has also established a health insurance scheme and offers free maternity benefits to women who subscribe to a fixed deposit plan. In Bangladesh Grameen Kalyan targets rural groups of informal workers through health insurance, and emphasizes family planning, maternal and child health, and reproductive health. In the Philippines, the \u2018Social Health Insurance \u2013 Networking and Empowerment Project\u2019 is a bilateral technical cooperation project between the German Agency for Technical Cooperation, and the Philippines Department of Health and the Philippine Health Insur- ance Corporation to support the implementation of an efficient, effective and equitable health insurance system. It has a \u2018patchwork\u2019 approach \u2013 targeting different groups by integrating grassroots organization and cooperatives with public social security, linked to the public health care systems. Source: Luttrell and Moser, 2004 AIDS, malaria and other diseases but the systematic provision of health protection is very low. In India, for example, expenditure on public health care is only 1 per cent of GDP, and as a result, over 70 per cent of health care expenditure comes from personal out-of-pocket payments. Effective social protection should not only make health care more accessible and affordable but also promote better health through preventative measures, especially for children. Conditional cash transfers can also encourage regular attendance at maternal and child clinics, and promote better nutrition. A number of countries in the region are now improving access to basic as well as intermediate health-care services. This is evident not just in the richer countries like the Republic of Korea but also in several middle-income economies, including Malaysia, Thailand, Tonga, Fiji, and Sri Lanka, as well as in a few low-income economies such as Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Viet Nam.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38db37a3-797d-4f33-919e-bec0f5c982d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "38db37a3-797d-4f33-919e-bec0f5c982d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85caf49005d4ce99281497f7fa6c9de635199ca4d3dac971dbdb42bc55808b9f"}, "2": {"node_id": "c17bdd09-cabc-4345-b5de-db9d066d6f48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8394055b90de367acf14b4a78a071367fc76b3ad0a935c17eeee22499f34a44"}}, "hash": "30b1ee9a6e807f258f374974337a9cb2f0693a7a57c8bfd9a5889caf33612a75", "text": "MDG-7 \u2013 Ensure Environmental Sustainability Millions of people rely for basic security on natural resources \u2013 on land, or forests, or fisheries.

MDG-8 \u2013 Develop a global partnership for deve- lopment Under MDG 8, social protection which serves as a lynchpin for inclusive economic development can benefit from increased donor support \u2013 in terms of capacity building, knowledge sharing and financial support. Social funds and community- based efforts can also be used directly to promote youth welfare. Social protection to reduce the impact of crisis and support MDG achievement The current economic crisis is expected to result in higher unemployment and poverty in the region, thus retarding the progress in MDG-1, and in turn affect other MDGs such as nutrition, health and education outcomes. Social protection measures, by providing additional income to the poor, and maintaining their food intake and access to education and health services, can support the MDG achievements during such crises. While several types of social protection measures exist, some are particularly relevant for tackling crisis situations as they can provide quick relief in the short-term to the poor. Important amongst these are (i) employment generation measures, (ii) cash transfers programmes - conditional or unconditional, (iii) targeted expansion of coverage of social services, such as feeding programmes, and health and education programmes, with particular focus on providing benefits to women and girls, and (iv) expansion of micro-credit schemes to affected groups and localities. Many of these programmes are in the nature of social assistance programmes and social services. Indeed, as seen in the previous chapter, the stimulus packages announced by some countries do contain many such social protection measures for crisis relief. For example, the stimulus package in India includes an expansion of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, while Indonesia\u2019s stimulus package lays stress on labour- intensive infrastructure projects. The stimulus packages in the Philippines and Thailand include social security benefits and cash transfers to the poor, while subsidies for health, education and social services in general find a major place in the stimulus packages of China, Singapore, Thailand, and Hong Kong, China. Easing the availability of finance for affected groups \u2013 women and small firms \u2013 has also been stressed in the stimulus packages of India and Thailand. To be effective as a crisis relief measure these social protection measures should be able to target the affected people and provide adequate benefits that meet the requirements during the crisis period, and to overcome the crisis impacts. The experience during the Asian financial crisis of 1997 brought out some of the major deficiencies of the social protection programmes on these two counts. An ESCAP study, based on surveys conducted in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea and Thailand, showed that the public works programmes, for example, failed to target women who lost jobs in formal sectors, while the unemployment insurance schemes did not benefit workers in the informal sector in any significant manner (ESCAP, 2002). Moreover, the additional income provided by these programmes was inadequate to cover the basic needs of the beneficiaries, and the benefits were not sustained sufficiently long for the affected people to overcome the impacts of that crisis. The micro-credit programmes, while successful in targeting women with low education, failed to reach those who had lost jobs in the formal sector. Similarly, the credit programmes for small and medium enterprises failed to reach those firms that suffered the most during the crisis and had to resort to job cuts. Further, the size of the credit provided under these programmes was insufficient to give a significant boost to the employment and incomes of the beneficiaries. The common bottlenecks in these programmes relate to deficiencies in design, administration and implementation, along with the appropriate monitoring and evaluation, in addition to sustainable financing. All these problems are solvable \u2013 as experience across the region has demonstrated \u2013 especially if the affected local community plays an important role in their design and operation, including the control of funds. In addition to the well known example of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, other examples of effective social protection programmes include: 61 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 India \u2013 National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme Launched in 2006, this guarantees every rural household up to 100 days of unskilled manual wage employment per year at the statutory minimum wage. This is usually through labour- intensive projects on rural infrastructure.

Armenia \u2013 Family Poverty Benefits Programme In 1999, in order to reduce the number of extremely poor families, the government replaced the system of state compensation and humanitarian assistance with a means-tested Family Poverty Benefits Programme. Since much of the country\u2019s economic activity is in the informal sector, the targeting was based not on income but on a proxy mechanism, ranking each household on a single index based on individual and household characteristics. Each family that qualifies receives a basic monthly benefit. In 2003, the programme covered 141,218 families (505,560 individuals), or about 16.6% of the population at a cost of US$ 25 million or 0.9 per cent of GDP. Bangladesh \u2013 Food Security for Vulnerable Group Development Executed by the Government of Bangladesh in partnership with the World Food Programme, this distributes wheat flour fortified with essential micronutrients. Compared with the food ration programme, which distributes rice, this programme brings greater benefits to women. It is thought to have reduced extreme poverty by 30 percentage points and increased per capita calorie intake by more than 10 per cent (Ahmed and Ninno, 2002; Ahmed et al. 2004). India \u2013 Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Project Covering a rural population of more than 19 million, this is one of the world\u2019s largest programmes for nutrition education and targeted supplementary feeding. A central tenet of the project, which has been running since 1980, has been that most malnutrition is the result of inappropriate child care practices. So key elements, along with nutrition supplements, include nutrition education and growth monitoring. Between 1983 and 2000, the incidence of severe malnutrition among children aged 0-36 months declined from 12.3 to 0.3 per cent (Swaminathan, M. 2009). Indonesia \u2013 Unconditional cash transfer In 2005, the Government initiated this programme to compensate poor families for the short-term impacts of a fuel price increase and the removal of a fuel subsidy. Each beneficiary family, selected through a proxy means test based on its economic and social characteristics, receives about $10 per month, paid quarterly. In 2006, this covered 19 million poor and near- poor households \u2013 one third of the population. It cost around $2.4 billion or 0.7 per cent of GDP. Since 2007, Indonesia has also been piloting a conditional cash transfer programme. Thailand \u2013 Universal health care In 2001, Thailand took an historic step towards achieving full population coverage in health care by introducing a universal health-care scheme \u2013 previously referred to as the \u201830 baht scheme\u2019. This offers any Thai citizen not affiliated to the Social Security Health insurance scheme or the Civil Servants\u2019 Medical Benefit Scheme full access to health services provided by designated district- based networks of providers \u2013 consisting of health centres, district hospitals and cooperating provincial hospitals. People who are eligible have to register with the networks and obtain a free insurance card. Originally they had to pay 30 baht \u2013 a little less than $1 \u2013 for each outpatient visit or hospital admission. However the co-payment has since been abolished, and drugs on prescription are also free of charge. Long-term social protection to strengthen Asia\u2019s resilience against future shocks Since global crises of different kinds are likely to recur, countries across the region will need to be ready with comprehensive social protection systems. In doing so they can defend millions of 62 vulnerable households and families, reducing the need for self-insurance or harmful household coping strategies. At the same time, by helping households avoid drastic cuts in expenditure they can build into the economy \u2018automatic stabilizers\u2019 that sustain economic activity at times of economic slowdown. Coverage of social protection programmes in the Asia Pacific region is among the lowest in the world. Most of the poorer developing countries lack institutionalized welfare systems. Although they may have a variety of social protection measures, these are not sufficiently funded, coherent or extensive to protect their vulnerable populations. And such fragmented social safety nets as do exist are generally biased towards the formal sector, leaving many without basic services and rights. Estimates of coverage are hampered, however, by definitions of what constitutes social protection as well as by the lack of data, so the information in this", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18d1ab57-3fd8-4d1e-9b12-01a27543d80c": {"__data__": {"id_": "18d1ab57-3fd8-4d1e-9b12-01a27543d80c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ee0f45a9343e92e48aea5b1da4310e8196daafdac22db3e8afcd8496bad27bc"}}, "hash": "2ee0f45a9343e92e48aea5b1da4310e8196daafdac22db3e8afcd8496bad27bc", "text": "chapter should be considered only as a general indication. Some of the existing forms of social protection are shown, by country, in Table III-1\u2013 though this only indicates the presence of the corresponding scheme rather than the coverage. For instance, social insurance, tends to reach only a small proportion of the workforce \u2013 generally government workers and some of those employed in the formal sector \u2013 which in India, for example, is less than a tenth of the total workforce. Across the region, people working in the informal economy do not generally benefit from social safety nets. Work by both ESCAP and the Asian Development Bank indicates the current scale of coverage. ESCAP, for example, has estimated that across Asia and the Pacific only 20 per cent of the unemployed and underemployed have access to labour market programmes, such as unemployment benefits, training or public works programmes, including work-for-food programmes. It was also found that only 30 per cent of the elderly receive pensions while the vast majority rely on family support. Protection through health services is weak: only 20 per cent of the region\u2019s population has access to health-care assistance \u2013 with the result that Asia and the Pacific has the world\u2019s highest out- of-pocket health-care expenditures (ESCAP, 2007). Even in China, social insurance has been restricted to the urban population, and only recently has the Government made a concerted effort to extend it to migrants and to the rural population. South Asian countries on the other hand tend to have much lower coverage, except for microcredit. The Asian Development Bank in its 2008 publication Social Protection Index for Committed Poverty Reduction has also made broad estimates by applying a set of weights to the coverage ratios for each target group for all major categories of social protection (Baulch et al, 2008). Since this includes public-sector pensions, those countries with a large public sector could have large values on this index. This index shows coverage to be highest in the two most developed countries in the data set, Japan and the Republic of Korea , but also high in the Central Asian countries because of the legacy of the Soviet era (Figure III-1). 63 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 Table III-1 \u2013 Social protection in Asia and the Pacific, selected countries Sources: Compiled from various sources Country Social Insurance and labour market initiatives Social assistance Emergency Transfers Child Protection Sickness, unemployment, old age, health, insur- ance (e.g. public service, formal sector) Poverty related: (universal or means tested) Health related transfers (e.g. maternity benefits) Education related transfers (e.g. school meals, stipends) Employment Related transfers (e.g. public works schemes) Transfers to cope with shocks, conflict and natural disasters Afghanistan X X X X Armenia X X X X X Azerbaijan X X X X Bangladesh X X X X X X Bhutan X X X Cambodia X X X X X China X X X X X X X Fiji X X X Georgia X X X X India X X X X X X Indonesia X X X Kazakhstan X X X X X Republic of Korea X X X X X Kyrgyzstan X X X X X X X Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic X X X Malaysia X X X X X Maldives X X X X Mongolia X X X X Nepal X X X X X X X Pakistan X X X X X X X Papua New Guinea X X X Philippines X X X Russian Federation X X X X X Samoa X X Sri Lanka X X X X X X Tajikistan X X X X Thailand X X X X X X Turkey X X X X X X Turkmenistan X X X X Uzbekistan X X X X Viet Nam X X X X X 64 0 20 40 60 80 100 Overall Coverage (%) Papua New Guinea Pakistan Tonga Vanuatu Fiji Islands Bhutan Tuvalu Cambodia Nepal Lao PDR Maldives Bangladesh Marshall Islands Nauru Philippines India ASIA Malaysia Armenia Tajikistan China Indonesia Viet Nam Uzbekistan Sri Lanka Kazakhstan Azerbaijan Kyrgyzstan Cook Islands Mongolia Republic of Korea Japan Source: Baulch et al, 2008 Figure III-1 \u2013 Proportion of population covered by social protection, selected countries Across Asia and the Pacific, more than half of social protection expenditure is devoted to social insurance programmes \u2013 though the proportion varies from one sub-region to another.

Interestingly, when it comes to programmes for the disabled, the elderly, and the unemployed, countries in the Pacific have better coverage than many in South Asia and East Asia \u2013 though, in per capita terms the expenditure tends to be fairly low. Expenditure on social protection in most Asia- Pacific countries tends to be small relative to GDP \u2013 highest in East Asia including Japan, lowest in the Pacific (Figure III-2). This is reflected in a similar pattern of per capita expenditure (Figure III-3). These patterns largely correspond to differences in levels of development. And even if expenditures represent a small proportion of GDP they may take up a significant share of government budgets. Nevertheless, financing social protection expenditures in a progressive and sustainable framework has remained challenging and requires coordination on multiple fronts: greater efficiency in expenditure; improved domestic revenue mobilization; increased domestic borrowing; and increased multilateral and bilateral foreign borrowing and donor grants. 65 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 Papua New Guinea Tajikistan Vanuatu Tonga Lao PDR Cambodia Bhutan Maldives Pakistan Indonesia Philippines Nepal Fiji Islands Cook Islands Malaysia India Viet Nam Armenia China Kazakhstan ASIA Bangladesh Azerbaijan Sri Lanka Nauru Tuvalu Republic of Korea Mongolia Kyrgyzs Republic Uzbekistan Marshall Islands Japan 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Social Protection Expenditure as % of GDP Figure III -2 \u2013 Expenditure on social protection as percentage of GDP, selected countries Source: Baulch et al, 2008 Pacifc South Asia Central Asia East Asia (excl.

A recent ILO modelling exercise, which covered Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Viet Nam, has demonstrated that basic social protection benefits are not out of reach for low- income countries. ILO estimated the cost of a basic social protection package \u2013 including a universal old-age and invalidity pension, universal access to basic health care and a universal child benefit \u2013 and concluded that expenditure could be kept at around 8 per cent of GDP in Nepal and below 6 per cent in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Viet Nam (ILO, 2009d). An expenditure of 6 per cent of GDP on social protection is much smaller than the stimulus package announced by Viet Nam (9.7 per cent of GDP) and may not be out of reach for India which announced a stimulus package of 3.5 per cent of GDP. Thus, it is not necessarily the case that a country has to wait for much higher per capita incomes to extend social protection cover to all its citizens. Admittedly, unlike stimulus packages that are temporary measures that will eventually be wound up when the crisis passes, the commitment to social protection has to be on a sustained basis. This calls for sustainable means of financing social protection programmes. If social protection is to be extended where will the funds come from? The private sector should be able to make a contribution. In the formal sector at least, governments can oblige employers to provide social insurance to workers \u2013 with or without state support. In most countries, however, the most pressing challenge is to redistribute the financing of social protection from informal family and community networks to public systems which offer greater opportunities for risk pooling, avoiding moral hazard and filling the gaps left by \u2018missing markets\u2019. This puts the onus on governments \u2013 and on politicians to generate the political will. In the short to medium term, governments should focus on using existing resources and structures effectively. This will mean switching resources from other areas and improving targeting. Social protection programmes in Asia and the Pacific are notorious for their inefficiencies and large leakages which reduces their cost-effectiveness in conferring benefits to the poor. They have large targeting errors that result in missing many poor people while including many from the richer classes. The Indian public distribution system is a prime example here, despite efforts at reforming its functioning. There are many opportunities for innovation, as for example, curbing potential leakages through direct conditional cash transfers to the poor. In some countries in Latin America, for example, the poor are able to draw cash transfers directly from ATM machines, which helps cut administrative costs. Such costs can also be reduced by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db714702-59f1-4d18-9167-0ac54986bcc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "db714702-59f1-4d18-9167-0ac54986bcc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33fdb8ba6f7d535b7e67d8ca5adb10a284fc2d94928a01a4a798134076f4fc22"}}, "hash": "33fdb8ba6f7d535b7e67d8ca5adb10a284fc2d94928a01a4a798134076f4fc22", "text": "better administration. In India, for example, this may mean using post offices \u2013 the most visible and popular face of the government \u2013 to deliver benefits. In the long run, the most important and sustainable source of funds is likely to be taxation, along with increased concessional aid and grants. As growth becomes more inclusive, and more members of society become productive and healthy, there should be greater fiscal space. Progressive forms of direct and indirect taxation can then increase the overall revenue needed to broaden coverage. Other reforms are needed too \u2013 in longstanding issues such as labour laws, and the public sector. All, however, will depend on the determination of politicians and civil society to create a minimum social floor. From a wider perspective, investment in social protection in Asia and the Pacific can also contribute to a more balanced pattern of global economic growth by boosting domestic consumption. In addition, there is the economic boost, as more and more children and youth grow into healthy and productive working adults. A region whose economies have been growing faster than the global average should now be able to afford this step forward. Countries can also draw upon a rich history of lessons learnt from the more advanced economies of the region such as Japan or the Republic of Korea. There are signs that countries are indeed moving in the direction of establishing more comprehensive social protection systems. China, for example has directed the bulk of its US $585 billion fiscal stimulus package towards several social sectors. Allocations include RMB 280 billion for low income 67 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 housing, RMB 370 billion for improving rural living standards, RMB 900 billion for healthcare, and over RMB 2.5 trillion for construction, especially post- disaster construction. China is also providing better job training by expanding the internship system, revitalizing venture enterprises, and expanding the number of job positions for the underprivileged. In some cases, particularly in Central Asia, what is needed is greater consolidation of existing over- lapping social protection programmes that might be managed by different agencies. This process has started in number of countries across the region. Pakistan, for example, in 2007 approved a national social protection strategy and in 2008 introduced the Benazir Income Support Programme to sys- tematise social assistance over the long term by bringing several programmes under one umbrella. Bangladesh does not yet have such a comprehen- sive framework, but is currently adopting a more systematic approach, grouping programmes ac- cording to categories of beneficiaries and the na- ture of risks covered (Kohler, et al 2009). The Mal- dives is in the process of implementing universal health insurance along with the provision of free primary education. Afghanistan is likely to consoli- date its social protection programmes under one umbrella. Governments are also starting to treat a minimum level of employment as a right. India has the most comprehensive scheme but other countries have introduced similar programmes. Nepal, for example, has, in the Karnali zone, introduced a One Family, One Employment programme which provides a guarantee of employment. Pensions too are being introduced. There are signs that governments are accepting the need for universal protection for certain classes of beneficiaries, with full funding from the government. In Nepal all citizens above the age of 70 are eligible for a non- contributory old-age allowance. These are encouraging signs of renewed interest in social protection, but most of the region\u2019s developing countries have a long way to go. Time is short, and the window of opportunity, before the next crisis, is closing rapidly.

What might the region do in future to better protect itself \u2013 and the MDGs \u2013 from such contagion? This chapter explores the options within the eighth goal, focusing particularly on the potential for greater regional and international cooperation. The current crisis has demonstrated all too clearly that scarcely any part of the world is immune from global financial and economic crises, especially not a region such as Asia and the Pacific which is so deeply integrated into the global economy. Most of the region\u2019s economies have relied heavily on exports \u2013 which are often equivalent to half or more of GDP (Figure IV-1).

The scale of the losses can be estimated by comparing 2008 exports with what they might have been had they followed their recent trend during the preceding three years. The results are shown in Table IV-1 for the 33 Asia-Pacific economies for which data were available. Of these, 12 economies saw their exports grow faster than the trend \u2013 predominantly natu- ral-resource exporters, such as Kazakhstan, which in 2008, prior to the financial crisis, had benefited from high commodity prices. The remaining 21, however, suffered setbacks. Compared with what they might have expected to export, five econo- mies suffered absolute losses of over $10 billion: China; India; Singapore; Hong Kong, China; and Thailand. For all 33 economies as a group, the net loss was $240 billion. However, the economies that suffered the greatest proportional declines compared with expected exports were: Samoa, -30 per cent; Bhutan and Myanmar, -24 per cent; Armenia, -21 per cent; and Azerbaijan, -20 per cent. The above estimates of export declines are, how- ever, only one part of the loss in GDP. They do not capture the impact of job losses in export sectors, particularly for women who make up the major- ity of workers in export industries (Box IV-1), and the further loss in domestic demand. Nevertheless, they do give a general idea of the scale of the loss- es in 2008. With the world economy in recession for most of 2009, the export losses in 2009 could be even higher. Further, not all of the loss in exports in all these countries can be attributed entirely to the crisis. In Myanmar, for example, some of the export loss may be attributed to cyclone Nargis that hit the country in 2008 affecting rice production and exports. Box IV-1 \u2013 Trade and gender equality Asia\u2019s export growth, and the rise of vertically integrated global supply chains within the region, have been powerful drivers of trends in women\u2019s employment and migration. Women have re- sponded to the global economy\u2019s need for a flexible workforce \u2013 concentrated in informal or vul- nerable employment \u2013 that can be tapped or discarded depending on market demand. In East Asia and the Pacific, around 60 per cent of women are in vulnerable employment; in South Asia over 80 per cent (ILO, 2008). Despite making up the vast majority of workers in export industries and vertically-integrated glo- bal production chains, women typically remain segregated and concentrated at the margins of the production process, and account for less than 10 per cent of total sale price of what they produce (Carr and Chen, 2004). Women also have limited opportunities to assert their labour rights; in most Asian countries, less than 20 per cent of female workers belong to labour unions. As a result of gender bias women will often lose their jobs first during economic downturns, since employers tend to favour the retention of male workers who are assumed to be the main income-earners in their households (UNIFEM, 2008b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7aa3c10-f758-4370-99fd-d7fd45329807": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7aa3c10-f758-4370-99fd-d7fd45329807", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "649ff145454e9bdc0acc68078562d8886e56b84bea1306301549246cae8ebc30"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e8f00bd-cd38-4ad0-8da1-538ef2b90158", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ece43ddf02e4bfdfe9b2e6896fc8c12ed22cceaa9f048432e3fd04ae28dd87b4"}}, "hash": "cf76a77049996050edcbc2946087183ab1f208806d21300614f9c2a4d402fd4c", "text": "71 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 Trend growth rate TE 2007, per cent Exports 2008, $ millions Gain or loss, $ millions Gain or loss, as percentage of potential 2008 exports North and Central Asia Armenia 18.3 1,124 -291 -20.6 Azerbaijan 79.3 30,586 -7,552 -19.8 Georgia 24.4 2,428 -171 -6.6 Kazakhstan 33.0 71,971 7,653 11.9 Kyrgyzstan 24.4 1,854 191 11.5 Tajikistan 13.1 1,505 -256 -14.5 East and North-East Asia China 27.2 1,434,601 -116,767 -7.5 Hong Kong, China 10.0 365,229 -15,200 -4.0 Korea, Republic of 13.7 433,427 2,339 0.5 Mongolia 31.1 2,530 -28 -1.1 South and South-West Asia Afghanistan 4.3 2,157 215 11.0 Bangladesh 17.1 13,945 -165 -1.2 Bhutan* 40.8 469 -150 -24.2 India 25.0 175,184 -32,466 -15.6 Maldives 10.0 330 80 31.8 Nepal 5.3 953 34 3.8 Pakistan 11.6 20,427 1,138 5.9 Sri Lanka", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2032ac3e-37c1-4c66-9c2e-08b2b18d4578": {"__data__": {"id_": "2032ac3e-37c1-4c66-9c2e-08b2b18d4578", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3bb6b8aa7d1df70ec547a7c8ec101f366f6618468706efc79a1bcdaaf8ab6a60"}, "3": {"node_id": "d8f7586d-9448-473b-becb-5a1d0c5394da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94b7e2a08f5cc9dc2452415a2d41be80edb8264d58c96594f22827f99f7e1a84"}}, "hash": "5b39b8496fd04bb9453447d4c40e7de41c88aa120f30874c990a93a7be3dddbd", "text": "9.9 8,137 -259 -3.1 South-East Asia Brunei Darussalam 15.4 9,494 647 7.3 Cambodia 16.7 4,708 -62 -1.3 Indonesia 18.6 139,291 -724 -0.5 Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic 38.8 1,085 -196 -15.3 Malaysia 11.6 199,105 2,381 1.2 Myanmar 37.8 6,558 -2,092 -24.2 Philippines 8.4 48,016 -5,472 -10.2 Singapore 15.1 331,269 -28,761 -8.0 Thailand 16.8 164,774 -11,723 -6.6 Viet Nam 22.4 62,685 3,249 5.5 Pacific Papua New Guinea 22.2 5,863 57 1.0 Samoa 6.9 10 -5 -30.7 Solomon Islands 18.9 214 24 12.9 Tonga 1.9 12 -2 -16.0 Notes: * For Bhutan, exports in 2007 was unusually high following the commencement of electricity exports to India from the Tala hydroelectric project.

In the past this has paid rich dividends in the form of high growth that has helped them make significant progress in achieving MDGs. But, as in the present crisis, it has also made them more vulnerable to economic shocks arriving from beyond their borders. Prudence suggests that they now need to rebalance their economies \u2013 so as to reduce their vulnerability to trade shocks without sacrificing too many of the benefits of trade. For this purpose they will need to give less emphasis to exports and more to stimulating domestic demand. In the short term the most practical way of filling the gap left by declining exports, and the knock- on effects for the rest of the economy, has been to boost government expenditure at home, through the kind of fiscal stimulus indicated in Chapter II. In the medium and longer term, however, many countries may want to generate domestic demand in a more sustainable way by increasing household consumption and corporate investment. The potential for boosting domestic demand in this way in many countries is evident from their considerable savings. These represent quite a turnaround. Before the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, savings were far smaller: most countries invested more than they saved, or ran only small surpluses of savings over investment. But the crisis taught a harsh lesson and many countries resolved to protect themselves in future by building up their own savings. Figure IV-2 illustrates this changing balance \u2013 with steady rises in the differences between savings and investments. Savings rates have either remained stable or increased, the largest rise being in China, where savings rose above 50 per cent of GDP (Table IV-2). The trend in investment has been mixed \u2013 falling in some countries, stable in a few, and rising in others. Investment increased particularly in China, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, India and Viet Nam, but not on the same scale. As a result, in several countries savings in recent years have exceeded investments by 5 per cent or more of GDP.

In the years following the Asian financial crisis, several governments adopted a conservative fiscal stance, and reduced their fiscal deficits, resulting in rises in government savings (Chhibber, Ghosh and Palanivel, 2009). Boosting domestic demand will mean increasing both consumption and investment. How can households be induced to save less and consume more? This depends on why people are saving. One reason could be to smooth incomes over the lifetimes of household members. On this hypothesis, savings should thus be higher in countries that have lower dependency ratios \u2013 a higher number of working people compared with children and the elderly \u2013 and lower in countries with higher dependency ratios. Some Asian countries show evidence, albeit weak, for this life- cycle hypothesis. Governments who wished to address this would need to consider increasing child benefits and old-age pensions \u2013 measures that are probably out of reach of the poorest developing countries. Another motive for saving is to set aside funds for emergencies. Households will want to provide for unforeseen exigencies such as loss of income or sickness. Offering more secure access to public health care or education, for example, would thus not only help achieve the health-related MDG targets but also reduce people\u2019s anxiety about having lower savings. Evidence from Taiwan, China, for example, suggests that better public health insurance results in lower household savings (Athukorala and Tsai 2003; Chou et al. 2003, 2006). A third motive for saving is to finance anticipated expenditure \u2013 to pay for expensive consumer goods, for example, or children\u2019s schooling. This is more likely in countries with underdeveloped financial systems where households cannot easily go to a bank to borrow against future income. Instead they have to self-finance through savings (Caballero et al. 2008). Policies to counter this would involve better credit so that households can make more balanced choices between current and future consumption. Consumption is also likely to increase if a greater share of national income goes to the poor who, as discussed in chapter II, have a higher propensity to consume. Reducing poverty can therefore unleash the latent demand for goods and services that cater to the needs of the poor. Governments should be looking to increase the earning and spending power of the poor, especially in rural areas, through expansion of education and skills and improving their health standards. In this way, policies that promote the MDGs will also foster domestic demand and inclusive growth \u2013 while provide a stronger buffer against foreign storms. But policies should not just aim to alter the choices of households. Governments will want to give appropriate incentives to the private sector to make it more profitable for companies to invest within the country \u2013 and in sectors that are oriented less towards exports and more towards meeting domestic demand, especially the needs of the poor. Policies on exchange rates, taxation and subsidies play an important role in this regard. For example, by avoiding undervalued exchange rate, governments can divert resources from tradable sectors into non-tradable sectors. In developing countries, government investment in infrastructure, such as energy and transport services, is also an important catalyst. From the MDG perspective, investments by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are crucial for employment generation. But SMEs in developing countries are usually constrained by the availability of finance, and in that context a strong, stable and supportive financial system is essential. Restructuring intra-regional trade As well as reorienting their economies more towards domestic markets, many countries can also consider diversifying their export markets so as to become less dependent on demand from the West. Here one of the most viable options is to boost trade within the region. In fact intra-regional trade is already quite high in some subregions, such as South-East Asia and East Asia, particularly in manufactured goods. For South-East Asia, for example, intraregional trade has been rising rapidly and now accounts for more than half of trade in manufactured goods \u2013 up from 40 per cent in 1994- 95 (ADB, 2009). In other subregions, such as South Asia and Central Asia, the level of intraregional trade is low, though South Asia has recently been witnessing some growth in intraregional", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cbbb06c-0ebc-4232-b2b2-d544212cbe58": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cbbb06c-0ebc-4232-b2b2-d544212cbe58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ea8eb0009638613e90f2698f3c07d86e19960ae74a18e0265312c35ee7b86f2"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca01d155-add5-402e-a512-a1dca0f568f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "572729b6848e226f0bb63b18abcea263d55695974d6b38e7d4f3cfad3854307f"}}, "hash": "084e21519e9bb17d54804d7dc428bacc487d01a9ac2d661c04b5eabf61f5f5ca", "text": "trade. Much of the intraregional trade in Asia-Pacific 75 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 is actually in parts and components for goods that will ultimately be shipped to markets in the USA, Europe and Japan. (ADB, 2009; Athukorala and Kohpaiboon, 2009). South-East and East Asia in particular have woven dense multi-stage production networks with much of the final assembly taking place in China \u2013 one reason why the recession in the advanced economies hit China\u2019s exports first and then spread rapidly to the region\u2019s other economies. An alternative would be to use the same production networks to meet demand within the region. However, this would not just mean boosting domestic consumption but also liberalizing trade regimes to foster imports of finished goods from neighbouring countries. This would require a shift in mindset, since during this global recession some countries in the region actually moved in the other direction and raised barriers. On a more positive note, however, trade ministers of 35 countries met recently in New Delhi and decided to revive the stalled Doha round of trade negotiations. Apart from maintaining liberal tariff regimes, governments will also be concerned with other trade issues. They will want to address non-tariff measures, such as those relating to standards for agricultural and manufactured products. They will also need to look at ways of making trade easier by improving transport links and simplifying customs and inspection procedures. Trade would also be helped by stable currency markets that can arise from deeper coordination in fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies. The current crisis has highlighted how trade policies and programmes affect different sectors, industries and occupations in different ways, and these differential impacts must be taken into account. Efforts to maintain liberal trade policies and strengthen trade facilitation must therefore be accompanied by measures to ensure that trade benefits the poor and vulnerable groups. Regional cooperation can help ensure that non- discriminatory trading and financial systems do not lead to rising economic and social inequality. The Asia-Pacific region already has a range of regional cooperation mechanisms (Box IV-2). These efforts at cooperation vary considerably in extent and depth, and in the progress they have made on different issues. They have, for example, been much more active in signing agreements on trade than in other areas such as investment or labour migration \u2013 or in food security, health or education. And even their agreements on trade tend to have quite a narrow focus, with more emphasis on tariff Box IV-2 \u2013 Regional cooperation mechanisms in Asia and the Pacific The countries of Asia and the Pacific have established many mechanisms for cooperation at a subregional level. These include the Association of South-East Asian Nations, ASEAN+3, the Greater Mekong Subregion, the Chiang Mai Initiative, the Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and East-ASEAN growth area, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and the Central Asia Regional Cooperation. In the Pacific, they include the Pacific Islands Forum and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. Most of these aim at closer cooperation in the field of trade and investment, encouraging greater economic linkages through the movement of people, the provision of development assistance, including technical assistance, and promoting socio-cultural linkages. Over time, some of them have produced free trade agreements (FTAs) amongst the member countries \u2013 including the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement, ASEAN-FTA, the South Asia FTA amongst the SAARC countries, and the proposed BIMSTEC FTA. Besides these subregional agreements, there are also bilateral agreements of which one of the most recent is the India-ASEAN FTA. A disturbing aspect of these agreements, however, is that the same set of countries are often partners under different FTAs. India and Thailand, for example, have a bilateral FTA and are also members of the India-ASEAN FTA, and would also be partners under a BIMSTEC FTA. Such multiple memberships could become counter-productive if the different FTAs have conflicting rules. Pacific island initiatives include the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement and the Melanesian Spearhead Group Trade Agreement. Pacific island countries are also considering trade agreements under the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations with Australia and New Zealand. 76 measures than on non-tariff measures or trade facilitation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca01d155-add5-402e-a512-a1dca0f568f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca01d155-add5-402e-a512-a1dca0f568f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ea8eb0009638613e90f2698f3c07d86e19960ae74a18e0265312c35ee7b86f2"}, "2": {"node_id": "5cbbb06c-0ebc-4232-b2b2-d544212cbe58", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "084e21519e9bb17d54804d7dc428bacc487d01a9ac2d661c04b5eabf61f5f5ca"}}, "hash": "572729b6848e226f0bb63b18abcea263d55695974d6b38e7d4f3cfad3854307f", "text": "76 measures than on non-tariff measures or trade facilitation.

The countries of South Asia, East Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific Islands, for example, received $249 billion in 2007, but also themselves supplied $150 billion. There is, however, a striking difference between subregions. In North-East Asia, 39 per cent of FDI comes from other countries in that subregion. In South Asia, on the other hand, only around 0.2 per cent comes from other countries in the subregion, and less than 5 per cent from the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific as a whole. Flows of FDI within the region, as with the flows of trade, often correspond to the needs of regional production networks. South Asia receives less FDI from within Asia and the Pacific since the countries of this subregion have developed few of these networks. This is partly because of restrictive investment policies. Although some governments in the subregion have liberalized trade, they still maintain complex rules governing capital flows, whether for FDI or portfolio investment. Often, for example, they restrict FDI in some sectors and ban it outright in others. They may also require foreign investors to enter into partnerships with national businesses and impose many other forms of regulation. Countries in East and South-East Asia often have similar requirements but in South Asia the restrictions tend to be more severe. While many countries could take advantage of greater FDI liberalization, this should not contribute to a \u2018race to the bottom,\u2019 so attention should be given to issues such as labour rights and environmental protection (Box IV-3). Box IV-3 \u2013 Organizing for women\u2019s rights There is evidence to suggest that the low cost of female labour is one of the key factors that attract foreign investments. For instance, women tend to dominate employment in export processing zones (EPZs); in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines, for instance, women account for more than 70 per cent of EPZ employment. Yet, despite their invaluable contribution to the global economy, women often have limited opportunities to heir labour rights; in most Asian countries, less than 20 per cent of female workers belong to labour unions. Women who work in EPZs, in particular, find themselves at a disadvantage, since EPZs are often exempt from labour regulations. The presence of gender disparities and biases in the labour market implies that policies in line with investment liberalization are not gender-neutral. A gender-responsive approach is clearly needed to address the differential impacts that this may have on women and men. Organizing for women\u2019s rights, in particular, has proved successful in a number of cases. Growing numbers of casual and home-based workers are organizing for their rights. In 1996, the International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted the Convention on Home Work as the result of a long campaign led by SEWA (Self Employed Women\u2019s Association) in India, the world\u2019s largest union of women in informal work, and coordinated by HomeNet, an international network for home-based workers. So far, the Convention has been ratified by only five governments \u2014 Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, Argentina and Albania\u2014 but in principle it provides a platform to demand accountability for the world\u2019s estimated 300 million homeworkers. Elsewhere, on May 1, 2006, organizations of home-based workers in Asia, Europe and Latin America announced the formation of the Federation of Homeworkers Worldwide to demand equal treatment with workers in more formal employment. Their demands include recognition for home-based workers\u2019 rights, including the right to organize, and government-provided social protection, particularly for health, maternity and old age.

One major step in this direction would be faster progress with the Asian Bond Market initiative. The ASEAN+3 countries are hoping that well- functioning local currency bond markets would open up opportunities for financing long-term investment projects that currently often rely heavily on domestic banks and on short-term external borrowing. Monetary coordination Regional cooperation can also be fostered by greater cooperation on monetary policy and on currency markets. Here too there has been some progress. Since the Asian financial crisis the monetary authorities of the region have rolled out a series of initiatives. One of the most significant has been the Chiang Mai Initiative through which the ASEAN+3 countries can pool currency reserves. Another is the Asian Cooperation Dialogue, which is an informal meeting to promote greater cooperation and coordination amongst the region\u2019s central banks. These efforts have opened up opportunities for cooperation in the monitoring and regulation of capital flows within the region. They also address, among other things, macroeconomic risk management, the development of common audit standards, and technical assistance in issues relating to regulation and supervision. Despite these laudable efforts, the recent crisis has exposed weaknesses in coordination amongst the region\u2019s monetary authorities. This has been evident in policies on deposit assurance. At the beginning of the crisis, when there were doubts about the health of banks and financial institutions, some countries responded by guaranteeing some bank deposits. While this had the merit of building confidence in national banking systems it also encouraged the flight of capital to those countries \u2013 a consequence that could have been avoided if countries had better coordinated their efforts. In addition to strengthening regional financial cooperation, Asia-Pacific governments will also have to play an important role in redesigning the global financial architecture \u2013 articulating their concerns and experiences. Regional cooperation on food Of particular concern for the MDGs is food security. Prior to the financial and economic crisis, the region was struck by a food crisis that hit especially hard at the poor. The food crisis has not gone away. It is still lurking in the wings; prices seem likely to surge again as global demand recovers. The causes of the food crisis are many and complex. But one solution to short-term or seasonal price rises would be to maintain adequate stocks of food that could be shared between countries. In 2007 such cooperation was lacking. Indeed many countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Viet Nam, in efforts to conserve supplies and stabilize national prices, imposed export controls \u2013 policies which in turn seem to have accelerated the rise in global prices. The influence of a number of national policy decisions is indicated in Figure IV-4. This episode also has important lessons for regional cooperation on food security. First, countries could establish stronger mechanisms for addressing temporary shortages \u2013 at national, subregional and regional levels. The South Asian countries have already taken one important step in this direction. In July 2007 they signed an agreement to establish a SAARC Food Bank which would act as a food security reserve (Box IV-4). Recently, Cambodia and Viet Nam have been exploring the possibility of 78 a joint-venture rice mill that would combine Viet Nam\u2019s rice processing experience with Cambodia\u2019s rice production to help boost shipments of Cambodian rice and to stabilize prices. Five South- East Asian nations \u2013 Cambodia, Laos People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam \u2013 are also exploring cooperation on issues relating to food security and production5. Similar efforts would be valuable in other subregions and for the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. Second, the countries of the region have to maintain liberal trade policies in grains, and whenever there are sharp price changes in the international market 5 Source: http://english.vietnamnet.vn/biz/2009/08/863790/ Box IV-4 \u2013 The SAARC Food Bank In July 2007, the SAARC member countries signed an agreement to establish a SAARC Food Bank. This would act as a regional food security reserve for the SAARC member countries, to help them address food shortages and emergencies. It would also provide regional support to national food security efforts and foster inter-country partnerships and regional integration. The Food Bank would commence with a reserve of 241,580 metric tonnes of food grains. The Food Bank is to be administered by a board. Each member country has an earmarked share of the reserve, which would remain the property of the member. Members are required to inform the board of the location of these reserves.

On a long- term basis, countries will need to facilitate trade in grains through regional cooperation. For this purpose they will have to harmonize food safety standards, and improve the transparency and administration of the procedures for testing and certification. And to reduce delays at the border they will need to improve customs procedures \u2013 while also strengthening the transport links that can reduce the cost of shipment. Third, in addition to trade, nations can also explore other stable, long-term, cross border supply arrangements that would boost supplies and help curtail price volatility. India, for example, which faces a perennial shortage of pulses \u2013 an important source of protein for its citizens \u2013 can consider arrangements with countries such as Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Thailand. These arrangements should ensure that farmers in the partner countries are not marginalized or pushed into becoming landless agricultural labourers. These problems are likely to arise from cross-border land leases or land purchases. Cross-border farming arrangements can be mutually beneficial, however, when they involve the exchange of agricultural products for knowledge and technologies for improving farm productivity. Fourth, the countries of the region need to cooperate in addressing climate-induced problems such as rising temperature and increases in the frequency of extreme weather events. Current farming technologies do not always equip farmers to face the challenges posed by climate change, and new technologies, including new crop varieties, might be required to augment climate change adaptation and mitigation. For this purpose the countries of the region can cooperate on agricultural research and introduce mechanisms to facilitate the sharing of research outcomes, experiences and best practices. While the countries of the region have resolved to address these issues, it is time to translate these intentions into action (ESCAP, 2008b). Cooperation on labour migration The Asia-Pacific region has developed one of the world\u2019s busiest international migration systems. Just as capital has moved around restlessly seeking the highest returns, so people have also been moving further afield in search of higher wages, or a better life, or just to broaden their horizons. More than three million leave every year, while a similar number return. In the past the majority went to the Gulf countries, but nowadays the largest flows are within the Asia-Pacific region. Indonesian agricultural labourers to Malaysia; Sri Lankan domestic helpers to Hong Kong; Fijian bus drivers to New Zealand. These and countless other flows across the region are weaving ever more dense and complex migration patterns (ILO, 2009). Around two-thirds of Asia\u2019s migrants are women.

Workers can also be exposed to abuse \u2013 particularly women in domestic service. However, most sending coun- tries in Asia and the Pacific are keen to encourage emigration, partly to relieve unemployment or underemployment but principally because of the ensuing flows of remittances. In 2008, the region\u2019s labour source countries in total received over $169 billion (Ratha et al, 2009). The largest recipients were India, China and the Philippines, though as a percentage of GDP, remittances were the most im- portant to Tajikistan, Tonga and Samoa (Table IV-4). This only reflects remittances that moved through official channels. It is thought that at least anoth- er 50 per cent of remittances travel unofficially, through the informal hundi or hawala systems.

Initial reports supported this expectation, with evidence of decelerating remittances in some countries. But as the crisis unfolds, it is becoming clear that the patterns of migration and remittances may be more complex than was previously imagined. Though growth of remittance flows moderated in some countries, overall flows remained resilient. In fact, in several countries (such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Nepal and Sri Lanka) remittance inflows have actually increased rather than declined so far. There has been a fall in labour migration in virtually all OECD countries (OECD, 2009). On the other hand, many Asian workers are also employed in oil- producing Gulf States which will be less affected by the crisis. The countries of South Asia used to worry about the concentration of their workers in the Gulf, though at present this seems to be an advantage. Migration will also be affected in Asia-Pacific desti- nation countries. Malaysia, for example, has more than 2.1 million registered foreign workers, mostly from within the region, who could be affected by layoffs in manufacturing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08cd50c2-1cc1-4d16-861f-43b1bfd8df45": {"__data__": {"id_": "08cd50c2-1cc1-4d16-861f-43b1bfd8df45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3de1871d964eec5e7a9c603e6a0a913575016b170d67e5243fec1b6a8d67ef8d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c612791d-9315-4e6d-bf35-320a244b478e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "013371b3b79202cd86fd842b607bbe5971aa5c1d516be810f6fcb41bf13e2554"}}, "hash": "1971e32b98e037c3061107a9ab36cf5fe00150c7111346da1bf207d6d81bc127", "text": "Thailand has some 1.8 million foreign workers, with the most vulnerable being those in manufacturing and agriculture.

In 2009, the Government more than halved its quota for temporary foreign workers recruited under bilateral schemes (OECD, 2009). In this crisis at least, it seems likely that those affected are more likely to be migrant men em- ployed in such sectors as manufacturing or con- struction, rather than migrant women who are often employed in domestic service. Neverthe- less, those migrant workers, men and women, who manage to keep or find employment may face poorer working conditions or reduced wages.

Prospects for cooperation At present migration policy is fairly unilateral, with most of the power held by destination countries, which can try to control the arrival and the working conditions of migrants. Some destination countries have adopted measures to protect the rights of their migrant workers (Box V-5). Box IV-5 \u2013 Empowering women migrant workers in Asia The UNIFEM Regional Programme on Empowering Women Migrant Workers in Asia works in close collaboration with the Ministry of Labour in Jordan, which is amending the labour law to cover domestic workers. This recognizes domestic workers as productive labour and as workers with legally recognized and enforceable rights. The Ministry has also endorsed a Special Unified Working Contract for Non-Jordanian Domestic Workers with substantive rights provisions. Under the contract, the employer is responsible for the costs of the workers\u2019 travel, work and residence permits, timely payment of wages and providing adequate shelter, clothing, health care, and accident insurance. The worker has the right to terminate the contract without notice and is entitled to a weekly holiday and a bonus at the end of the contract equivalent to 15-days wages. Workers are entitled to treatment in accordance with international human rights standards. The Government of Hong Kong also issues a legally valid domestic worker\u2019s employment contract with important rights provisions, including minimum wages paid direct to the worker in timely fashion, a weekly holiday, and health insurance.

They may also apply exit controls. Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines all have minimum age limits for women workers going abroad for employment (ILO, 2009). However, it would be better if countries of origin and destination could cooperate more closely. Cooperation between pairs of countries can take the form of legally binding bilateral agreements. The destination country can prepare a list of jobs to be filled while the source country selects applicants. They can then cooperate to provide visas, work permits and contracts, and perhaps health insurance. To give the workers an incentive to return at the end of the contract the employer can divert a proportion of the wages into a savings fund that the worker can access only when he or she has returned home. The alternative is a memorandum of understanding (MOU) \u2013 which simply sets out a broad framework to address common concerns. Most countries of destination prefer MOUs, probably because as non-binding agreements they are easier to negotiate and implement. Bilateral agreements are in principle preferable to MOUs, but more important than the type of agreement is its actual implementation. Bangladesh, for example, has signed a number of MOUs with countries in the Middle East and with Malaysia and within these has developed a minimum set of standards for its overseas workers, covering such issues as working and living conditions, medical facilities and compensation. However, this does not place the country concerned under any legal obligation. The Philippines has 13 bilateral agreements with labour-receiving countries and one labour-sending country. A number of destination countries have entered into bilateral agreements, notably the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. For most of these agreements, however, monitoring and enforcement mechanisms tend to be weak, and typically they concentrate more on recruitment procedures and less on welfare and protection. 2008 2009 Armenia 14 16 Azerbaijan 6 10 Bangladesh 24 24 Bhutan 65 64 Cambodia 26 26 Georgia 34 39 India 19 19 Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic 98 104 Maldives 83 92 Mongolia 35 47 Myanmar 28 27 Nepal 28 29 Pakistan 27 32 Papua New Guinea 20 18 Kyrgyzstan 52 49 Tajikistan 45 46 Sri Lanka 43 42 Uzbekistan 14 13 Viet Nam 30 33 Source: IMF, 2009b Table IV-5 \u2013 Debt projections for selected Asia-Pacific countries, percentage of GDP 84 In addition to various bilateral arrangements, there are also a number of regional and subregional agreements on various aspects of migration.

Development cooperation for the least deve- loped countries Greater regional cooperation on trade and finance would help buffer countries from the impact of global crises and help them attain all the MDGs. But they would have special relevance for MDG8 which aims to build a global partnership for development and is oriented in particular to the LDCs. As well as seeking cooperation in trade, the LDCs will also be looking for initiatives on debt relief and development assistance. As a result of the economic crisis, many of the poorest countries have suffered from a combination of drops in exports, capital flight and falling remittances, resulting in some cases in a sharp deterioration in their balance of payments. The IMF has forecast that the low- income countries as a whole will suffer a balance of payments shock of $165 billion, with the potential of creating a \u2018new debt-burden\u2019. In Asia and the Pacific the IMF has identified five countries as being particularly vulnerable \u2013 Georgia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Mongolia, and Pakistan. In 2008 their stock of debt was already greater than 25 per cent of GDP, a proportion that in 2009 was likely to increase by five percentage points or more (Table IV-5). If not addressed, a new debt burden would cripple these and other developing countries in the region, especially the low-income countries, for years to come. One unique way in which the crisis has hit Pacific countries is through diminished returns on their offshore investments. The crisis has reduced returns on offshore investments held by the region\u2019s trust funds \u2013 which in Tuvalu and Kiribati are a large proportion of national wealth \u2013 and superannuation funds. Another potential risk for the Pacific countries arises from their high dependence on ODA. On a per capita basis, the ODA received by these countries is very high \u2013 about seven times the average in the developing world \u2013 though it has been declining. The costs of achieving the MDGs in these countries are also high compared with other developing countries due to their unique characteristics \u2013 small populations, considerable inter-island distances and their location in an environmentally fragile and disaster-prone region. Under these circumstances, any reduction in the aid flowing to these countries would seriously affect their balance of payments, economic growth in general, and their ability to achieving the MDGs. Indeed, there are concerns on the sustainability of the volume of ODA flows itself following the crisis. The major donor countries, facing falling tax revenues and the costs of massive fiscal stimulus packages, might feel the need to curtail overseas aid. Thus far this does not seem to have happened. Indeed in April 2009 in London, the leaders of the G-20 countries committed themselves to significantly increasing the funds available to the developing countries. In all, they offered $1.1 trillion in additional resources: $500 billion as an expansion of the IMF\u2019s resources; $250 billion as an additional allocation of special drawing rights, of which $100 billion will go to emerging market and developing countries; $100 billion in additional lending from multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank; and another $250 billion as international trade credits. At this stage it is not clear how much of these commitments have actually come through in 2009. Along with these financial commitments, the leaders also announced several measures that would facilitate concessional or emergency lending to developing countries by the IMF and MDBs. For example, they doubled the IMF\u2019s concessional lending capacity and the access limits under the IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework, and they trebled the general capital of the Asian Development Bank.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18a2a230-97de-4dc8-9038-8ab7ef5984c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "18a2a230-97de-4dc8-9038-8ab7ef5984c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b48f69128e0969eef584087f589b094e35b4bd318889dc4eac2ae36844aef436"}, "2": {"node_id": "2833a07f-9c01-4a47-befa-3edec1a8f863", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e0131870e9a07d6ae8856fd7f4582f7a2f1f8cdea8ffe4081cbbeab77199b65"}}, "hash": "0c4ec33c36d2cfcdfbbf573bb3be6f0af92126ed910004ec4a82c8599899be6d", "text": "Not all this is new money, and some may be available only over a number of years, but these do represent significant increases 85 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 Country Facility Date of agreement Amount, SDR millions Percentage drawn Armenia SBA March 06, 2009 534 0 Georgia SBA September 15, 2008 747 60 Mongolia SBA April 01, 2009 153 50 Pakistan SBA November 24, 2008 7,236 47 Sri Lanka SBA July 24, 2009 1,654 13 Tajikistan PRGF April 21, 2009 78 33 Kyrgyzstan ESF December 10, 2008 67 50 Table IV-6 \u2013 Post-crisis IMF lending to Asia-Pacific countries, as of August 2009 Notes: SBA=Stand-by Arrangement; PRGF=Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility; ESF=Exogenous Shocks Facility; Source: IMF", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a9db480-540c-4029-9a59-eefc6423d449": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a9db480-540c-4029-9a59-eefc6423d449", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4e7cca4db5e9564b34277648ca401cbdc2fe707d4ef3f507c1b8db19db1d512"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ebac179-f216-4337-8376-a365a2d290e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65622a9376d0fc02cd3048069c127590bc429ad3e5b99145f68747cdf2fc03e7"}}, "hash": "079866b7a49b952cc468428cf331e1026e6a7ebcf8420c67fa2d8e0f46ab289b", "text": "\u2013 http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr1.aspx. Accessed on 16 September 2009. in donor commitment \u2013 on top of a recent a steady rise in aid commitments and disbursements. Nevertheless, few countries appear made use of this additional funding. Between September 2008 and August 2009, only 31 countries entered into an agreement with the IMF for funding under any of its lending facilities \u2013 and only 7 were in Asia and the Pacific. Of these only Georgia had drawn upon more than half the agreed amount (Table IV-6). Most Asia-Pacific countries do not, therefore, seem to be facing balance-of-payments difficulties that require emergency funding. Nevertheless many still receive significant amounts of ongoing development assistance. For many of the LDCs, small island nations and transition countries, aid represents well over 10 per cent of gross capital formation (Figure IV-5). For most of these countries, the amount of aid has been fairly stable, or has increased. Between 1997 and 2006, net aid from all donor sources to the Pacific, for example, rose from $750 million to about $1.1 billion, though barely rose in per capita terms \u2013 except in the Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste, both sites of recent civil unrest. In many countries, however, aid now represents a falling share of capital formation, as these countries have been able to increase their resource bases as their economies grow. This is particularly evident for the transition countries: Armenia, for example, between 1992 and 2007 reduced the proportion from 83 to 7 per cent. 86 % Uzbekistan Philippines Pakistan Sri Lanka Bangaldesh Viet Nam Fiji Armenia Georgia Bhutan Mongolia Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan Nepal Lao PDR Papua New Guinea Cambodia Vanuatu* 0 10 20 30 40 50 Figure IV-5 \u2013 Aid as a percentage of gross capital formation, selected countries, 2007 Note: * For Vanuatu, data refer to 2006 Source: Staff estimates using data from the OECD and World Development Indicators. Aid committed to social sectors as a whole has increased both in volume and as a share of the total. Much of the increase is directed towards the government and civil society (Figure IV\u20136). The share of aid allocated to health, water and sanitation, population and reproductive health, has been more or less constant, while that allocated to education has in fact fallen since 2000. Data on disbursement of aid by sectors are not readily available. Thus, from the MDG perspective the effectiveness of aid is at best ambiguous. Nowadays more aid is being specifically focused on gender issues. According to the OECD-DAC, for countries in East Asia and the Pacific for which data were available, between 2002 and 2006, the proportion of bilateral aid with a gender focus increased from 8 to 15 per cent. Gender-equality focused aid has also increased as a proportion of total ODA. Nevertheless, much of this is skewed towards the social sectors rather than women\u2019s economic activity (UNIFEM, 2008a). Moreover, there is little correspondence between the size of total ODA and gender responsiveness. For instance, although Japan\u2019s share in total ODA to Asia and the Pacific was sizeable at 39 per cent, it only accounted for 7 per cent of total commitments in support of gender equality (Guina, 2007). Historically, most aid has come from the developed countries. Increasingly, however, more is arriving as a result of South-South cooperation from other developing countries in the region \u2013 notably China, India and Thailand. Generally these regional donors are helping their immediate neighbours, though they do also support other countries. China\u2019s aid, for example, flows mostly to Cambodia, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Indonesia, 87 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 % of total Total ($ Billions) 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 120 105 90 75 60 45 30 15 0 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Education Health Population Pol./Progr. & Reproductive Health Water Supply & Sanitation Government & Civil Society Other Social Infrastructure & Services Total bilateral aid to all sectors ($ billions) Figure IV-6 \u2013 Aid commitment to social sectors Source: Staff estimates using data from the OECD.

India is the largest donor for Nepal, and also for Bhutan for which in 2003-04 it provided more than all other donors combined. Much of this South-South aid within the region is thus going to the LDCs where it can make a significant contribution to the MDGs and particularly poverty reduction. In some cases this involves infrastructure: China and India, for example, have helped in building roads, bridges and hydroelectric plants. In others, it has gone to capacity development: Malaysia has provided assistance to Viet Nam for research relating to rubber (Kumar 2008). Another focus is health: Malaysia has provided assistance for setting up clinics in Cambodia while India has built hospitals in Afghanistan, Nepal, Maldives and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Education has been another priority: China, India, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore all have a range of programmes that include setting up educational institutions and vocational programmes and scholarships for study in the donor country. The donor countries within the region have thus provided many positive examples that others might follow \u2013 especially given that many countries in the region now have high levels of savings that they could use for this purpose. A more resilient region Nearly a decade has gone by since world leaders agreed on the Millennium Declaration that laid the foundations for the MDGs. Another UN Summit on MDGs is planned for 2010 to reinvigorate national, 88 regional and global efforts at achieving the MDGs. The past decade has seen MDGs taking the centre stage in development discourses. During this decade, the world economy has witnessed a series of global crises \u2013 food, fuel, financial and economic crisis. This report has focused largely on the last of these, which has exposed the vulnerabilities of the developing countries and the risks of reversing MDG achievements. The experience of many countries of this region during the past decade has also shown that MDGs are achievable if governments reorient their policies towards the priorities of the poor. The success of some countries also shows that economic growth, while essential, cannot be relied upon alone to achieve the MDGs. Targeted interventions are required if the fruits of economic growth are to result in MDG achievements. Achieving MDGs is also smart economics \u2013 as it would unleash the latent demand of the poor, helping to sustain economic growth in a more stable manner. But this cannot be left to national endeavour alone. The experience of the successful countries also shows that no country can make progress in human development all by itself. In developing countries the scarcities of resource \u2013 both human and capital \u2013 have to be bridged through development assistance and international cooperation. In that sense, the MDGs have to be viewed as a \u201cglobal public good\u201d that is necessary for social stability, within countries as well as at the global level. With only six years left to 2015, efforts to achieve the MDGs will need to be accelerated. While countries will continue to provide the mainstay, a regional effort is needed to identify the bottle- necks and resources required, and to draw up a regional plan of action to address issues of common concern. Recognizing this, the Pacific countries have established a new development compact for the Pacific \u2013 The Cairns Compact on Strengthening Development Co-ordination in the Pacific. Asia-Pacific countries have the resources, the capacity and the know-how to address the basic problems affecting human development. Now regional co-operation has to go beyond trade and investment issues to cover social areas such as health, food security, water and sanitation, labour migration and development assistance, and the environment. Stronger cooperation on these issues could make the region more resilient to future crises and bolster the capacity of many of the poorest countries to achieve the MDGs. The leaders of the world will, it is hoped, give thought to these issues at the 2010 UN Summit on the Millennium Development Goals. 89 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 Photo: Marie Ange Holmgren-Sylvain 91 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 Abella, M and G.

December 2009. 96 Prospects for progress presented in this report are not always comparable with those in previous reports in this series. This is because indicator datasets in the Global Millennium Development Goals Indicators Database are updated yearly. Also, new MDG indicators were introduced in 2008. The same classification method is applied for both countries and regions or country groups. The four categories of MDG progress towards the targets are: \u2022\ufffd Early\ufffdachiever:\ufffdAlready\ufffdachieved\ufffdthe\ufffd2015\ufffdtarget\ufffd \u2022\ufffd On\ufffdtrack:\ufffdExpected\ufffdto\ufffdmeet\ufffdthe\ufffdtarget\ufffdby\ufffd2015\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Off\ufffdtrack-Slow:\ufffdExpected\ufffdto\ufffdmeet\ufffdthe\ufffdtarget,\ufffdbut\ufffdafter\ufffd2015\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Off\ufffdtrack-No\ufffdprogress/regressing:\ufffdStagnating\ufffdor\ufffdslipping\ufffdbackwards\ufffd Two different procedures are used to determine the categories depending on whether or not an indicator has an explicit target value for 2015. For indicators without such a target value, such as HIV prevalence, TB prevalence, TB death rate, forest cover, protected area, CO2 emissions and con- sumption of ozone-depleting substances, only three of the four categories are used: indicators trending in the \u2018right\u2019 direction since 1990 are categorized as Early achievers; indicators showing no change at all over the period are categorized as On track; and finally indicators trending in the \u2018wrong\u2019 direction are categorized as Off track-No progress/regressing. For indicators with an explicit target value, such as $1.25-a-day poverty, mortality rates, school en- rolment and the gender parity indices, all four categories are used. To determine the category, the year t* - by which a country would reach its MDG target if the trend since 1990 continued - is esti- mated (see below). Denote tLst as the year with the latest available value. If t* is below tLst country is categorized as an Early achiever. If t* lies between tLst + 1 and 2015, it is categorized as On track. If t* is above 2015, the country is categorized as Off track-Slow. Naturally no t* can be estimated if a country has a zero trend or trends in the \u2018wrong\u2019 direction, i.e. away from the target value. In these cases, the country is categorized as Off track-No progress/regressing. Estimating the trend To estimate t*, the trend since 1990 is estimated first based on at least two data points, which are at least three years apart. The only exception is HIV prevalence, for which country data are available only for 2003 and 2005 for almost all countries. For indicators that are a proportion or a probability, we convert the original value Yt to yt, which is between 0 and 1, by dividing Yt by the appropriate scale. For example, for $1.25 poverty rate, we divide Yt by 100; for infant mortality, we divide Yt by 1000. A logit transformation is then made on yt so that they are on the scale of real numbers. For indicators that are odds ratios, such as gender parity, a log transform is used. For indicators that can\u2019t be interpreted by either probability or odds ratio, such as CO2 emissions and consumption of ozone-depleting substances, no transform is needed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "852e0bf5-cfee-49ee-a241-d3cbe1859c91": {"__data__": {"id_": "852e0bf5-cfee-49ee-a241-d3cbe1859c91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee842bc34d11850098c2784bba0d1c08afbdf04ac4f608d9e810eae85836959c"}, "2": {"node_id": "149a638c-26f3-4b55-98ea-928aebd1ed13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b9a6bdd73b7e0a39fe8929b0094071720ac6f97595992da35fbad03c7446ce6"}}, "hash": "2675c7dba1d64d1772ec712375dc481cfa04210bd2b347e36e223e8a1995b4a4", "text": "(1) The rate of change r1 can be estimated via this linear equation using the OLS method: (2) For countries in North and Central Asia the impact of the social changes in the early 1990s on many otherwise of proportions if is a rate ) log( is a probability if 1 log y t t t t t t Y Y Y y y y L = = \uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8f8 \uf8f6 \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8ed \uf8eb \u2212 = t t t r r L +\u03b5 + = 1 * 0 Annex 1 - MDG progress classification 97 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 of the MDG indicators is taken into account.

If r2 <0, the indicator has increased in value first and then decreased, and in this case, the indicator has achieved the goal early. If r2 >0, the indicator has regressed. If the linear model is used, the sign of r1 is used to judge if the indicator has achieved the goal already (r1<0), on track(r1=0), or regressing(r1 >0). Estimating the year of MDG achievement For indicators with a target value, the calculation of t* is as follows. Let L* and LLst denote the target value and latest available value, respectively transformed as discussed previously. (4) Setting the target value When an indicator requires a target value, a value for the indicator for the year 1990 is required to calculate it. When the 1990 value is not available, with the exception of the North and Central Asian countries, the first value is used in place of the 1990 value. For the North and Central Asian countries, if the trend estimate excludes the first available value, the second value is then used in place of the 1990 value. Using cut-off values Many of the MDG targets require an indicator value to increase or decrease by a certain proportion of their 1990 values. For these indicators, we only have a cut off point for $1.25-a-day poverty, be- cause that is the lowest level reported on this indicator. Many other indicators require an absolute level as a target, which cannot be achieved by our model due to the transformation used. So they are treated as achieved if a country has reached a certain absolute value. In the case of primary school enrolment, for example, this \u201ccut-off\u201d value is set at 95 per cent instead of 100.

Regional and country group aggregates Regions or country groups are categorized with respect to their progress towards the MDGs in the same way as countries. To determine the trend and classify each region or country group accord- ingly, the aggregate values for the year when data is available for at least one country in the region are estimated (imputed) first.

These surveys, which provide data on popula- tion, health, and nutrition indicators, have large sample sizes (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households) and typically are conducted every 5 years, to allow comparisons over time (Measure DHS, 2009). For the DHS surveys used in this analysis, see Table below. Country DHS Armenia 2000, 2005 Bangladesh 2004, 2007 Cambodia 2000, 2005 India 1998/99, 2005/06 Indonesia 2002/03, 2007 Nepal 2001, 2006 Papua New Guinea 20061 Philippines 1998, 2003 Turkey 1998, 2000 Viet Nam 1997, 2002 DHS used in the analysis of within-country disparities Note: 1- DHS of Papua New Guinea had not been officially released by the time of the production of this report. 100 Estimates of the number of people trapped in poverty were calculated for the following countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, The Philippines, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. Based on Klasen and Misselhorn (2008), using the empirically plausible assumption proposed by Bourguignon (2003) that incomes are lognormally distributed, the poverty headcount is calculated from the mean consumption yt, the international poverty line z (i.e. $1.25-a-day \u2013 PPP 2005) and the standard deviation of the lognormal distribution by the following formula: (1) Where P[ ] is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the lognormal distribution, which can be calculated from the Gini coefficient G by the following equation: (2) The mean consumption expenditure from the household survey, Gini index and poverty head count were obtained from the World Bank Povecalnet website in August 2009. To estimate the number of people trapped below the poverty line of $1.25-a-day owing to the global economic crisis in 2009 and 2010, it was assumed that the Gini coefficients change at the geometric mean growth rate on an annualized basis calculated between the earliest and the latest years for which Gini data is available for each country. Two sets of poverty headcounts were calculated based on two sets of estimates of mean consumption expenditure for 2009/10, which were calculated considering the occurrence and the counter-factual of non-occurrence of the crisis. Mean consumption expenditure were estimated based on estimates of GDP per capita for 2009/10 using the parameter estimates of the following model: (3) Where Meanit and GDPperCapitait are the mean consumption expenditure and the GDP per Capita of country i in year t, respectively, and crname are dummy variables for each country.

The vulnerability index is a composite indicator that thus measures \u2014 on the one hand \u2014 the exposure of a country to a global economic crisis and \u2014 on the other hand \u2014 the coping capacity of countries to mitigate the crisis. The vulnerability index is based on the theoretical framework presented in Briguglio et al (2008) and its construction is inspired by the resilience index developed by these authors. Five indicators are used to measure the exposure to the current economic crisis: 1. EXPY per GDP per capita, 2. Foreign Direct Investment (as a percentage of GDP), 3. Official Development Assistance (as a percentage of GDP), 4. Worker\u2019s Remittances (as a percentage of GDP) and 5. Inbound Tourism (as a percentage of GDP). The capacity to mitigate the crisis is assessed using five different indicators: 6. External Public Debt Stocks to GDP ratio, 7. Total reserves in months of imports to GDP ratio, 8. Gross savings to GDP ratio, 9. Government Effectiveness \u2013 World Governance Indicator, and 10. Human Development Index. There is scope to refine the vulnerability index in the future, especially with regard to the above choice of variables. For example, another indicator of coping capacity that was considered during the construction of the index is the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio \u2014 countries with high fiscal deficit would have difficulties in implementing countercyclical measures, while countries with strong fis- cal positions could use discretionary expenditure or tax cuts to mitigate the crisis. However, while recognizing the importance of the fiscal deficit in the assessment of countries\u2019 coping capacity, this indicator could not be included in the vulnerability index due to a lack of data coverage.

Therefore, the performance for indicator 1 is expressed as a value between 0 and 1 applying the following formula: (2) Similarly, the level of external public debt reduces the coping capacity thus the performance in this indicator is also calculated using the formula above. The exposure index is the weighted average of the five indicators of exposure (1 to 5). The EXPY per GDP per capita ratio measures the exposure of countries to the crisis through the trade channel. Since, on average, the proportion of exports to GDP is five times the proportion to GDP measured by the other indicators, the exposure index is calculated as a weighted average where EXPY/ GDP per Capita is given a weight of 5 and the other four variables are given a weight of 1.

Both exposure and coping capacity indices are normalized using (5) to calculate the vulnerability index, which is measured as the exposure index minus the coping capacity index normalized to be expressed as values between 0 and 1. (3) Calculating EXPY per GDP per capita The EXPY index was introduced by Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2007). They initially constructed an index called PRODY to represent the income level associated with each product exported. For a given product, the index is a weighted average of the per capita GDPs of countries exporting that product. Therefore, PRODY is high for products that are mainly exported by high-income economies and low for products that are mainly exported by low-income economies. The PRODY index for a product k is calculated as follows: (4) Where j denotes countries, and k goods; thus xjk is the value of exports of product k for country j and Xj is the total of its exports. Based on this index, an index of the country\u2019s sophistication in export, called EXPY, is calculated as the weighted average of the sophistication of each of its exports. The EXPY index for country j is defined as: \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \u2211\u2211 \u22c5 \uf03d j j j j jk j jk j Y X x X x PRODY value actual value Indicator index min value max min value \u2212 \u2212 \uf03d \uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8f8 \uf8f6 \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8ed \uf8eb \u2212 \u2212 \uf03d \u2212 value value value actual value Indicator index min max min 1 Coping capacity index Exposure index Vulnerability index \u2212 \uf03d 104 (5) Where products are indexed by l, thus xj is the value of exports of product l for country j and Xj is the total of its exports. This report uses export data and aggregates from IMF Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) Online to calculate the year-on-year monthly percentage change of exports. The export data used to calculate EXPY indices are obtained from the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (COMTRADE) covering over 5000 products at the Harmonized System (1992) 6-digit level for the years 2004 to 2008. The value of exports is measured in current US dollars. The PRODY index for each 6-digit HS (1992) product is calculated as an average of PRODY from 2004-2006 generated from a consistent sample of 128 countries that reported trade in HS (1992) format in each of the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. The PRODY index was generated using data on GDP per capita in 2005 PPP-adjusted obtained from the World Development Indicators (WDI) Online. The average PRODY 2004-2006 is used to calculate EXPY of countries reporting export data in 2007. To generate the ratio of EXPY and GDP per capita, this report has used data on 2007 GDP per capita (2005 prices PPP-adjusted) obtained from the World Development Indicators (WDI) Online. Missing values and imputations All missing vales are assumed to be missing at random. We excluded all countries missing 30 per cent or more of data from the analysis, reducing the number of countries to 125. 11 ESCAP members\u2019 were excluded this way in order to avoid over-imputation (Afghanistan, Brunei Darussalam, Turkmenistan, Kiribati, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Myanmar, Palau, Singapore, Timor-Leste). Another six countries (Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia and Zimbabwe) were excluded because imputation of missing values using past data for these countries failed to capture the impact of conflicts and social unrest in the period from 2000 until the present. We imputed missing values for the year 2007 for variables with available data from 2000-2006, by averaging values from the three most recent years for which data was available. Remaining missing values were imputed as follows. Missing values for EXPY were imputed using a method of multiple multivariate imputation of missing values (ice command in the Stata software package). This method uses switching regression, an iterative multivariable regression technique to impute the missing values. The method was applied using values for EXPY from 1962 to 2000 and 2004 to 2007, and values of GDP per capita in 2005 PPP-adjusted (2003 to 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f1d8e20-c549-4ea0-8da1-715710a75288": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f1d8e20-c549-4ea0-8da1-715710a75288", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2009/2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4e592553ef134cf3093b347c0a2cb644b6fbe41a481354211c8d74e6d513d6c"}, "2": {"node_id": "61e118a1-86b6-44da-9913-86ba6ed67eac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2009/2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0164815a1a4af9a76eba501a0184d1c953f571574a88ea9e1f3a2fa13c50a4e2"}}, "hash": "2b99faf67ad7f5c5c0e003751e6e1df9a9e4cd8f1b66f1853852eb76e69166af", "text": "The missing values of EXPY per GDP per capita were imputed using the imputed values of EXPY and actual values of GDP per capita in 2005 PPP- adjusted (2007).

Results - Mapping vulnerability These two measures \u2013 of exposure and capacity to cope \u2013 can be combined in scatter charts that place countries according to national vulnerability. The vertical axis registers the potential level of exposure of a country to the economic crisis, while the horizontal axis registers its capacity to cope. Countries in the upper-left quadrant of these charts are those more exposed to the crisis and have less capacity to cope \u2013 so are more vulnerable. Countries that are placed in the lower right quadrant, on the other hand, are less exposed and in any case are better able to cope, so are less vulnerable. Figure A 1 shows the overall effects on selected countries by global regions and by country groups. This indicates, for example, that the Asia-Pacific region has similar coping capacity to Latin America and the Caribbean but it is less exposed to the crisis. Comparing with Africa, Asia and the Pacific is more exposed to the crisis but it is in a much stronger position in terms of coping capacity. Among the country groups, the Pacific islands are the most exposed and have lower coping capacity. LDCs in Asia and the Pacific also have a lower capacity to cope with the crisis but are less exposed than the regional average. The LLDCs in Asia-Pacific are as exposed as LDCs but have greater coping capacity.6 South Asia and South-East Asia have similar exposures but the latter has greater coping capacity. 6 In some Asia-Pacific LLDCs the impact of the crisis was greater than predicted here owing to factors not considered in the analysis. In Armenia, for example, this included the collapse of the construction sector, and in Mongolia a fall in the prices of mineral exports. These countries requested assistance from the IMF to cope with the crisis. (IMF 2009c, 2009d). South-East Asia Asia Pacifc (excl. China &India) Asia Pacifc North-Central Asia (excl.

The vertical axis shows the vulnerability \u2013 for which the horizontal line marks the Asia-Pacific mean value. The horizontal axis indicates the current poverty rate \u2013 for which the vertical line marks the regional average. The countries at greatest risk for this goal fall in the upper-right quadrant: they are the most vulnerable to the crisis and have the highest levels of poverty. 108 For countries that are already regressing on poverty, this chart also indicates that the economic crisis could make the situation even more difficult. Among these, Kyrgyzstan is at greatest risk of further regress, followed by Georgia and Turkey, and then Uzbekistan. Of the countries with high poverty rates currently making slow progress on this indicator, those at greatest risk are Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Nepal, in that order. Papua New Guinea does not offer sufficient data for assessing a trend in its progress towards poverty reduction, but it is amongst the countries that are facing greatest risks, given its combination of high poverty and vulnerability. India and Bangladesh are also slow movers on poverty and have high poverty rates, but are less vulnerable to the crisis. Tajikistan appears the most vulnerable, due, among other things, to its exposure to remittances, but it has already achieved the poverty goal, and continues to make progress, so on this indicator is less at risk. Risks for child malnutrition A similar chart can be presented for another of the Goal 1 indicators \u2013 the proportion of under-five children underweight (Figure A-4). On this indicator too, the countries at greatest risk fall in the upper-right quadrant \u2013 Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Nepal. Two countries have regressed on this indicator and are the most vulnerable: Armenia and Pakistan which has much higher levels of malnutrition. In the lower right-hand quadrant are India and Bangladesh, which have the highest under-five children underweight rates \u2013 48 and 46 per cent respectively \u2013 but appear less vulnerable to the crisis. Of the countries that are on track for this indicator, Sri Lanka and Maldives are the most vulnerable.

Although for some developed countries attempts have been made to estimate separate multipliers for expenditure increases (even for specific expenditure categories) and tax cuts, differential multipliers for pro-MDG (SP) and MDG-neutral (NSNP) stimuli have not been estimated separately. In the present report sets of country-specific pro-MDG and MDG-neutral multipliers consistent with the country-specific overall fiscal multiplier have been computed. These country-specific multipliers have been used to decompose the total GDP impact of stimulus package in a country into contributions from pro-MDG stimuli and MDG-neutral stimuli. The following methodology has been used to compute the differential multiplier. Total fiscal stimulus in a country C, as a ratio to its GDP, can be considered to consist of two parts, the Social-Pro poor (SP) fiscal stimulus and Non-Social Non-Poor (NSNP) fiscal stimulus. (1) where, FSC is total fiscal stimulus in country C, SPC is the Social\u2013Pro poor (SP) part of fiscal stimulus, NSNPC the Non Social non-poor (NSNP) part of fiscal stimulus and GDPC is the country\u2019s GDP. Let, TFMC be the total fiscal multiplier; SPFMC the fiscal multiplier for the SP part; and NSFMC the fiscal multiplier for the NSNP part. Then, the additional GDP as a result of introducing the fiscal stimulus can be decomposed as follows: (2) It is assumed that SPFMC and NSFMC are related to the marginal propensity to consume of the poor and rich groups in the country as follows: (3) where, SPmpC is the marginal propensity to consume of the poor group in country C, and NSmpC is the marginal propensity to consume of the rich group in country C. Let the observed value of the right hand side term in the above equation be, Then, by substitution in (3), we get: (4) C C C C C C GDP NSNP GDP SP GDP FS \uf02b \uf03d C C C C C C C C C NSFM GDP NSNP SPFM GDP SP TFM GDP FS \u00d7 \uf02b \u00d7 \uf03d \u00d7 C C C C NSmp SPmp NSFM SPFM \u2212 \u2212 \uf03d 1 1 1 1 C C C Ratio NSmp SPmp \uf03d \u2212 \u2212 1 1 1 1 C C C NSFM Ratio SPFM \u00d7 \uf03d 113 ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY : ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL REPORT 2009/10 Substituting equation (4) into equation (2), we get: (5) In equation (5) all the elements except NSFMC are known.

Such men were highly regarded due to the knowledge and personalattributes gained during monkhood. \u2018Boros Deoum Troung Pram Hath\u2018 therefore referred to men who were highly educated, impartial and understood dharmas and Buddhist philosophy. Such men possessed gentle and proper manners, strict discipline-abiding behaviour, high capabilities and strong consciences, serving as role models for other men. Specifically, those who sought self-happiness and shared this happiness with others.

Tackling these norms which perpetuate an environment conducive to violence against women is key to violence prevention efforts. Yet, boys and men are often left out of violence prevention efforts, with most responses to violence against women focusing on women\u2019s rights and empowerment, legal reform, protection and service provision. Whilst these interventions con- tinue to be key priorities, these efforts can be complemented by working with boys and men to address root causes of violence against women and girls, and ultimately strives to create societies where gender-based violence is unacceptable to all. It is with this understanding that Gender and Development for Cambodia (GADC) with support from Partners for Prevention, a UNDP, UNFPA, UNIFEM and UNV regional programme for Asia and the Pacific, the International Center for Research on Women, and the UN Trust Fund has conducted research on men and masculinities in Cambodia, leading to this report - Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Mod- ern Cambodia: A Qualitative Exploration of Gender Norms, Masculinity and Domestic Violence. This qualitative research project examines the links between masculinity, gender, and domestic violence in Cambodia. The research aims to further understand the links between masculinity, gender, and domestic violence, and identify further entry points for non- governmental organizations and policy makers in their ongoing efforts to prevent violence against women and girls. In particular, the research findings will be a useful tool to review existing policies and laws, and more importantly inform policymakers and other stakeholders to design programs and projects to transform harmful attitudes and behaviors that can foster violence. This report presents the preliminary analysis of research that was carried out in the rural provinces of Prey Veng and Pursat, and also in Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia. The study consisted of focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and key informants conducted in March 2009. Key findings of this research demonstrate the links between masculinity and violence against women, and sheds light on the masculinity norms that young Cambodian men are subject. The research also offers recommendations for how policymakers can build effective responses. In addition, the findings include information on societal attitudes toward violence against women, and the core factors that enhance women\u2019s risks of violence in the home. The findings also focus on influencing factors to violence such as alcohol abuse, sex outside of marriage and financial issues. We strongly believe that this research report will contribute toward a better understanding of the root causes of violence against women and girls - including structural male dominance, masculinity norms, and unequal gender relations - and their links with gen- der-based violence. This information will help policymakers make more informed decisions on making prevention measures a priority, as well as more effective implementation of the domestic violence law relevant government plans of action. Furthermore, this new information can also help support NGOs and other civil society organizations in terms of their work on advocacy, campaigning, policy and programming for violence prevention.

It is based on a review of existing information from government and non-government bodies, as well as regional and international sources.1 The field study was conducted in two rural provinces of Cambodia and in the capital, Phnom Penh. The main research methodology included focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with married respondents who were both male and female, perpetrators and non-perpetrators of spousal violence, victims and non- victims of familial abuse. This report documents the key findings from a preliminary analysis of the data. However, given the wealth of information collected, a second round of analysis is being undertaken to further explore certain issues raised in this report, and will be published in early 2011. A. Findings The findings of this study are grouped into three chapters dealing with: 1. masculinity and norms; 2. attitudes towards violence against women and the core factors enhancing the risk of violence; and 3. inter-related factors contributing to violence, along with responses to violence. 1. Masculinity and Norms Some of the key Cambodian constructions of masculinity identified by respondents indicated that men are expected to be: \u2022 the head of the household; \u2022 the breadwinner; \u2022 superior to women and girls; \u2022 dominant over women; and \u2022 strong and brave. Cambodian men are expected to be the head of the family and everything in a boy\u2019s socialisation is designed to prepare him for this responsibility. All other norms and characteristics stem from this expectation and definition of the man\u2019s dominant role. While most male participants construed masculinity in opposition to what is feminine, there were a few voices in the study that alluded to the complementary roles of husbands and wives. At the same time, however, they were aware of their dissenting stance and felt that they could not discuss these ideas openly with other people. The existence of differing versions of masculinity indicates that it is possible to promote alternative understanding of manhood that are not 1 Literature Review (Appendix E) Executive Summary 11 based on gender inequality.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf862862-d8b0-4131-bdfa-a57c1df4224f": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf862862-d8b0-4131-bdfa-a57c1df4224f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2fcbde8d91b8c446a6e45db21a113c4d8324dc6d9ca98d56e59e80c322c55eac"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a3b3c85-5d2c-46f6-9015-aa439cad599b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29ae1300636c2324e3e957154fa935c2a94b4d54ace2345a1d9cd19c5209f55f"}}, "hash": "b3b4c6b2a88dbd56f01c2bf939ab84684da419d7af63ed517930bd1dca11d59f", "text": "The standards for masculinity impose severe pressure on some men, particularly as those standards have become more difficult to fulfil in the face of changing economic circumstances and as more women enter the workforce. Some men recognise the expectation to play different roles and take on more household responsibilities. In fact, it was found that more men than women expressed acceptance of gender norms that had altered to become more equitable, and this suggests a starting point for interventions. It also highlights the need for interventions with women, given the strong internalisation of unequal gender norms. 2.

Urban men however were united in their opinion that violence is unacceptable, that men should be patient, control their anger and avoid talking back to their wives. One urban respondent even suggested that men who commit domestic violence harm the reputation of all men. The study identified the following five risk factors associated with violence against women in the home: unequal gender relations; \u2022 childhood experiences of violence; \u2022 social isolation and violence as a private matter; \u2022 sexual coercion and control; and \u2022 reasserting patriarchal control. Rigid gender norms and gender inequality were found to be the two main underlying causes of violence against women in Cambodia2 and the study data reveals that failure to uphold gender-based expectations of behaviour often leads to violence. Childhood violence was a common experience in many men\u2019s and women\u2019s lives, and was often cited as a risk factor for experiencing or perpetrating violence later in life. However the study cannot make the definitive causal links on this issue because not all children from violent families grow up to model the behaviour of their parents. Indeed, there were examples of men who experienced extreme violence as children that have not become violent adults, often through concerted efforts not to repeat the patterns they learned as children. Violence committed by men at home is viewed less negatively than violence committed in public, which 2 Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs, 2009, Violence Against Women 2009 Follow-Up Survey Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 12 reaffirms findings from numerous studies conducted within and outside of Cambodia showing that domestic violence is regarded as a private matter rather than a crime. Nevertheless, there is shame in outsiders becoming aware of domestic violence in Cambodia. Gender norms do not encourage open discussion of sex or sexuality particularly among women and the study found that there was a clear lack of knowledge and communication about sexuality. There was however striking agreement between men and women regarding the belief that men had the control and power over sexual behaviour within marriage. Women said that denying their husband sex would result in assumptions or accusations of infidelity, and/ or physical violence or forced intercourse. 3. Inter-related Factors Contributing to Violence and Responses to Violence Although many male respondents said that domestic violence is never justified, they cited certain factors that contribute to violence. These include: \u2022 alcohol abuse; \u2022 financial issues; and \u2022 sex outside marriage. As noted in previous studies3, respondents reported that the role of alcohol in contributing to violence is very strong in both urban and rural settings. They did not specify, however, whether they saw alcohol as the cause of violence or simply a trigger. Men said they wanted the freedom to drink with friends without criticism from their wives. A common conflict scenario was when men were denied money from their wives for drinking and/or gambling. Extra-marital sex was less frequently mentioned as a cause for conflict, but it was mentioned as a cause of much anguish for some women. When conflict becomes violent, Cambodian women have limited options. Their help-seeking efforts are inhibited by public attitudes towards discussion of violence and sexuality, and both the perceived and real availability of support services. Despite the existence of a specific law against domestic violence4, both men and women did not view domestic violence as a crime that should be referred to police or judicial authorities. Women who asked local authorities for help were often provided with an inadequate response, therefore discouraging them for seeking further assistance. Some respondents in the study had heard of the Prevention of Domestic Violence and The Protection of Victims Law5 (hereinafter referred to as the Domestic Violence Law), but they felt there was gap between the policy and its implementation. 3 Violence Against Women Survey Reports from 2005 and 2009. 4 Kingdom of Cambodia Government Document: Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs, Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence and the Protection of Victims, 2005. 5 Ibid. Executive Summary 13 B. Conclusions and Recommendations The recognition of clear links between masculinity, gender norms and violence leads to several important conclusions and recommendations for GADC and other agencies in their ongoing efforts to prevent violence against women. These recommendations, which are in effect entry points for agency programmes as well as for policy and advocacy stakeholders, are organised into six topics, in accordance with the areas of action outlined for Partners for Prevention (P4P), a regional joint programme between UNDP, UNIFEM, UNV and UNFPA in Asia and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe1fddbb-0af5-4b18-901a-904b5772bd52": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe1fddbb-0af5-4b18-901a-904b5772bd52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e9d74694d85177206a5e80aa484b881de77411b6d9d1d8474ab9a6147641ee2"}}, "hash": "6e9d74694d85177206a5e80aa484b881de77411b6d9d1d8474ab9a6147641ee2", "text": "the Pacific. These are: 1. Holding men accountable: \u2022 work on building awareness of the Domestic Violence Law and other laws to protect women from violence, build capacity of local authorities to enforce these laws and strengthen communication and coordination among commune committees, and advocate with provincial courts to try cases involving domestic violence, trafficking and rape; and \u2022 use counselling skills to work with perpetrators through the men\u2019s and women\u2019s core group dialogue programmes, and enlist former perpetrators to serve as positive role models.6 2. Victim support: \u2022 encourage people to speak out, seek services and condemn violence through radio broadcasts, TV talk shows, public meetings and education campaigns; and \u2022 coordinate with government efforts to change attitudes and build capacity among service agencies. 3. Legal and Economic Empowerment of Women: \u2022 develop violence prevention programmes for men that provide an understanding of, and skills to cope with, rapidly changing socioeconomic and political realities; \u2022 support core men\u2019s group dialogue to share with their peers positive experiences of helping in the home and provide them with an opportunity to act as role models in their community; and \u2022 integrate campaigns promoting healthy dialogue and recognising the respective contributions of women and men to their families into a wide range of development projects that seek to strengthen livelihoods. 4. Primary Prevention: 6 The dialogue programme is part of the two GADC projects of Women Empowerment through Legal Awareness (WELA) and Men\u2018s Perspective Project (MPP). The WELA establishes and supports community-based core women groups (CWGs) to empower grassroots women through legal awareness and interventions. The project also monitors media reports on cases of violence against women (VAW). Similarly, the MPP project also establishes and supports community-based core men groups (CMGs) to help transform traditional masculine ideologies, to end violence against women and promote gender equality in the family and community. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 14 \u2022 include young people in public campaigns on violence prevention; \u2022 implement interventions with adolescent and adult males and females that are sensitive to the Cambodian context; \u2022 ensure that core men\u2019s and women\u2019s groups discuss the behaviour and attitudes of young people, and ways to ensure effective cross-generational communication about these topics; and \u2022 incorporate gender-based violence and masculinity issues into other programmes related to peace building and conflict resolution, as well as gender issues. 5. Public Security: \u2022 expand discussions in core men\u2019s and women\u2019s groups to include the joint \u2022 roles and responsibilities of citizens and authorities to build community networks and strengthen social infrastructure. 6. Engaging Men for Equality: \u2022 strengthen male involvement in preventing gender-based violence in Cambodia; \u2022 train and support staff to approach violence from a gender sensitive perspective and to act as positive role models themselves; \u2022 encourage men and women to talk about responsible sexual behaviour; and \u2022 provide information to men and women about Cambodia\u2019s Labour Law7 and its provisions for paternity leave. This qualitative exploration of Cambodian masculinity raises issues that require further investigation. Some of the important questions raised include: \u2022 What is the relationship between economic and social change, gender constructs and violence? \u2022 What advocacy strategies are most effective to encourage law enforcement against perpetrators of gender-based violence? \u2022 What impact do programmes that engage men and boys have, and what are some promising practices for engaging men and boys in Cambodia? \u2022 How can these strategies be tailored to be effective for males of different ages and life experiences? GADC plans to put these programmatic recommendations into practice through its core men\u2019s and women\u2019s groups. GADC urges policy makers to make implementation of the Domestic Violence Law, and other components of the government\u2019s National Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women, a priority. Finally, GADC hopes other NGOs and civil society groups to expand and improve their advocacy, dissemination and social service activities in such a way to respond to the needs raised in this study. 7 Kingdom of Cambodia Document: Ministry of Social Affairs, Labour and Veteran Affairs, Labour Law, 1997.

However few of these studies comment upon, or study, men who do not engage in violent activities.

However outside this consensual conception of the male role, there are conflicting cultural messages on their behaviour, recreational activities and also a recognition that male ideals may not always be fulfilled. For the most part these studies note the relative lack of research on masculinity and have called for further investigation. What has been most obviously lacking in the available literature is the evidence base essential for policies and programmes targeting gender-based violence prevention, especially those engaging men and boys. The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has emphasised the value of research on masculinity for effective policy development action to address the issue of violence. The results of the national survey report published by the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs in 2005, Violence Against Women: A Baseline Survey, highlighted the need to obtain information on the various influences that construct or deconstruct men\u2019s attitudes towards violence, traditional gender norms and fatherhood. As well as the mental health needs of men arising from the stresses placed on them by changing roles and relations within Khmer society in order to devise methods and techniques for engaging men and transforming their harmful masculine practices.9 1.1 Objectives The objective of this study was to answer questions regarding the link between masculinity, gender, and domestic violence, with a view to enhancing GADC\u2019s programmes as well as streamlining its existing project activities in study locations 8 See Bibliography. While a thorough literature review was undertaken prior to the study, only those references most pertinent to the findings are discussed in this report.

Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 16 The broader aim was to identify further entry points for non-government organisations and policy makers in their ongoing efforts to prevent violence against women and to share the findings with relevant actors. In particular, the research aimed to assist the formulation of legal and policy recommendations for national machineries, to review the existing policies and laws, and to provide information about designing appropriate educational and communication materials at the project level to transform men\u2019s harmful attitudes and behaviour in relation to violence. 1.2 Methodology The study consisted of focus group discussions and in-depth interviews conducted in March 2009 by local staff trained in qualitative data collection. Research tools (see Appendices A-D) were developed by GADC with external technical assistance provided by P4P. Respondents were both men and women. In the rural areas, GADC staff first met with commune councils that allowed the research team an opportunity to introduce the methods and purpose of the project. Commune councillors identified potential participants who the research team then invited to take part. Apart from the commune chief in Pursat, other key informants included two high ranking government officials, one each from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MOEYS), and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), and two representatives of non-government organisations (NGO), one international and one local, who work to prevent domestic violence. The field research was carried out in the rural provinces of Prey Veng (Theay Commune, Baphnom District) and Pursat (Metoeuk Commune, Bakan District) as well as in the capital, Phnom Penh (Boeung Tompun and Niroth Sangkat communes, Meanchey Municipal District). Although GADC had worked in those rural districts of Prey Veng and Pursat for some years, these specific locations were new to the programme. As shown in Table 1, there was a total of 12 focus group discussions (FGD\u2019s) conducted. Their purpose was to explore the social norms around masculinity and violence against women. Special emphasis was placed on exploring the various options available to women faced with violence, and the role of law in mediating these options. The FGDs were segregated by gender and duration of marriage (fewer and more than five years), the premise being that younger individuals, married for less time, might have different views on the roles and responsibilities of partners. Each discussion lasted approximately one and a half hours. They took place in public spaces such as primary schools, pagodas or farm fields.

It discusses the masculinity norms into which young Cambodian men are encultured, and suggests how policy makers might respond. 2.1 Cambodian Masculinity Some of the key Cambodian constructions of masculinity identified by respondents indicated that men are expected to be: \u2022 the head of household; \u2022 the breadwinner; \u2022 superior to women and girls; \u2022 dominant over women; and \u2022 strong and brave. 2.1.1 Head Of The Household A core characteristic of Cambodian masculinity as indicated by the data is the male role as head of his family, the primary manager, decision maker and provider.10This is the overwhelming societal expectation for a man and everything in a boy\u2019s socialisation is designed to prepare him for this eventual responsibility. Many men mentioned the advice and teachings of their parents, especially fathers, as the source of standards such as: \u2022 working hard to earn money; \u2022 saving money; and \u2022 managing the family, which may involve using discipline. Respondents, both male and female and of varying ages stressed that men made most of the decisions in the family: Mostly, a man does the decision making because he is the breadwinner. Moreover, he is expected to take the lead (doeuk mok). Urban man, married less than five years One female respondent explained the decision making process in her household and the consequences 10 In particular, refer to International Women\u2018s Development Agency, Inc. (hereafter, IWDA), Men\u201fs Talk (Phnom Penh, 2008) which found that the role of provider is central to a man\u2018s sense of pride and identity, but that this role is also a source of pres- sure for most men. Chapter 2: Cambodian Masculinity 21 of usurping her husband\u2019s role: If I want to do something, my husband decides this for me; for example, buying household items. I cannot make up my mind until I ask him first, because he is the breadwinner and when he decides to buy something, I buy it. I do the housework and he is the breadwinner. I have discussions with him, and if he makes a wrong decision, we all are wrong. If I make a decision alone and buy something wrong, he will blame me and say that I insisted on buying it and I was pigheaded to buy it. Rural woman, non-victim of partner violence, aged 27 2.1.2 Breadwinner Men discussed their role as breadwinners extensively, indicating it is clearly a key component of their identity: My parents expect me to be a man who can earn money to feed his family. When my wife asks me for money, I have money for her. They don\u2019t want my wife to say that I am inferior to her and the other men in my neighbourhood. Rural man, perpetrator of violence, aged 29 On the other hand, women are expected to take care of household duties, care for children, and to manage the budget.11As reflected in strong cultural traditions, women are expected to defer to their husbands\u2019 opinions and to speak softly. It was also acknowledged however, that these rigid gender roles are changing and that men are taking on housework just as women are also earning more income. Significantly, one respondent noted the impact of television programming in promoting different understandings of gender roles, which highlights the potential impact of such advocacy tools: Therefore, we husbands must doeuk mok (take the lead); it means that we not only work outside the home but also do housework sometimes. In general, this awareness is also raised through TV programmes. Now, it is different from the old generation.

Both male and female respondents confirmed this: 11 The IWDA study, Men\u2019s Talk, noted that \u2018most men did not perceive women to be contributors to family revenue, despite the fact that women in Cambodia contribute more than 50 per cent of household income.\u2019 See Men\u2019s Talk, p. 13. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 22 It is generally accepted that men were born superior and to control (loeu) women. Urban man, married more than five years My father loves the boy more than the girls. When the boy is sick, he always gives him his full attention, but it\u2019s not the same with us girls. Girls are not as useful as boys; we can only do small chores at home. But boys have long legs. Rural woman, victim of partner violence, aged 32 Some respondents reported that their parents had treated sons and daughters equally, but additional qualify comments made it clear that this was not the case, which raises questions about how people interpret the concept of equality. One of the most frequently cited privileges of men\u2019s higher status was better access to education. The belief that education is more important for men than for women was linked to a rigid gendered division of labour. For example, a number of respondents indicated that education is necessary for a man as it increases men\u2019s chances of finding a good job, linking it to his expected role as the breadwinner.12 On the other hand, it was suggested that daughters had less time for their studies because they were expected to focus on household chores, fulfilling their socially constructed gender role as homemaker. With more in-depth analysis of the data to come, we will examine how these attitudes are changing with growing female employment and increased levels of female education. A man must be literate or have high education as well as good attitude and dignity. Those who are illiterate are considered incomplete men \u2013 or a half man (kan las). Urban man, married more than five years One respondent demonstrated how strong this bias is, noting that his parents promoted equality, but that he still believed that education is more important for males: My parents told their daughters to try to study hard for their future and not to depend on their husbands too much, and they told their sons the same \u2013 not to depend on their wives to make a living. They think that in Khmer society today there is an equal right to participate ... Sons must try to study more, study hard, and study well so that they can help their family and become the family heir. Urban man, non-perpetrator of violence, aged 25 12 Not only men hold to this opinion. The National Institute of Public Health and National Institute of Statistics, Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2005 (Phnom Penh, 2006), p. 271, recorded that about 42 per cent of women felt that mar- ried women should not be allowed to work outside the home. It also found (ibid.) that 45 per cent of women agreed that it is better to educate a son than a daughter. Chapter 2: Cambodian Masculinity 23 Some respondents argued that men\u2019s greater access to education was associated with the need to travel great distances. This reflects the real danger of violence that women face outside the home as well as a gender disparity associated with male and female mobility. Daily travel to a distant school is thought to pose security risks for women and relocating is not encouraged due to the expectation of living with their parents until marriage (at which point young husbands often move in with their wives\u2019 families): My parents allowed their sons to obtain a higher level of education than their daughters because they thought that sons could find a better job when they were well educated. They wanted their daughters to continue their studies, but they had more work to do than sons, especially housework. The main reason is that they were afraid someone could rape (the daughters) along the way home at dusk. Moreover, they thought that daughters could look after them [parents] when they were sick. Rural man, perpetrator of violence, aged 24 Others, especially my sister, did not have a chance to study more because my parents thought that she was just a woman, and women are not allowed to stay away from the family.

Rural man, non-perpetrator of violence, aged 29 Social control over women\u2019s mobility is linked to another tool of maintaining gender inequality, control over women\u2019s sexuality. The preoccupation with women\u2019s reputation or honour and the sexual purity of women in the Asian context is said to be \u201ccentral in sustaining gender inequality, simultaneously justifying violence against women and depending upon such violence to reinforce hegemonic systems of gender differentiation and gender inequality.\u201d13 As explained by one respondent: Women cannot go out at night as men can; therefore women must inform other members in the house if they want to go out. Men are entitled or free to go out; they will never lose anything like women [will]. Urban man, married more than five years 2.1.4 Dominance Over Women: Characteristics of Masculinity Respondents repeatedly used the words strong, firm, brave, determined and reliable to describe the characteristics of men. Echoing the existing literature, several respondents said a man has a five-hudt 13 L.R. Bennett and L. Manderson, \u2018Introduction: gender inequality and technologies of violence,\u2019 in Bennett and Manderson, eds, Violence Against Women in Asian Societies (London: Routledge Curzson, 2003), p. 9. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 24 chest.14 Both women and men voiced these societal expectations. A striking feature of the data, however, is the complete lack of reference to physical appearance as a marker of masculinity. References to physique, body type or looks are conspicuous by their absence. Physical strength is sometimes mentioned, but usually in comparison to women. For example, men say that men must be stronger than women; a woman is not as strong as a man. Alternatively, they say that men are stronger and more determined or decisive than women. The ability to serve in the army, and handle counter attacks in war is also used as one example of men\u2019s strength and women\u2019s weakness. At the same time however men are expected to be gentle: A perfect man knows how to be gentle and how to be ferocious \u2013 he knows everything! He is not always gentle or always cruel. He is gentle to those to treat him well. If someone provokes him or wants to fight, he will not retaliate or fight back. He will just be patient, so how can it be a man? (laughing). Urban man, married more than five years 2.1.5 Strong and Brave: Alternative Constructions of Masculinity Dominant constructions of masculinity in Cambodia often reflect rigid gender norms, male superiority and control over women. However some respondents also mentioned alternative constructions of masculinity. While most men constructed masculinity in opposition to what is feminine, there were voices that alluded to the complementary roles of husbands and wives. This is very much in keeping with Khmer culture, which encourages people to avoid conflict and achieve consensus: Men and women have their individual strengths, like the Khmer saying that \u201cRice seedlings depend on soil and men depend on women\u201d. We complement each other. Urban man, married more than five years Men voicing such opinions were aware that their understandings of masculinity were different from the norm. Some felt that they could not discuss these ideas openly with other people, highlighting the strong pressure for men to adhere to dominant notions of masculinity even when they hold alternate views: 14 One hudt is the distance from the tip of the fingers to the elbow; a five hudt chest implies a \u2018complete\u2019 man. Many studies show that Cambodian men are expected to be mentally and physically strong, not the type to walk away from a fight. See, for example, the recent works of Liz Giles.

I don\u2019t think men today can talk with other men about these social expectations because when men start talking about this issue, they fear that they might be criticised by friends and neighbours. Urban man, married more than five years The specific characteristics of these men who have more positive interpretations of masculinity and how are they different from other men will be explored in more detail in future analysis of the research. This will be particularly important in promoting men\u2019s role in violence prevention. 2.1.6 Discussion and Policy Implications A. Gender Roles are Learnt Early in Life Informants in this qualitative survey revealed that gender roles are absorbed early in the Cambodian context. Children learn norms from their parents, both through active socialisation and observation. The socialisation process for a boy is designed to prepare him for the eventual role as head of the family and many informants mentioned the role their fathers played in developing their masculinity. In contrast, girls are prepared for a life of domestic duties, with particular importance placed on being quiet, maintaining peace and deferring to her husband. Gender roles are further reinforced by the school curriculum, community, media and other institutions. This highlights the need for engaging boys at an early age in gender equity and violence prevention programmes. This could be achieved through policies that promote gender equitable parenting, and educational and youth development initiatives with boys and young men. B. Multiple Masculinities in Cambodia The research reveals that no single version of masculinity exists in Cambodia. Men and women have different views about what it means to be a man. Some men discussed the importance of women\u2019s rights while others seemed to remain rooted in more gender inequitable values. Similarly, some men said they valued mutual understanding with their wives, while others asserted their right to make decisions. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 26 Participant discussions referenced both positive and negative notions of \u201cmanhood\u201d as related to gender equality. Positive examples of masculinity included: \u2022 valuing women; \u2022 valuing the family; \u2022 showing mutual understanding; and \u2022 standing up for others (bystander interventions). Harmful examples of masculinity included: \u2022 the right to discipline women; \u2022 the right to control women; and \u2022 lack of partnership. The evidence of multiple constructions of masculinity in Cambodian society indicates that it is possible to promote alternative understandings of manhood that are not based on gender inequality. More in-depth analysis of the data is needed, however, to develop a clearer understanding of why men have differing views in this area, and what qualities or insights enable or motivate some men to ignore peer pressure. Future analysis will therefore look at the characteristics of men with alternative constructions of masculinity. This will help to understand what factors contribute to men being gender equitable and non-violent. In addition, existing traditional beliefs that men need to take responsibility and find mutual understanding with others, offer fertile ground for those seeking to design interventions that build upon positive masculine characteristics, as do the beliefs offered by men who feel they are in the minority in their thinking. C. Notions of Masculinity in Cambodia are not Static Notions of masculinity inevitably change over time. In Cambodia, the standards for masculinity have become more difficult to fulfil for men as challenges such as earning an income increase. Furthermore, as more women enter the formal workforce we see some men recognising the need for them to play different roles and take on more household responsibilities. In fact, it was found that more men than women expressed acceptance of gender norms that had changed to become more equitable, and this suggests a starting point for interventions. However, it also highlights the need for interventions with women, given the strong internalisation of unequal gender norms. In light of the fact that some respondents indicated that their ideas had departed from local norms, the data suggest a need for further study of the dynamics of changes in attitudes. Chapter 2: Cambodian Masculinity 27 D. Hegemonic Masculinities Remain Dominant While there is variation in people\u2019s understandings of Cambodian masculinity, it is clear that a dominant notion of masculinity is associated with dominance, control and superiority over women.

Hegemonic masculinities maintain their dominance in part because they do not invite questioning. This was evidenced by the fact that men who did not conform to dominant masculine ideals felt unable to share their alternative understandings with other men for fear of ridicule. Clearly there is strong pressure for men to adhere to the dominant notions of masculinity even when they do not necessarily believe them. The data suggest that interventions could benefit from a focus on single sex peer groups, as promoted in the studies by the International Women\u2019s Development Agency (IWDA)15, and Project Against Domestic Violence (PADV)16, and to provide an opportunity to reflect on gender norms and the advantages and disadvantages of upholding them. In light of comments from men and women alike that it is difficult, if not impossible for them to live up to these standards, such groups would create space for discussions about changes in society that may lead men and women to view their roles differently. Men\u2019s groups would no doubt be attractive to men given the high value placed on male solidarity, as noted in other studies.17Discussions about male/female relations would also be useful. One study found that men want to talk about relationships with women. It noted, \u201cthere was tremendous energy around the discussions and the men expressed appreciation of the opportunity to share their personal stories. For many of the men this was the first time that they had openly discussed and reflected on topics associated with women.\u201d18 15 IWDA, Men\u2019s Talk, p. 20. 16 Liz Giles.

The chapter concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of such findings. 3.1 Attitudes on Violence Against Women Although many respondents said that violence against women is sometimes acceptable, some noted that they had been taught to avoid violence and made strong statements that violence is not acceptable. In fact, the urban men who had been married fewer than five years agreed in their focus group discussion that violence is unacceptable: A husband should not hit his wife because she is as capable of leading the family as a man is. If we don\u2019t love our wife who is close to us everyday, who can we love? We husbands need to stay close to our wife, and if we don\u2019t love her and remain faithful to her, who should we love and be faithful to? It is impossible to love and be faithful to other people outside family circle if we don\u2019t first love our family. Rural man, married more than five years If we use physical violence against our wife, having once been criticised by our friends, this is not regarded as being a real man. If a wife beats her husband when he is drunk, that man can no longer be considered a real man, but an incomplete man (pee hudt).19 Urban man, married more than five years Some respondents said that women played a part in provoking violence20: Some men don\u2019t want to do that (commit violence) but they do because women talk back and are very stubborn. Sometimes, when a husband is patiently talking a wife will provoke violence by searching for a cleaver to attack him with which he then has to respond to. Urban man, married more than five years Rural male participants from a focus group discussion in Prey Veng presented contrasting views on how men who commit violence against women are viewed. One man felt that a violent man is \u201ccowardly\u201d. Another man disagreed with this characterisation, saying that instead, a coward is a man who is afraid of his wife. Respondents explained that others in the community might look down on men who commit 19 A \u2018two hudt\u2019 man is considered incomplete.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "858eecfd-fdd3-4c32-96e7-f253898ab223": {"__data__": {"id_": "858eecfd-fdd3-4c32-96e7-f253898ab223", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cdab72eee46c9301ef768d294d477c885e64c8077992e1173203529a991a7b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "72f5a632-59c2-484e-9c91-e51cc4569467", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf06e9a0335e30e2b3976fcd25acb99383fb23d1602529267b584dddd9d00ced"}}, "hash": "cf9e942a38e2873ad8fc3f35e6a965a108808f4a1ee37e3ac5c2e5d3ae60bd70", "text": "This is opposed to a complete \u2018five hudt\u2019 man. 20 This finding is similar other studies on GBV such as IWDA, Men\u2019s Talk, p. 4 Chapter 3: Violence 29 domestic violence.

If men use violence against women, the community doesn\u2019t value us as good guys because it affects our community. They want to reform our family to make it better.

Rural man, married less than five years Men who treat women unfairly may spoil the sense of masculinity of other men ... Women may think all men are the same. Rural man, married more than five years Respondents also presented advice on ways to prevent or avoid violence. Urban men (regardless of the length of their marriages) said men should be patient, control their anger and avoid talking back to their wives. Several men suggested that men should leave home for a short time until things cooled down. One rural male respondent, a 30 year old a perpetrator, said that he benefited from advice from radio broadcasts by the Women\u2019s Media Centre stating, \u201cI listen to Channel FM102 Mz every night, and I pick up some good advice from the programme\u201d. 3.2 Factors Enhancing the Risk of Violence 3.2.1 Unequal Gender Relations The research indicates that rigid gender norms and gender inequality are the underlying causes of violence against women in Cambodia.21 There are strong codes for male and female behaviour, and the data reveals that failure to uphold gender-based expectations of behaviour often leads to violence. For example, a husband may use violence to \u201cpolice\u201d and \u201cenforce\u201d gender norms if he perceives that his wife has failed in her duty: 21 Acceptance of marital control by husbands and, in turn, acceptance of violence when a wife does not comply with her husband\u2018s expectations is well documented. About half the men in the IWDA study, Men\u2019s Talk, p. 17, said they had the right to exercise power and control over women. In the Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs, Violence Against Women: A Baseline Survey, a sig- nificant number of respondents said that even extreme violence by husbands towards wives is sometimes acceptable. It noted that \u201cfor all levels of violence except the most extreme category (throwing acid, stabbing or shooting) women showed greater acceptance of violence than men.\u201d See p. 18. Even higher numbers of respondents said this violence was acceptable when a wife challenged her husband\u2018s dominance (by arguing, not obeying, questioning a husband about money or girlfriends, etc.) than when the wife simply failed to fulfil her gender role. See p. 19-20. Some violence occurs because some women don\u2019t listen or accept men\u2019s reason; and some women would rather be beaten. Being like this, they learn to understand and listen to each other. Urban man, married more than five years If a wife is wrong, for example she doesn\u2019t stay at home and goes gambling, so when her husband arrives home, she hasn\u2019t prepared food for him, her husband will get angry with her. Some men will use violence against women when they get angry. Rural woman, married more than five years He says that I should obey him because he is my husband and the head of the household. He says that I\u2019m illiterate and that I can\u2019t understand anything deeply \u2026 Just by virtue of the fact that he is my husband, he believes he can do anything and when I do not obey him he curses me out loud. He does not talk about things quietly. He makes sure everyone hears it. Urban woman, victim of partner violence, aged 29 Others note that arguments about economic issues such as a husband\u2019s failure to earn income could descend into violence. Gender-based expectations of behaviour extend to the belief that women should endure violence by the husband as a means to resolve conflict between them. Women and men reflected this belief equally: If a husband is unable to earn income, which makes his wife grumble and sometimes curse her husband, then violence is going to happen because the wife won\u2019t listen to reason. The husband commits violence, like giving her one or two slaps in order to threaten or to stop her from behaving like that next time. A man is like that! A strong man (pram hudt) because he wants to show other people that he is strong. Urban man, married more than five years 3.2.2 Childhood Experiences of Violence The qualitative research in Cambodia shows that childhood violence was a common experience in many men\u2019s and women\u2019s lives.22 Participants discussed childhood experiences of violence that included 22 Studies show that young", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8541139b-cae7-4c49-b35b-e26662ec55fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "8541139b-cae7-4c49-b35b-e26662ec55fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71b8fb934b284c647699b7e3f73aa1dc7ed1769aa5d7648ce00faa4be5edc7d6"}}, "hash": "71b8fb934b284c647699b7e3f73aa1dc7ed1769aa5d7648ce00faa4be5edc7d6", "text": "people in Cambodia experience significant amounts of violence. See, for example, the recent works by Graham Fordham and Luke Bearup cited in the bibliography. It is commonly believed that violence is learned behaviour. All the men in the perpetrator group organised by PADV agreed that children learn this from their fathers. See Liz Giles, Pilot Project: Phase One - Men Against Violence Toward Women (Phnom Penh: PADV, 2004), p. 26. Participants in Alistair Hilton\u2018s study, to I thought It Could Never Happen to Boys, p. 120, also said they believed in a cycle of abuse, although the author calls for more research on this matter. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 30 witnessing violence between their parents, observing community violence between men and women, as well as personal experiences of emotional, sexual and physical violence by family members and peers. In- depth interviews with male perpetrators of violence and female victims of violence in particular revealed childhood histories of violence indicating the influence of a cycle of violence. Below are some quotes from men and women in violent relationships about their own experiences of violence as children. My parents died during the Pol Pot regime. At that time, I was just three years old. My elder brother was married when I lived with him. I lived with his wife and his children. He was kind to me, but my sister-in-law told my brother to hit me when she saw me fail to do something. At that time he didn\u2019t ask me any reason, he just came to give me a slap. I fell from the back of a buffalo, so then I ran back home \u2026 When he hit me, I didn\u2019t say anything, I just kept it in my mind and I thought that I would hit him back when I grew up. At that time, I was only five years old. He often hit me during the farming season. I didn\u2019t know why. I wanted to ask him, but didn\u2019t dare because I was too small. I always wondered why he hit me. Rural man, perpetrator of violence, aged 38 When I grew up, I used to see my parents having an argument at home in the garbage site. At that time I was around 20 years old. My father used violence against my mother because he was drunk\u2026. After my mother was hit, she cried and when I saw this I was angry and I wanted to help my mother but I couldn\u2019t do anything because I was afraid of sin if I hit my father \u2026 We thought that our father was a bad person because he always started arguments with his wife when he was drunk. I felt pity for my mother when my father hit her, but I could only stand and look. Urban man, perpetrator of violence, age unknown He [the father] hit both my mother and me at my house with a bamboo stick that left scars on my thigh \u2026At the age of ten, he hit me and my brother very often, and our mother was seriously injured. He didn\u2019t do any business but just drank alcohol and hit his family. My mother was a vendor and when she came back home, she was hit and the rice was spilled. As a result we didn\u2019t have dinner and went to sleep hungry. Urban woman, victim of partner violence, aged 29 While we cannot make definitive causal links based on qualitative research, these examples indicate that there are probable associations between witnessing and experiencing violence as a child and living with violence later in life. This is supported by research detailed in the following chapter. Chapter 3: Violence 31 The qualitative research also demonstrates that intergenerational transmission of violence is not absolute and that not all children from violent families grow up to model the behaviour of their parents. There were also examples of men who experienced extreme violence as children and witnessed violence between their parents, who did not become violent as adults, often through concerted effort not to repeat the patterns they had learned as children. For example, one rural man, aged 32, whose stepfather had regularly beaten him and his mother said in an in-depth interview: From the beginning, I promised myself that I would not follow in my stepfather\u2019s footsteps when I had my own family. I will try my best to work hard and save money so that my family will live in harmony. I will not make violence or bring any harm to my family.

We love each other. We never allowed the shadow of violence to succeed in us (he laughed). From childhood, I have had some experiences of violence, especially in time I lived with my parents. I am not bothered when someone says I am afraid of my wife. It is not that I am afraid of my wife, but it is because I love and respect her. Rural man, non-perpetrator of violence, aged 32 3.2.3 Social Isolation and Violence as a Private Matter There is a distinction between the acceptance of violence in public and private spaces in Cambodian society. Violence committed by men at home is viewed less negatively than violence committed in public, bringing to mind the numerous studies in Cambodia and elsewhere showing that some view domestic violence as a private matter rather than a crime.23 Beating women in their household is less illegal than outside (the home) because people think that it is a family issue, which can be justified. Urban man, married more than five years If a husband disciplines his wife, he should do this at home. If it\u2019s talking, fighting or whatever he wants to do at home, nobody will blame him. But if a husband disciplines his wife in public, it seems that he is cruel and inhuman, and treats women like animals. Rural woman, married more than five years 23 M. Warrington, for instance, notes that in the home, \u2018once the doors are closed, what happens behind them, particularly if it concerns adults, is seen as being of no concern of anyone else.\u2019 See \u2018I must get out: the geographies of domestic violence,\u2019 Royal Geographical Society, 26, 2001, pp. 365-82. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 32 One respondent summed up the conflicting views in this area: The community views the case as wrong because violence and brutality took place. However, the community also considers that it is each individual\u2019s affair. Rural man, married more than five years While violence inside the home is often accepted, there is also shame in outsiders becoming aware of domestic violence. Therefore women often remain silent about their abuse. We have never had big problems and we never tell anyone about our conflicts. However, if my mother asks me, I will sometimes tell her some things but not all. Only our family was present during the conflict. We never have conflict outside the house. Rural man, perpetrator of violence, aged 30 One respondent reported that there are sanctions surrounding telling others about family matters: If a woman gossips about her husband and her mother-in-law, the husband should talk to her. He should not use violence but if she continues to do it, he can use violence against her. Rural woman, victim of partner violence, aged unknown Respondents also noted that women who break gender roles in public are more likely to face violence as a result, while private deviations from gender norms within the home may be forgiven more easily. Not surprisingly, women stated the importance of restricting their own movement in public. Some women mentioned the importance of remaining indoors and leaving only when accompanied by others. The magnitude of shame associated with revealing any conflict, problems, and especially violence outside the family is such that some women often prefer to suffer in silence: My mum always taught me to behave in certain ways. We should not go from house to house. We should stay home most of the time and do the work in the house making sure the kitchen is clean so that when visitors come to the house they will not say something bad about us ... (My mother) does not want me to go to other houses very often because she\u2019s afraid we will gossip and this only brings trouble. She told me that when I have a husband I should not go here and there too much because my husband would get jealous and that he might beat me up. Rural woman, victim of partner violence, aged 32 Women\u2019s social isolation has been shown to be a risk factor for partner violence in several international Chapter 3: Violence 33 studies. With reference to South Asian communities, Venkataramani-Kothari argues that \u201cfamily boundaries are clearly defined and a strict distinction is drawn between insiders and outsiders. Each individual is made aware of the prohibition regarding exposing family information to the outside world.\u201d24 3.2.4 Sexual Coercion and Control Respondents cited explicit gender norms that reflect how women and men are socially permitted to behave with", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43628975-67f9-4412-801d-b36d4fb1fb8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "43628975-67f9-4412-801d-b36d4fb1fb8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f7d0d9dde0a6e8f2a45037793f026521efe6709aab588b5abc248f807e824db"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4a2af02-a15b-4115-9b75-0beb1d7e71c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb9badb768d4ad7d310408a98e16c12f24605bf742212178371c4342b8d138b2"}}, "hash": "2fca6800cea5549bfff1e24e30def82bf6081afce8fcfb67f4a28d2edc134c31", "text": "regard to their sexuality. The majority of these norms do not encourage open discussion of sex or sexuality, particularly among women. There was a clear lack of knowledge and communication about sexuality, exemplifying the impact of reticence around sex and sexuality in Cambodia. A man\u2019s sexual needs or desires are often viewed as uncontrollable or insatiable.25 Both men and women said that husbands have a right to have sex with their wives whenever they choose. According to most respondents, the only legitimate reason for a woman denying sex with her husband was menstruation and even this excuse was unacceptable for some husbands: A wife must understand her husband\u2019s needs. As a wife, she must fulfil all his needs when he wants to have sex. Urban man, non-perpetrator of violence, aged 29 Conversely, female sexuality was rarely, if ever, discussed. Women referred to sex as a duty. Women\u2019s sexual pleasure was considered as a secondary consideration and any discussion of either sexual pleasure or sexual displeasure was limited by social restrictions regarding sexuality. When women did mention enjoying or initiating sex with their husbands, it was subtly mentioned. A subset of men expressed acceptance that their wives might occasionally initiate sex. They made excuses for this behaviour, saying that it was acceptable, but only sometimes. There was striking agreement between men and women with regards to the belief that men had control over sexual behaviour within marriage. Men decide when and if sex should happen and a woman\u2019s desire and/or pleasure is rarely of consequence: 24 Venkataramani-Kothari, A. 2007. \u2018Understanding South Asian Immigrant Women\u2019s Experiences of Violence\u2019.

New Brunswick, New Jersey and London: Rut- gers University Press. p. 14. 25 Liz Giles, for the PADV study, Pilot Project: Phase One in 2004, recorded the top answers on male characteristics related to sexuality from the men in groups were: strong sexual desire, having sex until death, love at first sight; having many sexual partners; being the one who initiates sex; forcing a woman to have sex; and having sex without thinking about the feelings of the partner. The participants also believed that it was generally accepted by both men and women that men will have mul- tiple partners. (pp. 83-4). Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 34 I think it isn\u2019t good for a woman to disagree to have sex with her husband, because she is already married so she has to have sex with him, even if she doesn\u2019t love her husband. But she can disagree to have sex with her husband if she is concerned about HIV/AIDS transmission. Rural woman, married less than five years Sexual violence shared similarities with other forms of violence wherein the act of sexual coercion or force was often explained by gendered sexual roles.26 Women said that denying sex with a husband would result in assumptions or accusations of infidelity and/or physical violence or forced intercourse: Whether or not I want it, I have to satisfy his need. So to avoid the accusation (of infidelity), I have to allow him. The reason I don\u2019t want to sleep with him is because I\u2019m scared I might get pregnant again. I\u2019ve already been pregnant eleven times, six with my previous husband and five with the present one. Of the five with him, two were miscarriages and two were aborted. The last abortion was about two weeks ago ... and it cost me 20,000 riel.27 I had to sell my gold piece to do it ... To be honest, there is not a day in a month he does not make me sleep with him if he\u2019s at home. The bleeding from the abortion hasn\u2019t stopped yet, but I have no way of fighting against him. Once he gets a hold of my wrists, that\u2019s it. Whenever he wants, he just does it. Rural woman, victim of partner violence, aged 32 Sometimes, when I am unwell, even if I don\u2019t have any feeling, I cannot resist his force ... He forces me but he never beats me.

Responses raised questions as to whether men viewed marital rape as truly being rape, but six of the rural men married longer than five years agreed that marital rape should be viewed as violence. Other men also agreed: It might happen when a wife denies sexual intercourse to her husband. He may have an excuse that he is officially married. Such a case is also included as violence.

Other international research also indicates that men\u2019s perceived loss of power is associated with perpetration of violence against women. For example, Jewkes and Abrahams argue that violence against women occurs when men can no longer exert patriarchal control or provide economical support.28 Similarly, Counts and colleagues argue that in societies where women\u2019s status is in transition, violence is used to reinforce male authority.29 3.2.6 Discussion and Policy Implications A. Most Men Think Violence is Unacceptable Attitudes toward violence against women varied among the participants. Some used language rejecting violence, saying it was an unacceptable behaviour. Others accepted violence as a normal occurrence.30However it is important to note that the majority of men said that violence against women was never justified and that non-violent men see others who act violently as giving men in general a bad reputation.

Chapter 3: Violence 37 Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 38 B. Violence Directly Related to Gender Inequality Respondents discussed several root causes of violence. First and foremost, the data reveals that violence against women is rooted in masculinity or structural male dominance and unequal gender relations. In Cambodian society men are expected to provide money for the family and to demonstrate their strength (which may include disciplining the family). Women are expected to remain quiet and deferential, managing the household and not refusing sex with their husband. Respondents indicated that physical punishment is often used to \u201cdiscipline\u201d women who are seen to have transgressed their prescribed gender roles. Violence against women serves as a policing mechanism and a way of maintaining male authority, reinforcing prevailing gender norms. The data focusing on sexual coercion and marital rape illustrates the clear inequality between men and women, particularly with regards to sexuality. Respondents repeatedly made it clear that such coercion and violence is routine and accepted by men and women. Furthermore, the privacy that surrounds sexual activity enables this form of violence to be easily perpetrated. The research clearly indicates that women are often unable to control their reproductive health or negotiate safe sexual practices. Studies suggest that married woman have a low success rate in negotiating condom use with their husbands and that married woman are one the groups at highest risk of contracting HIV. One study notes that HIV transmission from husbands to wives is increasing and that \u201calmost half of all new infections occur among married women.\u201d31This is a significant problem as Cambodia has the second highest HIV prevalence rate in South and Southeast Asia.32 Other research indicates that there are serious physical, mental and reproductive health consequences of martial rate including increased risk of miscarriages, abortions, unwanted pregnancies and stillbirths. Recent research on HIV in intimate partner relationships in Asia also highlights that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and that pervasive gender inequalities undermine women\u2019s ability to negotiate safe sexual practices. Furthermore, gender-based violence can interfere with women\u2019s ability to access treatment, maintain adherence to antiretroviral treatment or carry out infant feeding choices. Evidence also exists that living with HIV can constitute a risk factor for gender-based violence, with many people reporting experiences of violence following disclosure of HIV status, or even following admission that HIV testing has been sought.33 31 Jenne Roberts, Preventing Spousal Transmission of HIV in Cambodia Phnom (Penh: UNIFEM, 2009), p. 13. 32 Ibid. 33 Program on International Health and Human Rights, HIV/AIDS and Gender-Based Violence Literature Review. 2006, Harvard Chapter 3: Violence 39 C. Dominant Masculinity is Harmful to Men as well as Women Importantly, the research highlights the negative impacts that dominant notions of masculinity have on men as well as women. While the impact on women is more obvious, it is necessary to acknowledge that not all men are privileged in the same way and are often marginalised by multiple levels of inequality in society. This is particularly evident among men who articulated feelings of helplessness, loss of identity and even self-harming behaviour associated with being unable to fulfil dominant expectations of masculinity such as being the breadwinner. D. Cycle of Violence While quantitative data is required to clearly define risk factors associated with violence in the Cambodian context, the qualitative data collected by this study gives an indication that children learn the \u201cnormality\u201d of using violence in punishment and conflict situations. As noted in other studies, it is likely that children in violent homes learn to use violence rather than alternate, more constructive methods, to resolve conflicts.34 It may also lead to permissive attitudes towards violence.

The research also revealed that that childhood violence doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to violence in later life. More in-depth analysis of such examples is required to understand why some children appear to endure violent childhoods without perpetuating the same behaviour. This may have particularly important policy implications for working with victims of child abuse or at-risk families. The data also investigates spousal conflict resolution methods. One study documented the weak lines of communication between spouses and an array of gender norms that discourage women from openly disagreeing with their husbands.36 Although several respondents, male and female, offered advice on ways School of Public Health: Boston MA. 34 See, for example, E. Lee, \u2018Domestic violence and risk factors among Korean immigrant women in the United States,\u2019 Journal of Family Violence, 22, 2007, pp. 141-9. 35 Refer to the bibliography for details of Ellsberg et al.

Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 40 to defuse conflict, the note of inevitability in respondents\u2019 descriptions of episodes of violence suggests that there is a need for building capacity for strengthening communication within relationships. E. Public and Private Spaces Attitudes about public versus private spaces provide both a challenge and an opportunity for violence prevention. The wide acceptance of violence in a private setting is a major challenge. This idea rests on powerful ideas about men as the heads, and disciplinarians, of their families, as well as gender norms requiring women to be obedient and to stay home. But there are many signs that that acceptance is not as strong as it was in the past. Respondents note a high rate of awareness of domestic violence in their communities, so it is not clear that Cambodians actually succeed in keeping these secrets. Respondents also said that they did not want domestic violence in their communities. It is possible that interventions may be designed to create positive campaigns that show how ending domestic violence is a priority for everyone and would help the entire community. Awareness campaigns on the Domestic Violence Law have begun to make progress in this area, simply by naming domestic violence and thus marking it a public policy priority in Cambodia. Chapter 4: Findings on Other Factors and Responses to Violence 41 Chapter 4: Findings on Other Factors and Responses to Violence Apart from the core, underlying factors that put women at risk of domestic violence, there are other risk factors associated with intimate partner violence. The first of these is alcohol abuse, a trigger factor that needs to be explored in some detail. Extramarital sex and financial demands are other factors that can spark violence. After discussing the policy implications of these factors, the chapter turns to an examination of the responses to violence, especially help-seeking strategies and current perspectives on the efficacy of the Domestic Violence Law. 4.1 Inter-related Factors Although many male respondents stated that domestic violence is never justified, they cited several factors that contribute to creating a gateway to violence. In many cases, these factors were blamed entirely for violence with little recognition of the underlying power imbalances that put women at risk of violence. The majority of respondents most often linked alcohol and economic issues with violence against women. 4.1.1 Alcohol Abuse Respondents reported that the role of alcohol in contributing to violence is very strong in both urban and rural settings.37 Researchers recorded that drinking alcohol is considered as \u201ca manly activity\u201d and that men face peer pressure to drink.38 Graham Fordham argues that the context of drinking is a root cause of violence, as opposed to drinking (phoek Si) as it is often associated with gambling and loss of family income.39 Repeatedly in the present study, regardless of gender or setting, alcohol was cited as a spark for violence: Domestic violence happens to some families because some husbands like drinking, then go home and seek trouble and beat their wives and children.

Suddenly, the husband slapped 37 As noted in other Cambodian and regional studies such as Violence Against Women Survey Reports from 2005 and 2009. 38 Katherine Brickell, \u2018Fire in the House: Gendered Experiences of Drunkenness and Violence in Siem Reap, Cambodia,\u2019 Geofo- rum, 39 (5), 2008, pp. 1672-3. 39 Graham Fordham, \u201cWise\u201d Before Their Time: Young People, Gender-Based Violence and Pornography in Kandal Stung District (Phnom Penh: World Vision, 2005), pp. 65-6.

Rural woman, non-victim of partner violence, aged 27 This incident took place because the husband drank so much that he got drunk and sought troubles with his wife at home. Moreover, the wife at home did not take good care of the children and did not cook rice for her husband. Rural man, non-perpetrator of violence, aged 22 One woman said she was taught to accept her husband\u2019s drinking, and the high incidence of this behaviour suggests that other women have received the same advice: [My parents said] \u201cTreat your husband well and do not get into arguments with your husband about drinking alcohol.\u201d My (late) father told me, \u201cWhen your husband returns home, serve food for him. Be careful! He might argue with you.\u201d Rural woman, married more than five years Men repeatedly mentioned wanting the freedom to drink with friends without criticism from their wives. Alcohol was often mentioned as simply being an inevitable part of the male social scene. Respondents made no comments about the concept of alcohol abuse, although some differentiated between drinking alcohol and drunkenness. 4.1.2 Financial Issues Conflict sparked over financial matters reflected the sensitivity that exists regarding gender roles, specifically that of the male role of breadwinner and the female role of household manager. One common scenario involved men requesting money for alcohol and being denied by the wife. Another frequently noted scenario involved a woman\u2019s complaints regarding the man\u2019s ability to earn income and therefore failure to fulfil his gender role. Yet another reason related to accusations that a woman was not fulfilling her duty to manage the household\u2019s funds: He blames me for not being able to save money, but I never get to spend it. It\u2019s him who takes the money and spends it on his drinking. Sometimes he does not return home for a couple of nights. And me! I stay home and cook for the kids. No other woman experiences the pain that I go though every day. During the seven years that we\u2019ve been together, he has slapped me twice until my nose bled. I ran to seek help from my neighbour. I had bruises on my face and my ear hurt for two weeks. When he slapped me the first time, I asked the village chief to help me and he promised me that he would deal with my husband the next day, but after my husband invited him to drink, he forgot to find justice for me. Chapter 4: Findings on Other Factors and Responses to Violence 43 Rural woman, victim of partner violence, aged 32 4.1.3 Sex Outside of Marriage Though less frequently mentioned, sex outside of marriage or arguments about extramarital affairs were cited as precursors to conflict. Women said that sex outside of marriage is a source of angst for women whether they are accused of it or their husbands are having affairs. The last time it happened was when he had an affair with that woman after which I caught them together. He grabbed my hair and wanted to slap me. Rural woman, victim of partner violence, aged unknown A husband may scold his wife that she does not love him and accuses her of having outside affair. If he could not go out for sexual intercourse outside, he may rape his wife because he could not control his sexual desire. Rural man, married less than five years Despite fears of HIV or other diseases, a wife\u2019s denial of sex may result in accusations that she is engaging in extramarital sex. Part of the concern with perceived adultery or actual sex outside of marriage is the issue of public reputation.

Rural woman, married less than five years 4.1.4 Discussion and Policy Implications Respondents discussed the range of interconnected factors that can lead to violence including financial issues and particularly alcohol abuse. Numerous studies in Cambodia and beyond show that excessive drinking magnifies other conflicts. Respondents in this study did not explore how alcohol is associated with other factors, and more research in this area would be useful. As noted in the existing literature however, male drinking patterns are associated with marital violence across various ethnic groups and classes. Studies have also found that an abuser\u2019s alcohol use was related to a greater likelihood of physical injury.40 However, as noted in the literature, the role of alcohol in intimate partner violence is complex. 40 L.R. Brecklin, \u2018The role of perpetrator alcohol use in the injury outcomes of intimate assaults,\u2019 Journal of Family Violence, 17 (3), 2002, pp. 185-97. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 44 The association between alcohol use and intimate partner violence is due to a combination of factors. Alcohol contributes to violence through enhancing the likelihood of conflict, reducing inhibitions and providing a social space for punishment. It is important to remember that the use of alcohol does not explain the underlying imbalance of power in relationships where one partner exercises coercive control. Therefore, while decreasing the use of alcohol may reduce the risk of partner violence, it will not eliminate it. Interventions should approach this problem in an integrated way, taking into account the central role of alcohol in men\u2019s lives.41 At a time when male identity seems to be under threat, it would be useful to examine the wish of men to socialise with other men, and to explore ways that this social sphere does not occur in opposition to family life. The pressure to be the principal earner in the family is a definite cause of anxiety for men. Failure to fulfil this role can result in violence as men try to reassert the power they feel they have lost. Men\u2019s inability to see their value disconnected from their earning capacity contributes to a negative situation. The data is clear about the tremendous blow to male identity when a man cannot earn income, but is much less clear on coping strategies, or the ways that men develop an alternative view of their self-worth. Comments from male respondents that they cannot talk about their alternative views provide further evidence that more discussion on men\u2019s options and opinions is needed. Interventions aimed at illuminating these attitudes and what is required to change them also need to address the issues of sexuality and sexual coercion, given their role in causing conflict and the casual acceptance of these practices. 4.2 Responses to Violence 4.2.1 Help-Seeking Help-seeking behaviours by women experiencing violence are limited by many factors including attitudes towards public discussion of violence and sex, and the perceived and real availability of support services. International data on this issue is not relevant, as Cambodia does not have effective law enforcement or social services to provide care and support. Cambodia is well known for its weak rule of law and lack of 41 Numerous respondents also mentioned gambling as a component of these social settings. Losing money to gambling serves to increase economic stress and leads to violence. Chapter 4: Findings on Other Factors and Responses to Violence 45 social welfare services. Respondents named several barriers to seeking help. The distinction between public and private space affects responses to violence. The idea that domestic and sexual violence are strictly private issues causes women to remain silent. Shame and the need to maintain familial unity also prevented women from seeking help: I never told anyone about my husband forcing me to have sex with him because it is embarrassing. Rural woman, victim of partner violence, aged unknown She came back home because she didn\u2019t want other people to say that a wife had left the house. It\u2019s shameful for a woman to do that. It was an embarrassing for all of us.

Some respondents said they had attended local meetings or training sessions on domestic violence but the data does not include in-depth information about these sessions or their impact. Despite the existence of a specific policy on domestic violence, women and men did not view domestic violence as an issue that involved police or judicial authorities. Only a few respondents reported notifying police of a personal incident. This is not surprising in a country with strong traditions of informal dispute resolution outside of the court system. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 46 As noted in other studies, the most common resource sought for conflict resolution was the village chief.42 Normally, the village chief and other leaders try to discourage violence by discussing the negative impact for the community and family. However it is not uncommon for the village chief to simply encourage couples to reconcile and their comments may serve to reinforce negative attitudes regarding violence and gender roles.43 The village chief also came to intervene when we were arguing. He told us that we were husband and wife, so no matter who did something wrong, we should forgive each other. He told my wife not to blame me when I went to drink with my friends. Rural man, perpetrator of violence, aged unknown When the commune chief arrived, he stopped gambling. He told the chief that he hit his wife because she looked down on him in front of others and she did not allow him to play cards. Rural man, perpetrator of violence, aged unknown Women who do ask local authorities for help may be met with an inadequate response, discouraging them from seeking further assistance. Accounts of these local interventions had mixed results, but few resulted in prosecution. One respondent\u2019s comment reflected the fact that intervention by a village chief can have little impact: The village chief used to come and talk about this, but no one listened to him. I have not seen the police coming to arrest those (perpetrators) either. Rural woman, non-victim of partner violence, aged unknown Another respondent said that police can be bribed to ignore these offences: The parents of the abusers (husbands) take their money and bribe (the police) so that the husbands will soon be released. The wives who stay at home do not know (that the bribery has occurred). So I don\u2019t really know about laws. 42 The Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) 2004 reported that one in three women who experienced violence sought help, an increase over the 2000 CDHS where only one in five women did. In the majority of cases (51 per cent) this help came from their own family. The 2005 MOWA baseline survey pointed out that women\u2018s ability to get help was limited to options available or perceived to be available to them, naming commune or village authorities, or the police. Far fewer respondents mentioned the courts which are often located far away; 27 per cent of them said they would have to travel up to six hours to access a court. Disturbingly, agencies that provide counselling, legal aid, or shelter were even less accessible. 43 The 2005 MOWA baseline survey found that of the 330 respondents who reported seeking help, the vast majority of help- seekers (82 percent of the men and 96 per cent of the women) were urged to reconcile with their partners by the authorities. Chapter 4: Findings on Other Factors and Responses to Violence 47 Rural woman, victim of partner violence, aged 24 Many respondents felt they could help stop domestic violence by giving advice to others.44 Some explained that they had tried to intervene in domestic violence situations in other families, but with no success. This indicates that men also want to stop violence but are not sure how to do so effectively: Then the husband started beating her. I went to help to stop him from beating her but he didn\u2019t listen to me. It was not easy to help, as it was their family affair.

Then the battle broke out in the middle of the night. I wouldn\u2019t dare help in that situation. There is nothing I can do when I see such violence happening but ask the elders to talk to them. Rural woman, victim of violence, aged unknown One key informant said that men have an important role to play in preventing violence: If men do not participate in preventing violence, it is impossible to achieve our goals ... Men\u2019s and women\u2019s participation is very important to contribute to minimising domestic violence. Men have to know about the consequence of violence. Interview with key informant, H.E. Chan Sotheavy, Secretary of State of Ministry of Justice (MoJ) Comments from other female respondents demonstrate that women feel that they have few viable options and they must fend for themselves: Whenever he wants to beat me, I draw a knife and he keeps a distance from me. I can\u2019t allow him to beat me anymore, it hurts, but do I dare stab my own husband? Rural woman, victim of partner violence, aged 32 4.2.2 Perspectives on The Domestic Violence Law Certain respondents in both the focus groups and individual interviews said they had heard of the Domestic Violence Law and key informant interviews reinforced their comments. However, both community participants and key informants from NGOs cited a disconnect between policy and implementation. 44 Many respondents suggested that they and others should advise other men to cease their violent behaviour, but none mentioned possible interventions that involved listening to these men. With few counselling options available in Cambodia, however, this is not surprising. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 48 Some examples from community and policy maker interviews demonstrate that there is also a gap in understanding the law: I ask them about the violence law. They do not know. Maybe we did not disseminate it to them. Local people are not aware of laws. Interview with key informant, Mr. Sea Sokhon, Senior TechnicalOfficer, Strategic Behavioural Communication (SBC) of Family Health International Organization (FHI) Some of our relatives are not aware of the laws\u2026 Their implementation is not effective. Interview with key informant, H.E. Nat Bunroeun, Secretary of State of Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS) Like I said, if a husband hits his wife because he understands that she is his own possession and the police cannot interfere in his internal matter, this is his misconception because he lacks an understanding of the law. Interview with key informant, H.E. Chan Sotheavy, Secretary of State of MoJ Many respondents said that increased awareness of the law would greatly assist efforts to end domestic violence, which suggests that the law has the potential to break through attitudes about the acceptance of domestic violence in the private sphere. That knowledge will cause people to change their behaviour is not surprising in Cambodia, where the education system relies heavily on rote learning and where the government and civil society place a high value on dissemination campaigns. However, even where the policy was recognised or praised, respondents did not mention efforts to implement the law. Others said that people know about the law but that it does not deter violent behaviour: Men know about laws but they still violate them. Rural woman, non-victim of partner violence, aged unknown The most important thing is to enforce laws and participate in implementing laws. Phnom Penh and provincial residents do not. Interview with key informant, Nat Bunroeun, Secretary of State MoEYS Even though we spend a lot of money conducting dissemination campaigns, the violence still occurs, because people face livelihood problems, still go gambling, still drink alcohol and use drugs. It is related to biological, psychological, sexual and physical health, and economic factors. We should promote family income generation policies and hold dissemination campaigns that Chapter 4: Findings on Other Factors and Responses to Violence 49 will help reduce domestic violence. Interview with key informant, Sea Sokhon, Senior Technical Officer, SBC of FHI 4.2.3 Discussion and Policy Implications The study data highlights that there are few options available to women seeking help for domestic violence. This confirms earlier government studies findings, showing that local authorities and service providers assist few victims of partner violence.45 The small role of social service providers reported by respondents reveals a significant gap in services and even a lack of awareness about the types of services available. Cambodia has few psychosocial service agencies and few agencies offer counseling services.

It is clear that further efforts are needed to address the barriers such as shame, economic disempowerment, fear and secrecy that prevent women from accessing necessary assistance. In more concrete terms, the data mentions significant gaps in law enforcement and services. It is clear that law enforcement is extremely weak and that judicial and police officers require further training. But the requirements for changing police attitudes and behaviours need to be seriously considered to appropriately tailor such trainings. Similarly, village chiefs and commune councillors, as community leaders, require specifically tailored trainings on the effects of domestic violence and the law. Passage of the Domestic Violence Law was an important step in breaking through perceptions that such violence is acceptable in a private setting, and respondents place great faith in the potential impact of increasing awareness of this law.46 Clearly however, greater awareness raising of the law and ensuring its implementation is necessary. Indeed, the law itself calls for dissemination of the law and places emphasis on \u201cthe responsibilities within households and respecting the rights of each other in order to promote the value of Khmer families, morality, good manners, ways of living, ways of preserving and educating the households, ways to solve conflicts through non-violent and peaceful means, as well as to instruct them to be aware of the measures to prevent domestic violence and protect the victims.\u201d47 The willingness of several respondents to intervene in other families\u2019 domestic violence incidents 45 Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs, Violence Against Women: A Baseline Survey, and A Fair Share for Women: Cambodia Gender As- sessment (Phnom Penh, 2008). 46 Cambodia has several relevant legal instruments. Cambodia is a signatory to the global Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In 2008, the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation was approved. 47 Law on The Prevention of Domestic Violence and The Protection of Victims, Article 33. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 50 illustrates positive attitudes that reject domestic violence. Although these comments also reflect that people see no other option for addressing this problem other than personally intervening. Nonetheless, these comments are a step forward and can provide a basis for policies and programmes that harness political will in communities. In addition, the language used in the Domestic Violence Law regarding families and values indicates that positive messages about peaceful families can be linked to existing cultural norms. Other studies suggest that discussions on human rights and the impact of domestic violence can help to change attitudes.48 It is possible that some of these discussions could be included in all male settings, to provide an opportunity to reflect on positive gender norms and provide peer support, as well respect the high degree of interest by men to socialise with other men. Similarly, the data suggests that women could gain support and confidence from peer groups, particularly since so many women are able to articulate their frustration at domestic violence and in some cases their determination to put an end to it. As outlined in the existing literature, women in other countries report that they rely primarily on informal networks for help.49 This may also help to counter their feelings of isolation and shame. 48 See, for example, IWDA, Men\u2019s Talk, p. 24, and p. 32, where men said that discussing the impact of domestic violence helped them see it in a new way, and motivated them to change their behaviour. They also said that discussing it with other men was helpful. 49 World Health Organization, WHO Multi-Country Study on Women\u201fs Health and Domestic Violence against Women, 2005. Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations 51 Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations In this concluding chapter we present the key findings of the study and offer detailed recommendations at the programmatic level for organisations and agencies that address gender-based violence, as well as for policy makers and advocates. Areas requiring further research that were identified during the study are listed, as well as the next steps in this important work for gender justice and violence prevention. 5.1 Conclusions The study revealed the following key findings: \u2022 people\u2019s understandings of Cambodian masculinity vary, however the dominant construction of masculinity is associated with dominance, control and superiority over women; \u2022 while some men held alternative constructions of masculinity that promoted gender equality they felt that they could not discuss these ideas openly, especially amongst other men, highlighting the strong pressure for men to adhere to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f1cadf6-ef09-4afc-a02d-249ad54042d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f1cadf6-ef09-4afc-a02d-249ad54042d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1f2f50bf0adfa684a81efe1f490bd207de92e1d31f338a6e387bf814bc2fdb7"}}, "hash": "c1f2f50bf0adfa684a81efe1f490bd207de92e1d31f338a6e387bf814bc2fdb7", "text": "dominant notions of masculinity even when they do not support them; \u2022 the attitudes expressed towards violence varied among respondents. Some participants used language rejecting violence, saying it was unacceptable while others spoke of violence as being part of married life; \u2022 violence against women including sexual coercion and marital rape is rooted in constructions of masculinity that promote structural male dominance and unequal gender relations; \u2022 physical punishment is often used to \u201cdiscipline\u201d women who are seen to have transgressed prescribed gender roles; \u2022 violence against women serves as a policing mechanism and a mechanism for maintaining male authority, which therefore reinforce prevailing gender norms; \u2022 other risk factors associated with violence include childhood experiences of violence, alcohol abuse and financial issues; \u2022 both men and women suffer because of dominant notions of masculinity in Cambodian society; \u2022 help-seeking behaviour is limited by many factors (see Figure 1), including the belief that domestic violence is a private issue, shame and a shortage of avenues for help; and \u2022 some respondents were aware of Domestic Violence Law, but this law dates back to 2005, and it appears that further dissemination and enforcement efforts are needed, along with an array of interventions by government and other agencies. Gender roles impact on both help-seeking behaviours and violence. The path to violence outlined in this study usually passes through influencing factors, such as alcohol abuse and financial issues, before reaching physical or sexual abuse. These factors are often mistakenly perceived as the cause of violence. This misconception is dangerous to programming efforts. Focusing only on influencing factors (such as Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 52 alcohol prohibition) fails to address the underlying cause of the problem such as structural male dominance, masculinity norms, and unequal gender relations. The norms that affect help seeking behaviour are usually barriers to treatment for survivors of violence. The barriers that keep women from utilising services that may or may not exist are multilayered as Figure 1 below illustrates: Figure 1: Barriers to Help Seeking The main gaps beyond those embedded in social norms are found at the policy implementation level. There is weak infrastructure for law implementation, which is exacerbated by authorities that do not recognise the causes of violence, or its impact, and furthermore do they have the tools necessary to implement the laws. Furthermore, few agencies offer support for victims or work to change cultural norms. Addressing such barriers will greatly improve women\u2019s ability to access legal protection. Survivors of Domestic and/or Sexual Violence Lack of knowledge regarding policy Shame regarding any violence or conflict Shame regarding discussion of sex or sexuality Violence is a private domestic issue Reluctance to penalize husband for social and economic reasons Gender Norms: women should remain silent Local leaders are not sensitive to violence against women Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations 53 5.2 Recommendations The recognition of clear links between masculinity, gender norms and violence leads to several important conclusions and recommendations for GADC to consider in ongoing efforts to prevent violence against women. The following recommendations have been grouped into programmatic and policy/advocacy suggestions. They have been further organised into six areas: holding men accountable; victim support; legal and economic empowerment of women; primary prevention; public security; and engaging men for equality. This grouping aligns with areas of action for Partners for Prevention (P4P). These recommendations also reflect those outlined by the RGC\u2019s National Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women 2009- 2012, which includes four strategies: 1. Raising public awareness and dissemination of the Domestic Violence Law in order to change attitudes 2. Enhancing and improving social, medical and legal services for victims 3. Developing and improving policies and laws regarding access to the courts, education on violence prevention in schools and communities and mainstreaming gender into efforts of government institutions, civil society groups and other stakeholders 4. Strengthening the capacity of officials and agencies on legal and social components. 5.2.1 Programmatic Recommendations A. Holding Men Accountable The data shows a clear disconnect between the Domestic Violence Law and its implementation. In order to promote this law, all NGOs need a comprehensive understanding of its provisions and implications. The full range of programmes by local and international non-government organisations addressing gender and/or violence must include policy actions in order to support its legitimacy and make the law more widely understood and accepted. Recommended strategies and activities for holding men accountable for their own violent behaviour therefore should include the following: \u2022 work on building awareness of the Domestic Violence Law, the Trafficking Law,50 and the Criminal Code51 (with regard to rape) through a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c1c6086-2df9-4b87-9c30-3bf808da2eda": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c1c6086-2df9-4b87-9c30-3bf808da2eda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40fd7b809d6625ecfb531c26a9b1cb5073259cb8823cfd1139073ea0e901245f"}}, "hash": "40fd7b809d6625ecfb531c26a9b1cb5073259cb8823cfd1139073ea0e901245f", "text": "multi-level campaign, including a radio talk shows and face-to- face discussions among men so that local authorities and the public will have a more comprehensive understanding of relevant legislation; \u2022 build capacity of local authorities (district, commune and village level councils, chiefs and police) 50 Royal Government of Cambodia Document: Ministry of Justice, Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploi- tation, 2008. 51 Royal Government of Cambodia Document: Provisions Relating to Judiciary and Criminal Law and Procedure Applicable in Cambodia During the Transitional Period, 1992. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 54 to enforce the Domestic Violence Law by providing support at monthly commune and villages meetings and public forums, and by working with commune councils and the general population to strengthen communication and coordination among the commune committees, especially the women and children\u2019s commune committees; \u2022 advocate with provincial courts to encourage them to try cases involving domestic violence, trafficking and rape; \u2022 seek budget support/partnership in order to assist the courts in processing these cases; \u2022 find partners with counselling skills to work with perpetrators through the men and women\u2019s core group dialogue programs; and \u2022 enlist former perpetrators to serve as positive role models. These activities will support governmental efforts to raise awareness about the Domestic Violence Law and to improve the capacity of the courts in handing these cases and also improve social services. B. Victim Support Along with a deficiency of agencies to provide support, the data reveals an underlying notion in Cambodian society that sexual and domestic violence are private issues. As such, victims of violence face many barriers to getting help and support. People are reluctant to discuss sex and violence, and the victim is often blamed and subjected to discrimination. People must be encouraged to speak out; women must be encouraged to seek services and men must be encouraged to support women in seeking services. Programmes need to create safe and comfortable spaces to talk about violence. These efforts should take place on several levels as the following recommendations indicate: \u2022 continue radio and TV talk shows to spread the message that violence is not the fault of the victim but of the perpetrator; \u2022 continue public meetings and campaigns to bring the issue of sexual and domestic violence into the public forum; \u2022 continue capacity building efforts with local authorities in order to advocate for victim\u2019s rights, to reduce discrimination against victims and to encourage a shift in attitudes and beliefs about victims of violence; \u2022 work to find counselling partners to support victims though core group dialogue programmes; and \u2022 coordinate with governmental efforts to change attitudes and build capacity among service agencies. C. Legal and Economic Empowerment of Women The data shows that conflict over financial issues is often one component of disputes resulting in violence against women. Prevailing gender roles lead men and women to perform different types of work that are not equally valued. Decision making tends to be divided along those same lines, making choices about shared resources contentious. Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations 55 As women take on new roles, men must be equipped to become supportive partners. Both men and women need to understand how to deal with changing notions of masculinity. Programmes should acknowledge the contributing factors to such violence, such as men\u2019s economic marginalisation, alcohol use and infidelity. At the same time, these programmes should recognise the fundamental causes of violence, namely the unequal power structures and gender norms existing between men and women. It should be emphasised that power and roles need to be shared in relationships, and programmes should focus on changing beliefs and behaviours. Consequently, the recommendations of this study are: \u2022 develop violence prevention programmes for men that provide an understanding of, and skills to cope with, rapidly changing socioeconomic and political realities With specific reference to the existing GADC programme, activities should: \u2022 support the core men\u2019s group dialogue to share positive experiences of helping in the home and provide them an opportunity to act as role models in the community. These groups will provide a valuable addition to government efforts to create parenting programmes through MOEYS, as outlined in the action plan; and \u2022 integrate campaigns promoting healthy dialogue and recognising the respective contributions of women and men to their families into a wide range of development projects that seek to strengthen livelihoods. D. Primary Prevention An underlying cause of sexual and physical violence is gendered power inequalities. Informants reported that the family environment is a primary place where gender roles are learned and internalised. It is advisable therefore, that GADC", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79922b66-cb95-4198-b1d7-4975db5d6d31": {"__data__": {"id_": "79922b66-cb95-4198-b1d7-4975db5d6d31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f456037039d83d969a6df1585530e8194adc63142f96acc12df0d72d061d5d8a"}}, "hash": "f456037039d83d969a6df1585530e8194adc63142f96acc12df0d72d061d5d8a", "text": "and other agencies working to prevent gender-based violence should: \u2022 include young people in public campaigns on violence prevention; \u2022 implement interventions with adolescent and adult males and females that are tailored to be sensitive to the Cambodian context. This may include working with instructors of the same sex and the same age as the target audience, who employ some degree of cultural sensitivity. These programmes should specifically engage young men, some of whom are already questioning rigid gender norms; \u2022 ensure that the core men and women\u2019s groups discuss the behaviour and attitudes of young people, and ways to ensure effective cross-generational communication about these topics; and \u2022 incorporate gender-based violence and masculinity issues into other programmes related to peace building and conflict resolution, as well as gender issues. Discussions on gender norms and violence prevention should be mainstreamed into their work. This work with youth will be best coordinated Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 56 with the government\u2019s work with young people in the school curriculum. E. Public Security For the majority of women who are abused, assistance is difficult to access. Police, commune or village authorities are the only options available. Courts are distant, while agencies that provide counselling, legal aid or shelter are even more inaccessible. Furthermore, local authorities and police generally fail to enforce existing laws against violence. In view of these constraints, the recommendation is as follows: \u2022 in order to strengthen community harmony, GADC should plan to expand discussions in its core men\u2019s and women\u2019s groups to include the joint roles and responsibilities of citizens and authorities to build community networks and strengthen the social infrastructure. These discussions should ultimately create both support, and a demand for, increased law enforcement (through training and other efforts) as envisioned by the government action plan and increase awareness that violence against women is a crime. Together, improved law enforcement and stronger cooperation with citizens could change the culture of acceptance of violence. F. Engaging Men for Equality Research shows that a significant number of men recognise that a lack of mutual understanding incites domestic violence and that there is dual responsibility of both husband and wife to prevent family violence. The existing research also notes that talking about the consequences of violence appeared to have a profound impact on male participants, leading some to undertake not to commit violence against women. In view of these findings, GADC along with other NGOs and similar agencies should: \u2022 continue developing a strategy to strengthen male involvement in preventing gender-based violence in Cambodia; \u2022 provide implementing staff with training and support, both to approach violence from a gender sensitive perspective and to act as positive role models; \u2022 encourage men and women to talk about responsible sexual behaviour. The concepts embodied in the Domestic Violence Law and disease prevention practices can be used as a starting point to discuss responsible behaviours. This strategy will also include information about RGC\u2019s HIV policy and personal responsibility for prevention of transmission. Experimentation with ways to incorporate ideas about sexual health, including sexuality education and sexual pleasure should also occur. This will be challenging in the Cambodian cultural environment, but a possible starting point may be a discussion of the acceptance of sex outside marriage. This approach would include discussions that encourage men and women not to stigmatise or discriminate against people with HIV/AIDS. This strategy would augment the government\u2019s efforts to include sexual health education in public schools and to establish a new Committee on Social Morality, Women and Family Values; and \u2022 provide information to men and women about Cambodia\u2019s Labour Law and its provisions for Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations 57 paternity leave.52 GADC and other NGOs working in the area should encourage men to use paternity leave so that they can help with family care. Similarly, other programmes addressing issues highlighted in the study could incorporate exploration, discussion and action plans to implement solutions to these problems. It would be useful if the many agencies focusing on public health and sexual health could concurrently delve further into the underlying attitudes about masculinity, as they seek to promote healthy behaviour. In addition, labour unions and employers and employees should promote paternity leave programs. 5.2.2 Recommendations for Policy Makers and Advocates A. Holding Men Accountable Most respondents acknowledged the existence of strong gender roles, but only a few recognised these norms as a source of violence. Therefore those individuals and institutions in positions of authority that are able to intervene in gender-based violence situations need to have a deeper understand about violence and the constructs of masculinity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29b49d63-aaee-496d-8319-f36803f8b840": {"__data__": {"id_": "29b49d63-aaee-496d-8319-f36803f8b840", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66e1230cb4486bf895225ddf7eeca3ee195b91e9ca05e1bc09feece4c0edf915"}}, "hash": "66e1230cb4486bf895225ddf7eeca3ee195b91e9ca05e1bc09feece4c0edf915", "text": "Dialogues and sensitisation programmes with policy makers are necessary to ensure effective responses to this violence. Therefore: \u2022 to ensure that perpetrators are held accountable, it is recommended that the ministries of Women\u2019s Affairs, Information, and Justice take into consideration the important role they must play in engaging the courts and authorities at the provincial level, so that domestic violence, trafficking and rape cases will be prosecuted; and \u2022 men and women in legislative roles should raise awareness about the Domestic Violence Law and related policies affecting gender and human rights to ensure that this legislation is appropriately implemented. These policy makers are encouraged to assess the budgetary and infrastructure requirements for full implementation and monitoring of the Domestic Violence Law. Policy makers and advocates alike should encourage law enforcement personnel to engage with the community in a positive way and to be proactive in raising awareness and ensuring compliance with the law, so that they can fulfil their duty to work towards violence prevention. These recommendations fit well within the provisions of the government\u2019s action plan to establish policy and related mechanisms by expanding access to the courts, strengthening the criminal justice system, including domestic violence in policy training materials, and amending laws and regulations to improve 52 Kingdom of Cambodia Document: Ministry of Social Affairs, Labour and Veteran Affairs, Labour Law, 1997. Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 58 implementation of the Domestic Violence Law by strengthening capacity in the courts. B. Victim Support As part of the government\u2019s efforts to strengthen social service delivery and improve access to the criminal justice system, it is recommended that the relevant agencies be encouraged to provide female staff to work directly with victims. The survey revealed that it is difficult for most people to talk about sex or violence, and this difficulty is increased when a woman is trying to talk to a man. Providing female staff members for counselling, legal, and victim support would help ensure that female victims feel more comfortable talking about their experiences and accepting help. C. Legal and Economic Empowerment of Women The expectation that men should be the main income provider for the family and responsible for financial decisions does not recognise the value of unpaid work that men and women share to support their families and their homes. The economic value of unpaid work that women and men do must be recognised. Therefore: \u2022 the government should be encouraged to include this topic in the public education curriculum and in media campaigns; \u2022 school textbooks and public campaigns could challenge traditionally gender norms by showing males and females in positive, if unconventional, roles. For example, women and girls can be portrayed studying, working, and earning money outside of the home, as well as in positions of power. Positive images of men and boys can be shown helping with housework, caring for family members or working under female bosses; and \u2022 civil society organisations and other agencies are encouraged to engage in campaigns that highlight respect for women and domestic violence prevention. D. Primary Prevention Most participants stated that their understanding of gender norms was largely gained from elders within in their family and community. An increasing percentage of Cambodian children now receive a primary education that creates an entry point for primary prevention programs. Through the efforts of GADC and similar NGOs, educators should be encouraged to promote concepts of gender equality, conflict resolution, knowledge of the laws, and updated messages about gender roles and sexuality. Specific strategies could include: \u2022 carrying out critical reviews of school curriculum at the pre-school, primary and secondary levels to include ways of promoting gender equality that engage both boys and girls; \u2022 developing training for teachers, administrative staff and other groups dealing with children and youth to promote ways to engage boys and young men in efforts to promote gender equality; Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations 59 \u2022 including messages and activities targeting boys and young men and promoting gender equality within existing sexuality education and HIV/AIDS prevention programs; and \u2022 engaging sporting groups in the public and private sector to promote gender equality among boys and men, for example, by drawing on existing experiences by local organisations such as Pour un Sourire d\u2019Enfant.53 E. Public Security Incidents of violence discussed in this survey were often brought to the village chief. Encouragement of provincial policy and commune chiefs to provide leadership in this area, to ensure improved cooperation and action should occur. In addition, increased focus on these cases by the Office of Public Security at the commune level and with commune police", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66dbb40f-9457-410a-8fa7-72d392284ca1": {"__data__": {"id_": "66dbb40f-9457-410a-8fa7-72d392284ca1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da0c978c37d158a5abbe8c52db30a3d6576c582b485dbe03ad296da9d41f99fb"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d9e23d2-dbc0-43c6-b4a4-6f64ce741d5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fec114a11ac4e0feefdb3a85efc9ca853dd5636ad4a26cd55beb6123fed3be6"}}, "hash": "e860ce7e441c700418e7a5df46eaa5aa6324996fa8e198cdd67a067093fa3af6", "text": "would be welcome. F. Engaging Men for Equality The data gathered in this survey showed that most people do not recognise the link between existing gender norms and violence. There needs to be greater understanding by men and women of the relationship between gender equality and violence, and for increased efforts to promote gender equality through public policy. For their part, NGOs, social service providers and violence prevention advocates have an important role to play, by simplifying training tools and materials to ensure that they are effective and easy to use, and in providing adequate services for victims. In order to promote equality on an immediate and practical level, organisation policies should grant paternity leave and encourage men to use this time off so that they can assist within the family. Specific strategies could include: \u2022 strengthening the use of mass media campaigns for positive, non-violent messages about manhood, including participation in domestic and household tasks, care giving and respect for women; \u2022 using financial and social policy to improve the balance between work and family life, and encourage men to make equal contributions to domestic work, i.e. paid paternal leave provisions; and \u2022 providing information on parent education programmes to fathers about gender equitable ways to rear children, emphasising advantages of such approaches. 5.3 Areas for Further Investigation In addition to recommendations, this qualitative exploration leaves potential areas of further investigation for GADC, NGO\u2019s, service providers, research institutions and other professionals in Cambodia: \u2022 What is the relationship between economic and social change, gender constructs and violence? 53 Pour un Sourire d\u2018 Enfant (PSE). Website can be found at: www.pse.asso.fr Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 60 \u2022 What advocacy strategies are most effective to encourage law enforcement against gender-based violence? \u2022 What is the impact of programmes that engage men and boys and what are some promising practices for engaging boys and men? and \u2022 How can these strategies be tailored to be effective for males of different ages and life experience? These questions reflect GADC\u2019s continued commitment to linking policy and programmatic action to prevent violence. With an ultimate goal of equality and a society free of violence, the path to becoming a \u201creal\u201d man will have to be rebuilt alongside the construction of a path of empowerment for women. 5.4 Next Steps The Domestic Violence Law and the National Action Plan to Prevent Violence on Women provide a solid foundation for further efforts to prevent violence against women. In the short term, GADC plans to put the programmatic recommendations into practice in its core men\u2019s and women\u2019s groups. This report will be followed up by a second report with more in-depth analysis of the qualitative data in some of these areas. GADC urges policy makers to make implementation of the Domestic Violence Law and other components of the action plan a priority. Finally, GADC urges NGOs and other civil society organisations to expand and improve their advocacy, dissemination and social service activities in such a way as to respond to the needs raised in the study.
