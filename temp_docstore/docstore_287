Similarly, the increasing frequency and severity of sudden onset dis- asters needs to be prepared for. Given these pressures, donors want to spend (and to be seen to be spending) as soon as possible in responding to climate change. And their preferred modality is through vertical funds. The characteristics of vertical funding 40. During the last decade, global programmes (vertical funds) have become an increasingly important element of the international aid architecture. Examples of glo- bal programmes include the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI), and the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). While these programmes have very different models and fund different sectors, they all earmark their funding discrete purposes. They are usu- ally seen as funding the provision of global public goods. 41. In addition to the characteristics set out above, ver- tical funding shares similar characteristics to climate change financing; \u2022 It is additional to \u2018normal\u2019 ODA \u2022 It is for a narrowly defined purpose \u2022 It has specific monitoring and reporting requirements \u2022 Administration is not delegated to country offices but retained at international headquarters. \u201cGlobal programs \u2013 often referred to also as \u2018global funds\u2019 or \u2018vertical funds\u2019 \u2013 are defined (see IEG, 2004) as \u2018partnerships and related initiatives whose benefits are intended to cut across more than one region of the world and in which the partners: (a) reach explicit agreement on objectives; (b) agree to establish a new (formal or informal) organization; (c) generate new products or services; and (d) contribute dedicated resources to the program.\u2019 In other words, global programs focus \u201cvertically\u201d on specific issues or themes, in contrast with the \u2018horizontal\u2019 approach of the country-based model of aid.\u201d \u201cThe effectiveness and the sustainability of global programs will ultimately rest on the presence of complementary sector-level and country-level policies. As noted in the 2006 Global Monitoring Report (p. 78), \u2018global funds need to support country-led strategies and priorities (...)\u2019. A recent joint DAC-World Bank workshop (Paris, December 5, 2006) concluded that a \u2018mutually reinforcing approach\u201d between global programs and the country-based aid delivery model should be developed, focusing on complementarities and strengthening the alignment of \u2018vertical\u2019 aid with country programs.\u201d Extract from \u201cA Brief History of Aid Institutions\u201d World Bank 2008 Global Programmes and Vertical Funds: a World Bank Perspective Vertical Funding Mechanisms 13 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific The particular challenges of Climate Change financing as vertical funding 42. As indicated above, vertical funds for climate change financing have been established more quickly (and pro- lifically) than for any other development challenge. And with good reason. However, there continues to be con- siderable debate between experts around the impact of such vertical mechanisms. Some see them as providing effective, targeted funding for defined purposes. Others see such funding as distorting and fragmenting devel- opment, getting in the way of countries defining and managing their own processes and working against the harmonisation of all development assistance. 43. As the World Bank notes above, vertical funds face particular challenges when trying to integrate their programmatic objectives with broader national devel- opment processes. And they will only be effective and sustainable if they do. 44. Other nationally led financing modalities such as Programme Based Approaches and Budget Support may provide some characteristics that are useful to consider in the design of climate change financing mechanisms; indeed as will be seen below, some countries are begin- ning to question if separate climate change financing mechanisms are the most effective means of supporting integrated responses to climate change. By the same token, given the cross cutting nature of the climate change agenda, it is highly likely that if they are to be effective, climate change financing mechanisms will require innovate approaches that other aspects of ODA management would learn from. 14 Realising Development Effectiveness The case study countries are diverse 45.

Two of the case study countries are classed as Least Developed (Bangladesh and Cambodia), the remain- ing three are Middle Income Countries, with Vietnam graduating to this status only in 2009.

In the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, \u2018traditional\u2019 ODA funding is waning, with fewer grants and a disengagement by bilateral partners. However, funding for climate change activities, outside and theoretically additional to ODA, is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Likewise the culture of aid management varies, with the Philippines and Indonesia receiving almost all funds as loans, and both make a significant contribution to their own climate change miti- gation and adaptation finance. In contrast, Cambodia\u2019s assistance is mainly in the form of grants. 48. With development has come urbanisation. Eleven of the fifteen most populous cities in the world are in Asia, two (Manila and Jakarta) in the case study countries (Dhaka is ranked 19th). The Philippines The total ODA portfolio was estimated to be U$11 billion in 2009; $10bn in loans and $1bn in grants. Indonesia A report by the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), in the first quarter of 2010, shows that Indonesia manages US$ 20bn in development loans. Cambodia Current commitments to Cambodia for climate change are in the form of grants and roughly total USD$96 million. Although disbursements to climate change through ODA channels have been increasing, it is evident that at the same time other sectors, notably environment and conservation, have declined. Since 2004, ODA to environment and conservation has steadily decreased from US$19.6 million to US$7.6 million in 2008. 49. It will also be noted that political and administrative cultures also vary. Some countries are more centralized (Cambodia) than others (Indonesia). 50. Whilst the countries are disparate in experience, they are all receiving climate change financing in one form or another. Climate Change is an issue beyond boundaries 51. Whilst financial flows and international develop- ment are almost always channelled through states, the effects of climate change do not fit neatly within political boundaries. There are 57 transboundary river basins in Asia29. The continent has some of the largest river systems in the world cutting across national bor- ders; the Indus (China, India Pakistan), the Ganges (India and Bangladesh) and Brahmaputra (Tibet, India and Bangladesh), the Mekong (China, Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam), and the Red River (China and Vietnam). The International Organisation for Migration notes that the numbers of potential \u2018forced climate migrants\u2019 by 2050 globally ranges from between 25 million to 1 billion people30. In Bangladesh it is estimated that up to 20 million people will be displaced from ris- ing sea levels31.

However, this data is not yet fully comprehensive, nor available in a form that enables detailed and robust analysis of funding types (loans or grants) or expected utilization. Bangladesh $260m worth of climate funds is reported to be currently in place (including government contributions). Philippines Grants received for climate change mitigation and adaptation since 1992 total $1bn. From 2004 to 2008, the government alone provided $1.6bn for climate change, while external agencies provided roughly $1bn, 40% of which was in the form of loans. 53.

That it is not possible to clearly articulate what is being spent on climate change activities in the five coun- tries is itself instructive. 17 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific 56. This section looks at the similarities and differences in how financing for climate change is being managed across the five case study countries, according to the principles of aid effectiveness. Ownership 57. All case study countries are members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and have signed the Kyoto Protocol. Under article 3.4, the UNFCC urges signatories to incorporate climate change into national development planning. The Bali Action Plan of December 2007, delivered by the UNFCCC at the 13th Conference of Parties (COP13) went further, urging developing countries to integrate adaptation actions into sectoral and national planning and programmes. Is climate change integrated within existing policy and planning processes? 58. All of the case study countries have climate change plans, in one form or another, albeit at different stages of progress. In the Philippines, a climate change bill was introduced in late 2007, being made law as the Climate Change Act (CCA) of 2009. The purpose of the Act is to mainstream climate change into government policy, establishing a framework strategy and programme on climate change. This Act has led to a National Framework Strategy on Climate Change for the period 2010\u20132022. A process of coordinating the formulation of an Action Plan to implement the strategy is underway. At the same time, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) is mainstreaming climate change into the Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan for the period 2011\u20132016. 59. In the other case study countries, the policy and leg- islative framework does not include all three elements of legislation, strategy and action planning. Do roles and responsibilities support co-ordination? 60. Whilst the above demonstrates that planning is underway, in all cases there is a level of role confusion as to who oversees climate change financing. Climate change, like its related issue Disaster Risk Reduction, cuts across sectors, and arguably requires management that seeks to integrate, not fragment policy, implementa- tion and budgeting processes. Unfortunately this is not always the case. 61. The tension between Ministries of Environment (which tend to provide the co-ordination function for cli- mate change) and other ministries is a common theme. Do the different global funds support national ownership? 62.

However, it is reflected that the Government does not own the initiatives. 63.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f34ae8b-b0fc-4707-a9cf-59ad72b4f7f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f34ae8b-b0fc-4707-a9cf-59ad72b4f7f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ad035e85276af405766fd3df96fb5535b9ca25e20e00e63b2ebdcc8229c3d40"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a226de9-c0ff-4364-b873-94d8e3d0fd54", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fac8d38d0c1b229ec4e6c592a906062f239e629033ee5e7c8a31cb609456acc5"}}, "hash": "eb9404cf4a20f28688bde9ca38ff5c0d2f246dd3434b39080fcd3525bce50779", "text": "By the same token, Viet Nam and Bangladesh also exhibit characteristics replicated in countries that have implemented the institutional requirements of the glo- bal climate change governance bodies.

In particular, this can affect how policy ministries relate to each other over the competition for, and access to, funding for climate change from the different funding channels. It is notable that, in most cases, a Ministry of Environment is often seen as a junior department of government. It tends to have fewer resources. What is the relationship between the urgency of international efforts and national political priorities? 64. This leads to a further observation. In some countries (notably Bangladesh) climate change has considerable political salience, and the current policy is based on a long-standing approach to disaster risk reduction. In other contexts (such as Vietnam) it is becoming more of a political issue. However, it is arguable for some coun- tries in the region, were it not for the international focus on climate change and the demands of the international climate change architecture, it is unlikely that climate change would feature yet as an issue in the political discourse nor would there be the institutional mecha- nisms that currently exist. That it is has got this far, it can be argued, is due to the work of the international community. However, the lack of real domestic political salience means that policy development, co-ordination and implementation may be constrained and where it is in place, not necessarily appropriate to the particular context. The Government of Indonesia (host of COP13 in Bali) developed policy documents that set out how mitigation and adaptation activities were to be integrated into the National Medium-Term Development Plan (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional, or RPJMN), and guiding sectors and local governments in the implementation of climate change programmes. This led to the National Development Planning: Response to Climate Change document, commonly known as \u201cThe Yellow Book\u201d which acts as a reference for the international community in providing support, and an Indonesia Climate Change Sectoral Roadmap (ICCSR) that harmonises programmes and climate change actions within sub-sectors. In Vietnam, the Prime Minister issued an executive decision (which is law) in December 2008 approving a National Target Program to Respond to Climate Change. This has three phases and implements a national process that will lead, eventually, to a single national plan to respond to climate change. The programme has an explicit objective to ensure that climate change is incorporated into national and provincial plans. Specifically, it sets out that each line ministry and local administration should have a Climate Change Action Plan. While climate change does not feature in the current Five Year Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) nor in the guidance framework for the next SEDP, indications are that the next Party Congress, to be held in early 2011, will pay particular attention to climate change, and climate change will be mainstreamed in some form into the 2011\u20132015 SEDP. In Bangladesh the Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) was developed following on from 2005 National Adaptation Programme of Action. This has strong cross-party support, and is intended to integrate into the three-year poverty reduction strategy, the National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (NSAPR). Whilst tackling climate change is one of the supp five supporting strategies of the NSAPR, the BCCSAP has yet to be fully integrated into it (primarily, it is reported, as a result of capacity constraints). In Cambodia it is planned that The National Strategy and Action Plan for Climate Change will be a key policy priority in the National Strategic Development Plan 2009\u20132013. This action plan will provide the comprehensive policy and budgetary framework needed to strengthen government ownership of climate change financing. While there is an intention to mainstream climate change into sectoral work, this has yet to be fully implemented. 19 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific Alignment 65.

At the same time, in the same countries, In the Philippines, while a Climate Change Commission (CCC) exists, the Climate Change Act does not adequately address the institutional arrangements for managing climate finance. This has created some confusion over which agency should be responsible for coordination, notably about which part of government should oversee the Adaptation Fund. In Indonesia it is the National Board on Climate Change (DNPI) who would (in theory) coordinate climate change activities. However, the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and The Ministry of Environment (KLN) are also playing coordinating roles, and traditionally BAPPENAS has played the lead coordination role in development planning and cooperation. In Vietnam, there is a National Steering Committee for the National Target Program to Respond to Climate Change, chaired by the Prime Minister. A Standing Office has been put in place to implement the programme, as well as an Executive Board, chaired by the Minister of Natural Resources and the Environment (MONRE). MONRE provides most of the resources for co-ordination. However, other line ministries, notably the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), have a considerable stake in the development of the national response. MARD has established a steering committee for climate change adaptation and mitigation (OCCA), and has identified a series of (primarily adaptation) projects for funding (totalling up to $12bn for five years) on activities ranging from rural infrastructure to agriculture systems adaptation. In Bangladesh, the National Environment Committee/Council provide strategic guidance and oversight to the response to climate change. In operation, co-ordination is undertaken by the Climate Change Secretariat/Unit at the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), which liaises with climate change cells in all ministries to plan and implement activities in their respective ministries. The MoEF\u2019s role is to convene and coordinate the various line ministries, and in supporting them to take the necessary steps to mainstream climate change into their plans and programmes. Cambodia\u2019s Climate Change Department identified a number of challenges in accessing the global climate change funds, including: \u2022 Fragmented and diffuse array of climate funding options; \u2022 Complex rules and procedures in accessing the funds; \u2022 Relatively small amounts available compared to recipient country needs; \u2022 Co-financing requirement is especially difficult for Least Developed Countries; \u2022 Limited national capacity and lack of incentive in developing proposals for funding due to long lead times and overheads; \u2022 Limited local knowledge of the rules and procedures of each fund; and \u2022 Mandatory requirement to include a GEF agency in GEF proposals \u2013 the priorities of these agencies can contradict recipient government priorities and agendas. 20 Realising Development Effectiveness climate financing is about to flow because the conditions relating to a particular climate change funding stream have been satisfied (for instance the Clean Technology Fund finance to the Philippines, channelled through the World Bank and Asian Development Bank). 67. This divergence in approach to funding illustrates a key challenge for climate change financing. On the one hand needs are great and urgent, and funds (with clearly defined remits and requirements) are available. On the other hand (as seen above) countries in the region are at different stages in implementing their own policies, strategies and plans; providing funds in ways that are not consistent with the final policies might prove less than effective in the medium and long term. Is funding predictable and based on needs? 68. Predictability, particularly of the \u2018vertical\u2019 funds, is difficult to forecast. Whilst emitters (the Annex 1 coun- tries) have generally made significant pledges at COPs such as Copenhagen they have (with notable and hon- ourable exceptions) made limited progress in realising pledges. 69. It appears that for climate change financing across the region, support by external partners is more often than not \u2018supply driven\u2019. In Cambodia, the Climate Change Department identified that a number of develop- ment partners preferred to work with selected ministries by following existing capacities rather than aligning to capacity needs. This is also the case in Vietnam, where long-term relationships between line ministries and funders have resulted in concerns that bilateral discus- sions on funding for climate change are taking place without full involvement of the Ministry for Planning and Investment and the Ministry of Finance, who would ensure that financing was fully integrated with national plans, budgets and processes. 70.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04c70429-c527-4706-9ffa-462520950903": {"__data__": {"id_": "04c70429-c527-4706-9ffa-462520950903", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d49ba6c74d5c9cd8000fd3dd4ca888b9c15dc07a3a2509cee5c0e8fbdd8d7ddf"}, "2": {"node_id": "5fa764d2-f02e-4cb5-b869-07547b50c4e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24d391e319520974c149ccfd32678ca34573be7d941188532dc8c668ecbd289e"}}, "hash": "b14bd1bed9c1cc9bbdf0423a409143d1d8e7efacea3422ba258ae715e01b0b35", "text": "70.

In Viet Nam, since there are no developed plans for climate change financing, climate change funding does not yet help to fully reduce financing gaps that have been identified and costed into the national or sub national strategies. Rather, the availability of the financing has led to funding opportunities being identified. It is argu- able whether this supports national planning. Indeed it is not yet clear in Viet Nam whether climate change funding should be integrated fully (as the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Planning and Investment would prefer) into the activities of line ministries and provinces, or be managed and reported as separate projects (as some funding partners require). Does funding support and integrate with national systems for budgeting and reporting? 72. Equally the modality of providing assistance is often \u2018supply driven\u2019. Ministries of Finance in the case study countries express a preference (on the whole) for budget support or programme-based approaches as the modality of assistance. Much climate change financing is, however, discrete, provided through vertical funds with defined requirements and sometimes requir- ing separate project implementation units to be put in place. The country case study for Cambodia notes that: \u201c\u2026 donors working in the cross-sector demonstrate a wide array of foreign rules, requirements (administrative, financial, visibility, etc.) and agendas. Although donors understand the need to align, implementation of their stated commitments to align to climate change activities with Royal Government of Cambodia plans has proven challenging. When donors state that their initiatives are aligned to RGC policy priorities, the reality is that often the actions are pre-set objectives for support, which are subsequently modified to make them seem to be aligned with government policy priorities.\u201d 73. Whether systems are adequate to fully enable part- ners to report on and manage funding is a key issue. In Vietnam, systems cannot yet \u2018earmark\u2019 climate fund- ing that is allocated into the general budget, although there is work underway to do this. Similarly there is no system in place in Indonesia to capture and report on all climate change financing provided by external partners. In Bangladesh a debate is underway on the 21 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific ability of government to maintain fiduciary standards. This has resulted in a split of responsibility between government having the lead role in the programming funds, whilst the World Bank continues to maintain the financial systems that satisfy donors (the precise roles and responsibilities of the government agencies and the World Bank are still being worked out in an evolving operations manual). In Cambodia, there are also system- ic constraints to the use of country systems for climate change financing; the MoE does not currently have the sufficient financial management systems capacity to manage the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund, so the UNDP (temporarily) manages the fund, supported by European Union, DANIDA and Sida with functions being handed over to government following a three-year capacity support period. Does climate change financing contribute to the strengthening of country systems? 74. It should be noted that a key driver for the alignment principle in the Paris Declaration was to give all part- ners an incentive to strengthen financial management systems. Progress on this across the region is mixed; without the political will and sustained attention paid to organisational development, capacity support from external partners in this area is unlikely to succeed. This is an issue clearly beyond the narrow confines of climate change financing. 75. It should be noted that, other than the generic commitments to alignment set out in the Hanoi Core Statement (for Viet Nam) and the Jakarta Commitment (for Indonesia) there was no specific commitment from funding partners in the case study countries to align their climate change funding with partner country poli- cies and systems. Harmonisation What arrangements are in place to ensure that all funders of climate change work in a coherent way? 76. The case study countries have a variety of mech- anisms to ensure external financial assistance for climate change is harmonized. In all countries, there is an overarching Consultative Group or equivalent to guide harmonization of funding for general ODA. In the case of Viet Nam and Indonesia, there are particular accords that commit partners to harmonized assistance. However, it is not clear whether, in all countries, fund- ing partners see climate finance as falling within the realm of current donor co-ordination arrangements. In all cases, however, co-ordination and information shar- ing mechanisms particular to climate change financing have yet to be formalized, but are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f67ca734-1353-4a8a-b830-01322c089801": {"__data__": {"id_": "f67ca734-1353-4a8a-b830-01322c089801", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62807693482ceccae5c8d1358125589f8c4fab08164501f76cc11d67a5068dac"}}, "hash": "62807693482ceccae5c8d1358125589f8c4fab08164501f76cc11d67a5068dac", "text": "emerging. Are all funding partners included in the co- ordination arrangements? 77. In the Philippines, much of the international climate finance, (largely technical assistance) flows through the Global Environment Facility and bilateral agencies, including the German, Australian and Spanish govern- ments. While most funds are provided independently to the relevant agencies, the donor agencies have set up an informal consultative group to exchange informa- tion on each other\u2019s work, which does not involve any government participation. Similarly in Indonesia, a meet- ing is held between the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) and Japan every three months around support for the climate change programme. Also in Indonesia, DFID and AusAID have recently begun convening informal climate change meetings among development partners to share information. A formal letter is currently being drafted to inform Government of the development partner\u2019s meeting. There are also monthly informal development partner meetings in Cambodia, hosted by UNDP, but these are not regularly attended by some major donors. The UNDP as convenor of the donor meetings keeps the most up-to-date reg- ister of funded and planned climate change activities. However, as attendance to the informal meetings is incomplete and irregular, the funding matrix is incom- plete. As a first step towards a more coherent approach to the cross-sector, development partners participating in the informal climate change donor group have drafted a Statement of Cooperation. It is expected to be signed by development partners in the last quarter of 2010. 78. In Bangladesh, a Working Group [of the Local Consultative Group] on Climate Change and Environment is the main institutional mechanism for co-ordinating donor assistance. While no climate funds currently 22 Realising Development Effectiveness appear to be using budgetary support or other pro- gramme-based approaches, some donors in Bangladesh have undertaken joint missions and analysis and pooled their adaptation funds. 79. Questions remain, however, whether the co-ordi- nation mechanisms are comprehensive. In none of the case study countries does it appear that representatives of all external funders for climate change assistance sit together to co-ordinate their funding. Similarly, it should be noted that not all funding sources are man- aged from within the recipient countries. Indeed many of the \u2018vertical\u2019 climate funds are administered from Northern capitals. 80. It is also true that, as with general development assistance, harmonization of external finance is a great- er challenge where national policies are weak. Where policy and planning is strong, it is easier for external funders to be co-ordinated. Managing for Results 81. The Paris Declaration requires donors and partner countries to make a joint commitment to managing for development results. Similarly, a condition of all dedi- cated climate change financing under the UNFCCC is that actions should be measurable, reportable and verifi- able (MRV). The Philippines Framework Strategy defines two long-term objectives for adaptation and mitigation respectively: \u2022 To build the adaptive capacity of communities and increasing the resilience of natural ecosystems to climate change \u2022 Facilitate the transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions for sustainable development. Seven additional sector-specific objectives for adaptation and six for mitigation have been defined. In some sectors, further sub-objectives have been defined, while strategic priorities have been identified for each sector. Taken together, these objectives and priorities provide a results framework that all stakeholders could work towards achieving. In Bangladesh the Climate Change Action Plan for 2009\u20132018 outlines as its overarching goal: \u201cto build the capacity and resilience of the country to meet the challenge of climate change.\u201d Under the six pillars identified in the strategy, the Action Plan identifies 28 outcomes that it would like to see achieved form 2009\u20132013 (MoEF 2009). While the articulation of these outcomes could serve as a starting point for developing a results-based monitoring framework, it needs to be further developed to include measurable performance indicators to track progress over time. There is no framework yet in Viet Nam for measuring the impact of externally provided climate change finance. When climate change becomes incorporated in the national planning process, it is expected that a results framework for national climate change programming will be put in place. This is likely to happen with the implementation of the 2011\u20132015 Five Year Plan. In Cambodia results frameworks have been developed based on donor requirements on a project-by-project basis.

A system to properly monitor and record MRV results has yet to be developed and capacity needs to be developed to ensure stronger linkages between climate change financing and results reporting. 23 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific Do we know that current climate change financing gets results? 82. Progress on managing for results is variable. The Government of Philippines has identified Key Result Areas through the definition of higher-level long-term objectives, and sector-specific objectives, sub-objectives and strategic priorities for adaptation and mitigation. In doing so, they have taken the first important step of defining the climate outcomes that the country needs to achieve or make progress towards over a 12-year time frame. 83. In all the case study countries, results management and reporting systems are inadequate, either in terms of the specific requirements for UNFCCC funding or in the broader terms of the satisfying Paris Declaration commitments. They capture neither what is spent nor performance. Mutual Accountability 84. The 2008 Paris Declaration Monitoring Survey noted that \u201cAid is more effective when both donors and partner country governments are accountable \u2013 to their respec- tive publics and to each other \u2013 for the use of resources and management to achieve development results.\u201d Are there places where all stakeholders meet to hold each other to account? 85. Whilst all case study countries had a Development Forum or equivalent, none of the countries had a dedicated forum for dialogue where funding partners, recipient government and other stakeholders such as civil society could meet around climate change assist- ance and financing. Accountability mechanisms tend to be internal to government, based around bureaucratic requirements. Do domestic accountability mechanisms take account of climate change? 86. Domestic accountability mechanisms in some of the case study countries (such as the Parliament in Bangladesh) have been involved in dialogue on climate change financing, and (also in Bangladesh) civil soci- ety organizations have participated in discussions on Climate Change Strategies and Action Plans. It is notable in Bangladesh that there is a relatively strong capacity of civil society, and there has been a long engagement particularly in disaster risk reduction. These are, how- ever, the exceptions, and parliaments, the media and civil society have yet to fully engage with climate change across the region. It is also notable that, in general, insti- tutions that build accountability, such as the media, are poorly equipped to deal with the climate change agenda and have limited capacity to monitor climate change activities and the implementation of external financing. 24 Realising Development Effectiveness Preamble \u2022 Climate change is intrinsically linked to development. It is an exceptional global challenge as well as an opportunity for improved international collaboration. To respond to the challenge we will need to mobilize all our knowledge and experience in the provision of external financing for development. \u2022 Countries are currently developing their national response to climate change and are concerned about the quantity of finance that they will have available to them as well as the quality of that finance \u2013 the conditions under which it will be provided. \u2022 The Paris Declaration targets and indicators for the management of development assistance provide benchmarks for the quality of external sources of public finance provided for climate change. \u2022 Innovations in the governance of climate change funding modalities, such as with the Adaptation Fund, should also be learnt from and used to inform the management of development assistance. \u2022 Assessments of the quality of public finance for climate change should look at all sources \u2013 includ- ing domestic and international \u2013 and should be country-led. \u2022 Analysis and evidence generated at the country level should be used to inform a transparent debate on the quality of climate financing, alongside its quan- tity. This debate should be interdisciplinary bringing together climate specialists with managers of exter- nally provided public finance. The Bangkok Call for Action: Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific 28th October 2010 The recommendations contained within the Bangkok Call for Action were developed at the Asia-Pacific Climate Change Finance and Aid Effectiveness dialogue held on 19th\u201320th October 2010 in Bangkok. The dialogue was facilitated by the Capacity Development for Development Effectiveness (CDDE) Facility and brought together over 75 participants representing the seven governments of Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Indonesia, Philippines and Viet Nam, as well as the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, eight development partners and international agencies (ADB, AUSAID, JICA, OECD, SIDA, UNDP, UNEP, World Bank) and representatives", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3131fcc5-d978-4b34-911f-199026f54a96": {"__data__": {"id_": "3131fcc5-d978-4b34-911f-199026f54a96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dad9800139cfbb0c970cda9e605dab76fcd2292118e6c3d73ae50fdea34aa164"}}, "hash": "dad9800139cfbb0c970cda9e605dab76fcd2292118e6c3d73ae50fdea34aa164", "text": "from parliament and civil society. Beyond these recommendations \u2013 this synthesis report provides issues for further consideration which may be addressed in future analysis and dialogue are found in Annex 6. Background 25 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific \u2022 The debate on the quality of climate change finance should be initiated across countries at regional, sub- regional and national levels and promote south-south dialogue to feed into international policy process and decision making. \u2022 The Bangkok Call for Action is articulated in four sets of recommendations: \u2212 For Countries (including executive government, legislative bodies and citizens) that are recipients of external sources of public finance for climate change \u2212 For Governments that receive external sources of public finance for climate change \u2212 For International Funders working at the country level \u2212 For International Funders working globally (i) Countries should\u2026 \u2022 Countries should broaden and deepen the political leadership of the climate change agenda. Political leadership and ownership of the climate change agenda by national stakeholders will be the founda- tion of an effective climate change response. \u2022 Countries should establish clear national priorities for climate change to guide policy, planning and budgeting. \u2022 The emphasis should be on mainstreaming the results and financial resources required of a climate change response within national plans, budgets and sector / sub-national processes. Countries should integrate external public financing into national budgets where appropriate. \u2022 In developing the response to climate change and managing climate finance, attention should be given to harmonising agency functions, laws, policies and regulations. \u2022 Countries need to identify and allocate all avail- able sources of finance for climate including private finance. \u2022 Evidence and data for monitoring the implementa- tion and financing for the climate change response should be strengthened and made publically avail- able. Existing databases for monitoring development processes, domestic budgets and development assistance can all provide mechanisms for track- ing the climate change response both in relation to results and resources. (ii) Governments should\u2026 \u2022 Governments should strengthen their capacities for a whole of government response to climate change. A coordinated response with clear roles and responsi- bilities for different agencies and a common approach to external financing should be operationalised. \u2022 Wherever possible, existing institutional arrangements and policy frameworks for managing international cooperation, including development assistance, should be built upon. \u2022 Where appropriate, governments should strengthen their capacities to access external climate finance. \u2022 Governnments need to improve overall coordination of the climate change response in country \u2013 including climate finance \u2013 by clarifying roles and responsi- bilities, in particular harmonising agencies at central level and ensuring effective communication, coordi- nation and appropriate financial transfers of climate finance to sectors and subnational levels. \u2022 Governments will need to strengthen their policy, planning and financial management to include policy frameworks and clearly articulated national priorities for the climate change response. \u2022 Financing frameworks will need to be established to include external and domestic sources of public finance as well as resources from the private sec- tor. Where appropriate, external sources should be integrated into national budgets and government\u2019s public financial management systems used to track expenditures. \u2022 Alongside managing publically provided funds, governments will need to establish an enabling environment for private sector investment to support climate resilient low-carbon growth and the transition to a green economy. (iii) International funders working at the country level should\u2026 \u2022 International funders should ensure that the climate programmes they support and finance are based on demand articulated through country-led needs assessment and planning processes and are not supply driven vis-\u00e0-vis the types of funding that are available. \u2022 In supporting country led programming, international funders should consider where existing development 26 Realising Development Effectiveness programmes should incorporate climate change con- cerns and where new programming is required. \u2022 Wherever possible, international funders should ensure that the public sources of external finance that they provide are aligned and make use of national systems for: \u2022 Planning, and monitoring and evaluation processes \u2022 Public financial management, procurement and audit \u2022 Where capacity constraints hinder the use of country systems, support should be provided to strengthening them and plans articulated for alignment with and progressive use of these systems. \u2022 Good practice in the management of development assistance can and should apply to the management of climate change finance \u2013 for example through the implementation of Programme Based Approaches. \u2022 Learning from the management of development assistance, international funders will need to work together to strengthen their co-ordination, as well as supporting government-led efforts at coordination.

In particular, public and private sectors will need to work together to establish policies, incentives and capacities for cli- mate resilient low-carbon growth and the transition to a green economy as well as innovative mechanisms for blending public and private resources. \u2022 Simplify the diversity of external funding sources, to reduce transaction costs. \u2022 Facilitate easier and direct access to external finance by stakeholders in recipient countries. \u2022 International funders should work with partner coun- tries within the framework of the UNFCCC to clarify guidance on how to measure, report and verify cli- mate finance and supported programmes in order to facilitate transparent and effective climate action. 27 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific Annex 1: Matrix of questions Policy Capacity Incentives Constraints Ownership What is the political commitment to having a climate change policy?

Although a range of development activities contribute to reducing vulnerability to many 32 Adopted by the OECD Development Assistance Committee and the Environment Policy Committee at the joint high-level meeting in Paris on 28\u201329 May 2009. climate change impacts, in some cases, develop- ment initiatives may increase vulnerability to climatic changes. For example, coastal zone development plans which fail to take into account sea level rise will put people, industries and basic infrastructure at risk and prove unsustainable in the long term. In addition, climate change considerations may raise the importance of sup- porting such sectors as agriculture, rural development and water resource management. Climate change risks will need to be considered system- atically in development planning at all levels in order to build in adaptation measures. There is an urgent need to work with Ministries of Planning and Finance in partner countries to integrate climate change considerations into National Development Plans including Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRSs), joint assistance strate- gies as well as associated programmes and projects in order to enhance climate resilience. The focus should be on those communities, sectors or geographical zones identified as most vulnerable to climate change. Particular attention should also be paid to policies and projects with long-term consequences. These include, in particular, large-scale infrastructure projects, trans- port networks, major land use planning initiatives, urban development master plans and others, which play a key role in underpinning economic development and poverty reduction. Building in timely climate change adaptation measures will greatly enhance the benefits and sustain- ability of many development initiatives. We recognise the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the political forum to agree international action on climate change. Fully meeting the challenges of climate change will require action at many levels and through many channels. The following commitments are based on those set out in the 2006 OECD Declaration on Integrating Climate Change Annex 5: Policy Statement on Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Development Co-operation32 37 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific Adaptation into Development Co-operation by laying out specific priorities on how we can support our developing country partners in their efforts to reduce their vulner- ability to climate variability and climate change and to identify and prioritise adaptation responses. II. Priorities and commitments Our support to developing countries to address the new challenges of climate change adaptation will be guided by the commitments of the Monterrey Consensus, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action. Country ownership is key. Consequently our assist- ance for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into development co-operation will be aligned to part- ner countries\u2019 long-term visions and their development plans and programmes. The majority of Least Developed Country Parties to the UNFCCC have or are develop- ing National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). These and similar plans and strategies developed by other countries can provide a useful starting point. To the maximum extent possible we will seek to use our partners\u2019 own systems and harmonise our approaches. Our assistance should accordingly be administered by the relevant national authorities in partner countries. It will be accompanied by capacity development support to enable our partners, at various levels, to lead and manage all aspects of climate change adaptation. We will use a variety of aid modalities, considering each country\u2019s situation, and will make the maximum use of programmatic instruments such as programme-based and sector-wide approaches. We will provide our assistance in an efficient and effec- tive manner in line with the principles of Aid Effectiveness and we will mobilise private sector support. We will ensure that climate risks are adequately taken into account in the programmes which our agencies support and we will work to harmonise our approaches towards addressing climate risks at this level. In addressing adaptation issues, we will pay specific attention to those with greater vulnerability across regions and countries: \u2022 between geographical areas: those areas most at risk to the impacts of climate change need special attention; \u2022 between countries: Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States and African states affected by drought, floods and desertification are particularly vulnerable and need special attention; \u2022 within each country: particularly vulnerable commu- nities and groups, including women, children and the elderly, need special attention. Recognising that there will always be uncertainties regarding long-term climatic trends and their impact, we will seek, whenever possible, to identify and imple- ment win-win adaptation-development solutions.

Improved access to clean energy, for example, can support poverty reduction and adaptation to climate change as well as climate change mitigation. We will also enhance synergies with the other Rio Conventions on Biological Diversity and Desertification to identify areas where multiple benefits can be achieved. In addition, we will reinforce the links between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction and man- agement, notably in the context of the implementation the Hyogo Framework for Action. The Policy Guidance on Integrating Climate Change into Development Co-operation which we are endorsing today will provide a key reference for our Development Co- operation and Environment Ministries and Agencies in their co-operation with developing country partners in support of adaptation to climate change. This will include maximising synergies and complementarities with the various mechanisms established under the framework of UNFCCC. The policy guidance will pro- vide an important input to the Fifteenth Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009. We will make special efforts to share experience and monitor progress towards implementation of the policy guidance and the results achieved, including through the OECD\u2019s Peer Review mechanisms. 38 Realising Development Effectiveness Are we being fully honest about the incentives (in opera- tion rather than in vision) for much of the current funding received by countries? Are we constantly challenging all stakeholders to ensure that the mechanisms and targets for financing are not being shaped by fund- ing agencies? Are we having a fully transparent debate on the nature of climate change financing, in order to ensure that it can be fully effective? Such debate needs to include recipients, beneficiaries and funders and be held at the highest level. Are we being honest about the risks to achieving funding and development objectives if the current modalities of assistance continue? Are we making sure that we are reinforcing the relationship of development outcomes to climate change? Are we ensuring that all stakeholders under- stand this inter-dependency, that climate change outcomes are development outcomes? Are we sure that mechanisms for monitoring and reporting are not driving how assistance is pro- vided? Are we constantly checking that monitoring and evaluation supports overall accountability for the achievement of reduced emissions and improved adaptation. Global Architecture Are we constantly reviewing global climate change funding channels and mechanisms in order to reduce the management burden on recipients? Have we done enough so that administrators of all and planned global funds can commit to basic principles for the co-ordination of climate change finance and activities, similar to or as set out in the OECD\u2019s Policy Statement on Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Development Co-operation? Can all climate change funds contribute to budget support and programme-based mechanisms (trust funds etc) in country if required? Has sufficient consideration been given to creating sin- gle channels for funding climate change activities? Are we sure that international climate change archi- tecture is not defining the local institutional mechanisms for managing the response to climate change? What could we do more to exchange knowledge between climate specialists, those responsible in developed governments for managing their countries\u2019 contribution to climate financing and the managers of aid programmes? Regional Are we doing enough to build the capacity of mem- bers of legislatures and Civil Society Organisations in the countries of the region to assess concepts such as adaptive capacity, emission reductions, additionality to participate more effectively in oversight processes? What more can we do to strengthen regional interac- tion around climate change financing, and ensure it is a regular feature of regional dialogue on development? Is the regional voice in the international institutions strong enough? Annex 6: Issues for Further Consideration arising from the Case Studies General Are we sure we are making the full use of the lessons learnt about aid and development over recent decades to inform how climate change finance is provided? 39 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific National Are we clear in all cases that the form of financing, whether in of grants or loans, is consistent with what the government identifies as being appropriate?

Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 6 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background The UN Millennium Summit in 2000 adopted the Millennium Declaration, which reaffirmed and synthesised the goals and targets set by previous global conferences. The adoption of the Millennium Declaration was a defining moment for global cooperation\u2014it brought poverty eradication on to the global map through collective consent of the international community.1 Progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) contributes to improving the lives of the poor and disadvantaged and, more broadly, to human development. The MDGs are particularly significant in Asia and the Pacific due to the region's diversity. In this region, addressing income poverty does not necessarily result in successfully addressing issues of human poverty. Therefore, stakeholders in the region have been collaborating and evolving partnerships to harness the synergies among the different MDGs. A number of initiatives in the region are successfully taking the MDG agenda forward. After the success of the first phase of the regional initiative on Supporting the Achievement of Millennium Development Goals, a follow-up phase was initiated in collaboration with UNESCAP. The first Regional MDG Report, launched in 2003, was a key output of this partnership. It was followed by a second Regional MDG Report in 2005. Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam were the first nine countries to launch their national MDG Reports. Others followed soon after. By the end of 2004, 21 out of 39 countries in Asia and the Pacific completed their MDG Reports. Other regional initiatives supporting the MDG agenda include the Macroeconomics of Poverty Reduction; Regional Trade, Economic Governance and Human Development; and the Asia\u2013 Pacific Regional Initiative on Human Development Reports. In collaboration with UNDGO, RBAP organised three regional workshops on the MDGs in which most UN or UNDP country offices in the region participated. Vientiane, Dhaka and Nandi hosted the workshops in October 2002, February 2003 and March 2003, respectively. The workshops resulted in the preparation of country action plans for achieving the MDGs at the national level. The Regional Initiative on the MDGs in Asia and the Pacific draws extensively from the workshop recommendations. The initiative supports countries in implementing their MDG action plans in the following areas: monitoring and reporting, advocacy and campaigning, policy-making and strategising, and capacity-strengthening in statistics and data collection (in collaboration with UNSIAP). The 2004 MDG regional workshops, which followed the workshops held in 2002\u20132003, were an essential part of the above initiative. UNDGO and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) partnered with UNDP in these workshops and have helped further the work on MDGs in the region. These activities assumed even more relevance and urgency following the UN Secretary-General's presentation of the MDG Progress Report five years after the Millennium Summit, at the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly (called the Millennium +5 Summit) in 2005.

DAY ONE 2.1 Opening Session and Session I: MDGs, an update In the opening session, Ms Deborah Landey (UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, Philippines) welcomed the participants and set the tone for the deliberations. Mr Jan P.M. Van Heeswijk (Director General, ADB) and Mr Arthur Erken (Associate Director, UNDGO) delivered their addresses and highlighted the importance given to the MDGs by their respective organisations. Dr Hafiz A. Pasha (UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Assistant Administrator) made his opening remarks, and the Hon. Jos\u00e9 C. de Venecia, Jr., (Speaker, House of Representatives of the Philippines) highlighted the commitment of the Philippine government to the MDGs. The insights provided by the addresses set the tone for the discussions that followed. The first business session reiterated the objectives and spelt out the scope of the workshop. The workshop's structure was presented: \u2022 National perspectives and the MDGs (session II) \u2022 Millennium +5 Summit (session III) \u2022 MDGs and the Millennium Development Project (special session III, through video link) \u2022 Achieving the MDGs: Policy and programming challenges \u2013 part I and part II (session IV) \u2022 Achieving the MDGs: Monitoring and statistical capacity-building (session V) \u2022 Strategic communication plans and regional support mechanisms (session VI) \u2022 Developing country action plans (session VII) \u2022 Media panel (special session) \u2022 The way forward (session VIII) 2.2 Session II: National perspectives and the MDGs In this session, delegates from China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Viet Nam, Japan and the Republic of Korea shared their national perspectives on the MDGs. The session was conducted in two parts: (a) country presentations and (b) working groups. In order to highlight the common challenges and opportunities faced in achieving the MDGs, three country-cluster groups were created. Group 1 comprised delegates from China, India and Indonesia; Group 2 comprised delegates from Iran, Pakistan and Sri Lanka; Group 3 comprised delegates from Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. 2.2.1 Highlights of country presentations China Chan Chuandong, Deputy Division Director, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, National Plan of Action on National Development In 2003, China's per capita GDP exceeded US$ 1,000. The population living in poverty has been reduced from 250 million in 1978 to 29 million in 2002. The enrolment rate of school-age children stands at 99.3 percent, and the adult illiteracy rate has been brought down to 4 percent. Child and maternal mortality rates are down to 28.4 per 1,000 people and 50.2 per 100,000 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 9 people, respectively. The nation has launched a robust campaign to combat HIV/AIDS. China is the first among developing countries to adopt Agenda 21, and it has also developed a plan of action on sustainable development following the World Summit on Social Development.

The government will also better incorporate the MDGs into its national development strategies and improve its monitoring and reporting capabilities. It will encourage broad public participation and forge partnerships with the business community, the media and CSOs, and it will strengthen international cooperation. We call on industrialised countries to deliver on their commitments to help developing countries on their road to achieving the MDGs. UNCT prepared the first MDG Report on China in close consultation with the government. The report was successfully launched at the International Conference on MDGs, which was attended by over 400 participants from both China and abroad. A memorandum of understanding on establishing the International Centre for Poverty Reduction was signed between the Chinese government and UNDP last May during the Global Conference on Scaling-up Poverty Reduction in Shanghai.

MDGs are crucial, but progress in other sectors, specifically infrastructure, is equally critical. National goals that relate to the MDGs have a much shorter time frame for achievement, ahead of 2015, but there are financing gaps. As per the World Bank's assessment, India should achieve goals relating to income, hunger, poverty and drinking water rates if current trends continue. With improved policies and institutions and additional external resources, India could achieve all MDGs except maternal mortality, sanitation and HIV/AIDS control. India, as a whole, may achieve the MDGs, but there are interregional variations in development within the country. India is on track for further improving its policies and performance. It is already assessed as being in the top 20 percent of developing countries. External assistance does not play a dominant role in public expenditure but has a strong catalytic and supplementary role. The MDGs require public investments over a long period. External assistance depends on a country's capacity to attract private capital and should be allocated based on needs and performance, not artificial capping. All components of the MDG Global Compact should be mobilised. If industrialised countries and international financial institutions provide a helping hand by fulfilling their part of the Compact, India could reach the goals earlier. Industrialised countries should 'walk the talk'. There is no uniform prescription for all countries\u2014balancing growth and equity is important. Sustaining high growth rates and providing direct investments for the poor are essential to achieving the MDGs. Indonesia Karlina Sutaprawira, Assistant to the UN Special Ambassador On 17 May 2004, Indonesia launched its first progress report on the MDGs. The report provides data on the MDGs by province. Indonesia has made progress over the years in achieving many MDGs but is lagging in reducing child malnutrition, reducing maternal mortality and improving maternal health, increasing immunisation coverage, combating diseases such as TB and malaria, and improving access to clean water. MDGs do not belong to governments alone. The goals and processes must be owned by civil society as well and achieved through strong partnerships and alliances. In Indonesia, civil society is taking the lead in sensitising the public, local governments and the parliament. The challenges ahead for Indonesia are huge, but with existing partnerships and alliances, the country can overcome these obstacles and make the most of the opportunities it has.

Women's participation in economic life (Goal 3) and controlling and reversing HIV/AIDS (Goal 6) are challenges that Iran continues to face. Creating a global partnership for development (Goal 8) is a priority for the government. The first draft of the MDG Progress Report was prepared by the Management and Planning Organisation of Iran. Malaysia Datin Shamsiah Dahaban, Director, Social Services Section, Economic Planning Unit Malaysia has a history of successful five-year development plans since the 1960s. The plans have included development goals aimed at advancing economic and social well-being. Many of these national goals foreshadow international development goals, including the MDGs... Malaysia has reached most MDG targets, but challenges remain. These include the following: \u2022 To reach the remaining pockets of hard-core poverty so that the most disadvantaged can benefit from development measures \u2022 To define new indicators to identify and target marginalised groups \u2022 To further reduce spatial and ethnic inequities \u2022 To ensure sustainability of development gains in a competitive global environment Pakistan Pervez Tahir, Chief Economist, Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan Progress has been slow for Pakistan. The government aims to build on existing mechanisms to achieve the MDGs but recognises that additional resources are required. The constraints facing the country are complex. They are both intra- and inter-sectoral in nature and depend on specific contexts. These constraints include challenges brought about by the devolution process: political changes, administrative changes and fiscal reforms; the need to improve monitoring and evaluation systems; and the need for cross-sectoral efforts to achieve education, health, nutrition and population targets. Philippines Erlinda Capones, Director, National Economic and Development Authority The Philippines faces the following challenges in achieving the MDGs: \u2022 Financing the MDGs \u2022 Improving database and statistics \u2022 Firming up strategic action plans of lead agencies \u2022 Sustaining communications and advocacy campaigns \u2022 Localising the MDGs \u2022 Pushing for legislative measures \u2022 Strengthening, monitoring and evaluation However, the following opportunities can support the achievement of the goals: \u2022 Strong support from both the executive and legislative branches \u2022 Strong support from the donor community \u2022 Initiatives at the local level -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 12 \u2022 Participation of the business sector and NGOs \u2022 Data availability \u2022 Functioning structures and mechanisms Sri Lanka Louise Chamberlain, Assistant Resident Representative, UNDP The first MDG Report for Sri Lanka was being drafted at the time of the workshop and was released soon after. In 2003, information workshops and national campaigns were held. Awareness-building campaigns and baseline studies for particular goals were conducted. The country is committed to meeting the MDGs, with civil society participation and local MDG action plans in place. In conflict-affected areas, peace negotiations need to be conducted before social development can be achieved. Adapting the MDGs to Sri Lanka's specific needs is a challenge. The country is particularly concerned about gender and wants to study how it will cut across the other goals. Sri Lanka has made strong progress in achieving the goals of primary school enrolment, gender development, and maternal and child mortality. The key challenges are: not to become complacent with national averages, to seek the reintegration of refugees, to achieve peace and security, and to resume peace negotiations. Thailand Priyanut Piboolsravut, Director, NESDB The first MDG Report for Thailand was released in 2004. Thailand has made remarkable progress in meeting most of the internationally agreed MDGs. The internationally set targets for poverty, hunger, gender, HIV/AIDS and malaria have been achieved more than 15 years ahead of schedule. The education goal is likely to be achieved soon. And progress is being made in reaching the targets of child and maternal health as well as environmental sustainability.

Viet Nam Ho Minh Chien, Director General, Ministry of Planning and Investment Viet Nam's progress towards the MDGs is largely due to the Doi moi reforms process launched in 1986. Poverty has already been reduced by more than half since 1990, well ahead of the MDG schedule. But there are emerging challenges that will need to be met in order to achieve the MDGs by 2015. Viet Nam prepared its third MDG Report, Closing the Millennium Gap, in 2003. This report builds on the first two MDG Reports prepared for Viet Nam, Bringing the MDGs Closer to the People (2002) and International Development Targets: MDGs Progress Report in Viet Nam (2001). The MDGs have also been localised in the form of Viet Nam Development Goals (VDGs), with their inclusion in the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction Growth Strategy (CPRGS) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). If Viet Nam achieves the VDGs by 2010, it will likely achieve the MDGs by 2015. An MDG policy conference was organised in Hanoi in February 2004. Participants included Deputy Prime Minister Vu Khoan; representatives from the National Assembly (NA), Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), Ministry of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA), and Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD); and officials from provinces, NGOs and UN agencies. The conference raised awareness and provided additional policy perspectives and insights for enriching the latest MDG Report. Several workshops were organised at the provincial level to integrate MDGs into the local planning processes. Training on MDGs has been organised for selected officials and professors at the Ho Chi Minh Political Academy. The nascent UN CCA in Viet Nam as well as the new UNDAF are being based firmly on the Millennium Declaration and on the findings of the MDGRs. The key findings and recommendations of MDGR 2003 are being used for Viet Nam's new Five-Year Socio-economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010. A wide range of MDG awareness-raising activities have already taken place across the country, with many more planned for the future.

Participants were divided into three groups. Working Group 1: China, India and Indonesia Table 2.1 China\u2013India\u2013Indonesia Common Highlights Challenges Opportunities 1. Regional disparities 2. Sustainability of social services 3. Vulnerability of people just above the threshold of poverty; a single catastrophic event can send them back into poverty 4. Equity among groups: rural vs. urban, infrastructure vs. social sector 5. Need for resources 6. Gender disparities 7. Delivery mechanism of basic services 8. Convergence, interaction and interplay of MDGs, national development goals and local aspirations 9. Monitoring through regional statistical data collection. Disaggregation of reliable data, gender-sensitive indicators, regional bias within countries 10. Financing 11. Decentralisation 1. Democracy, participatory development models 2. Civil society participation 3. Sustaining economic growth 4. Role of private sector, partnerships with private sector 5. Microcredit 6. External finance In addition, a few issues were raised regarding individual countries: \u2022 Indonesia: The country has high public debt. Sufficient funds are not available for development because a large share of available resources goes towards repaying the debt. Despite most of the domestic budget going towards this repayment, debt rescheduling is often required. The utilisation of external resources, however, has political implications. \u2022 India: The government sees external funding as assisting domestic public spending. The following issues are of particular concern: \u2022 Transparency: Because of decentralisation, budget allocations may be inadequate. \u2022 Public funds for development: Focus on infrastructure or economic growth. \u2022 The social sector would benefit from focusing more on the deprived. \u2022 Trade-off between economic imperatives and social needs is needed. \u2022 Market-based service delivery has limited reach to the poor. \u2022 The social dimension of globalisation needs more attention. \u2022 The impact of trade commitments needs assessment. \u2022 OECD countries should make concrete contributions. \u2022 Growth policies need to be pro-poor. \u2022 Changing demographic structure needs attention. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 16 \u2022 China: Balanced development requires technical assistance, global experience and capacity building. Funding is not a problem. The country supports a policy environment for balanced, equitable development (both social and economic). Working Group 2: Iran, Pakistan and Sri Lanka Table 2.2 Iran\u2013Pakistan\u2013Sri Lanka Common Highlights Challenges Opportunities 1. Human resource capacity to implement MDG initiatives (especially health-related MDGs) 2. Weak governance: limited and inadequate statistics and information; coordination and communication constraints; human rights; security and terrorism 3. Even experts are unaware of MDGs; awareness has to be promoted 4. Unequal income distribution 5. Financial constraints 6. Ambivalent relationship between government organisations and CSOs 1. Country-specific MDGRs can be used for advocacy 2. Seeds exist for corporate social responsibility. They have a strong private sector, well-educated population and vibrant academe. 3.

Further involvement of the private sector In addition, the following issues common to all four countries were raised: \u2022 Decentralisation: It is inevitable and can be both a challenge and an opportunity.

For example, China's ability to depend only partially on foreign investment highlights the importance of promoting growth through internal policies and resources. China addressed the issue of food security, especially in rural areas, where 80 percent of the population still lives. It increased production and promoted economic growth to solve problems that it has faced for the past 25 years. China experienced economic growth but made inadequate social investments. It now recognises that a balance needs to be struck between developing economic sectors and social sectors. \u2022 Evidence of private, domestic investment varies across countries. For example, Viet Nam is not strong on domestic savings due to differences in policies, while Malaysia relies quite extensively on domestic sources of funds, although foreign investments are quite substantial. Capacity and contribution come from foreign direct investments (FDI). A country like India has limited resources for investment in backward areas. \u2022 When political commitment to fulfilling the MDGs is high, the goals get all the attention and other areas under the Millennium Declaration get neglected (i.e., issues such as reproductive health and labour protection). \u2022 Policies that encourage private investments in backward areas are required to promote equitable development across different regions within a country. \u2022 The following strategic issues need to be addressed in the Asia\u2013Pacific region: \u2022 Disparity in the MDGs among Asian countries \u2022 Vulnerability to policy changes \u2022 Sustaining efforts to achieve MDGs \u2022 Cost of the MDGs, and investments required \u2022 Role of expenditure, both public and private \u2022 Environmental sustainability \u2022 Role of CSOs \u2022 Delivery mechanisms \u2022 Human resources \u2022 Building local capacities \u2022 Role of information (availability and use of data) \u2022 Facilitating environment: multilateral trading system; bilateral and free trade areas (FTAs); debt cancellation, not debt relief \u2022 Economic policies of OECD, especially with respect to developing countries \u2022 Role of private sector \u2022 Role of youth and volunteerism -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 18 2.3 Session III: Millennium +5 Summit Turhan Saleh, Director, UNDP, MDG Unit The Millennium +5 Summit, a five-year review of the Millennium Declaration, would take place in September 2005, at the beginning of the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly. Such reviews are necessary because we need at least a decade to achieve the MDGs. If we do not have basic conditions in place by 2005, we will struggle to meet targets by 2015. Though not officially called a summit, it would nevertheless be a meeting at the level of heads of state. Its objective would be to examine how countries accomplish the MDGs rather than to set new goals or to revise existing goals. The focus would be on implementation\u2014on adopting concrete measures\u2014not on making rhetorical statements. The summit would be a turning point for the Country Teams, other UN development agencies, governments and CSOs as they mobilise to make changes in the way they achieve the MDGs. The Millennium +5 Summit would be a top priority in 2005, particularly for UN agencies. Many changes would take place, directly affecting work at country level and having significant global impact. The following two issues would be assessed: (1) evidence of policy impact and (2) evidence of political mobilisation. Both issues bring forward some relevant questions: \u2022 Evidence of policy impact: Are the MDGs being integrated into national development plans, PRSs, budgets and medium-term expenditure frameworks? Are these global commitments resonating at country level? Are they leading to substantial changes? \u2022 Evidence of political mobilisation: Are countries prioritising the MDGs? Will the MDGs remain a top priority in the long term, regardless of who holds power in a country? Can countries sustain the achievement of the MDGs over a 10-year period?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11ddfa13-ed05-4c20-a654-ed129279e81b": {"__data__": {"id_": "11ddfa13-ed05-4c20-a654-ed129279e81b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-august-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, August 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-august-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8766496799e19f484266d3e159ce4d36c854fb0dd7cd3d854410bc1a439f9ceb"}, "2": {"node_id": "167762f0-f024-49ed-8599-83966db40a57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-august-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa7420a63fc7eb9230fb7754a6fdd45703524a1f01130b7ff6607d681f8c2ce6"}}, "hash": "52ef1c1d7089eccbb1b9dbc3fe9c43dc99ebfbbc7c247dc81663a795eb9faf41", "text": "Can countries sustain the achievement of the MDGs over a 10-year period?

Prof Sachs recognised the need for setting up a task force to implement the overall strategy of poverty reduction. MDGs are achievable in the next decade, between 2005 and 2015. While the poorest countries are off track, most are on track in achieving one or several of the goals. He mentioned two factors that are necessary in achieving the MDGs. The first factor is increased dedication and support from governments and international institutions to transform the MDGs from general and vague aspirations into operational and achievable targets. Second, perceptions need to be changed in order to replace a 'business as usual' attitude with serious planning focused on the MDGs. For country-level situation analyses, Prof Sachs highlighted important issues related to government priorities, geography, cultural specificities, social context and the health sector. Does the country have irrigation and electricity problems? Does it have adequate roads? Is it vulnerable to natural disasters? UN project staff can work with governments to identify problems and solutions and assess the extent to which local priorities are also global priorities. He asked governments to develop strategies for the remaining 10 years of the Millennium Declaration, keeping in view two points: (1) Focusing on economic growth is insufficient\u2014the quality, composition and nature of growth influences the achievement of the MDGs; and (2) targeted public investments and infrastructure-building are important. The private sector can set the stage for economic growth, but it is not wise to reduce the size of the public sector in health, education, power, roads, water and sanitation, and environment and biodiversity conservation. Borrowing, project financing and increasing tax revenues are easily achievable ways for richer countries to raise resources for the MDGs. Poorer countries need a programme indicating how much domestic resources and how much donor assistance is necessary to finance MDG-driven projects. At present, 0.7 percent of the GNP of donor countries has been committed as ODA funds in accordance with Agenda 21 Summits in Mexico and South Africa. Only 10 donor countries have fulfilled their promise, with very strong commitments from the UK, Canada and Ireland. USA is US$ 60 billion short on its promise. At the 2005 World Summit in New York, rich countries were asked to double their commitments, which means an increase from US$ 60 billion to US$ 120 billion annually. Prof Sachs said he and his staff are willing to review ideas from countries, give comments on projects and provide technical assistance. But a high level of commitment from governments is the most important factor in achieving the MDGs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 20 3. DAY TWO Building on the insights of the first day of the workshop, delegates brainstormed issues related to policy and programming challenges posed by the MDGs. They discussed the need to build statistical capacity to monitor progress, the need for a strategic communication plan and the role of the media. 3.1 Session IV: Achieving the MDGs: policy and programming challenges The session began with a panel discussion, chaired by Dr Zahidul Huque (Resident Representative, UNFPA, Philippines). Panelists included Omar Noman, Adrian Panggabean, Aynul Hasan and Leonor Briones. Delegates from Iran and the Philippines presented their country experiences. Omar Noman (Senior Adviser, UNDP, RBAP) said that Japan's revival because of China is the most significant economic development in recent times.

The results showed that the Asia\u2013 Pacific region is far better off compared with Africa, where about two-thirds of the MDG problem exists. However, sub-regional variations exist. Three issues need to be considered: \u2022 Striking a balance between ambition and realism in achieving the MDGs. Mobilising funds is important\u2014the donor community needs to complement internal resources. \u2022 Striking a balance between long-term and short-term objectives and \u2022 Domestic capacities. To move forward, the following steps are required: \u2022 Putting sufficient emphasis on the MDGs \u2022 Translating medium-term goals into year-by-year goals \u2022 Reviewing government expenditure and revenues to adjust policies and decide where to place resources to meet the goals \u2022 Adopting unconventional approaches as needed, recognising the complexity of problems on the ground -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 21 Aynul Hasan (Chief, LDCCU, MDG Centre, UNESCAP) noted that poverty in the region is being successfully reduced. Already 150 million people are out of poverty, compared with 1990 levels. Yet, child mortality, universal primary education, gender equality and maternal mortality ratios have seen little progress. The results are uneven\u2014some countries are on track in meeting their goals, while others are far behind. In addition, external shocks such as the Asian Crisis have made progress even more fragile. Policies that boost economic growth and avoid increases in income inequality are needed. Growth should also be sustainable\u2014modest but sustained growth is preferable. However, growth and aid, although necessary, are not sufficient to achieve the MDGs. The environment needs to be considered, too. An increase in oil prices, for example, has major implications. Paradoxes such as declining poverty and continuing hunger also exist. Countries in the region need to focus on the demand and the supply sides of the food issue. Innovative, non-formal institutions could help by taking steps such as promoting rural mobile telephones, small enterprises and self-employment. Leonor Briones (Director, Centre for Policy and Executive Development, NCPAG, Philippines) said that CSOs should be partners, participants and stakeholders in the planning and implementation process. In reality, the roles of CSOs vary across countries due to differing social, economic and political situations, which have direct and indirect bearing on these organisations. There is a direct relationship between the degree of CSO participation and the degree of success in achieving the MDGs. Ideally, CSOs should be part of national planning regardless of unfavourable economic and political conditions. In the Philippines, CSOs have been actively participating in planning since the 1990s. Now they are involved in local government units. Arthur Erken (Associate Director, UNDGO) said that the UN system should coordinate its country assessments and create an integrated development-assistance framework. CCA and UNDAF can be used as tools. CCA combines the analysis of UN agencies and national authorities on the national development situation. Since it already identifies key development issues, an assessment of MDG progress in the country can be easily included as well. UNDAF is the UN's business plan. It presents a common strategic framework for UN operational activities. UNDAF provides an integrated response to national priorities, needs, modalities and the UN system's support content. UNDGO revised CCA and UNDAF guidelines in 2003 to better reflect the UN's collective contribution to achieving national priorities. The UNDAF Results Matrix, which is at the heart of UNDAF, was developed using the logical framework approach to identify this contribution. The matrix pinpoints areas for joint programming and holds the UN accountable for delivering concrete results in relation to national priorities and the MDGs.

The poverty rate (based on the proportion of the population below US$ 1 per day) fell from 1.4 percent in 1995 to 0.1 percent in 2001. Substantial progress and achievement have been recorded in universal education, health care, access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Net enrolment in primary education reached 97 percent in 2002, up from 85 percent in 1990. Yet, challenges remain with regard to the environment, efficient uses of energy resources, HIV/AIDS, rural-urban migration and urbanisation, high unemployment (among youth), and technical and human resource capacity. The emphasis is on evolving a participatory and consultative process, which is being done through the following mechanisms: \u2022 MDG theme groups and working groups \u2022 Regular consultations by the UNCT, within the team as well as with the government \u2022 Advocacy, networking and national MDG workshops and forums \u2022 Partnering with NGOs, CSOs and other development partners, including academic institutions Iran completed and launched its first MDG report in September 2004. It emphasises the role of national leadership and the ownership and participation of all stakeholders. Drafting the report, however, was difficult because of the lack of adequate data, limited national technical capacity and limited financial resources. Zahidul Huque (Resident Representative, UNFPA, Philippines) said that the UN Country Team in the Philippines was focusing its operational activities on the MDGs. CCA, a highly consultative process, was conducted through a multisectoral analysis of the challenges faced in achieving the MDGs. Thematic groups were created around the MDGs to ensure in-depth analyses of issues. An analytical framework was developed to make sure that the analyses are gender- and rights-based and that constraints to achieving the MDGs are discussed. The Philippines UNDAF was developed by linking the MDGs with the Philippine medium-term development plan and the areas of development cooperation identified in CCA. The result was a consensus around five UNDAF outcomes based on five areas of cooperation: macroeconomic stability and equitable development, basic social services, good governance, environmental sustainability, and peace and security. Drawing from the UNDAF, each UN agency developed Country Programme Documents (CPDs). UNFPA CPD, for example, has the following priority programmes linked to the MDGs: \u2022 Reducing fertility \u2022 Improving maternal health \u2022 Promoting adolescent reproductive health \u2022 Prevention and care for HIV/AIDS The UN family in the Philippines delivers the following messages in one voice: \u2022 The Philippines is broadly on track in achieving the goals at the national level. It will have to sustain its successful programmes while redoubling efforts to reach unmet goals, such as hunger and maternal mortality targets. \u2022 Additional resources are needed to fund the MDGs; special services should be given priority in national budgeting. \u2022 The Philippines needs to address regional disparity within the country in achieving the goals. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 23 \u2022 The high population rate is diluting economic gains. \u2022 Situations of conflict make it difficult to achieve the MDGs. \u2022 The country needs to improve data collection and progress-monitoring for the MDGs. The Philippines has learned the following lessons and best practices: \u2022 Speaking in one UN voice has great impact. \u2022 Private sector and CSO ownership of the goals is important in MDG advocacy. \u2022 Media support for the MDGs needs to be enhanced. \u2022 This is a crucial time for MDG advocacy since there is a new administration at the national level and at local levels. \u2022 The strategy to localise MDGs needs to be institutionalised. The floor discussions led to the following recommendations: \u2022 Analysis should be within the broader perspective of the Millennium Declaration rather than only within the framework of the MDGs. If the focus is limited to the eight goals, the activities of UN agencies such as ILO, UNICEF and UNESCO may be left out. \u2022 CCA and UNDAF should not be limited to the MDGs. The UNDAF is a combination of the MDGs and commitments made at other summits and conferences. \u2022 The CCA working group should examine relevant operational questions. \u2022 Issues of governance and management of conflicts and disasters need to be considered. \u2022 UNDGO should develop a rights-based checklist. \u2022 Aid should be increased.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fc0f778-1ade-4ce7-b303-a16c5da559cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fc0f778-1ade-4ce7-b303-a16c5da559cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-august-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, August 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-august-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df16266e7f6293eed804c3720bd54642b396cd5d2443778725b025fc14ff85f8"}, "2": {"node_id": "64f726e0-41c5-4692-8c93-72a83e007793", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-august-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb3a59535372fa0d14e80e0823eeee3f8f4b4576328ecff7a2bd58ecf34f3a7e"}}, "hash": "c403b17dd75956bee0035cf26bc8ef7d1719d9dee589c3a89de81afbe52cb98e", "text": "\u2022 UNDGO should develop a rights-based checklist. \u2022 Aid should be increased. \u2022 The MDGs provide a framework for the use of aid. \u2022 Cost estimation for the achievement of the MDGs should be done at the national level. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 24 3.2 Session V: Achieving the MDGs: monitoring and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30f7c33e-ece8-4026-bd23-9562ddf3e6f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "30f7c33e-ece8-4026-bd23-9562ddf3e6f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-august-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, August 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-august-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8a487f8d4779aefca7ba44158d511af14ccec85b484b25d5861ab87afb0595d"}, "3": {"node_id": "7dd95170-86bd-4493-b6b0-bba8181dcdf6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-august-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18cfc67b49e8b0ef3637f7ce4a22739ca295fb93bb39a2f6d82fcfa089c20e3e"}}, "hash": "0bc3ae18d2502c23e22cf963880d769db08fd3926ed1ea51f48359ad47beb99a", "text": "data In this session, delegates shared experiences concerning the need for relevant, reliable and timely statistics to monitor progress and evaluate results. Despite considerable improvements in recent years, meeting the demand for data remains a major challenge. Three presentations were made, followed by floor discussions. Nicolas Pron (Senior Project Officer, DevInfo) said that DevInfo is a useful system for MDG monitoring. DevInfo is a single and central repository of data from various sources, making information retrieval easy. It analyses trends, highlights gaps and discrepancies, and has user- friendly features that facilitate presentations such as map- and table-creation and zooming into geographical areas. The possibility of standardising the use of DevInfo in MDG reporting is being explored in India, Tanzania and Cambodia. In the new version of DevInfo, users can define their own regional and sub-regional groupings. Lyn MacDonald (Statistics Adviser, UNDP BDP) said that UNDP, recognising constraints in data availability, accessibility and the need to improve statistical analysis, has embarked on a project to support statistical literacy training. Target users are government officials, local government planners and policy-makers, NGOs, NSOs, donors, CSOs and the media. The objectives of the project are to teach users basic statistical analysis, increase the use of data for policy design and implementation, formulate a set of priorities, stimulate public monitoring of policy and improve social communication. Tomas Africa (Director, UNSIAP) said that gaps in data availability for MDG monitoring were being identified. For the short term, countries have to use available data, recognising the gaps. They have to make do with data such as small sample estimations and area-specific epidemiological surveys. Labour-force surveys, purchasing power parity (PPP) estimates and gender monitoring need to be improved in the short to medium term. Civil registration systems need to be improved in the medium to long term. Institutional issues such as the limited participation of NSOs and the need to enhance partnerships for system development and human- resources capacity development for MDG monitoring also arise. Floor discussions led to the following suggestions: \u2022 Alternative methods such as rapid assessments and epidemiological surveys can be used for situations where data on malaria and TB are difficult to obtain. \u2022 Proxy indicators can be used, for example, in the case of disease incidence. \u2022 Stakeholders should agree on the common norms of data use and collaborate at country level to get more reliable and comparable data. \u2022 All major stakeholders, such as the World Bank, should agree on data and indicators. \u2022 Statistical data should be linked to planning and programming. \u2022 Investment in data, indicators and methodologies for global and national-level initiatives, should be promoted. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 25 3.3 Session VI: Strategic communication plans and regional mechanisms In this session, delegates discussed communication issues in promoting the MDGs. Four presentations were made (by Erna Witoelar, Turhan Saleh, B. Murali and Juan B. Santos) before opening the floor to discussion. Erna Witoelar (UN Special Ambassador on MDGs) said that countries need participatory processes to build multisectoral consensus on MDG reporting. They need to present both positive and negative results and ensure national ownership in MDG progress. The MDGs are not just an obligation to the UN system, they are also a commitment to meeting people's needs. Thus, national ownership is important. The following challenges are involved in promoting the MDGs: \u2022 Creating awareness of the whole 'MDG package' \u2022 Keeping the media interested \u2022 Sustaining high growth but avoiding increases in inequality \u2022 Harmonising donor assistance to avoid duplication of efforts and to create synergy \u2022 Integrating MDGs into national and local poverty-reduction efforts to ensure more proactive and pro-poor policies Throughout the Millennium Campaign, developing countries will implement more pro-poor policies and the private sector will be more involved in achieving the MDGs.

The private sector in the Philippines consulted business groups on their contribution to health care, the environment, poverty alleviation and education. An advisory committee was also organised to manage the process. The MDG campaign was then launched to attract the business community. The floor discussions led to the following recommendations: \u2022 Start a policy dialogue involving multiple stakeholders. \u2022 Create awareness through a two-pronged approach: \u2022 Campaign on the MDGs in academic circles, NGOs and universities; spread specific messages. \u2022 Engage in a more detailed nationwide campaign on a few selected MDGs. \u2022 Encourage volunteerism and partnerships between businesses and the government. \u2022 Identify core partners, for MDGs as a whole and for individual goals. \u2022 Identify strategies to raise public awareness and enthusiasm; identify a 'hook', using social marketing techniques, to engage the public over time. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 27 3.4 Session VII: Developing country-action plans In this session, delegates formed individual country action plans. Participants were divided into country teams. Each team discussed themes and prepared a draft action plan for 'The Way Forward' presentation in session VIII. 3.5 Special Session: Media panel on the MDGs In this session, delegates discussed how the power of the media can be used to achieve the MDGs. Collaboration between the media and the development family is critical. Sylvia Inciong (National Information Officer, UN Information Centre, Philippines) introduced the subject and initiated the discussion. The media, like civil society and other stakeholders in development, should be active participants in the campaign to promote the MDGs. B. Murali (Programme Specialist, UNDP, RBAP) highlighted the importance of engaging the media on the MDGs. Governments need to play a leading role as well and encourage civil society to come on board. The process has to be interactive. He asked the media to be frank and guide governments in carrying the MDGs forward. Deborah Landey (UN Resident Coordinator, Philippines) gave an overview of the history of the MDGs and the UN Secretary-General's strategies to support countries achieve the goals. Zahidul Huque (UNFPA Resident Representative, Philippines) reported on MDG progress in the Philippines. The country is broadly on track in achieving the goals but will have to address hunger and maternal-mortality targets. The country faces some challenges in achieving the goals: lack of resources; prioritising social services given the available resources; high population growth rate diluting economic gains; conflict in some areas; and enhancing the monitoring system. Florangel Braid (Columnist, Manila Bulletin and Dean, Asian Institute of Journalism and Management) emphasised the need for the media to be included in the MDG consultation process.",

Inadequate preparation of media persons in dealing with processes compared with investigative reporting and the reporting of important national and global development issues Amado Jake Macasaet (President, Philippine Press Institute and Publisher and Chairman, Malaya) identified the fundamental structural problems faced by the media in the Philippines: \u2022 The print and broadcast media are owned by the elite. \u2022 The industry is designed to protect the interests of a few. \u2022 The media are businesses. \u2022 The media believe in giving consumers what they want instead of what they need. \u2022 The media are scandal oriented. Few people in the media understand the importance of economic reporting. For example, many do not appreciate the impact of consolidated budget deficits; thus they are not able to report it to the general public. The media should try to focus on development issues, but this is difficult because of the constant drive to increase distribution, readership and, ultimately, profits. The media fail to educate people, as do politicians. Leonor Briones (Co-convenor, Social Watch) described the experiences of Social Watch in working with the media. If the issue is good, the media will give their full support. The following media-related suggestions were made for the MDG advocacy campaign: \u2022 Show that MDG issues are felt by people in their everyday lives. \u2022 Show the importance of the MDGs for our collective survival. \u2022 Link the MDGs to the needs of the people in regions, provinces and barangays. Teresita Giron (Dean of the Northern Quezon Cooperative College) pointed out the following: \u2022 The media should be provided with a complete set of MDG-related documents. \u2022 Community media should be tapped, since big media are not as interactive. \u2022 Alternative media\u2014such as digitised learning modules for out-of-school youth in rural areas\u2014should be explored. \u2022 Media literacy should be promoted to encourage the general public to become social advocates. The floor discussion led to the following suggestions: \u2022 Media practitioners should be made more aware of the MDGs. \u2022 The MDGs could be divided into thematic clusters, since selling all eight goals at once is difficult. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 29 \u2022 The MDGs can be promoted through the development of a communication network (explaining, localising and popularising). \u2022 Government-run media can set up information centres around the country to help disseminate information on the MDGs. \u2022 The National Anti-Poverty Commission should also be active in promoting the MDGs. \u2022 Partnering with the private media is recommended. \u2022 Interesting storylines are needed. \u2022 A rights-based approach (RBA) can be used by the media to come up with appropriate stories and reports. \u2022 Media personnel should be given an MDG orientation. \u2022 Tapping existing networks is important. \u2022 The MDGs should be related to existing priorities and issues in each country. \u2022 An integrated media plan for promoting the MDGs should be developed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 30 4.

The delegate said that even though the economy is booming, China needs to focus on its people and their needs. The country aims to integrate the MDGs into its five-year plan, but it needs international experience, cooperation, collaboration and partnerships. 4.1.2 India Ajay Seth, Director, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance The current status of India can be summarised as follows: \u2022 India follows a five-year planning cycle. \u2022 India's national goals subsume the MDGs. \u2022 The national goals and the MDGs are in perfect harmony with each other. \u2022 Prioritisation of goals is according to needs and available resources. \u2022 India aims to achieve all national goals related to the Millennium Declaration ahead of 2015. \u2022 Overall programmes, strategy papers and action plans are in place. \u2022 Programmes are being implemented. \u2022 Some sectors receive supplementary financing from external development partners. India's national plan puts the MDGs at the centre of three important sectors: the economic sector, the social sector and infrastructure. The following table shows sector positions: Sector Strategy Paper Action Plan Programme Education Yes Yes Yes Health Yes Yes Within 6 months Poverty alleviation Yes Yes Coverage to be increased Water supply Yes Yes Coverage to be increased Rural roads Yes Yes Coverage to be increased HIV/AIDS Yes Yes Yes The following are the details of the \"Education for All\" programme: \u2022 Three-year programme \u2022 Domestic resources US$ 2.5 Billion \u2022 External resources (ODA) US$ 1 Billion \u2022 Common financing, implementation, reporting and monitoring arrangements \u2022 Fast Track Initiative sees it as a model for replication in other countries. However, financing issues exist: \u2022 There are financing gaps for MDG programmes and action plans. \u2022 The roll-out has been slower because of these gaps. \u2022 Incremental domestic public resources are being provided. \u2022 Additional external assistance is needed to supplement domestic resources. \u2022 India needs to find ways of raising and channelling additional ODA. The following MDG financing options are available: \u2022 Raising additional ODA -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 32 \u2022 Receiving direct contributions \u2022 Borrowing from international finance facilities \u2022 Using existing institutions \u2022 Using new entities \u2022 Using multiple agencies Note: ODA allocation is based on 'need' and 'performance' alone. Private capital has a limited role in financing MDGs. The UN system gives support as well: \u2022 It provides strong advocacy for the following: \u2022 Additional ODA \u2022 Early consensus on raising, channelling and allocating ODA \u2022 Fair multilateral trade regime \u2022 Pro-global growth policies of industrialised countries \u2022 It does sector-specific analytical work (in the Indian context) on the following issues: \u2022 Gender \u2022 Poverty in backward areas \u2022 Knowledge management \u2022 Capacity-building for the media India's budget of US$ 3.5 B covers four years.

As part of this close cooperation, the UN Resident Coordinator's Office in Iran has included MDG-related activities in its annual work plan in order to coordinate MDG advocacy and implementation among different stakeholders, such as the government, UN agencies, civil society, academia, the media and other groups. Since 2003, based on the outcomes of the MDG regional workshops (in Dhaka and Manila), strategic action plans have been developed. These have been incorporated into the annual work plan of the RC Unit and guide the work of the UN system in Iran, supporting the government in MDG advocacy and implementation. Though small in scale, the plans are designed to sensitise different target groups to the MDGs. The Iran team developed an action plan during the MDG Regional Workshop in Manila. The draft was further discussed and confirmed during a consultative meeting with UN representatives, civil society and the government. The plan, shown below, has two components: (a) stocktaking of the 2003\u20132004 country action plan; and (b) new strategic action plan for 2004\u20132005. What Who When Support Required Follow-up activities to the launch of the MDG campaign in Iran. Activities could include nominating MDG ambassadors, briefing parliamentarians, essay and drawing competitions in schools, poster exhibitions, televised debates on the MDGs, production of promotional items such as posters, brochures, films.

Therefore, UNDP Korea has shifted its programme focus to MDG 8: global partnership for development. The Korean government is trying to increase its ODA level to 0.1 percent of GNP by 2007. In 2002, ODA was 0.06 percent of GNP (US$ 334 M). To achieve this target, the national campaign on MDG 8 will be undertaken in cooperation with NGOs and the private sector, in order to mobilise as many national partners as possible. A new Country Programme for ROK was developed in cooperation with the Korean government. The CP focuses mainly on sharing Korea's development experiences, advanced know-how and technology with developing countries. UNDP Korea also developed a package of projects for MDG 8 the following year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Manila, 23\u201325 August 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 42 4.2 Highlights of open discussions, and closing statements Floor discussions covered the following points: \u2022 Gender: Around 1.2 billion people, 70 percent of whom are women, live in extreme poverty worldwide. The MDGs should focus on this reality. These people are more important than strategies, procedures and mechanisms. The 2015 country reports claim success, but poverty among women persists. Therefore, each MDG\u2014not just Goal 3\u2014should be tracked through a gender lens, and indicators should be suitably segregated. In future discussions, gender should be given more space, and specific gender-related MDG issues, concerns, challenges and opportunities should be addressed. \u2022 Political will: The role of political will in furthering the MDGs should not be underestimated. MDG discussions should cut across party lines. Sri Lanka, for example, discarded its PRSP because of a change in government, and the IMF and Word Bank had to formulate another one with the new government. \u2022 Synergy among stakeholders: Strong linkages should be built to leverage the synergies between different stakeholders such as politicians, NGOs, CSOs, academia and the private sector. This leads to efficiencies in capacity building. \u2022 Media: Working with the media is difficult, given their predilection for big headlines and entertainment. However, dramatic contrasts in development stories and regional comparisons can work well with them. Media networks should be initiated and strengthened. \u2022 Monitoring and capacity building: Both quantitative and qualitative indicators are necessary. While numeric data are important, excessive reliance on numbers can be detrimental. Malaysia's case is instructive because of the quality dimension. In Thailand's case, the country has made a remarkable transition from recipient to donor\u2014a good showcase in the region and in the world. MDG monitoring can make new demands on official statistical systems. Therefore, capacity-building is important in this area. Turhan Saleh summarised the discussions and combined them with his observations: \u2022 The strategic focus on and the level of ownership of the MDGs show that countries have come a long way. \u2022 Countries are more confident and specific about what they are planning to do. \u2022 Integration was a recurring theme. \u2022 Regional disparities were identified. \u2022 Gender concerns were highlighted. \u2022 Delegates emphasised the need for databases and official statistical systems that can do more rigorous analysis. \u2022 Advocacy and media outreach were recognised as critical support mechanisms for the MDGs; campaigning, like monitoring, also requires needs assessment and a high level of rigour. \u2022 We need to create a sense of urgency among political leaders as we approach 2015. \u2022 Delegates discussed the importance of the business sector and its role in the MDG process. \u2022 Country teams focused on the Millennium Declaration and used specific development goals as a framework. \u2022 Experience-sharing and networking were identified as important tools. \u2022 Delegates suggested targeting external assistance based on MDG assessments.

The adoption of the Millennium Declaration was a defining moment for global cooperation\u2014it brought poverty eradication on to the global map through collective consent of international community.3 The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) embody the multidimensionality of human development and are aimed at improving the lives of the poor and the disadvantaged. The MDGs are particularly significant in Asia and the Pacific due to the region's diversity. In this region, addressing income poverty does not necessarily result in successfully addressing issues of human poverty. Context Given the crosscutting nature of the MDGs, collaborative projects and partnerships have evolved to harness the synergy of convergence. Several initiatives in the region push the MDG agenda forward. These initiatives assumed greater urgency at the time of the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly (designated as the Millennium +5 Summit), in which the UN Secretary- General presented the MDG Progress Report. After the success of the first phase of the regional initiative on Supporting the Achievement of Millennium Development Goals, a follow-up phase was initiated in collaboration with UNESCAP. The Regional MDG Report launched in 2003 was a key output of this partnership and was followed by a second Regional MDG Report in 2005. Nine countries in the region launched MDG Reports in 2003, and the rest followed soon after. By the end of 2004, 21 countries completed their MDG Reports. Other regional initiatives supporting the MDG agenda include the Macroeconomics of Poverty Reduction; Regional Trade, Economic Governance and Human Development; and the Asia\u2013 Pacific Regional Initiative on Human Development Reports. In collaboration with UNDGO, RBAP organised three regional workshops on MDGs in which most UN or UNDP country offices in the region participated. Vientiane, Dhaka and Nandi hosted the workshops in October 2002, February 2003 and March 2003, respectively. The workshops resulted in the preparation of country action plans for achieving the MDGs at the national level. The Regional Initiative on MDGs in Asia and the Pacific draws extensively from the workshop recommendations. The initiative supported countries in implementing their MDG action plans in the following areas: monitoring and reporting, advocacy and campaigning, policy-making and strategising, and capacity strengthening in statistics and data collection (in collaboration with UNSIAP).

In this region, addressing income poverty does not necessarily result in successfully addressing issues of human poverty. After the success of the first phase of the regional initiative on Supporting the Achievement of Millennium Development Goals, a follow-up phase was initiated in collaboration with UNESCAP and a second Regional MDG Report was published in 2005. In collaboration with UNDGO, RBAP organised three regional workshops on the MDGs in Lao PDR, Bangladesh and Fiji in 2002 and 2003. Most UNDP country offices in the region were represented at these workshops, which resulted in national actions plans for achieving the MDGs and the establishment of APRI, among other outcomes. These workshops, along with the Manila workshop in August 2004, are key activities under APRI's new mandate. Participants in this workshop, held in Siem Reap, Cambodia, shared information on MDG progress in their countries and created national action plans for achieving the goals. The workshop witnessed a high level of government and stakeholder participation, indicating immense interest in and commitment towards the MDGs. The rich deliberations, discussions and presentations throughout the three days will serve as an important basis and mandate for UNDP-APRI in its future activities. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 6 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background The UN Millennium Summit in 2000 adopted the Millennium Declaration, which reaffirmed and synthesised the goals and targets set by previous global conferences. The adoption of the Millennium Declaration was a defining moment for global cooperation\u2014it brought poverty eradication on to the global map through collective consent of the international community.1 Progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)2 contributes to improving the lives of the poor and disadvantaged and, more broadly, to human development. The MDGs are particularly significant in Asia and the Pacific due to the region's diversity. In this region, addressing income poverty does not necessarily result in successfully addressing issues of human poverty. Therefore, stakeholders in the region have been collaborating and evolving partnerships to harness the synergies among the different MDGs. A number of initiatives in the region are successfully taking the MDG agenda forward. After the success of the first phase of the regional initiative on Supporting the Achievement of Millennium Development Goals, a follow-up phase was initiated in collaboration with UNESCAP. The first Regional MDG Report, launched in 2003, was a key output of this partnership. It was followed by a second Regional MDG Report in 2005. Eleven countries in the region (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Vietnam) have launched National MDG Reports. Others are in the process of preparation. Other regional initiatives supporting the MDG agenda include the Macroeconomics of Poverty Reduction; Regional Trade, Economic Governance and Human Development; and the Asia-Pacific Regional Initiative on Human Development Reports. In collaboration with UNDGO, RBAP organised three regional workshops on the MDGs in which most UN or UNDP country offices in the region participated. Vientiane, Dhaka and Nandi hosted the workshops in October 2002, February 2003 and March 2003, respectively. The workshops resulted in the preparation of country action plans for achieving the MDGs at the national level. The Regional Initiative on the MDGs in Asia and the Pacific draws extensively from the workshop recommendations. The initiative supports countries in implementing their MDG action plans in the following areas: monitoring and reporting, advocacy and campaigning, policy- making and strategising, and capacity-strengthening in statistics and data collection (in collaboration with UNSIAP). The 2004 MDG regional workshops, which followed the workshops held in 2002\u20132003, were an essential part of the above initiative. UNDGO and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) partnered with UNDP in these workshops and have helped further the work on MDGs in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c042c8f-f640-4a66-93c7-92a0967b436f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c042c8f-f640-4a66-93c7-92a0967b436f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, October 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29fd13d7ebc5f5462b28cc4d60ff8e6c2381dd6cbffd22d6dd1b5b3779adc259"}, "2": {"node_id": "86e3bf27-61a6-42de-915d-69d1b0618876", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a818aaab2a9a3aee574123448eb329d084c32d99c0bdd8fa780a4d8cf1fe9ff"}}, "hash": "ef6f242bbe790ef34fdd6811a5ad8dae2289088be3bb5fc4d9f41c1f8d3b8a5e", "text": "These activities assumed even more relevance and urgency following the UN Secretary-General's presentation of the MDG Progress Report five years after the Millennium Summit, at the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly (called the Millennium +5 Summit) in 2005.

DAY ONE 2.1 Opening Session and Session I: MDGs, an update Mr Douglas Gardner (UN Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, Cambodia) welcomed the participants to this important regional workshop, organised 12 months before the Millennium +5 Summit and following-up on the workshops held in Lao PDR and Bangladesh. He announced that Cambodia had localised the MDGs and launched the Cambodian MDG Report in 2003. The report had nine goals, with de-mining added to the eight common MDGs. Mr Gardner added that 17 technical working groups had set up sectoral action plans to achieve the MDGs. He encouraged participants to share their experiences and knowledge of the poverty reduction process. Mr B. Murali (Programme Specialist, UNDP, RBAP) highlighted the events and successes of previous MDG workshops in his introductory address. Siem Reap, he said, was an excellent opportunity for LDCs and LLDCs to discuss the status of their country reports, which will be used to monitor and assess MDG progress. Mr Murali conveyed apologies sent by the ADB representative, who could not be present, and Ms Sally Fegan-Wyles, Director, UNDGO, who was attending to urgent matters related to the Darfur crisis in Sudan. She sent a message to participants, reaffirming the Millennium Declaration and emphasising that 2005 was a make-or-break year for the MDGs. UN agencies and governments would have to ensure strategic structural support for the MDGs. UNDGO's core strategy contains four interlinked elements: monitoring and tracking of progress; analysis of MDG-related policies; campaigning, partnership building and community mobilisation; and goal-driven operational assistance. Ms Fegan-Wyles highlighted global progress made thus far. Around 80 National MDG Reports have been issued, following UNDG guidelines, and more are under preparation. Each developing country plans to produce at least one report by 2004. Donor countries are also encouraged to prepare reports analysing their contribution to Goal 8. Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden have already done so, and more will follow. Also, DevInfo, the UN's MDG-tracking software, is being widely used now. Many reforms have been introduced to reduce transaction costs for governments and to improve UN coordination, effectiveness and efficiency in supporting national goals.

The session was conducted in two parts: (a) country presentations and (b) working groups. Three country-cluster groups were created in order to highlight common challenges and opportunities in achieving the MDGs. Group 1 comprised delegates from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan; group 2 comprised delegates from Cambodia, Lao PDR, Maldives and Mongolia; and group 3 comprised delegates from Myanmar, Nepal and Timor-Leste. 2.2.1 Highlights of country presentations Afghanistan Mr Esmatullah Ramzi, Vice President, Central Statistics Office Afghanistan was not present at the Millennium Summit and was thus not among the signatory states. The country fully endorsed the Millennium Declaration in a letter from President Karzai to the UN Secretary-General on 23 March 2004. Afghanistan has taken the following steps towards fulfilling the Millennium Declaration: \u2022 A Loya Jirga ratified the new constitution in January 2004. \u2022 Presidential and parliamentary elections have taken place. \u2022 Afghanistan acceded to CEDAW; the Convention on Biological Diversity; the Framework Convention on Climate Change; the Rome Statute on the ICC; CRC-OP on child sale, prostitution and pornography; and the Mine-Ban Treaty. The following table shows Afghanistan's actualised and proposed targets: Table 1: Afghanistan's MDG progress 2004 2015 Halve Poverty 53 percent 26 percent Halve Hunger 48 percent 24 percent Universal Primary Enrolment Total: 36 percent (M: 51, F: 21) 100 percent Two-thirds reduction of U5MR 172/1,000 60/1,000 Three-quarters reduction MMR 1,600/100,000 400/100,000 However, the country has many development constraints: \u2022 Security problems persist in some areas. \u2022 The central government has limited control over certain provinces. \u2022 Corruption is widespread. \u2022 Domestic funding is limited. \u2022 The country is prone to frequent natural disasters. \u2022 Poppy cultivation (for opium production) has resumed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 11 The MDGs are a priority for the Afghan government.

They work on enhancing the quality of education, with a specific gender focus, and advocate for human rights, specifically women's rights. They also promote environmental sustainability, provide micro-financing for small business development, and engage in civic education for elections. MDG advocacy and monitoring in Afghanistan face the following challenges: \u2022 Overall, limited knowledge exists about the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs. \u2022 Funding for advocacy campaign must be secured. \u2022 Human resources for MDG advocacy are limited during election time, as CSOs focus on civic education for the elections. \u2022 The MDG monitoring capacity of the Central Statistics Office must be strengthened. \u2022 Data is scarce, but some progress is being made. \u2022 Professional staff, equipment and financial resources are lacking. Bangladesh Mr Akram ul-Aziz, Joint Chief, Macro and Perspective Planning Wing, General Economics Division Bangladesh has witnessed considerable economic and social progress over the past decade. The progress in achieving key social MDGs has been shared by almost all socioeconomic categories. Bangladesh has graduated from being a test case for development to being in the league of graduating to medium development countries. However, further improvements in social MDGs, such as poverty reduction, require a substantial increase in the income-earning ability of the poor. Bangladesh finalised its first PRSP in March 2003, followed by another one in December 2004. The core principles of PRSPs are adhered to: It is country driven, results oriented, comprehensive, partnership oriented, long term in perspective and fully participatory. In addition, MDG targets are embedded in the PRSPs. Bangladesh's PRSP emphasises policies for enhancing pro-poor economic growth, which are anchored on macroeconomic stability, an enabling environment, infrastructure development, development of ICT, fostering agricultural and rural development along with water resources development, and management of the environment. Social development, devising effective safety nets, and targeted programmes for women, children and disadvantaged groups are other areas that need attention. The General Economic Division of the Planning Commission was identified by the Government as the National Poverty Focal Point (NPFP) and was entrusted with preparing the PRSP. (NPFP also monitors MDG progress.) A 21-member national steering committee was set up under the chairmanship of the principal secretary to the prime minister. The steering committee provided overall guidance and direction to NPFP for the preparation of the PRSP. It also oversees the implementation of I-PRSP policy reforms as contained in the medium-term policy matrix and monitors other poverty indicators.

The PRSP process has opened up dialogue on public policy, and representatives of civil society have had access to policy debates that were hitherto limited. Efforts have been made to ensure consultations with as broad a class of participants as possible, including socially excluded groups. The aim was to elicit views, share experiences and understand the expectations of stakeholders. Participatory consultations took place with a cross-section of stakeholders at the national and regional levels. The meetings, one at the national and six at the divisional headquarters, generated unprecedented enthusiasm among the participants. Particular attention was given to gender, children, the weak and vulnerable groups in the consultation process. An outcome-oriented participatory approach was adopted in designing the consultation, with a combination of structured and open-ended discussions. Two imperatives were especially considered: (1) ensuring informed, active and committed participation, and (2) fostering a conducive atmosphere for participatory discussions. It was anticipated that constraints and biases may affect the quality and output of the consultations. Comprehensive recommendations were obtained on the subject of poverty and on the 12 thematic topics, and the regional dimension of poverty in Bangladesh was also captured during the discussions. Capacity was also created within the Planning Commission through the UNDP- supported Sustainable Human Development modelling system for monitoring MDG and PRS progress. An MDG progress report for 2004 was prepared using the outcomes of the system. Efforts are under way to consolidate the system within NPFP through further UNDP assistance. Bhutan Mr Lam Dorji, Director, Department of Planning, Ministry of Finance The Royal Government of Bhutan launched its first Millennium Development Goals Report in 2003. In terms of opportunities and challenges, the Bhutan delegation highlighted two areas: Opportunities 1. The MDGs related to poverty, educational attainments, maternal and child health, high-risk diseases and environmental sustainability are high-priority development themes for Bhutan. This is also evident from the development focus in the current Ninth Five-Year Plan (July 2002\u2013June 2007). There is a strong national political commitment to, and a positive policy environment for, the achievement of the MDGs. In keeping with the alignment of the MDGs with the national development themes, the government has designated the Department of Planning, Ministry of Finance, as the focal agency with responsibility for coordinating and taking a lead role in all matters relating to the MDGs in Bhutan. As the Department is also responsible for the preparation of PRSPs and the formulation of national development plans, there is now more scope for the integration of the MDGs into the development planning process. 2. In Bhutan, MDG Country Reports are viewed as a vehicle to keep the national focus on agreed development priorities, to keep the public informed on progress, to foster debate and dialogue, and to trigger action to meet the tailored MDG targets. They provide the platform for donor coordination around nationally defined development priorities. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 14 Accordingly, two years after its first National MDG Report, Bhutan would undertake a review of the status of its progress, assess whether progress is on track, and identify major challenges through a highly inclusive consultative process and dialogue involving senior policy makers as well as local officials, NGOs, academia, donors and UNCT. This process, which will lead to either the preparation of a second report or an update of the first MDGR, should provide the necessary opportunity for Bhutan to see where it stands and what it requires for future action. Challenges 1. The government acknowledges the critical need for an analytical framework to monitor and report on the progress towards the MDGs at the subnational levels to address specific district needs and priorities through well-targeted initiatives and resource allocations. To facilitate the production of district-level MDG indexes and maps, the government considered various requirements and challenges, such as the availability of district-level disaggregated data and the capacity to monitor, analyse and report, as the first prerequisite to the production of district-level MDG indices and maps and their effective inclusion into local priority settings and planning processes. 2. While there is awareness of the importance of the MDGs and their message in certain sections of government, civil society and the international donor community because of early MDG advocacy and campaigns, the country needs to further increase awareness and bring about more sensitisation to take the MDGs forward in the country.

The usual challenges of resource constraints, and the fact that Bhutan is a landlocked country, have not been discussed as the workshop is focused on the LDCs and LLDCs. Cambodia H.E. Ou Orhat, Secretary of State, Ministry of Planning The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) is fully committed to the MDGs and has consciously decided to measure national development performance against the MDGs. For this purpose, RGC has localised the global MDGs into Cambodia MDGs (CMDGs). They reflect the realities of Cambodia based on a strong national consensus. Specific indicators for each CMDG have been identified, including the benchmark and the short-, medium- and long-term target values to be achieved during 2005, 2010 and 2015. In all, the CMDGs cover nine goals, 25 overall targets and 106 specific targets. RGC has also taken measures to prepare and disseminate CMDG reports in a regular manner. Although the first report was prepared in 2001 by UNCT, the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals Report 2003 has been prepared under the leadership of the Council for Social Development (CSD) and was launched by the Prime Minister in March 2004. The report discusses the current situation, identifies major challenges, provides a diagnosis of major policies -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 15 and programmes contributing to each CMDG, sets out frameworks for meeting the challenges, and indicates road maps for monitoring and evaluating performance. Over the past decade, Cambodia has achieved significant economic growth. This, however, has not been translated into rapid poverty reduction. The proportion of the population below the poverty line fell from 39 percent in 1994 to only around 36 percent in 1999. On the social side, progress has also been slow and uneven. While access to primary education has improved significantly, reaching the targets of secondary education remains a major challenge. Gender equality is also a major issue in most areas of socioeconomic life despite a clear government commitment to female empowerment. Health and sanitary conditions of a significant proportion of the population are still unacceptable. The U5MR seems to have increased slightly over the past decade. Also, Cambodia has made limited progress in improving maternal mortality. The HIV prevalence rate in the adult (15\u201349 years) population, despite falling from 3.3 percent to 2.6 percent between 1997 and 2002, still remains high. Cambodia's natural resources are also degrading at an accelerating pace. The objective of the RGC is to ensure that by 2015 there will be improved human resources, less poverty and inequality, reduced prevalence of HIV/AIDS, enhanced conservation of Cambodia's environmental heritage, and a society without discrimination against women and where all girls and boys have better and equal access to education. These are the core issues of the CMDGs. The political will to support the CMDGs is a critical factor in carrying forward the government's commitments. The Third Legislature of the National Assembly, which is the political platform of the government, has adopted the Rectangular Strategy. The comprehensive agenda under the strategy aims at improving and building the capacity of public institutions, strengthening good governance and modernising the economic infrastructure. The objectives are to promote economic growth, generate employment for all citizens, ensure social equity, enhance the efficiency of the public sector, and protect the nation's natural resources and cultural heritage. All these are crucial to achieving the CMDGs and promoting sustainable development in Cambodia. To mainstream CMDG-related issues, the government has integrated the CMDGs into its national planning and development process. The Third Cambodia Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDPIII) will be formulated as a harmonised policy document by combining all national policy and strategy documents, including the national poverty-reduction strategy. For success, they would have to go a long way to ensure adequate capacity in human resources, effective and efficient institutions, and good governance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de8ffec5-13cf-4ba4-8a90-18c7f0e5b728": {"__data__": {"id_": "de8ffec5-13cf-4ba4-8a90-18c7f0e5b728", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, October 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad72dbca363e442cfafb031df83ff52f70c4e7f226820085c1bc6d92426febe8"}, "2": {"node_id": "b40cac41-2252-4d48-951e-1a9114dd7baa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f47028cadef29a2c5264e8cbf3314615cad7e8364cf2034081cbe10d073cfb5a"}}, "hash": "d3e331540b2d11ac54caa05062b2e0361042eff64f3bf450df45d51d53554579", "text": "For Cambodian citizens, the CMDGs are also a commitment to human rights, democracy, peace and security, and good governance.

Mr Kommasith commended UNCT for its logistical and substantive support to the Lao Government. He explained the country's position in terms of MDG implementation, development challenges, and opportunities that would help them achieve the MDGs by 2015: MDG 1 Overall poverty has been reduced from 48 percent in 1990 to about 37 percent in 2001. However, wide disparities exist across the country. The poverty rate ranges from 75 percent in the provinces to 12 percent in the cities. The government has to overcome this challenge to achieve MDG 1. It has identified 47 districts, which are considered the poorest in the country, as a focus for its poverty-eradication strategy. MDG 2 Lao PDR has made steady progress in the area of universal primary education. The net enrolment ratio increased from 58 to over 80 percent. Nevertheless, the government is still concerned about the disparity in the enrolment rates in the provinces as well as those between girls and boys. If this disparity persists, it will impair overall progress towards this goal. MDG 3 Gender disparities in Lao PDR are still a challenge the government has to address, particularly the gap in school enrolment. Basic education will determine whether girls and women are treated equally with boys and men in society. Despite this disparity, the government has achieved relatively commendable progress towards the MDG target in women's representation in parliament. The number of seats held by women in the Lao National Assembly increased from 6 percent in 1990 to 23 percent in 2003. MDG 4 The government is taking progressive steps towards the MDGs. The U5MR was down from 170 to 106 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the infant MR dropped from 134 to 82. MDG 5 Over the past 10 years, Lao PDR has seen the incidence of maternal mortality drop almost by one-third (from 750 to 530 per 100,000). This was due to improved access to family planning services and maternal health care. However, this trend is unlikely to continue since it requires significant improvements in health infrastructure, access and service. MDG 6 and 7 Lao PDR has zero HIV/AIDS prevalence (0.04 percent). However, this is not a signal for complacency. The government has initiated a national policy on HIV/AIDS/STI and a National Strategy Plan and Action on HIV/AIDS 2002\u20132005. In relation to environmental sustainability, the government has taken significant steps to ensure that the country's environment and natural resources are managed in a sustainable manner. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 17 Based on the first National Report and the overall assessment of progress, Lao PDR is on track to achieve most of the MDG goals and targets. This optimistic prediction depends on performance and international support from now on to 2015. To achieve the MDGs, the government is committed to fully implementing the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), a localised PRSP, which was adopted in 2003. NGPES is a comprehensive framework for growth and development and focuses on improving the poverty situation in the poorest 47 districts. It aims at enhancing growth and development and reducing poverty. It has incorporated most of the MDGs in its goals and targets. Moreover, in most cases the government's targets in the NGPES are more ambitious than the global MDG targets. Monitoring progress in implementing the NGPES objectives and programmes will serve to help the government monitor progress in implementing its international commitments.

Maldives Mr Ahmed Mohamed, Director, Development Planning, Ministry of Planning and National Development The MDGs consist of eight goals, 18 specific targets to be met by 2015 and 48 indicators to measure progress. The goals, targets and indicators are the same for all 189 participating countries and are deliberately not country specific. Accordingly, some targets and indicators may not be relevant in the context of individual countries. For example, indicators like land area covered by forest, carbon dioxide emissions, slum dwellers, etc. are of minor importance for a small island state such as Maldives. Therefore, for Maldives, some MDG indicators have been made country specific. For instance, indicator 9 (ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education) has been changed to ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education, because there is hardly any tertiary education in Maldives. Indicator 11 (share of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector) has been changed to share of women in the labour force, because the agricultural sector is negligible in Maldives. This presentation is in three parts, with separate progress reports for Maldives, Mal\u00e9 and the Atolls, because of increasing disparities between the capital, Mal\u00e9, and the other islands. Other important factors need to be taken into consideration: 1) Not all data are available for the benchmark year; in those cases, the time series of indicators are as close as possible to 1990; and 2) MDGs are country averages; disparities within a country are not considered. MDGs where the performance of Maldives appears to be excellent in 2004: MDG 1 The proportion of the population living on less than $1 a day is close to zero. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 18 MDG 2 Universal primary education has practically been achieved in Maldives. MDG 3 There are practically no gender disparities in primary and secondary education. MDG 4 Both the U5MR and the infant MR have declined by more than 50 percent during 1991\u20132001; immunisation of 1-year-olds against measles is over 99 percent. MDG 5 Although the MMR is declining and practically all births are now attended to by skilled birth attendants, getting access to essential, quality obstetric care remains difficult on the small islands. Anaemia is the main contributing factor to high MMR. MDG 6 The low contraceptive user rate is a matter of increasing concern that needs to be addressed. Further, about a quarter of the population are Thalassaemia carriers, and epidemic-prone conditions such as acute respiratory infections, viral fever, diarrhoea and vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever continue to be the main causes of morbidity. MDG 7 Ensuring sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation to the many dispersed islands remains a big challenge. Opportunities and challenges The overall progress in Maldives upto 2004 towards meeting the MDGs is excellent. Most MDGs have already been met or are likely to be met by 2015. As for economic and human development, more has happened in Maldives in the past three decades than in the previous 2,000 years. However, major challenges remain in finding ways to meet the other MDGs where Maldives still has some way to go. A major constraint in this respect is the unique geography of the country, with 200 dispersed, small inhabited islands, out of which 168 have fewer than 1,500 inhabitants. Severe diseconomies of scale make it difficult to formulate realistic policies to provide sustainable essential services throughout the country and to improve access to transport for the island population, both in terms of availability (many islands are not accessible at all times, and there is practically no routine transportation system in Maldives) and in terms of affordability. All three MDG targets where Maldives has still some way to go\u2014maternal mortality, access to medicines and doctors when needed, and access to safe drinking water\u2014are directly related to geography and diseconomies of scale. Apart from these well-known structural geographical constraints, new challenges have arisen in Maldives as a result of rapid economic development during the past few decades.

Accordingly, one of the major challenges in Maldives today is to promote balanced and equitable economic and human development throughout the country. This implies increasing employment opportunities on the islands in the Atolls, keeping in mind that traditional sectors such as fisheries are unattractive sectors for some young people. To increase potential employment opportunities for youth, new sectors need to be explored on the islands. MDG forums and VPAs UNCT Maldives, which comprises four UN agencies, collaborated with the government to put together a special task force to coordinate all MDG-related activities. The MDG forums were some of the most important activities. Three public forums were held in 2003 to raise awareness among policy makers as well as the public about the MDGs. The first MDG forum, held in April 2003, was on MDGs and environmental health. The second MDG forum, in June 2003, was on the topic of MDGs and nutrition. The third MDG forum titled 'Towards Meeting the Millennium Development Goals' was held on 20 August 2003. H.E. Mr Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, President of the Republic of Maldives, addressed this forum. UNDP, WB and the Ministry of Planning and National Development also carried out the second Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment (VPA) in 2004. VPA 2 would provide panel data analysis to enable comparison with the findings of the previous VPA survey conducted in 1998. The data would be used to prepare the Maldives MDG Report. Mongolia Mr Namkhaijantsan Baldandamba, Economic Policy Adviser to the President of Mongolia The government has made a strong effort to integrate the MDGs into its Economic Growth Support for Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGSPRS), which provided a framework for poverty reduction, linking economic policies with social development trends, encouraging the participation of the public and donors, and improving the effectiveness of external assistance. Given Mongolia's high dependence on aid, EGSPRS determined budget allocations. In addition, a new Social Security Sector Development Plan for the country was approved and started. A series of poverty-reduction actions were taken, but one-third of the total population still lives in poverty. In 2000 and 2001, economic growth slowed to 1.0\u20131.1 percent because of a sharp decline in the agricultural sector, which produces more than one-third of the GDP. However, it accelerated to 3.9 percent in 2002 and 5.5 percent in 2003. Poverty and disparity appear to have increased over the past decade. If this trend is not reversed, the MDG target of halving poverty by 2015 will be a challenge for the country. To address the above challenges, the government will accelerate the rate of economic growth through broad-based private sector development and regional development. It will also diversify the economy, which is heavily dependent on a few export commodities and remains highly vulnerable to external shocks. Mongolia has been a member of WTO since 1997. Development of knowledge-based industries will open new possibilities for economic diversification and export growth. This will require technological renovation of industries, and the promotion of small- and medium-sized industries and skilled professional employees. Mongolia's other priorities are to reverse the rise in disparity, ensure adequate social protection, involve local communities and CSOs, manage disaster and risk, and pay attention to the special needs of the country's landlocked nature. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 20 MDG 1 The implementation of the educational, health and gender-related goals is comparably more successful than other macroeconomic and poverty-related goals. The economic crisis in Mongolia has had adverse effects on education, although recent trends leave room for optimism. Net primary enrolment rates plummeted from around 98 percent in 1989 to 91 percent in 2000.

It was more than halved between 1990 and 2000, putting Mongolia on track to achieving this target by 2015. MDG 5 Rates of maternal mortality are high in the country. However, the MMR dropped in 2002 to 124 and in 2003 it was 109.5, which is the lowest rate in the past decade. The challenge now is to ensure a continuous decreasing trend in order to meet the MDG target. MDG 6 Mongolia has a low prevalence of HIV/AIDS. But the country has a number of risk factors, including a high incidence of sexually transmitted infections. Tuberculosis is one of the most pressing public health problems in Mongolia today, being the third most prevalent infectious disease. The government introduced the Directly Observed Treatment Short Course in 1995 within the framework of the National Programme for Combating Tuberculosis, which has currently achieved 100 percent coverage of both urban and rural populations. MDG 7 The most pressing environmental problems for Mongolia are land and pasture degradation, air pollution, low energy efficiency, deforestation and decreasing biodiversity. Mongolia gives priority to the MDGs that are essential for the country's development and will cooperate with other countries and international organisations.

Myanmar Mr Khin Kyu, Project Officer, Monitoring and Evaluation, UNICEF Myanmar is an LDC, with per capita income of US $300 in 1997, according to WB estimates. Because of the lack of data, in-depth analysis of the situation in the country is difficult. Even when data exist, their reliability is questionable and their timeliness is a problem. Previously, the Planning Department of the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development used to release information on the performance of the macroeconomy by publishing the yearly Review of the Financial, Economic and Social Conditions of Myanmar. This practice stopped in 1998\u201399. The government's budget used to appear annually in local newspapers in April, the beginning of the fiscal year. In April 2001, the Government stopped publishing its budget in newspapers. The last census was conducted in 1983, and before that, it was conducted once every 10 years. In 1993, the census was not conducted. Therefore, data on population are projections and according to these projections, Myanmar had a population of over 52 million in 2002, with a population growth rate of 2 percent. According to the 1997 Household Income and Expenditure Survey conducted by the Central Statistical Organisation, nearly one in four households (22.86 percent) had expenditures below minimum subsistence levels. Poverty rates are the same in urban and rural areas (23.91 percent and 22.42 percent, respectively). At the same time, there are important differences in regional poverty rates. For example, in Chin, Magway and Kayah, poverty rates are 42 percent, 38 percent and 35 percent, respectively. In Tanintharyi, Kachin and Shan, poverty rates are 8 percent, 10 percent and 11 percent, respectively. UNDP in Myanmar Since 1993, UNDP has been implementing grassroots-level projects in strict compliance with the UNDP Mandate in Myanmar. It assists in primary health care, the environment, HIV/AIDS, primary education and food security. In 2002, UNDP Myanmar conducted a nationwide poverty survey. The project started in June 2003, and in November 2004, the first round of the quantitative survey was conducted, followed by the second round in May 2005. From this poverty survey, all MDG indicators, except MMR, will be measured.

This programme focuses on girl child education, with incentives and facilities extended to the poorest families. A new initiative has recently been taken to link the MDGs with the PRSP in a more intensive manner, so that the PRSP could work as a medium-term road map to implement the MDGs. The business plan to link the MDGs with the PRSP spells out the required inputs in terms of various interventions as well as financial and human resources, and it identifies areas for policy and institutional reforms. The business plan also addresses short-term needs for streamlining the current PRSP and long-term needs for providing a consistent approach for subsequent PRSPs. This exercise includes setting targets and aligning them with resources as reflected in MTEF; reviewing policies in the PRSP and prioritising them, and strengthening institutions to address challenges; and analysing the efficiency and effectiveness of intra- and inter-sectoral resource allocations.

It would inform intergovernmental processes, shape efforts across and within UN agencies, be the main focus of the Millennium Project and the Millennium Campaign, and influence the dialogue with international financial institutions. Considerable debate about the summit would be planned for the five-year review: what it means, what it should become, what its desired outcomes are. The event would present a turning point globally on the road to the MDGs for three reasons: expectations would be raised globally; there would be increasing political momentum in the developed and developing world; and time required for achieving the goals would be running out. Most agreed that the event would break from established patterns and have a business-like focus on adopting and ratifying substantive measures to achieve the goals by 2015.

He outlined the similarities and differences between MDGs and PRSPs and emphasised how they complement each other. He also explained some general principles applicable to both MDG implementation and PRSPs. For MDGs, he stressed that the rationale calls for greater focus and more effective and concerted effort (in aid, trade, security) for promoting development. On the other hand, PRSPs operationalise the belief that country ownership is critical in ensuring effective government policy and use of aid. The PRSP approach recognises that a simplistic approach to aid conditionality has had limited success and that poverty reduction and aid effectiveness depend on government commitment. He further explained that the similarity and the positive and negative points of the two approaches, as well as their links to national budgets, are obligations and pose great capacity constraints on countries. The attempt to develop national MDG-related targets, and strategies to reach them, generally occurs in a policy environment in which there already exist other national strategies and plans, with or without clear medium- and long-term targets. PRSPs are arguably a special subset of these national plans. This presentation sought to encourage explicit recognition of the coexistence of MDG and PRSP processes in most LDCs in Asia; identify the similarities and differences between these two approaches; and explore the potential effects (positive and negative) on the evolution of government capacity and donor cooperation arising from the coexistence of these two processes. Origins of and rationales for the two approaches Just as the drive to define country-level MDGs (and associated strategies to achieve them and to track progress towards their achievement) are strongly associated with the UN System, so PRSPs have been most closely associated, initially at least, with the World Bank and IMF.

The PRSP approach shares many features in common with that of country-level MDGs but evolved from a somewhat different set of influences. First, the IFIs had come to acknowledge that conventional conditionality (as used in most structural adjustment policies) had not been very successful.

Developing government commitment\u2014a broad agreement and partnership between the government and donors\u2014came to be seen as extremely important. Second, there was a push to provide debt relief, but there was fear among donors (including the IFIs) that this would not benefit the poor. In an attempt at a solution, WB and IMF announced that rather than make their aid conditional on a country adopting a standard package of structural adjustment policies, they would ask aid- recipient countries to prepare, with extensive civil-society participation (to build government accountability for the use of aid), a medium-term strategy for poverty reduction. This should be holistic (i.e. bring together macroeconomic stability and growth, revenues, and pro-poor economic and social policies); be based on a rational and prioritised use of available resources (i.e. address inefficiencies and anti-poor biases in public expenditure management); and be results oriented (with a framework to track PRSP implementation and outcomes). The existence of a nationally owned PRSP, produced through a participatory process, became the overarching condition for receipt of aid. Initially intended only as a meta condition for debt relief under Highly Indebted and Poor Countries-II, PRSP soon became the centrepiece of all IFI concessional finance to LDCs. Linking to the global agenda for aid harmonisation, a number of other donors have stated, either as global policy or in particular countries, that they will base their country programmes around the government's PRSP.

If the MDG and PRSP approaches have these positive characteristics in common, they both also share a number of potential weaknesses: \u2022 Risk becoming donor led: There is a danger that the principle of national ownership and broad participation of nongovernment stakeholders will get lost in donor efforts to meet internal standards and timetables. The result is at best a high-quality PRSP and national MDG framework without any real roots in government planning or M&E, little prospect of implementation, and a waste of donor resources; and at worst, the creation of donor- oriented documents and systems in parallel to existing government systems, with national capacity undermined. Both PRSPs and country-level MDG processes have in some countries at some time fallen into this trap. \u2022 Risk overemphasising social sectors at the expense of productive sectors: Delivering social services is something that governments 'do', and so donors can help them do and measure; the more subtle and complex problem of how to raise the incomes of the poor sometimes takes a back seat to improving service delivery. As a result, the macroeconomic policy prescriptions of PRSPs have sometimes failed to advance much beyond those laid out in older Strategic Plans. Both approaches have typically struggled to define in practical terms what 'pro-poor growth' means for government policies and institutions or to pin down the opportunities and risks for the poor inherent in trade integration. Differing underlying views on how resources and institutions determine outcomes PRSP and country-level MDG approaches have much in common and complement each other more often than they contradict each other. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge where differences exist. The most important is with regard to the understanding implicit in each approach (or at least, implicit in how each approach is typically operationalised) with regard to the link between total resources and development outcomes, and the relative importance of available finance, as opposed to policies and institutions, as constraints on progress. The PRSP approach draws on experience over the 1990s with non-project aid modalities (SWAPs, MTEF, general budget support) and development cooperation that focuses on reforming the budget and planning processes. As such, it tends to emphasise the following: \u2022 Establish overall budget envelope, including ODA (many countries find it hard to do this, so they allocate public expenditure without a clear idea of what the overall limits are). \u2022 Link budgets to plans, and make hard choices to prioritise expenditures in order to improve the effectiveness and pro-poor orientation of PEM (in many countries, there is -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 30 little relationship between plans and strategies and the pattern of PEM; many countries allocate money in inefficient ways\u2014e.g. spend much on new investment, and too little on subsequently sustaining this investment\u2014and with very strong biases in favour of the rich rather than the poor, e.g. tertiary rather than primary services, subsidised electricity or inputs that favour large rather than marginal farmers, etc.). \u2022 Put in place systems (chart of accounts, expenditure tracking, reporting, audits, MIS, M&E) so that policy makers and planners can track how the money is spent and what outcomes it does or does not achieve, and feed this back into policy. MDGs\u2014especially as articulated in the Millennium Project\u2014tend to emphasise the right to development and the need for rich countries to increase the resources they give as ODA. There is a strong\u2014and reasonable\u2014argument that the developed world does not live up to its responsibilities to help the developing world. This is seen not only in many aspects of international relations (e.g. biased trade regimes) but also in aid, where most donors fail to give the 0.7 percent of GNI that they have promised. The formulation of the MDGs globally was intended to set collective goals for the world and to motivate all partners\u2014including donors\u2014to put more effort into development. So there is pressure to calculate the additional aid resources that would be required to achieve the MDGs\u2014globally and at country level\u2014and to use this to advocate for more generous ODA.

Those associated with the PRSP and the 'first make better use of existing resources' approach emphasise the importance of national institutions and policies in translating resources into outcomes. They note that some countries have achieved very good policies and outcomes at levels of per capita income or public resources and with levels of per capita ODA that are similar to those of countries that have not achieved success\u2014implying that the level of aid is not the critical factor and that national institutions do matter.

They may even make things worse by muddying the signals that donors send government about the importance of reform: \u2022 By reducing the incentives for the evolution of systems by which politicians and bureaucrats are held accountable to their citizens for the use of public resources \u2022 By discouraging efforts to collect domestic revenue and so perpetuating aid dependence \u2022 By creating more opportunities for corruption and so helping to entrench elites and increasingly unequal patterns of assets, income and access to public resources, which will distort development efforts for decades to come -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 31 \u2022 And, possibly, by creating yet more donor projects, parallel systems, and technical assistance posts, and so perpetuating or exacerbating all the capacity- and accountability- destroying aid practices that the current harmonisation and alignment agenda is intended to address. (This last point is debatable; to scale up aid to the size and at the speed implied by the Millennium Project would probably only be possible with some significant move away from projects and towards budget support.) Advocates of the 'institutional' emphasis associated with the PRSP approach do not disagree that global ODA will need to be greatly increased in order to have any chance of achieving the MDGs or that it should be increased in this way. The danger, they argue, comes when the assumptions about the relationship between resource transfer and development outcomes are applied without adaptation across all country contexts. In many countries, there is evidence that government has the capacity to transform aid into outcomes; here, there would be a strong case for more aid. Disagreement arises about whether the same relationship between more aid and better outcomes can be assumed to hold in countries with weak institutions, accountability and capacity. MDGs in the context of PRSPs: maximising synergies, minimising transaction costs The summary above is a simplification for the purposes of clarifying the debate. In reality, the difference in the traditions is one of emphasis; all sides acknowledge that at a fundamental level both resources and institutional change are necessary, but they may disagree about the balance or sequencing between the two. There are different views on what is an appropriate level of total aid to a country at a given point in its institutional development\u2014this is a valid debate, which should be conducted openly, involve government and civil society, and proceed in a respectful manner, drawing on evidence and testing the explanatory logic of each case. Under most circumstances, the complementarities far outweigh the contradictions between the country-level MDG approach and the PRSP approach\u2014in terms of their common objectives and the common risks they face. Encouraging governments to articulate national MDGs can help reorient national planning and M&E towards poverty reduction, which is exactly what the PRSP approach aims to do. The priority then is to ensure that both, alone or together, are pursued in ways that maximise the benefits achieved and minimise any potentially negative effects. Neither of them should be a stand-alone process, parallel to existing government planning and M&E; both should aim to help define and then enact the changes needed in government planning documents or structures. As far as possible, country MDG or PRSP production should not be driven by donor needs or timetables; donors need to be realistic about the time required (and encourage government counterparts to be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35fa0377-996f-4669-ac5f-8da4c7461454": {"__data__": {"id_": "35fa0377-996f-4669-ac5f-8da4c7461454", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, October 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bac8f95d2f471bf4eda6bcc14549d5206d3adaf1fa646ab42fcf703ddd549bd3"}, "3": {"node_id": "884e4512-7652-4652-87f4-ba83a51f8360", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63759d8f0ca8224ade98312f4e007df27a521d7296da8dec6ad073e768ddcabf"}}, "hash": "bd92bd1512b1de2c9883fef5431af3879237a99d940a686e58677f16a051d6b1", "text": "similarly realistic). Time, thought and effort are needed to first build consensus with government and CSOs; building awareness and commitment to a document and system after it has been finalised is much harder. Both of these new donor 'technologies' should be developed in an iterative, two-way process; if there is an existing measure that is a close proxy for an MDG indicator, or if there is a national plan that meets most of the criteria for a PRSP, improving that measure or plan is better than creating a new one. In contexts where PRSPs and country-level MDGs coexist, various stakeholders should be gathered and the two efforts merged, rather a government going through both as separate exercises, either sequentially or simultaneously. Country-level MDGs make a natural overarching framework for a PRSP M&E system; for its part, the process of defining country-level MDG targets can benefit from the detailed work on cross-sectoral planning and the potential synergies between progress on different goals that can and should be an important part of the PRSP process. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 32 Finally, MDG 8\u2014creating an international partnership in support of development\u2014can add value to a PRSP. The goal helps remind donors, and the bilateral donors' parent governments, that they have obligations, too (for example, with regard not only to aid harmonisation, alignment and the timeliness and predictability of ODA delivery, but also with regard to how trade and security policies of northern countries influence development prospects in the south). Elaborating this principle in a particular country context can help include in the PRSP mutual accountability between governments and donors and accountability of both to the citizens who are meant to be the ultimate beneficiaries of aid. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 33 2.5 Session V: Political and social mobilisation for policy change: the UN Millennium Campaign's interface at country level H.E. Erna Witoelar, UN Special Ambassador for MDGs H.E. Erna Witoelar, UN Special Ambassador for the MDGs, detailed strategic ways through which the 10 LLDCs could effectively and efficiently be involved in the UN Millennium Campaign. The MDGs need to reach different audiences in these countries. The presentation focused on achieving the MDGs through political and social mobilisation for policy change, explaining the rationale behind two categories of activities, 'sprint' and 'marathon'. 'Sprint' refers to objectives that needed to be achieved by 2005 and that are considered the backbone and prerequisites for the success of the MDGs. The following priorities have been identified: \u2022 completion of MDG National and Regional Reports; and \u2022 commitments and renewed pledges at the highest levels to pro-poor policies in developing countries and pro-development policies in developed countries. 'Marathon' objectives have a longer timeframe for implementation, starting from now until 2015. Special attention and more support are needed along the way if the following goals are to be achieved: \u2022 ownership of MDGs at all levels by all stakeholders; political and public support for policy changes and implementations; \u2022 capacities built and resources mobilised to meet the MDGs; and \u2022 putting monitoring, evaluating and reporting systems in place. The following solutions were suggested to overcome potential challenges facing stakeholders during 'sprint' time: \u2022 MDG reporting: Build multisectoral consensus and participatory processes to decide on the end product; get reliable and comprehensive data. \u2022 MDG general awareness: Use appropriate, popular and concise language and tools to promote the MDGs; get the right angle and relevant human stories to generate media interest. \u2022 Commitments: Harnessing long-term commitments at the highest level remains critical and the biggest challenge during the 'sprint'. How do we overcome it?

Political mobilisation is undeniably required to develop and maintain policy changes. Social mobilisation is needed to develop and maintain public awareness, public participation, strategic achievements from planning, implementation through monitoring, and evaluation to realise the goals. Building ownership of the MDGs is the most important factor for success. Achieving the MDGs is not just a 'UN obligation', but also involves commitments by governments to their own people. Ownership involves tailor-made targets and indicators to fit local circumstances and to generate more participation. It involves sharper priority action to tackle disparities and country-specific challenges as well as stronger leverage to direct donor harmonisation. Ownership means that countries will be better in getting political and public support. As with 'sprint', the 'marathon' has its challenges: \u2022 Sustenance of relatively high-growth areas: Promote a conducive atmosphere for trade and investments. \u2022 Avoid increasing inequality: Take affirmative action for poorer, more remote or conflict areas; strive for harmonisation of donors and central government (sectoral) interventions; target the vulnerable groups with programmes and social protection, build infrastructure for the poor, up-scale appropriate technology and disseminate success stories; develop proactive and pro-poor policies to improve governance and promote accountability. Synergy convergence is needed in the efforts undertaken and the efforts yet to be undertaken by countries in the region. Because of the interdependence of the goals, progress in one area will translate into supporting progress in others. However, the following challenges persist: \u2022 Acute and widespread poverty and hunger \u2022 Gender inequality \u2022 Lack of (access to) primary education \u2022 Development challenges \u2022 Child mortality \u2022 Maternal mortality \u2022 HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis \u2022 Environmental destruction/degradation \u2022 Global inequality Session V also examined key roles of civil society and the media in determining the success of the MDGs. Promoting the MDGs requires civil society to assume these active roles: \u2022 Participants in design of MDG strategies \u2022 Service providers through community-based organisations and neighbourhood groups \u2022 Advocates to ensure government's fulfilment of global and national MDG pledges Like civil society, the media is an active participant in promoting the MDGs. The media should advocate for more awareness and more inclusive decision-making for MDGs. They should promote access to information; participation in planning, monitoring and evaluating; and accountability at all levels of authority. Despite good progress towards MDGs, significant 'pockets of poverty' still exist. Poverty at its core is a local issue, and local political processes matter most to the poor. Without local accountability, efforts to tackle issues of poverty will be ineffective. Local governments need to promote locally driven MDGs, unlocking inherent local potentials and bringing decision-making processes closer to the people. Equally important is the role of local, provincial and national legislators in resource allocation and advocating for affirmative actions for poorer and more remote areas. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 35 3.

reaffirmed at the UN Financing for Development Conference in Monterrey in 2002 and the September 2002 Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development. \u2022 We also recognise the unique

In the Pacific, many countries have effectively integrated MDGs into their national planning processes, and in some countries, village communities are using MDGs as tools to evaluate progress in their development. However, we acknowledge that, despite some notable socioeconomic advances in Asia, it remains the region with the highest number of people in poverty. Close to 700 million, out of the global total of 1,100 million of the world's poorest, live in this region. We are deeply concerned that Asia and the Pacific, in spite of some remarkable strides in the income\u2013poverty situation, suffer from severe constraints in 'human' poverty issues such as safe and clean drinking water, adequate food and nutrition, and access to health care and education. We also express our concern at the continued lack of attention to issues of gender equality and equity that have directly affected our generation of young women and girls. We are disturbed by the condition of many of Asia\u2013Pacific's youth, who are particularly susceptible to the problems of poverty, unemployment and diseases such as HIV/AIDS, among other social and economic challenges. We are alarmed at the continued violations of the rights of young people in Asia and the Pacific, especially girls, because of trafficking and sexual exploitation, and the recruitment of child soldiers. We are dismayed by the minimal commitment to providing environmental sustainability to ensure equitable access to productive resources and services, and the lack of recognition of our responsibility to protect natural resources and respect the environment on which we depend. We are further concerned that the benefits of the ICT revolution have not reached many in Asia and the Pacific, denying the youth, in particular, of the opportunities that ICT affords to access knowledge and information. We are also dismayed that conflict has been affecting millions of lives in this region and has impeded progress and development, and, in particular, has worsened the plight of women and children. In light of these realities, we strongly believe that the Asia\u2013 Pacific region urgently needs to refocus its attention to achieve the MDGs, taking advantage of its existing resources to improve the lives of all its people. We therefore call for focus, convergence and expansion of MDG advocacy in our respective countries and in the Asia\u2013Pacific region. We welcome the United Nations World Youth Report 2003, which emphasises the need to engage the youth in strengthening participatory democracy and concludes that political, economic and social youth empowerment and participation will lead to better decisions and outcomes. We call for empowering and building capacity of fellow young leaders to meaningfully and proactively engage in the achievement of the MDGs and for a more active representation of youth in several institutions of government. We are determined to be active partners in helping Asia and the Pacific meet the MDGs and wish to contribute to making them an integral part of local and national policies by localising the MDGs to suit national priorities and concerns.

We are well placed to spread the messages of Asia\u2013Pacific 2015 by mobilising global and local resources, raising awareness and, ultimately, as agents of change in our countries. We pledge to do all that we can to protect others and ourselves from the spread of HIV and substance abuse and to help work for an HIV/AIDS- and drugs-free new generation. We commit ourselves to establishing a permanent network of young leaders across Asia\u2013Pacific to provide a unified voice for our region's youth for development and peace. To follow up on the outcomes of this summit, we urge the United Nations, its agencies and other development partners to support the youth in their endeavours to become self-reliant, based on the principle of self-help. We welcome plans for similar movements in other regions\u2014which have been or will be launched across the globe in the form of Africa 2015, Arab States 2015, Europe and the CIS 2015, Latin America and the Caribbean 2015\u2014and stand ready to build coalitions with these initiatives. We call for continuously building consensus and fostering engagement in the dialogue with youth leaders of Asia\u2013Pacific to include other nations not present in the Pan-Asian Youth Leadership Summit. We urge our governments to include youth in their delegations to the General Assembly when it reviews the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, as well as the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth, at its 60th Session in 2005. This is the Declaration of the Pan-Asian Youth Leadership Summit adopted this day, 21 September 2004, World Peace Day in the Peace City of the world, Hiroshima. This city and its people have given us the inspiration to believe that the best can rise from the ravages of destruction and thus the hope that human poverty in our region can be overcome. We, the future leaders of Asia and the Pacific, pledge to turn our words into action for the betterment of our region and, to this end, wish to strongly urge the leaders of ASEAN, Pacific Island Forum States and SAARC to give us a chance to present our Vision for 2015 to them. We ask for their guidance and support in enabling the nations and peoples of Asia and the Pacific to achieve the MDGs by 2015. B. Cambodia UNCT and the MDGs Mr Douglas Gardner, UN Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative Mr Douglas Gardner gave an update on the collaboration between UNCT and the MDG Reporting Secretariat, the status of the CMDGs and involvement of UNCT, and the linkage between CMDGs and the Rectangular Strategy of RGC. UNCT has been proactive and has provided substantial support to RGC on implementing the MDGs in Cambodia through technical assistance on the MDGR and awareness campaigns. Stakeholders' consultations for the setting up of CMDGs with the overall targets and indicators have been organised with the assistance of UNCT as well. UNDP Cambodia and SIDA (Swedish International Development Agency) have provided financial support. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 38 Aside from this, UNCT has established an MDGs Advisory Committee for assisting the Secretariat-General of the Council for Social Development to organise stakeholders' consultations and to provide technical inputs on the assessment and localisation of the MDGs (checking overall targets and indicators as well as identifying the challenges in achieving the MDGs).

Mr Gardner said that the MDGs process in Cambodia is under the leadership of the government, and the concept of ownership has been highlighted through the localisation of the MDGs. RGC has also taken measures to prepare and disseminate CMDGs reports in a regular manner. Although the first report was prepared in 2001 by UNCT, the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals Report 2003 was prepared under the leadership of the Council for Social Development (CSD) and was launched by the Prime Minister in March 2004. The report articulates the country's situation, identifies major challenges, provides a diagnosis of major policies and programmes contributing to each CMDG, sets out frameworks for meeting the challenges, and indicates road maps for monitoring and evaluating performance. The country needs to go a long way to ensure adequate capacity in human resources, effective and efficient institutions, and good governance. For Cambodian citizens, CMDGs are also a commitment to human rights, democracy, peace and security, and good governance. RGC views the rule of law and good governance principles, such as transparency, predictability, accountability and participation, as essential prerequisites to sustainable socioeconomic development, social justice and poverty reduction. This process is constituted on the basis of assessing the global goals, indicators and targets in a Cambodian context; setting realistic indicators and targets appropriate for the Cambodian situation; organising national consultations with government institutions, donors, UN agencies, NGOs, international organizations and civil society; and setting up technical meetings with all stakeholders and national poverty forums (NPF). Because of consultations, RGC localised the MDGs and decided to add an extra MDG related to de-mining: Goal 9\u2014de-mining, UXO and victim assistance. The country plans to move towards zero impact from landmines and UXOs by 2012 and eliminate the negative humanitarian and socioeconomic impacts of landmines and UXOs by 2025. Mr Gardner pointed to the progress made on CMDGs related to HIV/AIDS and noted that this was done with active support from UNCT. In fact, Cambodia had been selected as one of the 10 target countries for the Millennium Project. Mr Gardner concluded his presentation by informing participants about the new strategy of RGC known as the Rectangular Strategy and the active role played by UNCT in the setting up 17 technical working groups, getting government donors and working on harmonisation. These 17 technical working groups will use CMDG indicators. This joint activity of all UN agencies on donor coordination to translate the Rectangular Strategy into action plans will create synergy and boost the chances of success in achieving CMDGs. The establishment of the Cambodia Poverty Management Information System (CPMIS), with 439 Cambodia Poverty and Development Monitoring Indicators (CPDMI), definitions and data sources, and the use of indicators to monitor the implementation of various programmes, CMDGs and other policies, is another good example of the close collaboration between UNCT members and RGC on the subjects related to the MDGs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 39 The following diagram designed by the Ministry of Planning shows the linkage between UNCT, donors and RGC on the processes related to CMDGs.

Erna Witoelar, UN Special Ambassador on MDGs H.E. Witoelar talked about the Millennium Campaign, highlighting its key objectives, alliances and strategies, adopting country-level as well as regional and local perspectives. Public awareness is necessary to increase motivation for action and to pressure decision-makers and hold them accountable, especially at the local level. The objective of the Millennium Campaign is to encourage, inspire and enable CSOs, parliamentarians, local authorities, media and youth\u2014 collectively known as target constituencies\u2014to use the MDGs to advocate pro-poor policies in developing countries and pro-development policies in OECD countries. The Millennium Campaign has the endorsement of the entire UN system and is hosted by UNDP. Working semi-independently, it reports directly to the UN Secretary-General. Started in early 2003, with a strong focus on Goal 8 in developed countries, it soon embarked on global campaigns on all the goals by the end of 2003, reaching constituencies beyond national governments. In the Millennium Campaign, each country would shape and drive its own campaign by mobilising the grass-roots level, creating public awareness and media processes, and implementing policy changes. At the regional and global levels, a common thread would be established to hold things together and joint symbolic actions would be timed synchronously. Several developed and developing countries have embarked on MDG campaigns. Examples of some campaigns are given below. MDG campaigns in developed countries: \u2022 Italy: The 'No Excuse 2015' campaign was launched in October 2003 with a peace march, which attracted over 100,000 marchers from Perugia to Assisi. \u2022 Spain: The 'Sin Excusas 2015' national campaign has taken off since its launch in May 2003 at the opening of the Barcelona Forum. \u2022 United States: A number of large development and humanitarian assistance groups in the US are launching the 'ONE Campaign' to fight poverty. MDG campaigns in developing countries: \u2022 Campaigns have been process oriented. \u2022 Countries started with global, regional and national consultations in December 2003, assessed the rationale for civil society engagement in MDGs campaigning, and agreed on a preliminary list of priority countries in each region. \u2022 A few organisations were identified as focal points to facilitate campaigning in each region and subregion: ActionAid Asia in Bangkok is the Asia regional focal point. The following criteria were used for choosing priority countries (in Asia: India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Philippines and Indonesia): countries where performance on the goals is weak; where success will provide greater leverage at the international and regional levels; where networks or campaigns already exist or could be established; and where the UN system is proactive. Although priority countries have been identified, Millennium Campaign services are reaching far beyond these countries because of today's advances in communications technology and combined outreach strategies for mass communication. For information, people can contact info.campaign@un.org. There is a website, where anyone, anywhere can find out more about the issues, the campaign, what they can do to promote the MDGs in their country and connect with other campaigners worldwide.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee5b7dc4-fc6c-4543-8081-7f10ca9f9609": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee5b7dc4-fc6c-4543-8081-7f10ca9f9609", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, October 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68c0dde7e0e4470e8acf75edb7e984ef20440f9e614d4550d194c569ed6d7798"}, "2": {"node_id": "b80d5ebb-6123-4ed8-90d8-d8049e907f38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "520323de827dd5e1dcb80765346823e210f6e597b7d7dbf676ec56af8c9ee69a"}}, "hash": "9c724bc4c1744bec1dc8864af9e5189fa852ab19773742d6a8bf14a83f46090f", "text": "Communication and -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 42 media partnerships have been developed with various outlets, including AllAfrica.com, BBC and OneWorld.net, to raise the media profile of the goals and stimulate debate at all levels.

Part of such a strategy would involve engaging the media to ensure that the MDGs are high on the public agenda. To help participants gain practical tips for engaging the media, an interactive session was held, led by the following panel of journalists in the region: Peter Starr, Independent Journalism Foundation; Richard Ehrlich, Asia Times; Michael Haze, Editor-in-Chief, Phnom Penh Post; Marwaan Macan-Markar, Asia Correspondent, Inter Press Services; and Deependra Jauchon, BBC World Service Trust. The session was moderated by Cherie Hart, UNDP Regional Communications Officer, Bangkok. The following tips were offered for engaging the media: \u2022 Build relationships with journalists through social interaction; issue simple information; train national journalists; help the media get access to useful information to support their stories;-think of 'hooks' (time-bound events, e.g. report launch, workshop); take journalists to visit your development projects, to see the successes on the ground. \u2022 Writing for the media: Keep it simple. Don't use jargon. When writing a press release, put across a maximum of two key points. Support these points with quotes, with facts and figures at the end. Keep the article length to one page. \u2022 The most important point (or 'lead' paragraph) is what is most interesting, appealing or shocking. This is not necessarily something you would write in an official report after attending a workshop but rather something you would tell your wife or husband after the workshop. \u2022 Put your MDG story within the context of news events in your country. See the bigger picture in which the MDG plan unfolds. \u2022 Use meaningful words to express the goals: In your country campaign, perhaps you do not have to use the word 'millennium'. This word does not reflect the work that is being attempted. It may come across as out of touch to some, i.e. it suggests something that happened four years ago at the turn of the century. \u2022 The job of a journalist: Largely, journalists do not care about the year 2015\u2014their job is about what is in the news today. How do we make sure that the MDGs, their progress and setbacks, are made palatable for publicity? The Financial Times supplement is a useful source of examples of articles that are of interest to journalists. \u2022 Conflict makes news! The UN often deals with a conflict of ideas. This can be news. \u2022 Media ownership of the MDGs: The real challenge is to foster a sense of ownership of the MDGs. Television is a hungry animal. It needs programming. There is a niche there. You could provide your national or local channel with interesting programmes, and chances are that they would lap it up! \u2022 Audiences: Keep in mind who your mass audience is. Who are you trying to address and persuade?

This session gave an opportunity to representatives to learn more about communications strategies and useful tools to support communications planning in order to raise awareness about the MDGs among targeted populations, taking into account the local environment and the level of the audience. The Blue Book: A Hands-On Approach to Advocating for the Millennium Development Goals is a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate strategic communications planning and implementation. The presenter told participants where they could read more on specific topics and cited particularly powerful examples of outreach programmes from countries around the world. National leaders, and not the UN, through the Millennium Declaration made the commitment to achieve the MDGs by 2015. Thus, it is crucial that this message is delivered clearly and adapted to the audience. UNDP's message on the MDGs is quite simple: the MDGs are achievable, and 2005 would be the breakthrough year. But this would only be possible if rich and poor countries alike follow through on their shared commitments to put in place the necessary policies, institutions and resources. This would require not only top-down or bottom-up action, but also everyone coming together to make it happen. An acceleration of outreach is required, which is why communications and advocacy are essential. UNDP and UNCTs are well placed to advocate and facilitate sustainable development solutions to achieve the MDGs. Moreover, through its close working relationship with national governments, UNCT, CSOs and, increasingly, the private sector, UNDP is well positioned to help organise and speed up the social changes necessary to achieve the MDGs. The MDGs are not business as usual. They are time-bound and measurable targets, accompanied by indicators for monitoring progress. They bring together many of the most important commitments made at global summits during the 1990s. And they bring together the responsibilities of both developing and developed countries. They cannot be achieved by working just from the top down or from the ground up. They require creative, coordinated and disciplined work from all directions. Communications, advocacy and strategic planning are all crucial elements when working on the MDGs, and these are closely connected with policy, research and programmatic work in support of the MDGs. A strategic communications plan is how an outreach campaign is formed and gets implemented. It assesses the communication resources and determines how the message can and should be distributed. It also sets time and performance goals to check progress, keeps open lines of communication and makes modifications or additions in message and communications strategy as campaign dynamics shift. Having a strategy that answers the questions 'Who, What, When, -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 45 Where, Why and How' is important. This approach is frequently used by partners to stay on plan, thus enabling them to deliver clear messages to audiences and stakeholders. A chronological sequence should be followed to set up a communications plan in order to maximise the level of reception. A plan begins with identifying goals and desired outcomes. Both long-term outcomes (such as the achievement of an MDG) and short-term outcomes (such as gaining political commitment or enacting a national law requiring all children to attend school until a certain age) should be considered. Partners need to identify the overarching goal and what they want to achieve with this strategic plan, preferably through small, achievable steps that build towards the overarching goal. For example, what might a coalition have wanted in its country leading up to the high-level event on the MDGs in September 2005? It is also important to determine a timeframe for the completion of the plan. Ms Tirana also highlighted the fundamental laws of communications on MDGs and defined the message as the overall driving force behind how people perceive the MDGs. The message of the plan is critical and should be based on specific goals, target audience, local context and desired outcome. It is not necessary to always refer to the MDGs in a long list, Goal 1 through Goal 8, which may not grab people's attention. Instead, talking about the goals in human terms, such as bringing up healthy, educated children, or focusing on an issue that matters most to a constituency may be better. Finally, in preparing strategic communications plans, it is important to assess the status, strengths and weaknesses of the Country Office (CO) and UNCT in each country as well as the social, political and economic trends that might influence progress towards the MDGs.

For example, if the target audience is an important minister, meetings with his/her top staff, placing opinion editorials in leading newspapers and television channels, and having a trusted adviser approach him/her, are all strategic means to get across the message. On the other hand, mass outreach through multiple visual and creative media is more appropriate to building general awareness among inhabitants of rural areas and small towns in a province. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 46 3.7 Session X: Regional initiatives: supporting the achievement of MDGs in Asia and the Pacific B. Murali, Programme Specialist, UNDP, RBAP The new Regional Programme on MDGs Initiatives has the capacity for country-level support in the following key areas: \u2022 action-plan implementation; \u2022 monitoring, advocacy and campaigning; \u2022 policy research and strategising; and \u2022 data and information. Funding for the MDGs must be a national effort, although catalytic support in marshalling advocacy and awareness and for policy-oriented research has potential to attract funds, including external funding, if governments reallocate national resources to critical areas of MDGs. The session explored the impact of support for policy research, which has a role in sensitising, creating awareness and building capacity of policy makers to carry the MDGs forward. By evaluating the impact of national economic and socioeconomic policies on poverty-reduction objectives, it seeks to promote policy reforms through dialogue and knowledge dissemination. UNSIAP implements the component of the MDGs Initiatives Programme designed to build and strengthen national statistical capacity to generate reliable data for in-depth analysis and monitoring progress of the MDGs. Country-level monitoring is an indispensable element in assessing progress towards the MDGs. This in turn mobilises resources to assist developing countries in meeting targets. UNSIAP works in close collaboration with other UN agencies, organisations and national institutions to build local capabilities and provide technical assistance. The Communications Unit at UNDGO in New York, where all MDG-related information and regular updates and bulletins can be accessed, serves as a base for information sharing. Additional knowledge networks would also be created. The second phase of the MDGs Regional Initiatives would be a joint undertaking by UNDP and UNESCAP to support the achievements of the MDGs in Asia and the Pacific. The second phase would have a strong focus on fostering partnerships among multilaterals, bilaterals, governments and civil societies and building a depository of technical inputs to facilitate cross comparisons of experience and lessons learnt among countries in the region. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 47 4.

The adoption of the Millennium Declaration was a defining moment for global cooperation\u2014it brought poverty eradication on to the global map through collective consent of international community. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) embody the multidimensionality of human development and are aimed at improving the lives of the poor and the disadvantaged. The MDGs are particularly significant in Asia and the Pacific due to the region's diversity. In this region, addressing income poverty does not necessarily result in successfully addressing issues of human poverty. Context Given the crosscutting nature of the MDGs, collaborative projects and partnerships have evolved to harness the synergy of convergence. Several initiatives in the region push the MDG agenda forward. These initiatives assumed greater urgency at the time of the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly (designated as the Millennium +5 Summit), in which the UN Secretary- General presented the MDG Progress Report. After the success of the first phase of the regional initiative on Supporting the Achievement of Millennium Development Goals, a follow-up phase was initiated in collaboration with UNESCAP. The Regional MDG Report launched in 2003 was a key output of this partnership and was followed by a second Regional MDG Report in 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d1e34db-ee4b-41c7-ad6b-55dd6ef647cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d1e34db-ee4b-41c7-ad6b-55dd6ef647cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, October 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5468971659fcc87d4d0f57f1a4fb086735ef94f55a02b56b59ad83ec44c61973"}, "2": {"node_id": "60bcc13e-fdeb-446c-b353-85ff6b448824", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72164e5eea459d0a3c5ceefd0c7ddbe0b1e103e0b0aa3711bedc867e5fadb2a5"}}, "hash": "251862a2bd648aa917dd47e0d77c7ff02bf3fb1e9654e0403bd9c469dbcb66b6", "text": "Nine countries in the region launched MDG Reports in 2003, and the rest followed soon after.

I wish to express my most sincere apologies for not being able to be with you in person today at this Regional Workshop on the MDGs in Asia and the Pacific region as I have been asked to attend a meeting on Donor Coordination for Darfur, Sudan. Also, my staff in DGO could not represent me because of other commitments. I am grateful to UNDP for conveying this message to you. Please know that in spirit I am with you today. We in the United Nations Development Group Office (UNDGO) are honoured to be associated with this event. I commend UNDP, in collaboration with ADB, for again taking the initiative to organise this workshop at a time deemed to be critical for all of us. As you well know, next year the General Assembly of the United Nations, in a special session, will commemorate the adoption of the historic Millennium Declaration in September 2000 and will review global progress made so far towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals in 2015. In many ways, 2005 will be a make-or-break year for the MDGs, because the year and time that we know whether or not we are going to meet the MDGs is not 2015, but 2005. As such, this regional initiative provides you, i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40005a0d-d785-4fee-96ea-7fd0f0adff33": {"__data__": {"id_": "40005a0d-d785-4fee-96ea-7fd0f0adff33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, October 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "160458f481371ac43aeabe1605c08d505da96a9602f95847beebb772d41773e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac9929c7-6c89-497e-a064-d27cf37f51a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fff9dace48f05f1817e1d744da009a1c4ef71e4eee2e781f1ee2611c018dbe34"}}, "hash": "6f32ca96848c8312fdf979631e24bf0fd5f27012f42d000e53ec7f6a4b7a2c23", "text": "As such, this regional initiative provides you, i.e. national governments and the international community working in this region, the opportunity to not only recommit to the pledges that have already been made, but also to take stock of what has already been achieved and the actions required to turn those promises into concrete actions that will improve people's lives. Why are the MDGs so important for the UN in general and the UN Development Group (UNDG) in particular? Very simple. For the first time ever, UN agencies were given an overarching set of interlinked goals, in which each of the agencies has a unique role to play in assisting countries in their pursuit of the goals. It provided us with a clear rationale for working together closely and effectively, the same rationale that lay behind the creation of UNDG by the Secretary-General in 1997.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "886d5677-181d-4985-944d-fcd3d925249a": {"__data__": {"id_": "886d5677-181d-4985-944d-fcd3d925249a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, October 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a8c764d6579e0affd14270b26aaa3a776f65b52f14410e1697ae00e7b47e977"}}, "hash": "5a8c764d6579e0affd14270b26aaa3a776f65b52f14410e1697ae00e7b47e977", "text": "But the MDGs also brought clarity to the shared and individual roles and responsibilities of other key parties: first and foremost, of Governments to achieve or enable the achievement of goals and targets; of the network of international organisations to marshal their resources and expertise in the most strategic and efficient way possible to support and sustain the efforts of partners at global and country levels; of citizens, CSOs and the private sector to engage fully in this groundbreaking effort by bringing to bear their unique strengths for motivation, mobilisation and action. UNDG didn't waste time in coming up with its own strategy for dealing with the MDGs and how best to support Governments in their MDG efforts and to help create a conducive environment for fostering effective partnerships at the local, regional and global levels between the various stakeholders involved. As you well know, UNDG core strategy on the MDGs, which was adopted in 2002, was grounded in a set of principles that are still very valid, namely, that the MDGs have to be situated within the broader norms and standards of the Millennium Declaration; that all eight MDGs and their 18 targets are equally important; that broad national ownership and -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 59 participation will be pivotal; that partnership, with Governments but also with CSOs and the private sector, will be essential; that the potential of UN has to be mobilised fully; and that a focus on the MDGs neither diminishes nor precludes the important work of the UN System in other mandated areas. The core strategy contains four interlinked elements: monitoring and tracking of progress; the analysis of the policy dimensions of achieving the MDGs; campaigning, partnership building and community mobilisation; and goal-driven operational assistance. How far have we come in all four areas? It would take too much of your time to delve into all the issues, but some notable progress has been made, and I would like to highlight some of them. On the issue of monitoring and tracking of progress, 80 national MDG reports have been issued, following the issuance of the UNDG guidance note on the MDGRs, and more are under preparation. The plan is for each developing country to have at least one report by the end of 2004. Donor countries are also being encouraged to prepare reports that analyse their contributions to Goal 8. Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden have already done so, and more have indicated that they will follow soon. This is all very encouraging. Equally encouraging is the fact that DevInfo, UN's software for tracking the MDGs, is being rolled-out. Nicolas Pron will give you an update on that later in this workshop. With regard to goal-driven operational assistance by UN agencies, a number of reforms have been introduced to improve UN coordination, effectiveness and efficiency in supporting national goals and to reduce the transaction costs for government. Within this context, UNDG has been moving forward in key areas to help meet the MDGs, and you will have a panel session tomorrow on the integration of the MDGs into our common analytical and planning tools. I would just like to highlight that UNDG now has a common country programming progress, with the MDGs or localised MDGs at the core of UN programming at the country level. Progress has also been made in providing guidance and training to country teams, encouraging learning and sharing experience, and establishing quality assurance and support mechanisms at country, regional and global levels for the common programming process. However, while significant progress has been made, more must be done. We have not yet managed to provide coherent and strategic support to UNCTs on achieving or operationalising the MDGs. We are still not satisfied with the integration of MDGs into CCAs, UNDAFs and country programmes, nor has there been sufficient MDG-focused support to the national poverty- reduction processes. National ownership of the MDGs could certainly be further improved. All members of UNCT and their headquarters must be able to feel full ownership and to produce strategic alignment behind a country's MDG-based development strategy by utilising programming, personnel, performance and accountability, and oversight to measure, shape and drive country-team performance. We need more UN agencies to align their resources behind the MDGs. Also, we need to further improve the mix of skills, expertise and services that the UN System can mobilise to support countries in implementing coherent, sustainable and inclusive development strategies to achieve the MDGs.

It challenges UN to not only showcase achievements but also to identify the further measures and conditions that have to be in place to maximise operational results. It provides an occasion to pull together various strands of the current debate on the functioning and financing of development cooperation. And it offers a particularly timely opportunity to engage governments and civil society in the search for ways to maximise the contribution of operational activities and national plans to overall progress in achieving the MDGs.

I also would like to take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to all our distinguished guests for their kind presence at this important workshop. Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: I consider this occasion as another milestone in our regional commitment and our national efforts towards reducing poverty and eliminating the worst forms of human deprivation. As we all know, the adoption of the Millennium Declaration at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 was a defining moment for global cooperation, which brought the poverty-eradication agenda on top through a collective consent for international cooperation. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) embody the multidimensionality of human development and are aimed at improving the lives of the poor and the disadvantaged. The MDGs have a special significance in our region due to its sheer diversity. In fact, the situation in the Asia-Pacific region negates the view that addressing income poverty alone will successfully address the intricate issues of human poverty. Since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration, which affirmed specific targets and goals for poverty reduction, the countries of the Asia-Pacific region have made significant progress. We can be proud of a number of success stories in different areas of human and social development. In many areas, however, our progress has been mixed and uneven. For example, we have yet to go a long way in areas where progress has been slow, such as child malnutrition, education, gender equality, infant and maternal mortalities, HIV/AIDS and environmental sustainability. In order to achieve the MDG agenda by 2015, nine countries in the region have already launched their MDG Reports. The rest are in the process of preparing their reports and 21 countries are likely to complete their reports by the end of 2004. The available evidence, however, points out that the gap between the developed countries and the developing countries, particularly the LDCs, is widening. Among other reasons, this is due to the growing debt burden, lack of human resources, and limited access to new technologies. These are difficult challenges for which we need to create strong domestic foundations of our national economies along with beneficial external linkages through trade, investment and financial cooperation. This will provide a solid base for a balanced development of the region. The key objectives of the Regional Workshop today revolve around issues that are very important for developing effective coalitions in support of the MDGs and accelerating our national efforts towards improving and executing the MDG-centred activities. The workshop will share experiences; will provide updates on global, regional and 2005 Millennium +5 issues; review action plans that countries have prepared and are implementing; review MDG Reports and linkages to policy planning and resource allocations; and focus on activities to build MDG-related -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 63 capacity at the national level. The results will be reported to the UN Secretary-General at the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly, designed as the Millennium Summit +5, in 2005. Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: The Royal Government of Cambodia is fully committed to the MDGs, and we have consciously decided to measure our national development performance against the MDGs. We have localised the global MDGs, and these are called Cambodia MDGs (CMDGs). The Third Legislature of the National Assembly, which is the political platform of the Royal Government and constitutes our common national vision, has identified four issues that will be at the forefront of the Government's political agenda. To realise the political platform, the Rectangular Strategy has been adopted, which builds on the achievements of the Triangular Strategy of the Second Legislature of the National Assembly. The comprehensive agenda under the strategy aims at improving and building the capacity of public institutions, strengthening good governance, and modernising the economic infrastructure. All these are crucial to achieving the CMDGs and promoting sustainable development in Cambodia. Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: In the present era of globalisation, we are rapidly moving towards a world where economic and social linkages among the countries are becoming stronger and deeper. This has been more so in the Asia-Pacific region, where rapid growth has brought about significant changes in the economic and social life of the population. As a result, the impacts of developments in one country, whether positive or negative, are being felt more strongly in other countries. Such linkages will grow in the future. In a world that is becoming more interdependent, our collective efforts will be the key to ensuring the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e73b3d5-4458-490a-8968-3666a90de2ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e73b3d5-4458-490a-8968-3666a90de2ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Workshop Report: Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific, October 2004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5c13676e3887c022298484de27c480404d541fc38c51f3b4ad8ad475c2fba83"}, "3": {"node_id": "03a9ae86-14ea-4380-92bf-c7af666fba29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-workshop-report-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific-october-2004", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1871331ed30993bcc90a139f48a41ef9bad834a9f9c65a7c9cdb34d96f1481f6"}}, "hash": "68f0c0eb49142b020497500a1f044d3cb61963682e025dd7fdd698bfd2389e45", "text": "sustained growth and stability of the region. This calls for a closer understanding of the challenges, better learning from each other's experiences, and opening up new channels of mutual learning to ensure more effective management of policies and programmes for achieving the MDGs. The present workshop is a very timely move in that direction. This workshop provides us a great opportunity to raise issues and challenges posed by globalisation in the pursuit of our common goals. The report and the recommendations of the Regional Workshop will be very important for the Secretary-General of the United Nations to ensure strong commitments and required global actions towards achieving the MDGs in the Asia-Pacific region. In this respect, I strongly feel that our focus should be more on concrete actions on how to accelerate our journey towards our cherished goals. I also believe that a close collaboration among the countries of the region will pave the way not only for the replication of successful experiences but will also lead to the culmination of new ideas and policies suited to our own culture and tradition. Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: We, the countries in the Asia-Pacific region, have made considerable progress towards the MDGs. However, our achievements must not make us complacent about the challenges that lie ahead. We still have uphill battles to fight in which our common wisdom can be very effective tools. Let me once again take this opportunity to thank UNDP, UNDGO and ADB for organising this Regional Workshop on the MDGs in Asia-Pacific in Cambodia. I also thank the development partners and donors for their support and continued assistance for Cambodia's development. I am grateful to the delegates from the countries of the Asia-Pacific region and others for their attendance and contributions in making the workshop a success.

The Media Panel was a value-added item. The interactive session provided us with an interesting outside perspective of things\u2014a clear mirror, a bitter (non-sugar-coated) pill. I certainly learnt how not to handle our communications. I do hope that this provides all of us food for thought on how to communicate the MDGs to the masses. MDG should become a household buzzword\u2014just like WMD has now become. 8. I do hope that the workshop provided opportunities to share not just experiences but also to make contacts and friends from other countries, and to let down your hair for a bit. 9. All the presentations and the following discussions provided useful inputs for preparing CAPs. 10. Although what happened during the workshop is important, what is more important is what happens afterwards. 11. The expectation we have is that the country teams will be able to return and finalise their Action Plans and go on to carry out the activities proposed. 12. I hope you will go away from this workshop fully energised to take forward the work towards achieving the MDGs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional MDGs Workshop: Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1\u20133 October 2004 HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 67 Thanks to all the participants for their lively participation and specific contributions\u2014that is the true jam on the basic bread and butter that we can provide. A thank you to Douglas Gardner, UNRC, and the Cambodia Country Team not only for hosting the event but also for providing excellent background support without which the sessions would not have proceeded so smoothly. A thank you also to our hosts for making the after-session time memorable with cultural programmes and, I am sure, what will be a very memorable trip to Angkor Wat. A big thank you to H.E., the Senior Minister of Planning, the Royal Government of Cambodia, for his participation and support. And a very, very special thank you to Prof Aung Tun Thet for coming all the way from Turin to facilitate the workshop.

Their active and sustained participation has bolstered a \u2018Pacific Perspective\u2019 which will continue to guide this flagship report for UNDP. 3 Introduction The Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Report (RHDR) on Gender is slated to be the third in a regular series, produced by the Human Development Report Unit, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo. The first was the 2006 Report, titled Trade on Human Terms: Transforming Trade for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific and the second was Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives: Accelerating Human Development in Asia and the Pacific. Human Development Reports are a policy-advocacy resource and an instrument to explore critical issues from a human development perspective. There is a fundamental difference between a technical analysis of an issue and an exploration using the human development lens; this is the value-added of an HDR. Because human development subsumes and goes beyond the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), HDRs can potentially push policies toward an \u2018MDG- plus\u2019 agenda. Stakeholder consultations are a major part of the participatory process of producing an RHDR; a report \u201cfor and by the people of Asia Pacific.\u201d Extensive brainstorming sessions on broad thematic issues bring together diverse Asia Pacific stakeholders from different levels of society to interact with each other to shape the substantive contours of the Report. The objectives of the stakeholder consultations are two-fold: to be informed by views, experiences and priorities of countries in the region, while strengthening cross-country networks, and to obtain buy-in for the RHDR from stakeholders. The Pacific consultation was the second of two sub-regional workshops for the forthcoming gender RHDR which preceded the Asia Consultation held on April 14-15th in Langkawi, Malaysia. More specifically, the objectives of the Pacific stakeholder consultation were to: \u2022 Introduce stakeholders to the Asia-Pacific HDRs and the theme of \u2018gender\u2019 for the Report with the overall focus of \u2018overcoming unequal power and voice\u2019 \u2022 Share an overall view of gender trends in the Pacific and across its different sub-regions / countries \u2022 Discuss a \u2018Pacific perspective\u2019 for understanding gender, gender differences, and the causes and consequences of inequality along with methods to examine and measure gender gaps \u2022 Take account of stakeholder priorities in identifying and sharpening six suggested sub- themes: gender and justice systems (laws and law makers), investing in gender equality (economic benefits), gender energy and environment (women have been adapting, but how does adaptation affect choices for men and women), gender-based violence (underlining unequal power), gender and crisis (male-female differences in impact) and gender migration and mobility (given the unprecedented surge in recent female mobility) that are cognizant of the concerns in the Pacific \u2022 Provide a platform for stakeholders to share experiences, highlight priorities and solutions that affect people\u2019s lives and to analyze whether and why gender inequality may be more prevalent in some countries or sectors rather than others \u2022 Explore emerging thematic issues from various perspectives with a focus on solutions and derive broad messages to guide and inform (in a two-way feedback process) research \u2022 Promote buy-in for the RHDR and thus strengthen its policy advocacy potential . . . . . . .. . .

The report must deal with values, norms, socialization processes, stigma, economic activity, opportunity, access, etc. from both sides of the gender equation. It will also need to focus strongly on rights-based approaches and give emphasis to both the duty-bearers and the right -holders. Turning to the distinct challenges confronting the Pacific in battling gender inequality, Mr. Dictus noted the following issues: The first is the gender aspects of the fight to reduce HIV and AIDS and the second is the gender dimensions of Disaster Risk Management and Adaptation to Climate Change. Power differences, deeply rooted in prevailing social norms, constrict women\u2019s socio- economic opportunities and are at the core of heightened HIV vulnerability of women and girls (related to unequal access to resources and information, unequal decision making power, including that in sexual relationships). It was seen as essential to implement HIV interventions that integrate gender and address specific female, male, boys, girls and transgender vulnerabilities. A possible approach would be to make better use of the human rights frameworks now gaining momentum in the Pacific with CEDAW implementation. The vulnerability of the Pacific to natural hazards and climate change is well known. However, it is important to recognize that the impact of such events is likely to be different for men and women. Better understanding is needed of how livelihoods are conducted and sustained by men and women. Understanding also needs to be deepened of the roles men and women play in communities, which influences their participation in natural resource management. The RHDR and Objectives of the Consultation - Anuradha Rajivan, Regional Programme Coordinator, Human Development Report Unit, RCC/UNDP 5 Ms. Rajivan presented the objectives of the consultation, the linkages between gender and human development; the status of the work of the Human development Report Unit (HDRU) on the gender report; issues to be focused on for the Report. She also presented statistics on gender (in)equality in the Pacific and brought out the tenuous balance between political sensitivity and credibility, while sharing some possible messages for the Report and the next steps. The objectives of the consultation were: 1. Introduce the Asia-Pacific HDRs and the theme of \u2018gender\u2019 for this RHDR 2. Overall trends in gender differences in the region and measure gaps \u2022 Discuss innovative and proxy measures \u2022 Focus more sharply on the lives of the disadvantaged sections, the poor 3. Improve the understanding of gender gaps by \u2022 Exploring underlying causes for inequities \u2022 Mapping factors that inhibit equality \u2022 Identifying consequences of inequalities \u2022 Reflecting Pacific perspectives in the work 4. Provide a platform to \u2022 Share experiences and ideas to promote equity \u2022 Analyze why gender inequality may be more prevalent in some countries / sectors over others, providing clues for solutions \u2022 Identify good practices \u2022 Highlight priorities and possible solutions to improve people\u2019s lives Introducing the overall framework of \u2018unequal power and voice\u2019, the speaker presented the six sub-themes that emerged from earlier consultations for consideration. These were: 1. Political power: gender in justice systems \u2013 laws, lawmakers, traditional and introduced - on the books and on the street 2. Economic power: investing in gender equity \u2013 context of inclusive growth and globalisation 3. Gender in crisis: breakdown in social relations 4. Gender, energy and environment: adapting to climate change, securing livelihoods 5. Gender, mobility and migration 6. Gender-based violence: beyond domestic violence Anu Rajivan presented the audience with feedback from the Asia Stakeholder Consultation (held in Langkawi, Malaysia from 14-15 April, 2008), which prioritized political and economic power as the top two sub-themes the Report should address with gender-based violence as a cross-cutting theme. The two big messages from the Asia Consultation came from issues related to mindsets (It\u2019s \u2018our\u2019 issue, not \u2018her\u2019 issue) and policy (Commitment is revealed by money and laws).

Political will on these and other gender issues was seen as a barrier to progressive action. \u2022 Moving forward, Fiji needs to improve its communication paths to disseminate good practices and replicate and scale them up nationally. Particularly, within each good practice, there is a need to highlight the linkages between the macro and micro, as well as different levels of agency. \u2013 Pasifika Women with Disabilities Network \u2022 People, especially women with disabilities, experience a disproportionate level of discrimination and violence throughout Fiji and many other countries in the Pacific. There is also a higher level of in-family abuse. Girls with disabilities have special needs compared to boys. \u2022 There is less access to education by women with disabilities compared to men. This leads to a cycle of poverty and discrimination against these women. \u2022 A greater degree of awareness of the issues facing women with disabilities is needed, especially from non-governmental organizations that are not exclusively mandated to work on these issues. - Pacific Foundation for the Advancement of Women \u2022 Feminization of poverty clearly illustrates that poverty and gender inequality should not be dealt with separately; they part of the same problem \u2022 There was seen to be a lack of Government capacity in Fiji and other Pacific Island Countries to understand, identify and develop programmes aimed at reducing gender inequality. - Fiji National Council of Women \u2022 There was a stated need to address gender inequality in adolescents and the different power dynamics of this group as opposed to adults. \u2022 Finding the right word for gender among indigenous peoples in Fiji itself is a challenge. This highlights the language/communication barrier for this group. The collective power of peer-to-peer communication amongst indigenous groups was * These are the personal views of stakeholders and do not necessarily reflect those of governments in the region 7 put forward as a potential strategy to address gender issues due to the fact that it is easier for them to relate to each other rather than outsiders. Overall, in terms of closing the gender gap, indigenous groups should be prioritized as they were stated to be further behind than mainstream groups. TONGA \u2022 Gender equality was seen as a secondary concern in Tonga by the majority of decision- makers and even by women themselves due to the traditional notion that all women hold a very elevated status in the Tongan society. \u2022 The major challenge for women\u2019s empowerment in the country was seen to be economic independence and control. In particular, resource constraints and legal barriers to women\u2019s inheritance, especially in land (women can only lease land not inherit), is an issue which needs immediate action. \u2022 Although there is only one woman parliamentarian in the country, the upcoming elections have the highest number of women candidates ever recorded. NIUE \u2022 Issues of gender inequality are similar to other small island developing states. In Niue, the Government is focusing strongly on the human resource sector to help close the gap. \u2022 New immigrants to the country are seen as posing a problem: they have introduced conflicting ideas and values into Niuean society. \u2022 In terms of political participation, there is only one woman cabinet minister in the country so that number could be increased along with wider female participation in the local level decision making bodies. SAMOA \u2022 There is a prevailing mindset in the country that gender inequality does not exist and it is not a problem. Hence, dealing with the more subtle aspects of gender inequality is a big issue. For example, legislative equality is reasonable, female representation in higher levels of the Government is quite good, and the matai system technically allows for women to be chosen as matais. These are often presented as reasons that gender inequality does not exist. However, there are many indicators of gender inequality. For example , domestic violence levels are high and parliamentary representation is low. The suggestion that gender inequality is a problem can often be seen as an attack on culture.. \u2022 There is a challenge of addressing men. Gender is about men and women, girls and boys. Because traditionally it tends to be women who are the more disadvantaged, many projects target women specifically. How do we convince men that gender is really about them too? \u2022 Relying on evidence and data, which often doesn\u2019t exist or is hard to access to show that gender inequality really is an issue presents challenges. Within this, if the efficiency argument is used, it would be important to show the specific positive", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2c4b2bf-3e6c-486a-91b8-2b43baa5b0a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2c4b2bf-3e6c-486a-91b8-2b43baa5b0a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "061e03da9a3a3a18c1da40dca5d730cb5bdedcdbf9f20422503b3ce9da8f284d"}}, "hash": "061e03da9a3a3a18c1da40dca5d730cb5bdedcdbf9f20422503b3ce9da8f284d", "text": "benefits of engaging with both women and men. Engaging with men and boys is fundamental. \u2022 It is also important to consider the rural-urban divide in relation to gender inequality. Government, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and other machineries are usually located in urban areas and as such can focus much . . . . . . .. . . more on urban considerations, while issues in rural areas can often be quite different. COOK ISLANDS \u2022 Cook Islands is a party to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) through New Zealand. New Zealand signed the Convention on 17 July 1980 and ratified on 10 January 1985. On 11 August 2006, the Cook Islands acceded to the Convention in its own right. \u2022 The two main concerns about gender inequality were stated to be the under- representation of women at all decision-making levels and domestic violence with cultural practices, perceived or otherwise, being a central issue throughout. In terms of the former, there is only one woman Minister and two Members of Parliament and a lack of female representation at all levels of the bureaucracy, including the community level. In terms of domestic violence, the two major challenges are lack of political will and lack of capacity on the ground to address the issue. There needs to be stronger legislation on the books as well as greater resources delegated to training and awareness-raising. \u2022 Suggested strategies to address gender inequality include: o Gender Impact Statements \u2013cabinet submissions should include gender analysis. o Gender-relevant statistics need to be collected and must be centralized for easy access and transparency. o A closer working relationship and cooperation between Government, NGOs and development partners is needed to advance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. o There needs to be a sustained commitment by Government to tackle gender inequality with concrete targets and timetables, stronger and more diverse mechanisms for effective tracking and monitoring of financial resources spent on gender equality; sufficient allocation of resources at all levels for real progress in implementing national policies; and regional action plans and international conventions with particular emphasis on reaching women in rural areas. TUVALU \u2022 The Government of Tuvalu has prioritized gender equality in all of its development undertaking through its Department of Women under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The inclusion of women and gender issues in the National Strategic Plan \u201cTe Kakeega II\u201d provides an opportunity to pursue gender issues at the national level; however, the biggest challenge was seen to be resource constraints and lack of capacity. \u2022 Tuvalu boasts gender parity at the secondary education level. In addition, an average of about 45 percent of all overseas tertiary scholarships since 1991 have gone to women. There is also an increase in the number of women who hold mid and senior level positions in civil service posts. \u2022 Challenges which Tuvalu needs to address in the fight against gender inequality: lack of women in decision making at the community level, outdated laws which contribute to gender based discrimination. In addition, it is essential to have leadership training for women and spread awareness on gender inequality to help change the notion that it does not exist. 9 KIRIBAS \u2022 The idea of \u2018gender\u2019 is seen as a new phenomenon and cannot be easily articulated by the population of Kiribas. Traditional values and norms make it difficult to deal with gender issues as it is either seen as \u2018invisible\u2019 or an affront to culture. These challenges are particularly acute in rural areas. \u2022 The country has recently ratified CEDAW and is working on implementing the provisions of the Convention at all levels. NAURU \u2022 Although Nauru has a population of more women than men, attitude and a lack of education is a major problem to reducing gender inequalities. Gender is largely viewed as a domestic problem, in which the State or other outside entities should not interfere. \u2022 Men in the country feel threatened by the idea of gender equality; they feel that gender equality is only about women surpassing them. \u2022 Nauru has not ratified CEDAW and needs the assistance of organizations such as UNIFEM and the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT) to do so. \u2022 The top priority for the country is women\u2019s health and education. It was proposed that mentoring and data collection programmes could bolster these and other efforts to bring about positive change for women. MARSHALL ISLANDS \u2022 An interesting difference between Marshall Islands and other Pacific Islands Countries is that women have traditional authority over land, which is inherited and owned through the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6d92ed3-c4d1-4be9-a755-dd41481ec37b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6d92ed3-c4d1-4be9-a755-dd41481ec37b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1bfe334b9b12d494bb1f255e7f69392869143dd9f42e92d40a8c9a592db81afa"}}, "hash": "1bfe334b9b12d494bb1f255e7f69392869143dd9f42e92d40a8c9a592db81afa", "text": "mother of the household. In contrast, the culture of the country is such that women are not encouraged to speak or be present in front of men while male relatives are often asked to act as a proxy for the women of their household, a situation which often leads to men taking the advantage. Even so, gender inequality is translated in the local context as women over-taking men. \u2022 The US is giving a substantial amount of compensation for development assistance; however, these resources are not distributed equally amongst men and women, often in favour of men. \u2022 There is a need to further gender sensitize political leaders. Gender sensitive budgeting was attempted in the past but was unsuccessful so there was a need to rework the methodology. Although there were an increasing number of women taking office at the local level, there is a complementary need to combine this with women at higher levels of decision-making. At the household level, there is also a need to educate the extended family as well as immediate family, such as mothers-in-law and other members. SOLOMON ISLANDS \u2022 The prevailing mindset in the Solomon Islands is that gender equality is the sole business of women. This prevents gender, and women\u2019s voices, in particular, from being mainstreamed in much of the country\u2019s development planning and policies. Balancing culture and gender equality is key to the success of any initiative aimed at women\u2019s empowerment. . . . . . . .. . . \u2022 Poverty and gender inequality go hand in hand and are related in a vicious cycle. This is played out through lack of land ownership and inheritance, as well as lack of access to credit and support for income generating activities. \u2022 As a unique step in the sub-region, the country has ratified CEDAW without reservation. Work is currently on it\u2019s the country\u2019s first reporting exercise. \u2022 Addressing human rights and gender equality through a religious (in this case Bibilical) perspective is an excellent strategy. For example, explaining to people that the Ten Commandments are essentially about human and women\u2019s rights has improved understanding of the issue greatly. Interactive Discussion \u2022 Skills training for women has largely been ignored and this is important for their economic empowerment. Skills training thus far has mainly been focused on \u2018soft skills\u2019 and not on \u2018hard\u2019 or technical skills, which are seen as the domain of men and often generate more income. The movement of labour , in particular skilled labour is also an important area of focus for programmes seeking to fight gender inequality. \u2022 A lot of good work and progress on gender equality has been done throughout the Pacific and this should be acknowledged. The issue is of coordinating partnerships and collaborations to minimize overlapping initiatives is an important one. \u2022 Is culture static or fluid? One should not generalize about \u2018Pacific culture\u2019 but define what exactly it is. When cultural differences are given as an excuse for gender discrimination or even violence, is it real or perceived? Who has the power to define what culture is and isn\u2019t? \u2022 The younger generation needs to be included in the gender and development discourse. They are not clear what gender equality means and how it can affect them. Summary by Chair The Chair thanked the national stakeholders for their frank and open contributions to the consultation. He noted that many governments in the region see gender as a \u2018foreign issue\u2019 or a \u2018women\u2019s issue.\u2019 So changing this mindset was a common theme from the presentations. Apparently, some men seem to think that gender equality would make them \u201close out\u201d and become inferior to women; this is not true. Although culture or traditional/faith-based practices were often given as a reason for gender realities in the Pacific, the Chair noted that every culture has its own set of normative constructs and social mores; the Pacific is no different in that regard and could tap into knowledge of success stories from outside the sub-region. Following this point, the issue of real and perceived cultural barriers was seen as an important point in advancing the debate. Who gets to define what \u2018culture\u2019 is and isn\u2019t? Culture is dynamic and constantly changing; this idea is fundamental to understanding real or perceived cultural barriers to gender equality. 11 SYNTHESIS OF COUNTRY PRESENTATIONS Ongoing Measures \u2022 Many countries throughout the region have signed or ratified CEDAW \u2022 Several countries in the Pacific have departments and/or ministries exclusively dedicated to gender and/or women\u2019s empowerment \u2022 Most countries have civil society organizations actively working to enhance gender equality in their countries", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2055cc4b-f6c3-4020-b0af-94a02a60d32f": {"__data__": {"id_": "2055cc4b-f6c3-4020-b0af-94a02a60d32f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "013ee3aa411beac122afb4380e71f0991dc0128bf850ac70b17f69301e24738a"}, "3": {"node_id": "3f74aaaf-5ee7-45b6-a78d-0e759a221b37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe4668a768368b6abfe1af1f11b11bbf506093b41a7fff0c3ddfb91daecec64d"}}, "hash": "54e73d7ede8e68075635d0481f5794585c450d464dd6310a4b96e6c0f0d7b109", "text": "and/or regionally Positive Examples \u2022 Many countries throughout the region have established safe houses and other support centres for victims of gender- based violence \u2022 Several countries have women involved in government either at the Parliamentary and/or Ministerial levels \u2022 In numerous countries throughout the Pacific, women hold a traditional high place in society Issues and Challenges \u2022 Gender is seen as a \u2018new or women\u2019s issue\u2019 with little reference or understanding of what it means \u2022 Changing mindsets to facilitate and sustain gender inequality is a big challenge \u2022 Addressing culture and traditional practices is a priority for change \u2022 Political will is often not present to carry out gender sensitive policies and reforms \u2022 Lack of capacity, both technically and in terms of resources for gender programmes, is a substantial challenge for many countries \u2022 The paucity of data throughout most Pacific Island countries makes measuring and reporting on gender a challenge \u2022 Women are often not represented in all levels of decision making, particularly at high levels \u2022 Extensive gender-based violence throughout the region, particularly in the household and during conflict/crisis situations is a serious problem in many countries \u2022 Implementation of laws which focus on gender equality, particularly those dealing with land and inheritance rights for women \u2022 Greater attention should be given to sexual minorities as these groups often have high levels of violence, discrimination and poverty \u2022 The issue of male agency and involvement in initiatives promoting gender equality needs to be strengthened \u2022 Young women and women with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to gender discrimination and violence \u2022 Religious and faith-based institutions need to be more integrally involved in efforts to alleviate gender inequality . . . . . . .. . . Networking Break: 10:45 \u2013 11:00 Session II: Pacific Perspectives 11:00 - 13:00 Chair: Garry Wiseman, Manager, UNDP Pacific Centre The second session for the day involved a panel discussion of experts from the Pacific to discuss \u2018Pacific Perspectives\u2019 on: gender and justice systems (including political participation), investing in gender equality, gender based violence and gender in crisis. Membership of the Panel, in speaking order, consisted of: Ms. Imrana Jalal (RRRT), Dr. Henry Ivarature and Ms. Joanne Kunatuba (PIFS), Ms Michelle Reddy (FWRM), Ms Ana Laqeretabua (UNIFEM), Ms. Sharon Bhagwan- Rolls (Fem\u2019LINK), Ms. Rose Atu (PNG Family Violence Sexual Action Committee) and Dr Wame Baravilala (UNFPA). Ms. Imrana Jalal (RRRT) presented on gender justice in Pacific Island Countries and outlined the major entry points: \u2022 Legislation (including criminal law, civil law and family law) \u2022 Courts (common law) \u2022 Judicial and legal policies \u2022 Practices (of officials of the justice system, including the police) \u2022 Legal aid to support women (critical for the poor; the only country with this facility in the sub region is Fiji) \u2022 Human rights mechanisms \u2022 Ratification of international human rights Conventions along with enforceability provided through the reporting process \u2022 Customary law systems in many countries (especially in Melanesia; these tend to be \u2018glamorized\u2019 and have a disproportional effect on women, for example witchcraft in PNG) Each of the above issues demanded different strategies for change. For example, to change legislation requires campaigning, lobbying and working with members of parliament because it involves changing the substance of the law. To change the women\u2019s status in the courts by getting new legal precedents would require training of judicial officials and lawyers to change attitudes and mindsets. In order to change policies and practices on the ground, it requires negotiating with the courts and judicial officials to bring about a mutually beneficial outcome. Lastly, how women are treated in the justice system reflects the societal status of women in a given country. If women\u2019s status is comparatively low in society, this will be reflected in the justice system with notable but rare exceptions. The status of women in society and the justice system is no different in the Pacific than in the rest of Asia, except that systems in the Pacific might appear to allow for a slightly faster pace of change if there is political will and women\u2019s NGOs are able to effectively mobilize (the last point was seen to be extremely crucial for success). The economies of scale, the sophistication of the women\u2019s movements and the funding/technical support received determine the degree of mobilization (this was demonstrated in the Cook Islands and Fiji).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f74aaaf-5ee7-45b6-a78d-0e759a221b37": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f74aaaf-5ee7-45b6-a78d-0e759a221b37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "013ee3aa411beac122afb4380e71f0991dc0128bf850ac70b17f69301e24738a"}, "2": {"node_id": "2055cc4b-f6c3-4020-b0af-94a02a60d32f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54e73d7ede8e68075635d0481f5794585c450d464dd6310a4b96e6c0f0d7b109"}}, "hash": "fe4668a768368b6abfe1af1f11b11bbf506093b41a7fff0c3ddfb91daecec64d", "text": "In one case, Pacific Countries are ahead of Asia and RRRT is assisting Malaysia to change family laws. 13 Dr. Henry Ivarature and Ms. Joanne Kunatuba (PIFS) spoke about the Pacific Plan, which is an important regional instrument for reducing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "662bebc3-e935-4bf7-915a-fe80861bb8ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "662bebc3-e935-4bf7-915a-fe80861bb8ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8cb3ffb710a40bb7d4130832606924598100982839a0db4b39eb29dacb93d1b"}, "3": {"node_id": "6fe11e0f-aaff-445a-a243-9b7082ffd7cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4976f7227a5ee658547daeb048c0a23450488aec4335d33724ac9a80771dee6"}}, "hash": "8dfb2b23222c08ef83f6bc61ad977c61328494ea66cbeab6dc41a22bfedbbca0", "text": "gender inequalities. According to the Pacific Plan, the aim is \u201cto pursue economic growth, sustainable development, security and good governance, through greater regional cooperation and integration\u201d. Strategic Objective 8 of the Plan is on improved gender equality and is built on the ideas of other regional initiatives, such as the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, CEDAW, the Commonwealth Plan of Action for Gender Equality and MDG3. Other regional initiatives contribute to improving gender equality and are being monitored and evaluated in terms of: \u2022 Harmonized approaches in the health sector under the Samoa Commitment, including the HIV/AIDS and STI Strategy; a stronger focus on non-communicable diseases; and agreement on health worker agreement. \u2022 Support or establish the regional consolidation of commitments to key institutions such as audit and ombudsman offices, customs, leadership codes, anti- corruption institutions and departments of attorneys-general. \u2022 Upgrade and extend country and regional statistical information systems and database across all sectors. In terms of pressing issues for increasing women\u2019s participation in parliamentary processes, (which in the Pacific stands at a low 4.1 percent) the speakers highlighted the following: \u2022 Main challenges: \u2022 What measures are suitable, appropriate and relevant for each of the Forum Island Countries\u2019 setting? \u2022 How to go about making the measure or measures which are considered relevant for FICs, acceptable and implemented? \u2022 Need for awareness-raising programs on measures for increasing women\u2019s representation in legislatures, including legislation, electoral system, social, economic, political and financial, traditional and cultural. \u2022 Members of Parliament, including Ministers, political parties, officials, traditional leaders, churches, key government officials, NGOs \u2022 Challenge of differing literacy levels and politically awareness among citizens Ms Michelle Reddy (FWRM) spoke about gender equality from the point of view of youth in the region. Culture places value on women \u2013 as child bearers and care givers. This also restricts women because it defines women only by these roles. Young women are expected to be seen but not heard. Being young and a woman is synonymous with having unequal power and no voice. The critical issues in this regard seem to be religion, culture, sexual reproductive and health rights and leadership. Other points raised: 1. Recognize the particular social, political, economic and cultural challenge that young women in Pacific Island countries face 2. Acknowledge the contribution and rights of women with disabilities to be included in government and NGO programmes 3. Acknowledge and advocate for the inclusiveness of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered youth in the Pacific . . . . . . .. . . 4. Support innovative leadership programmes for young women to equip them to participate effectively in decision-making processes in their homes, communities, and countries 5. Utilise the energy and creativity of young women for the Pacific Women\u2019s Movement 6. Ensure that young women\u2019s opinions and experiences are taken into account in making policies that will affect their lives 7. Advocate for a distinct space for young women at national and regional events, and their inclusion in all official delegations 8. Encourage intergenerational conversations by drawing on our many voices and myriad strategies that continues to advance women\u2019s rights in the region 9. Utilize commitments made in the Pacific and international documents and meetings which specifically address young women\u2019s issues Ms Ana Laqeretabua (UNIFEM) saw investing in gender equality as a transformative area to help achieve gender equality in the Pacific. The main issue is not how much resources have been allocated to women but whether a gender perspective has been integrated into the design and implementation of programmes. Progress in this area could be captured more directly through process-oriented gender indicators. It was observed that the notion from religious and cultural institutions of \u201chappy families, happy isles in a tropical paradise\u201d belie a reality of gendered social relationships, resulting in various manifestations of entrenched discrimination against women. Pacific economies are weak and largely dependent on bilateral and multilateral donor assistance, as well as remittances sent by Pacific islanders working oversees. Agriculture and fishing is central to local subsistence and is often the only basis for different levels (from the macro to micro) of engagement with the cash economy. Fiji has a large inflow of remittances from the British army, UN peacekeeping and international security guard services to Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan, etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fe11e0f-aaff-445a-a243-9b7082ffd7cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fe11e0f-aaff-445a-a243-9b7082ffd7cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8cb3ffb710a40bb7d4130832606924598100982839a0db4b39eb29dacb93d1b"}, "2": {"node_id": "662bebc3-e935-4bf7-915a-fe80861bb8ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8dfb2b23222c08ef83f6bc61ad977c61328494ea66cbeab6dc41a22bfedbbca0"}}, "hash": "e4976f7227a5ee658547daeb048c0a23450488aec4335d33724ac9a80771dee6", "text": "Large numbers of the Tongan and Samoan male population find work in Australia and New Zealand.

Asian fishing fleets, loggers, and traders present problems in Kiribati, for example, , where young women are commoditized by Asian fishing crews and Chinese traders. In terms of what to do, the panelists noted: \u2022 Next steps vary by country and are more urgent in some cases than in others. In the case of Papua New Guinea, lobbying and advocacy with donors and government to put gender equality into the Kavieng Declaration should be an urgent priority. \u2022 At the global level, there is a need for gender-responsive indicators for aid efficiency and effectiveness that are consistent with and have the potential to contribute to further development of the Paris Declaration Indicators. \u2022 Aid that it not efficient or effective for women is, by definition, neither efficient nor effective. 15 Ms. Sharon Bhagwan-Rolls (Fem\u2019LINK) spoke about the importance of highlighting UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and taking forward its decisions. In particular \u20181325\u2019 is illustrative of how the UN and NGOs can work together for meaningful change toward gender equality even though women still remain under-represented in the peace process after 1325. Three areas are critical to gender equality in the context of conflict peace and security: participation, protection and peacekeeping. These 3 Ps clearly address the ongoing trend in gender inequality which was once again reaffirmed during last year\u2019s Open Debate at the UN Security Council (October 23) that highlighted under- representation of women in formal peace processes even seven years after 1325. This was particularly challenging in the Pacific Island region, where war is not only being fought amongst political factions or armies or militants, but where war is being raged on dwindling natural resources, including rising sea levels; where women continue to face the brunt of domestic and institutional violence; and where political structures, whether modern or traditional, continue to perpetuate barriers to equal women\u2019s participation in decision making. When it comes to gender, conflict, peace and security, the heart of the issue is about human insecurities \u2013 social, political, economic and environmental insecurities. In terms of moving forward, there was a stated need to invest in a range of national strategies to fight gender inequality because there is no \u201cone size fits all solution.\u201d The 1325 Resolution and the UNDP CPR Eight Point Plan, for example, provide practical strategies that need to be considered and adapted to our region. One interesting way to do this is through women\u2019s media, information and communication networks. Such networks have continued to demonstrate that they have a role, a place and a purpose to assist in advancing global commitments. This could be done by advancing gender justice (by assisting women learn about their rights), expanding women\u2019s citizenship, participation, leadership and advancing women as decision-makers and by enabling them to gain the skills and confidence they need to or influence the decisions that directly affect their lives.. Women in media and information-communication networks offer the opportunity to: \u2022 document and provide evidence of women\u2019s situations and contributions in addressing issues of peace and security in order to inform and influence peace processes \u2022 produce information in an appropriate and accessible manner which contributes to peace-building and serves as a support for other peace initiatives from peace education to mediation and training \u2022 establish accessible and appropriate information and communication systems to serve as gender-inclusive early warning systems. There is also the challenge to transform existing decision_making forums, whether they are traditional or community based or national and regional level, to ensure women are able to take up their legitimate roles Ms. Rose Atu (PNG Family Violence Sexual Action Committee) Guinea chose to prioritize gender and justice systems, gender based violence and gender in crisis as the areas which are of most pressing concern for the country with relevance to many other countries in the Pacific. \u2022 Within gender and justice systems, there was a strong need to look at medical protocol (working with health workers), a family protection bill to protect women and children, review legislative amendments (especially the criminal code for . . . . . . .. . . sexual offenses) and gender-sensitive training for members and officials of courts. \u2022 Under gender-based violence, it was stated that data collection and research was lacking in Papua New Guinea.

However, there was much more work to be done to get a representative sample from all provinces. There was also a lot of sexual abuse of young girls and internal migrants lately, which was a relatively new issue for the country. \u2022 Within gender and crisis situations, community awareness and education (both in and out of schooling systems) was seen to be instrumental in stopping family and sexual violence. Specifically, during the recovery phase, there was a need to establish further family and victim support centres and safe houses. In terms of constraints to gender equality, there was a lack of skilled technical people in the country to help deal with the problem. Also, cultural practices in Papua New Guinea were often given as reasons for promoting discrimination and violence. Lastly, there was a lack of political support to keep gender on the agenda for the Government and to give programmes adequate resources. The panelist recommended respecting and including faith-based and cultural values in efforts to reduced gender inequality; these resonate with the people. Men and boys should also be brought into gender programmes, particularly those aimed at halting gender-based violence. Dr Wame Baravilala (UNFPA) spoke on how violence against women and girls is a major human rights and public health concern for Pacific Island Countries. This encompasses a wide range of abuses including physical, sexual and psychological violence in the family and community. These show up in terms of battering, sexual abuse of children, dowry-related violence, rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women. Non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women, forced prostitution, and violence perpetrated or condoned by the state are ever present in many countries. The perpetrators of violence are mostly men so it is critical to reach out to men and boys. Physical abuse in intimate relationships is almost always accompanied by severe psychological and verbal abuse \u2022 In one of four cases of domestic violence, women will experience sexual abuse \u2022 Women are at greatest risk of violence from men they know \u2022 Abused women are more likely than others to suffer from depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, eating problems, sexual dysfunction and many reproductive health problems The panelist highlighted the findings of many surveys and studies in the region. Some highlights of a recent survey in Samoa were: \u2022 No education, rural residence and low household income were associated with a greater likelihood of abuse. \u2022 Those who had been abused were significantly more likely to have had their first sexual encounter at ages 10-14 years (2.4 percent compared to 1.9 percent of those never abused) and 15-19 years (58 percent compared to 42 percent). The latter age group were also more likely not to have wanted their first sex (14 17 percent compared to 9 percent of those never abused) or to have been forced the first time they had sex (8 percent compared to 5 percent). \u2022 In response to the statement, \u201ca good wife obeys her husband\u201d, 93 percent of rural women and 84 percent of urban women agreed; 85 percent of rural women and 79 percent of urban women agreed that \u201ca man should show his partner who is boss\u201d. \u2022 77 percent of rural women and 67 percent of urban women agreed that \u201ca woman is obliged to have sex with her husband\u201d. \u2022 79 percent of the males in the study agreed that women should have the right to ask their husbands to cook and clean. \u2022 2 percent of men surveyed reported having been physically abused by their wife \u2022 45 percent of men ever in a relationship reported that they had experienced emotional abuse, such as spouse demanding to know their whereabouts at all times. \u2022 Sexual abuse by their partner was reported by 3 percent of men. \u2022 Only 18 percent of men admitted to having physically abused their spouses (compared to 38 percent of women who said they had been physically abused); 45 percent reported that they had emotionally abused their spouse (compared to 19 percent of women respondent who reported having been emotionally abused). \u2022 No men reported that they had sexually abused their partner (compared to 20 percent of women). \u2022 Two-thirds (74 percent) of the abusive male respondents reported that they had physically abused their wives for \u201canswering back\u201d or disobedience.

Capacity is crucial, both at the grassroots and top-down levels, for this to become a reality. \u2022 Many panelists brought up the issue of women in parliaments and how a greater presence would lead to more gender equitable outcomes for a country. There is a need, however, for more in-depth impact studies on this relationship to see if this link to more gender sensitive legislation and outcomes is really as strong as it is proclaimed to be. 13:00 \u2013 14:00 Lunch Break Session III: Focusing the RHDR \u2013 Pacific Priorities 14:00 \u2013 17:15 Chair: Ramesh Gampat, HDRU/RCC Focus Group Discussions Stakeholders were divided into three focus groups and were asked to: identify two priority focus areas from Pacific countries (suggested sub-themes and triggers for discussion provided with guidance sheet) from six sub-themes and explore these themes from the point of view of (a) issues, (b) solutions/recommendations and (c) messages. . . . . . . .. . . Group A Priority Theme 1: Gender justice and women in decision making Priority Theme 2: Investing in Gender Equality (GBV as a crosscutting issue throughout both themes) Gender justice and women in decision making Key Issues \u2022 Low representation of women in parliaments and lack of women in decision- making, statutory bodies and grass-roots organisations. Women are not running for parliament in some countries, while in others women ran but will not be elected. Women have little resources to help them lobby for election and women\u2019s voices are often not taken seriously even when elected. \u2022 Women need to be educated (there is a low level of understanding of electoral systems) and support each other to understand ingrained gender roles. The father, for example, dictates to the entire family on who should be voting (Women not seen in decision-making in leadership). Decision-making powers start from the home and move to the macro-level. Without this link, it will be difficult to see women in these roles at a higher level. \u2022 Lack of awareness of the electoral system/reservations/quotas and the political system at all levels, particularly in rural areas. \u2022 Focus on Parliament may be misplaced; quotas should also be in statuary bodies (Permanent secretaries, provincial councils, committees, trade unions). \u2022 Legislative concerns; laws exist but implementation a challenge. Reality is that laws cannot discriminate when it comes to employment but in reality it is not so; enforcement is hardly done. \u2022 Women can be excluded from some jobs due to legislation that creates barriers such as employment barriers (e.g. women are not allowed to manage male blocks in prisons so this means they are excluded from such jobs). \u2022 When there is a party system, it can inhibit women\u2019s representation as parties have spaces that do not always accommodate women. \u2022 GBV - Gender sensitisation of the judiciary (5 percent of GBV cases make it through the system). In Samoa, there is no specific GBV legislation and not enough women\u2019s machinery for it to happen in the near future. There exists a low priority for GBV legislation in the region. \u2022 Expecting women to perform in Parliament when men don\u2019t won\u2019t solve the problem. Countries should hold male parliamentarians responsible for delivering gender justice to both men and women. Key Recommendations/Towards Solutions 1. Involve influential community leaders, church leaders, opinion shapers and faith- based organisations to enforce gender justice, especially at the community level. Identify agents of change, champions of gender justice/role models 2. Employ a range of affirmative action measures, including quotas and reserved seats for women to ensure equal representation of women and men. Where there is increased membership of women in decision-making bodies, learn from these good practices 3. Increase gender awareness programmes for men, including high-risk groups (such as criminal offenders/men in prisons, men living in poverty, rural men) 4. Set up regional women\u2019s and men\u2019s forums for networking 19 5. Identify and document indigenous/traditional practices/traditional justice forms that affirm the positive/equal role of women. Review harmful/negative cultural practices that impact women 6. Regular reviews (every five years) of legislation and policies for gender sensitivity should be institutionalized 7.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffd5bccd-7f63-434b-afd8-c0dbcd3d3744": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffd5bccd-7f63-434b-afd8-c0dbcd3d3744", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46a2207d34924dcaa46401bf2f0ad711750aad8f9f482c2ca4cee36114ad73e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "8fdd3789-1187-46f7-95cf-48e435f54de7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb2ea55a5b0de83d11fb6535f51605230eccacab535ea4e2d7d640b8b8e00d8d"}}, "hash": "5cfa150ec8377aca866c519203b41dee899b22e56999ca53cc2a9e6fb8bbb13a", "text": "Increased support by governments for legislative approaches to stopping gender injustice Key Messages \u2022 Collective justice begins with individual justice \u2022 Cultural tradition does not justify gender injustice \u2022 Numbers are not enough \u2022 Gender justice is also men\u2019s business \u2022 Violence is injustice (injustice is violence too) \u2022 Knowledge brings power and justice \u2022 No justice without gender equity Group B Priority Theme 1: Investing in gender equality Priority Theme 2: Gender justice and women in decision making (GBV as a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ff3dad2-0187-4ff1-9567-d9abfbf5e543": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ff3dad2-0187-4ff1-9567-d9abfbf5e543", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3494c3177b79661065ac1b42e07f51077ec9b88111cd34819706e270a480cefa"}}, "hash": "3494c3177b79661065ac1b42e07f51077ec9b88111cd34819706e270a480cefa", "text": "crosscutting issue throughout both themes) Investing in gender equality Key Issues \u2022 Adequate political will for resource allocation, particularly in the health and education sectors, is a sizeable barrier to progress in investing in gender equality \u2022 The feminization of poverty and HIV has contributed to the importance of seeing economic injustice, public health and gender as a big issue \u2022 Decision makers and political leaders often misinterpret religion and culture to justify gender discrimination and acceptance of the status quo \u2022 The main collateral for people in the Pacific is control land and other natural resources.

Prioritize a certain percentage of resources for investing in gender equality programmes, which is fixed and predictable for a sustained period of time 7.

Policy and law makers need to be aware of differences across the Pacific \u2013 matrilineal vs patrilineal systems \u2013 both systems don\u2019t necessarily result in empowerment for women.

Key Recommendations/Towards Solutions 1. Strengthen support mechanisms for existing women leaders (i.e. parliamentarians) 2. Networking and partnership into rural areas is important as problems can be more acute there 3. Stock-take the existing structures/power structures/relevant institutions of political governance/control in order to map problems and prioritize ways to move forward with legislation and policies; differences between rural and urban areas should be part of this exercise as well. 4. Capacity- building to increase knowledge of traditional and modern structures, their interaction and implications for gender equality. 5. Localize international and national instruments, such as CEDAW, designed to empower women. 6. Sensitization of the Chiefly system to gender issues is one of the key factors as many Pacific Islanders see this as the primary normative framework governing their lives. Formal and introduced systems should also be sensitized (i.e. party manifestos, government machineries, etc.) 7. Broad-based civic education is needed to prevent and fight gender inequalities. There is a need to reach out to men to enable them to understand the benefits of gender equity, as well as to articulate their role in this process. Key Messages \u2022 WISD\u2019M - There is wisdom when women share in decision-making \u2022 Get Gender on the Agenda \u2022 We inadvertently restrict our own progress \u2022 Put your money were your mouth is \u2022 Don\u2019t put your mouth were the money is \u2022 Political empowerment starts in the bedroom \u2022 \u201cIf men can\u2019t even listen to older women how are the expected to listen to younger women\u201d . . . . . . .. . . Presentations and Interactive Discussion Following the presentations, the floor was open for comments and questions in the plenary. The following points were raised: \u2022 There is a need to include people with other sexualities and men / male agency if any of these initiatives are to be holistic and sustainable. Research is needed on cultural aspects which impact women; this is also crosscutting for policies to respond to local contexts. For the Pacific, this is especially relevant to control and land ownership and natural resources \u2022 Many Pacific Island Counties rely heavily on donor funds and aid for social welfare programmes but what about \u201cdonor syndrome\u201d when donors go away? Governments should also see how to sustain resources independently in the long term and are the primary responsible party for ensuring their countries achieve gender equality. Donor support should be strategic but pay attention to national ownership and sustainability \u2022 Faith-based organizations and their impact on women and women\u2019s sexuality are important in the fight against gender inequality \u2022 Language barriers are important especially as \u2018gender\u2019 is seen to be a new term in many societies \u2022 Political power is not just in the parliament but personal space as well. In the Pacific, as in Asia, the family is the strongest and most fundamental unit of society; to bring about gender equality, need to focus on personal power and personal space to change mindsets at home Session IV: Summing Up for Day 1 17:15 \u2013 17:45 Chair: Anuradha Rajivan, HDRU/RCC Summary by Chair The Chair thanked the three focus groups for a day of extremely rich and diverse discussions. She noted that all three groups chose the same sub-themes of politico-legal and economic equity (with GBV as a crosscutting sub theme), so there was a strong convergence in the Pacific. In addition to GBV as a crosscutting issue, there were issues that repeatedly came up throughout the discussion: \u2022 the importance of working with faith-based organizations and leaders of the region \u2022 including sexual minorities, people with disabilities and youth in policies \u2022 looking at customary legal and justice systems and their impact on gender \u2022 land/resource control and inheritance rights were fundamental for women\u2019s economic empowerment \u2022 the importance of generating sustained political will to fight gender discrimination and violence \u2022 the interaction between traditional and formal systems must be part of any contextual understanding of gender equality \u2022 the need to reach out to both men and women so that gender equality is not seen as an exclusive women\u2019s issue ~ End of Day 1 ~ 23 Day 2, Tuesday, April 22nd Session V: Measuring Gender (In)equality 9:00 \u2013 10:15 Chair: Isiye Ndombi, UNICEF Representative, Pacific Island Countries The", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ea9fc85-4d8d-4369-a615-15f57003d0c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ea9fc85-4d8d-4369-a615-15f57003d0c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f110aecd7cb71c481ee92f620b4238906701fd2593c7654fa56de156a074b6f"}, "3": {"node_id": "10bae139-2bb2-4d3f-a3a3-d4fe095eb657", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38f337c32850bc4a30b31b66dcabbe5360f69b79a5c52b305d69e245d0783469"}}, "hash": "ad118292f62658b903218defe4781ff21e21c1fb0bf5f27cb2a203e3d6bcd525", "text": "Chair opened the first session by highlighting some critical issues relating to data and measurement of gender: \u2022 Work on measuring gender equality at the macro level must be matched by concerted efforts at the micro or household level in order to make a difference in people\u2019s lives \u2022 Data should show the inequality of power and provide technical assistance to enable countries to build their own databases \u2022 Making data easily accessible to policy makers and audiences is crucial \u2022 Data must be translated into knowledge in economic terms and highlight what is the cost of taking the wrong decision Measuring Gender (In)Equality: A New Approach - Ramesh Gampat, RCC This presentation focused on the importance of measures of gender (in)equality, selected measures in the literature and a proposed alternative measure, the Gender Vulnerability Index (GVI). The main arguments were presented as follows: \u2022 Gender Gaps: have existed from time immemorial in all societies and at all times. Some societies have been more successful than others at dealing with these gaps. Ultimately, gender gaps are about power and competition \u2026 unequal power, unequal treatment, unequal rewards \u2022 Popular Measures: The Gender Development Index (GDI) and Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) are complex and difficult to understand. They have been less successful than expected \u2022 An Alternative: HDRU would like to take a step backward and look at gender vulnerability in its \u201cplural\u201d dimension. A new index, based on the methodology of the HDI, can be constructed readily The presenter further detailed the conceptual and empirical issues associated with the GDI and GEM: Conceptual issues \u2022 GEM and the GDI: Complex, difficult to understand and interpret. Not as effective as expected \u2022 GDI: Problem of dominance of the earned income component (GDI: as much as 90 percent penalty levied on earned income). Equal penalty applied to all gaps for both GDI and GEM \u2022 GEM: largely reflects position of elite and economically advantaged women; need to focus more on everyday women and the poor. Empirical issues . . . . . . .. . . \u2022 GEM: Data unavailability \u2013 serious data problems; poor coverage; comparability. \u2022 GDI underestimates gender gap. \u2022 GDI: Life expectancy tracks mortality, not health or morbidity. In conclusion, conceptual and empirical problems limit usefulness of these pioneering composite measures on gender. Following on from Amartya Sen\u2019s \u201cplural view of gender equality\u201d, the objective of a new approach would be to look at observable and measurable factors that make men and women vulnerable to unequal power and unequal treatment. This would be easier to measure and have policy implications. Three issues are crucial to the approach: 1. The \u201cplural view of gender inequality\u201d \u2013 multi-dimensionality of phenomenon. 2. A measure of gender inequality, not measures of gender-related development. 3. A measure of vulnerability to unequal power and unequal treatment The dimensions of the proposed Gender Vulnerability Index (GVI) would be: 1. Demographic inequality 2. Basic inequality and special opportunity inequality 3. Economic opportunities inequality 4. Professional inequality 5. Ownership inequality 6. Household inequality The presenter thanked the stakeholders for their attention and concluded by requesting comments on how to take this proposed new index forward, utilizing inputs from the Pacific experience. Pacific Gender Indicators \u2013 Kim Robertson, SPC The presenter from SPC highlighted the institutions pioneering and critical work on measuring gender-related phenomenon in the region. The current project involves (a) review of existing national mechanisms for using gender statistics, (b) building a core set of statistics and indicators for national, regional and international monitoring, evaluation and reporting and (c) producing a hhandbook and training materials on how to compile the statistics and indicators and how to interpret them for stakeholders. The framework for such indicator work was divided among the following thematic areas: Population, Housing, Families and households, Economy, Education, Health, Work and employment, Public life and decision making, Crime and Justice, Environment, Poverty, Information and communications and Governance (Legislation). In terms of using statistics in measuring \u2018unequal power\u2019, it was suggested to use proxies such as: labour force participation rates, access to credit by women and men, businesses registered/vendor \u2018tables/stalls\u2019 for women and men, pay rates for women and men in different occupations/industries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10bae139-2bb2-4d3f-a3a3-d4fe095eb657": {"__data__": {"id_": "10bae139-2bb2-4d3f-a3a3-d4fe095eb657", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f110aecd7cb71c481ee92f620b4238906701fd2593c7654fa56de156a074b6f"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ea9fc85-4d8d-4369-a615-15f57003d0c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad118292f62658b903218defe4781ff21e21c1fb0bf5f27cb2a203e3d6bcd525"}}, "hash": "38f337c32850bc4a30b31b66dcabbe5360f69b79a5c52b305d69e245d0783469", "text": "A major issue for this and many other data concerns is that for many of these countries there are no formal/ongoing 25 monitoring systems.

The next 28 indicators cover the establishment of implementation machinery, custom, sex work, political and public life and nationality. The remaining indicators cover education, employment, health, economic and social benefits, rural women, capacity, equality before, during and upon the breakdown of relationships, including de facto, and many more. The UNDP Pacific Centre has assisted in a comprehensive review of ten Pacific Island Countries (Cook Islands, FSM, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu) legislative compliance with CEDAW. The review found that there exist varying levels of compliance from article to article, and from country to country. In each country, there is significant compliance with CEDAW in some areas, in other areas, some progress has been achieved and in other areas, non-compliance remains a considerable issue. The utility of these reviews for countries were stated to be the following: \u2022 they are useful to Pacific governments, civil society and gender/human rights advocates \u2022 a good source of information for government reporting and NGO shadow reporting to the CEDAW Committee \u2022 a tool for identifying areas of non-compliance and determining areas of priority \u2022 excellent for monitoring/measuring future progress towards compliance, fact- based information to counter arguments that gender equality does not exist The experience on measuring CEDAW legislative compliance was seen as a good practice from the region and is currently being scaled up to include other Pacific Countries, as well as countries outside of the region. . . . . . . .. . . Interactive Discussion \u2022 Qualitative research could be included in and new and existing measures of progress toward gender equity; there is a tendency towards homogenization of groups \u2013 what about sexual minorities and people with disabilities? \u2022 Indicators of women\u2019s access to information is critical for inclusion in any measure (not only Internet); for some countries in the region, such as Fiji and Solomon Islands, conflict issues are becoming important when looking at gender \u2022 There needs to be comparability of data across the region and with other regions so sources and guidelines need to be consistent. Many institutions utilize international data for multi-country work. However, data gaps at the national and sub-national level exist and need to be reconciled. \u2022 Using proxies to bridge data gaps for Pacific was put forward as a possible solution. \u2022 It was noted that CEDAW only measures de jure and not de facto compliance of legislation. New measures could assist by filling that gap. \u2022 HDRU clarified, that, like HDRO, they are data users not creators. The GVI will also use international data sources as had past indices. The use of proxies was seen as a second choice if more proximate indicators are not available. Summary by Chair The Chair thanked the presenters and the discussants for their extremely targeted and informed contributions toward looking at new ways of measuring gender (in)equality. He went on to affirm that data needs to be accessible to make a difference in policies and programming. 10:15 \u2013 10:30 Biology Break Session VI: Focusing the RHDR \u2013 Pacific Priorities 10:30 \u2013 1:00 Chair: Garry Wiseman, PC The Chair introduced this session as a continuation of the previous day\u2019s focus group discussions.

Centralisation of health services and higher education in capitals and urban centres for the bigger countries. Overpopulation, violence unemployment and overcrowding in urban areas result in pressure on limited services. Mobility is an issue; people need to move to access in services. \u2022 Lack of infrastructure for education even for basic services like primary education. \u2022 Problems with the use of finance to promote work outside the government in civil society; very little funding for civil society for gender equality especially at the community level. \u2022 National ownership of gender equality is a problem. Governments do not commit funds for gender equality, possibly because gender is perceived as an external idea; donors are driving the process and it is consequently not nationally-owned. \u2022 Channelling of gender equality funds are usually done via the Ministry of Women; there are no wider allocations through programmes in other sectors. These budgets are small and not sufficient for a sustained effort. \u2022 Seeking a decent wage is an issue; small businesses, shops, wages council review do not push to increase minimum wages and women are particularly impacted by this. Trade Unions ignore women and do not empower informal workers to become unionised. \u2022 Women often take up customer service positions while men take up more technical and higher paid posts; how to provide opportunities for women in these skilled areas needs to be addressed. \u2022 Fear of changing the traditional governance systems owing to gender empowerment; there is resistance to this kind of change. Consequently, inclusive participation is an issue. \u2022 Tuvalu and Kiribati are facing big changes in terms of climate change migrations; flooding affects housing, destruction of food crops which affect subsistence farming and food security. Women\u2019s adaption to these issues needs to be taken into account in planning \u2022 Investments are being made without consulting women; trade-offs in women\u2019s livelihoods can be linked to issues from environmental and agricultural changes Key Recommendations/Towards Solutions 1) Invest in community education and technical skills-building 2) Investing in transportation and communication infrastructure is important. Logistics is an issue, not only in provincial markets but also in very small islands. Transportation through sea, air and land routes within the islands should be improved; the cost for maintenance of transportation systems must be factored in 3) Donor polices should be open to empowering women through a flexible and sustainable approach to funding NGOs so that they become more independent. Participatory approach to planning projects needs to be adopted 4) Investment in the recruitment and training of female police officers is needed 5) Encourage the private sector but with controls and safeguards that are gender-friendly . . . . . . .. . . 6) Investment in access to financial market; more soft loans, micro-finance and encouraging women to open bank accounts 7) Invest in IT education for women and girls 8) Donors should be more flexible and supportive of faith-based organisations that often provide services for women Key Messages \u2022 W (women) +I (investment) = Equality \u2022 Prioritise, prioritise, prioritise \u2022 Invest in where the work begins \u2013 In the community \u2022 Access to money = Access to a better life \u2022 Invest in capabilities to expand opportunities \u2022 Investing in women is investing in communities \u2022 Investing in gender equality is everybody\u2019s responsibility Group B Priority Theme 1: Investing in gender equality Priority Theme 2: Gender justice and women in decision making (GBV as a crosscutting issue for both themes) Gender justice and women in decision making Key Issues \u2022 Participation of women in leadership positions throughout the region is low. \u2022 Lack of understanding of constitutional rights and lack of knowledge and ability to interpret the law as it relates to daily life. For example, if you\u2019re a victim of GBV how do you access justice if the laws are in place? There is no knowledge of the service providers of legal recourse against injustice. \u2022 Legal aid institutions do not exist in most Pacific Island countries. \u2022 Low female literacy rates, for example in PNG, impact the ability for women to understand, interpret and put laws into use. \u2022 Two sets of laws exist in the Pacific: customary and \u201cintroduced\u201d law with the latter overriding the former.

Men take part and are the major benefactors of decision making in traditional justice systems. Even if a customary law judgment occurs, then the formal law will still apply but usually take effect following the customary practice. \u2022 Faith-based organizations are often used as political puppets to move forward with gender discriminatory policies and practices. \u2022 Limited resources in the legal system for most countries in the region. \u2022 Cultural barriers of accessing the formal legal system; for example, women would not take their husbands to court for GBV if they are the sole income generator for the household. This also relates to the importance of economic independence as a prerequisite for a gender-sensitive justice system. \u2022 Women with disabilities suffer from a lack of knowledge about their rights. The Implementation of pro-disability rights and laws is an issue. For example, every building has to be accessible to disabled persons and there must be 29 equal opportunity to employment; however, this does not occur. Often discrimination against people with disabilities is not reported because they are not empowered enough to contest. \u2022 Land is a big issue, especially concerning inheritance laws and female beneficiaries. \u2022 In some Pacific countries such as Tonga, women stereotypically hold a privileged position (by perception) so many men don\u2019t see gender gaps even though they are there. \u2022 Gender usually drops out of the picture after crisis situations and the focus becomes solely on reconstruction and redevelopment. Notions of security are purely economic and political without gender being mainstreamed. \u2022 Immigration and nationality laws, particularly dealing with citizenship, are often gender-discriminatory Key Recommendations/Towards Solutions 1. Civic education needs to be increased in order to make traditional and formal systems work together 2. Inequalities which traditional laws promulgate need to be identified and addressed 3. Draw together case studies/experiences on traditional law for comparative experience throughout the different sub-region of the Pacific 4.

Without resources, women\u2019s political power is also limited. . . . . . . .. . . \u2022 Socialization of boys and girls at home, in the church and schools is the beginning of the process aimed at addressing economic inequality. \u2022 The reasons why women tend to end up in low-paying / low-end jobs are still not recognized and analyzed at higher political levels. Lifestyle issues have a huge impact here; for example, lack of maternity leave provisions is an inhibiting factor. \u2022 Women are still not taking up technical and vocational education. Part of the problem is cultural/mindset \u2013 certain work areas are still seen as \u201cman\u2019s domain.\u201d In particular, for poor families, the short term incentive of a girl getting a job and contributing immediately often overrides the long-term possibility of educating the girl to get a better job.

A lot of women don\u2019t have access to technical skills/opportunities. Some countries give only a small number of scholarships to girls \u2013 for example, USP did a study and found that Vanuatu and Solomon Islands gave less scholarship to girls. It could also be that women aren\u2019t applying for scholarships in particular sectors. \u2022 Sex work is beginning to appear as an economic opportunity. In the Solomon Islands, PNG and Kiribati women bring food to the family because of sex work. \u2022 Natural resource industries in the Pacific are associated with sexual exploitation of women. Governments need to think through the implications of letting foreign companies in to pursue unregulated natural resource extraction. Post-conflict situations also have this problem: women use sex to access scarce resources. \u2022 Lack of social safety nets can be a problem. Economic insecurity leads to poor choices. Divorced women, single mothers, etc. are left particularly vulnerable \u2013 immediate problems for the mother, which are often passed on to their children. Key Recommendations/Towards Solutions 1. Need to invest in gender equality at the national level. As a first step, women\u2019s mindsets can be empowered to do this but line ministries also need to invest a proportion of their budget in gender and take responsibility for mainstreaming gender 2. National planning and finance departments should include gender analysts who will oversee gender mainstreaming. Foreign Affairs Offices need to start better monitoring of women\u2019s conventions 3. There is need for better gender budgeting and gender auditing through increased capacity building for ministries to undertake this exercise 4. International and regional trade activities need to be gender sensitive 5. Showcase role models of Pacific women doing different and non-typical kinds of work 31 6. There is a need for male advocates for non-traditional female employment. Teachers also need to encourage women and men to do non-stereotypical jobs 7. Provide sex education to change mindsets around women\u2019s sexuality and empowerment; working with faith-based organizations to avoid resistance 8. Availability of money for schooling is a big issue \u2013 need to have proper support systems in place to enable both boys and girls to go to school. Need to set up systems and processes to make sure that women with children can still access educational opportunities 9. Safe accommodation needs to be provided for girls and women who have to leave home to go to school 10. Invest in social safety nets for women 11. Corporate social responsibility should involve work towards gender equality (for example, conflict/gender-sensitive business practices/training for extractive industries) and involvement of disadvantaged women in the community. There is a need to have a clear incentive for the private sector to be gender-sensitive. Women\u2019s management of resources in the home demonstrates their capacity to contribute 12. More inclusive economic growth is desired and this involves recognizing the differences across classes of women and the rural/urban divide 13.

This is evident from the fact that all focus groups decided to prioritize politico-legal equity and economic equity with gender based violence, culture, sexual and other minorities as cross-cutting issues. In terms of politico-legal equity, the strategic relevance of this is that it is a cross- cutting issue and provides a space for transformational change. The issue is critical both at micro-and-macro levels, but linkages need to be made quite explicit; the personal is also the political. This theme includes political power/law/law- reform/implementation/legal precedents, culture, faith-based organisations, leadership, and traditional and non-traditional structures and has clear policy content \u2013 some of which may not cost very much to put into action. Some of the common concerns were: \u2022 Political power needs to be extended/ defined broadly to include the public sphere in national governance structures, political parties, religious and traditional bodies, and local governance mechanisms. Political power is also about holding the powerful accountable. Focusing solely on Parliament might be misplaced; quotas should also be in statuary bodies (permanent secretaries, provincial councils, committees, trade unions). \u2022 Small number of women in decision-making, low representation of women in parliaments and lack of women and women\u2019s voice for those in decision- making, statutory bodies and even in grass-roots organisations. Women are not running for parliament in some countries, while in others women contest but are not elected because of lack of resources/party support and electing patterns. Party system can inhibit women\u2019s representation as parties have spaces that do not always accommodate women. \u2022 Legislative concerns, laws exist but not enforced. Laws may not discriminate on employment as per the book but in reality it is not so. Land issues/family law particularly inheritance, people with disabilities, gender 33 sensitisation and maintaining independence of the judiciary (5 percent of the GBV cases make it through the system) is an issue. There is a low priority for GBV legislation. Coordination of enforcement of pro-gender laws is hardly done. Social workers and police need to be involved in this process. \u2022 Gender impacts of customary law: there is clash between the modern and traditional justice systems, i.e. pressure within family and village for victims of GBV to accept traditional forgiveness over modern forms of justice. However, there are examples of customary law relevant in Pacific, in particular around women\u2019s land rights \u2013 gives economic empowerment, right to negotiate. \u2022 Need to instil a process of change at the cultural level. How does one go down to the local level and instil change? Ingrained gender roles and patriarchy should be dealt with in any analysis of gender. Decision making powers should start from the home and move to the macro level. Without this link, it will be difficult to see women in these roles at a higher level. \u2022 Until women\u2019s personal relationships with others, such as household relationships (e.g. father, husband, brother), are transformed to be based on mutual respect, it will be difficult to see change in other spheres (i.e. outside the household). In terms of possible avenues to bring about change, many of the stakeholders proposed the following measures: \u2022 Take stock of formal and informal power structures. Involve influential community leaders, church leaders, opinion shapers and faith-based organisations to enforce gender justice at the level of community. Identify agents of change, champions of gender justice/role models (e.g. Men and Women of the year). Transform traditional and formal structures to promote participatory decision-making \u2013 have men and women sitting together and talking with each other. There is a need for \u201cshared power.\u201d \u2022 Range of affirmative action measures could be implemented, such as quotas and reserved seats for women and equal representation of women and men. Increased membership of women in decision-making bodies is important, as well as learning from best practices. \u2022 Government machinery needs to be gender sensitized.

The second theme which stakeholders prioritized was economic equity. Its strategic relevance is that investing in gender equality through economic empowerment for women can lead to increased political power in terms of participation in decision- making forums in communities; economic empowerment = political empowerment. Economic disempowerment can make people, especially women, more vulnerable to GBV. Economic empowerment thus has the potential to be transformative and amenable to policy. Some converging issues are: \u2022 The thinking that explicit gender inequality does not exist; that it\u2019s not a problem. Necessary to deal with the more subtle aspects of gender inequality. \u2022 Lack of access to economic resources, including natural resources, land, leads to poverty of opportunity. Without resources, women\u2019s political power is also limited. \u2022 The fact that women tend to end up in low-paying / low end jobs is still not recognised at higher political levels. Lifestyle issues have a huge impact \u2013 e.g. lack of maternity leave provisions, etc. act as an inhibiting factor. Removal of minimum wage clauses pushes women into low paying jobs. \u2022 Suggesting that gender inequality is a problem can often be seen as an attack on culture; implication is that culture is wrong. This is a very sensitive issue. \u2022 Gender is about men and women, girls and boys. But traditionally, women tend to be more disadvantaged, many projects target women specifically. How do we convince men that gender really is about them too, and that it\u2019s not just words to say that gender is about men and women? \u2022 Countries are scattered, medical facilities are not accessible and this is even more crucial for maternity care. Centralisation of health services and higher education in capitals and urban centres can impact negatively on women and gender minorities. \u2022 Lack of infrastructure for education and mobility even for basic services such as primary education and access to markets. \u2022 Women still not taking up technical vocational education. Part of the problem is cultural/mindset \u2013 certain work areas still seen as \u201cman\u2019s domain.\u201d This starts at a very young age \u2013 women are socialized to tend towards female-stereotyped jobs. Pregnancy at a young age can be a problem \u2013 education systems not set up to handle women with young children. Many families would prefer their girl children to marry young which impacts on their ability to take up tertiary education opportunities. \u2022 Sex work is beginning to appear as an economic opportunity and it is attracting many young and uneducated women and men. \u2022 Lack of social safety nets can be a problem. Feelings of (economic) insecurity lead to poor choices. \u2022 Political will is a big problem, especially in gender equitable resource allocation. How to generate political will \u2013 make gender equality a \u201cvote 35 winner\u201d and name specific constituents in politicians\u2019 constituencies to give it a \u201chuman face.\u201d \u2022 Channelling funds is usually done through the Ministry of Women; there are no wider allocations through programmes in other sectors. \u2022 Migration (both safe and unsafe), owing to economic reasons, both internally and between countries, can affect family relations at home; migration can be both empowering and disempowering. \u2022 Young women, sexual minorities and the disabled are \u201cinvisible\u201d when it comes to investing in gender equality. \u2022 Rural/urban divide shows that rural women have special needs. Some initiatives which could bring about positive change toward gender equity: \u2022 Invest in transportation and health infrastructure that is gender friendly. \u2022 Socialization of boys and girls in the home, church and schools is the beginning of the process of economic equality. \u2022 Relying on evidence and data to show that gender inequality really is an issue. In addition, use the efficiency argument; show the specific positive benefits of engaging with both women and men. \u2022 Engage with men; and ensure that any attempts to address gender inequality include and consider men and boys. \u2022 Need for gender budgeting and gender auditing through capacity building of ministries. \u2022 Showcase role", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "371be800-9647-4351-9cef-954bcd672aaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "371be800-9647-4351-9cef-954bcd672aaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4fae976d46d9bd6df3d8a2cac7417aae129680e6bcb49e5a6ec944c54f6bcd87"}}, "hash": "4fae976d46d9bd6df3d8a2cac7417aae129680e6bcb49e5a6ec944c54f6bcd87", "text": "models in the Pacific \u2013 women doing different kinds of work for example.

Interactive Discussion: Suggestions from participants The stakeholders thanked Anu and Garry for their comprehensive synthesis of some of the main issues raised over the last two days. Additional issues raised were: \u2022 Sexual exploitation is a huge issue in the Pacific which needs more action from policy makers. The monitoring and collection of data needs to be improved; need to sharpen an appropriate set of indicators. . . . . . . .. . . \u2022 Traditionally, official statistical offices collect only economic indicators and now are being overwhelmed with social statistics requests, such as those associated with measuring gender (in)equality. Perhaps, there is a need to give more resources to these offices in order to build their capacity to collect social statistics more actively. \u2022 Need to look at indicators (data) for women and people with disabilities, as well as minority groups such as sexual minorities. Summary and Concluding Statement by Chair The Chair thanked stakeholders, especially those who had travelled considerable distances to participate. These consultations are fundamental if the Report is to be \u201cof the people of Asia Pacific and for the people of Asia Pacific\u201d. Taking the rich and diverse inputs from the Asian and now Pacific stakeholders forward, the HDRU will begin the process of commissioning research that responds to the priorities and concerns of the region. The Chair invited all stakeholders to continue to work with the HDRU in shaping the contours of the Report through the AP-HD Net discussions, as well as contributing research and acting as champions for the Report. ~ End of Meeting ~ 37 Special Briefing Session with the Asian Development Bank Preliminary Review of Gender Issues in the Pacific. In preparation for regional technical assistance to strengthen Pacific policy analysis. Presenter: Gayle Nelson The speaker thanked UNDP and all stakeholders for the opportunity to present some current work of ADB in the Pacific on gender equality.

THE ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORTS The Asia Pacific Regional Human Development Report (RHDR) on Gender will be the third in a regular series, led by the Human Development Report Unit, housed at the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo. The first RHDR in this series was the 2006 Report titled Trade on Human Terms: Transforming Trade for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific which was followed by the one on corruption, Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives: Accelerating Human Development for Asia and the Pacific, to be launched soon. HDRs are policy-advocacy tools to explore critical development issues from a human development perspective. There is a fundamental difference between a technical analysis of an issue versus an exploration from a human development lens, which is an important element of the value added of an HDR.\u2020 HDRs aim to provide policy options by bringing people to the centre of development concerns for poverty reduction, countering inequalities, promoting internationally accepted development goals and, ultimately, promoting human development. 2. GENDER: OVERCOMING UNEQUAL POWER Relations between men and women are at the foundation of society. The proposed Asia Pacific Human Development Report provides an opportunity for contribution to transformative thinking by exploring the very fundamentals of gender-based inequalities that restrict choices and identifying strategic triggers for countering them. The overarching framework for the Report has been identified as \u2018unequal power and voice\u2019 with a focus on gender socialization and identities which influence opportunities and choices for women and men. There are expected to be many sensitive aspects to this work, for example, those involving an exploration of cultural norms and practices. Discussions so far have identified six themes for consideration under the overall framework of unequal power: justice systems, economic equality, energy and \u2020 For details, see APRI 2005. \u201cFrom Development to Human Development: Tool for Examining Themes from a Human Development Perspective.\u201d . . . . . . .. . . environment, gender-based violence, crisis prevention and recovery, mobility and migration. In spite of the many attempts at bridging male-female gaps in recent decades, gender inequality persists across the world as in Asia Pacific countries, including some extreme forms of discrimination that threaten survival, sustenance and human dignity. Can we identify critical underlying factors that inhibit gender equity in Asia and the Pacific? While a focus on women\u2019s empowerment is crucial, do we need a better understanding of ideas of masculinity? Even when improved opportunities for women can increase productivity and contribute to economic growth, unequal opportunities continue. Perhaps a win-win at the macro level is not adequate when there are dimensions of win-loose at the household level. What are some of the second generation issues emerging, for example male underperformance in schools? Do we want to replace one type of inequality by another?

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly, is often described as an international bill of rights for women. The Convention defines discrimination against women as \"...any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.\"", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9203e487-106e-493e-8513-09aa0d4f41e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "9203e487-106e-493e-8513-09aa0d4f41e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d99ab2a15c816dd166cac4c6a02e14cb107a8dccff7918a052ce39390d3a2234"}, "2": {"node_id": "b42f7574-b80e-4daa-b438-ab97786033c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9bc62d0ebe164abb005bb242610fc4ea2de457290643cf4b3fb092b50b39c69"}}, "hash": "665ab91dff2260369606049bd11b967c7d22c32903b09c68e447f5e9b113d426", "text": "By accepting the Convention, States commit themselves to undertake a series of measures to end discrimination against women in all forms, including to: \u2022 incorporate the principle of equality of men and women in their legal system, abolish all discriminatory laws and adopt appropriate ones prohibiting discrimination against", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8069541c-49e8-4adc-aeba-572a50ccb092": {"__data__": {"id_": "8069541c-49e8-4adc-aeba-572a50ccb092", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Pacific Stakeholders Consultation: Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fecb8604f74b3b71c37350b6d8c9875f5f38332a040a8f6fc3e382be8031142b"}, "3": {"node_id": "21d18e75-6840-41e6-a8ff-0b0db104b791", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5f1ad4d0413e8b1e4c75868071e9c4c7d502a2710043aa03fba9c4c39a168ee"}}, "hash": "24fe5c3c3d5750eb5cc3f984559d7563aa965dadd7f959e09f8a98928e2f2e70", "text": "women; \u2022 establish tribunals and other public institutions to ensure the effective protection of women against discrimination; and \u2022 ensure elimination of all acts of discrimination against women by persons, organizations or enterprises.

There is a fundamental difference between a technical analysis of an issue and an exploration using the human development lens; this is the value-added of an HDR. Because human development subsumes and goes beyond the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), HDRs can potentially push policies toward an \u2018MDG plus\u2019 agenda. Stakeholder consultations are a major part of the participatory process of producing an RHDR; a report \u201cfor and by the people of Asia Pacific.\u201d Extensive brainstorming sessions on broad thematic issues bring together diverse Asia Pacific stakeholders from different levels of society to interact with each other to shape the substantive contours of the Report. The objectives of the stakeholder consultations are two-fold: to be informed by views, experiences and priorities of countries in the region, while strengthening cross-country networks; and to obtain buy-in for the RHDR from stakeholders. The South and East Asia (hereafter referred to as \u2018Asia\u2019) consultation was the first of two sub-regional workshops for the forthcoming gender RHDR which preceded the Pacific Consultation held on April 21 st- 22nd April in Suva, Fiji. More specifically, the objectives of the Asia stakeholder consultation were to: \u2022 Introduce Asia stakeholders to the Asia-Pacific HDRs and the theme of \u2018gender\u2019 for the Report with the overall focus of \u2018overcoming unequal power and voice\u20191 \u2022 Share an overall view of gender trends in Asia and across its dif ferent sub- regions / countries \u2022 ?Discuss an \u2018Asian perspective\u2019 for understanding gender, gender differences, and the causes and consequences of inequality along with methods to examine and measure gender gaps \u2022 Take account of stakeholder priorities in identifying and sharpening six suggested subthemes: gender and justice systems (laws and law makers), investing in gender equality (economic benefits), gender energy and environment (women have been adapting, but how does adaptation affect choices for men and women), gender-based violence (underlining unequal power), gender and crisis (male-female differences impact) and gender migration and mobility (given the unprecedented surge in recent female mobility) that are cognizant of the concerns in Asia \u2022 Provide a platform for stakeholders to share experiences, highlight priorities and solutions that affect people\u2019s lives and to analyze whether and why 1 The APHDR themes are selected through a process that takes account of emerging development challenges of a regional nature and country priorities in Asia Pacific. The theme of gender, 'unequal power, unequal voice' emerged through a series of consultations with the Asia Pacific Human Development Network, NHDR focal points, CSOs, academia and voting on the web-site along with four other themes. Finally, of the five themes 'gender' was selected by members of the Management Board of UNDP's Regional Centres in 2006.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ffda18a-f7ad-421d-94a8-fb03b59fb3d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ffda18a-f7ad-421d-94a8-fb03b59fb3d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the South and East Asia Stakeholders Consultation - Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c38736d1857f50db5178a47ff2daa9e171dc729bb82f7981dcbb7553b1849b99"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e72612f-4d68-4513-8789-ee73c23f3efa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7ee740c0307ba500c32f72c96ef6ac08f0f32dd697b03623964c37fb06c9b45"}}, "hash": "3a6dd8a9cc48d95c2ae673a2b19ef04e5f5497d7520a3062d8cae51a67e0942e", "text": "4 gender inequality may be more prevalent in some countries or sectors rather than others \u2022 Explore emerging thematic issues from various perspectives with a focus on solutions and derive broad messages to guide and inform (in a two -way feedback process) research \u2022 Promote buy-in for the RHDR and thus strengthen its policy advocacy potential 5 Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender Theme: \u2018Overcoming Unequal Voice and Power\u2019 SOUTH AND EAST ASIA STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION Langkawi, Malaysia 14-15 April 2008 Day 1, Monday, 14 April 9:00-10:30 Session I: Setting the Scene Chair: Welcome Remarks and Opening Statement: Omar Noman, Chief, Policies and Programmes, RCC Mr. Noman explained the importance of the Asia Pacific Human Development Report (APHDR) as an entry point and \u2018hot-house\u2019 for a debate about ideas and human development.

The APHDR deals with issues that are beyond borders, often sensitive and have a wider relevance. It is complementary to the NHDR that is tailored to each country. The HDR is the only report that has the protection of the General Assembly and does not need to be \u2018cleared\u2019. The APHDR and objectives of the consultation: Anuradha Rajivan, Regional Programme Coordinator, HDRU, RCC Ms. Rajivan introduced the Human Development perspective as bringing people to the centre of national, regional and global dialogue. The APHDR is a policy advocacy tool for independent analysis, accessible to an intelligent, non -expert audience with a few key messages. An important dimension of the HDR process is t o generate buy-in and dialogue among stakeholders. A notable feature of the APHDRs is that they tackle issues of a sensitive, cross border and multi country nature. The upcoming APHDR is focused on gender inequality \u2013 a theme that was selected through consultation, thematic discussions and a Management Board decision in 2006. Ms. Rajivan presented the objectives of the consultation; the linkages between gender and human development; the status of the work of the Human Development Report Unit (HDRU) on the gender report; and the issues which would be the focus of discussion. She also presented statistics on gender (in)equality in Asia and brought out the tenuous balance between political sensitivity and credibility, while sharing some possible messages for the Report and the next steps. The objectives of the consultation were to: \u2022 Introduce the Asia-Pacific HDRs and the theme of \u2018gender\u2019 for this Report \u2022 Share overall trends and experiences on gender differences in the region \u2022 Identify innovative methods to measure gender gaps and discuss alternative proxy measures \u2022 Focus more sharply on the lives of poor and disadvantaged groups \u2022 Improve the understanding of gender gaps by exploring underlying causes \u2022 Reflect Asian perspectives in the work 6 \u2022 Analyze why gender inequality may be more prevalent in some countries / sectors over others, providing clues for solutions \u2022 Identify good practices which highlight priorities and possible solutions that affect people\u2019s lives. Ms. Rajivan, introducing the theme \u2018gender inequality \u2013 overcoming unequal power and voice\u2019, noted that the Asia Pacific region is very diverse with developing, rapidly growing, less developed and small island countries. However, one thing is common to all countries in the region: the wide gender gap. Despite the growth in incomes, this gap has not been bridged. For development practitioners the main question to be addressed is - Why does this gap persist, and what can be done to bridge it? Adopting a broad perspective while approaching this theme, she emphasized key issues: \u2022 Evolution of gender: The reversal of Western and Eastern views of gender in the \u2018Other\u2019s space\u2019. Women\u2019s freedoms have changed; progress on freedoms and regressions have both taken place. \u2022 Incorporating masculinity: How can we reflect the role of males, females and sexual minorities in addressing and inhibiting inequalities; given the rapid changes in Asia impacting gender relations, how can we recognize and factor in the stress on all sexes? \u2022 Inequalities: What are the underlying causes, factors that inhibit change, and how should they be explored? \u2022 Macro vs. micro: Recognition that \u2018Win-win\u2019 at macro level may be win-loose at the household level. Introducing the overall framework of \u2018unequal power and voice\u2019, she presented si x sub-themes for consideration by Asia stakeholders. These sub -themes emerged through brainstorming work-shops earlier in the year. 1. Political power: Gender in justice systems \u2013 laws, lawmakers, traditional and introduced, on the books and on the street. 2. Economic power: Investing in gender equity \u2013 context of inclusive growth and globalization. 3. Gender in crisis: Breakdown in social relations. 4. Gender, energy and environment: Adapting to climate change, securing livelihoods. 5. Gender, mobility and migration 6. Gender based violence (GBV): Beyond domestic violence. She concluded the presentation by recapping the objectives of the consultation and underlined the need to prioritise the themes of most relevance to the Asia region by stakeholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67c2a1a6-48ba-432b-8bd1-f9613bf562c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "67c2a1a6-48ba-432b-8bd1-f9613bf562c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the South and East Asia Stakeholders Consultation - Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44332ff596eda554ef0f58c0b7c2d374e00ad3a7706255ea8d88ebac721f1e20"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1bb4b07-8b03-4d02-974e-804550ac1d42", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c0e2ca0814840d997babbdf5f3bd3deb08c1d85f2a27581c352fb3a34c8e711"}}, "hash": "99d1a1138a36a0ea093c2ad9fb9d24a5628e63cdb3335df0382fe59dfdf06687", "text": "Current Trends and Issues for Asia on Gender: Yumiko Yamamoto, Gender and Trade Advisor, Trade Team, RCC The presentation focused on the following questions: Has economic development in Asia reduced gender equality?

Women\u2019s labour force participation rates are high in developing countries that are in agricultural phase. After that the rates went down then rose again as the economy developed. \u2022 The level of gender earning gap varies across the region and the different stages of economic evolution. \u2022 The crisis has different impacts on women and men. During and after the recession and Asian financial crisis, women lost their jobs first in Japan where women\u2019s labour is considered as a \u2018buffer\u2019 to adjust to the rises and falls of the economic growth. In the Philippines, there was a tendency for women to be overworked. \u2022 There are some cases to show that men are vulnerable to economic crisis partly because of their access to (formal) credit. For instance in Japan suicide rates increased after the recession in the 1990s (more than 30,000 suicides each year); and the majority of debt-related suicides are found among men. In India suicides rates among male farmers in the South Indian states have increased after the production of cash crops, which was encouraged in the course of liberalization, failed due to drought. \u2022 Economic drivers affect issues such as crisis and gender based violence (GBV). How quickly victims can escape violence partly depends on his or her economic security. \u2022 Women are major stakeholders in the course of economic development but women have been left out of the economic policy discussions. How will policies change once women and poorer people are included in the policy discussion? At the close of the session, the Chair for the session highlighted that the upcoming APHDR on the theme of gender would need to consider many issues. What are the dimensions of the interaction between global and regional dimensions of ge nder? Asia has particular characteristics, for example the lack of gender equal political participation in the region. Simultaneously Asia has the highest number of elected female heads of states (a majority of these are Muslim women). But this does not always get translated into gender equity at different levels of political participation. Gender indices appear to be weak and data is lacking globally. Refined and better indices of gender equity are required. Lastly, we need to examine the phenomenon wherein economic transformation has not led to gender equality. For example Japan has experienced a remarkable economic transformation but has very complicated gender issues. The Chair concluded the session by thanking stakeholders for their participation. 8 10:45-12:45 Session II: Stakeholder Experiences Chair: Ramesh Gampat, HDRU, RCC Tour De Table of National Stakeholders Participants presented key issues, concerns, experiences and good practices from their countries on gender inequality and gender gaps. Afghanistan \u2022 The situation confronting women is characterized by unequal power and discrimination at every stage and level, including in directives, implementation and resource allocations. Women in leadership, management and in general are invisible in society. \u2022 At the same time the policy environment for gender equity is very conducive. The constitution contains provisions on equality of women and men. The National Development strategy provides for elimination of all kinds of discrimination against women. But in practice, these policies don\u2019t translate into effective actions or in state interventions for promoting gender equity. \u2022 Health and education for women are priority concerns. The maternal mortality rate is very high. Without improvement of women\u2019s health status, progress of women in education will be affected. Women have limited access to education, particularly higher education. \u2022 The status of women is greatly influenced by traditional society and misinterpretation of Islamic rules. \u2022 Although the question of insecurity is paramount, the strong gender dimensions of women\u2019s security issues are completely overlooked. \u2022 There are unrealistic expectations from the International community which expect actions to take place overnight on human de velopment and gender inequality. \u2022 The APHDR is a timely initiative as it will encourage Afghanistan and other countries in the region to focus on gender equality. Bangladesh \u2022 Women\u2019s empowerment including political empowerment ha s experienced a quiet revolution. There is a high proportion of women in the labour force. The country has had two female Prime Ministers. \u2022 Bangladesh has made progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals and targets by achieving gender parity in school enrolment and improving access to pure drinking water. Free education has been introduced. \u2022 Awareness among young women about their legal", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c103e2f1-976f-48ba-809b-ef4837e377ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "c103e2f1-976f-48ba-809b-ef4837e377ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the South and East Asia Stakeholders Consultation - Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31ea34801713619514ad3f2a68921c537458d4ce3036378e94b366e50a38a670"}}, "hash": "31ea34801713619514ad3f2a68921c537458d4ce3036378e94b366e50a38a670", "text": "rights is growing. Women\u2019s human rights are being promoted through the National Development Policy. Women\u2019s Development Policy supports equal rights for women and men. 9 However Islamic groups are protesting against these policies as being un - Islamic. \u2022 In local councils women are contesting for membership and getting elected. Women are also joining administration, police and army se rvices which is a unique phenomenon among Muslim countries. \u2022 There are ongoing discussions on gender inequality within civil society and the UN in urban centres\u2019. However these issues have not reached or influenced rural areas. Bhutan \u2022 With a small population of 700,000, the Government has developed a unique index of Gross National Happiness. Bhutan\u2019s Development Policy prioritizes women through the draft National Action Plan on Gender focusing on 7 key areas. \u2022 The gender profile is considered conducive for women\u2019s empowerment. However discriminatory practices do exist in some areas. For instance women\u2019s representation is only 3 per cent in the National Assembly, 6 per cent in the judiciary and 28 per cent in the civil service. \u2022 Women\u2019s participation as voters has increased recently. Women have been elected as well as nominated. \u2022 Labour force participation of women in Bhutan is concentrated mostly in rural areas and in agriculture. The late start in modern education in the country, may have affected women\u2019s literacy, which remains low and is one cause of the gender gap in employment. Female unemployment is also higher than male unemployment. \u2022 Violence against women exists despite laws. Victims suffer from social stigma, emotional and financial insecurity and a lack of support mechanisms. Prejudice and stereotypes reinforce gender roles and responsibilities. Cambodia \u2022 Traditional beliefs continue to be reflected in contemporary attitudes and practices which discriminate against women. \u2022 The Government has developed strategic policy interventions. Gender has been mainstreamed in the National Strategic Development Plan. MDG indicators have been expanded to focus on gender inequalities. There is support for gender mainstreaming in line ministries. Laws against Domestic violence, human trafficking and sexual exploitation have been passed recently. \u2022 There is a traditional saying which symbolizes men as gold and women as white cloth which should not be soiled. Such sayings illustrate the prevailing mindsets in society. The women\u2019s ministry has adopted a new symbol that shows women are precious gems and men are gold. 10 \u2022 Cambodia has low levels of education, high drop out rates and late entry in education particularly for girls. Low levels of education constrain women\u2019s employment and livelihood opportunities. High maternal mortality, low nutritional status and vulnerability to HIV-AIDS all impact heavily on women. \u2022 Accessing economic opportunities and rights are difficult for women. The problem of high and unsafe migration leads to exploitation (particularly sexual). GBV is a major issue for women. The high rate of domestic violence is also linked to the country\u2019s history of genocide. \u2022 GEM is very low by regional standards. Women are greatly under- represented in government. Representation in the legislative branches is gradually increasing as well as in commune councils. \u2022 Cambodia faces a substantial human resources gap due to the genocide which affects its capacity to deliver services. The genocide targeted educated and professional people who were killed or forced to leave. Capacity development is a strategic management priority. \u2022 Most resources for development are from donors. Donor pressure affects the policy environment. \u2022 Moving from plans to effective implementation requires cultivating state commitment, developing capacity for gender mainstreaming and ensuring adequate resources. Strategic programmes include womens economic empowerment, women in governance, targeting attitudes, combating GBV and protection from HIV-AIDS. China \u2022 The CEDAW committee and Chinese NGOs have outlined major areas of concerns for gender inequality in China. Chinese domestic legislation and policy level measures need to be gender sensitized. Domestic legislation does not define discrimination against women, domestic violence, sexual harassment and marital rape. \u2022 Strategies for fighting gender inequality in China include enhancing the government\u2019s legal commitments and accountability for implementation. While gender is included in the Constitution, and some gender sensitive laws have been passed, the gap between laws and implementation needs to be bridged. The national programme for development of Chinese women should be integrated with CEDAW, Beijing Platform and MDGs. \u2022 Women\u2019s representation in political bodies, National Congress and Village committees is low. Quotas remain a controversial issue and \u2018appropriate proportion\u2019 policies have been misinterpreted in implementation in some cases. \u2022 Women\u2019s labour force participation is concentrated in low wage sectors. Women are generally paid less than men and are vulnerable to unsafe working conditions and trafficking for labour exploitation. \u2022 GBV is a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6cd1baa-ba76-46a6-975c-bbbceb5449ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6cd1baa-ba76-46a6-975c-bbbceb5449ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the South and East Asia Stakeholders Consultation - Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a8d19903c83cd30c96baefa134b1e1381e30e563cb07a942f4588e7ff99496b"}}, "hash": "2a8d19903c83cd30c96baefa134b1e1381e30e563cb07a942f4588e7ff99496b", "text": "major concern, with the sex ratio of 119 boys for every 100 girls resulting in millions of \u2018missing women\u2019.

Lack of reliable statistics to accurately estimate GBV in different forms is a challenge. \u2022 Strategies employed against GBV include the Combating Domestic Violence Network of the China Law Society and the China Gender Facility. India \u2022 Access to justice is a key obstacle for women due to illiteracy, the slow nature of the judicial system and corrupt lawyers. \u2022 Principles of gender equality exist in the Constitution and preamble, measures to protect women such as the Dowry Prohibition act, the Hindu Succession Act and the Domestic Violence Law have been passed, but lack of funding affects their implementation. Bodies such as the NHRC exclude women as only members of the (mostly male) judiciary can be appointed. An Act against sexual harassment is in progress. \u2022 The Ministry of Women and Child Development is now a stand -alone Ministry (previously under the Ministry of Human Resources). The Ministry of Finance has partnered with each Ministry as a policy, earmarking high budgets for at least two gender sensitive schemes. \u2022 There are some innovative schemes where Gender Budget provisions have resulted in converged services. One such scheme is the Chiranjeevi Yojana in Gujarat. Due to high maternal mortality, the Government costed deliveries in 5 districts and signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a public -private partnership. Services are provided to families below the poverty line. This initiative is successful and needs to be expanded in scale. \u2022 There are gender components in many programmes (such as Reproductive and Child Health [RCH] and Elementary Education). An example of good practice was the consultation of women\u2019s groups on the design of transportation by the Ministry of Science and Technology. Buses without seats were demanded by women as they were unable to put their produce on top of the bus. By simply asking, solutions such as this one came ab out. Indonesia \u2022 Men and women\u2019s rights are guaranteed in the national constitution and other frameworks on Human Rights, education, employment and social welfare. There is a Presidential Decree to integrate a gender perspective into all programmes of Government ministries. However in reality, gender inequality persists in every sector of society. \u2022 Persistent traditional and patriarchal norms, misinterpretation of religious teaching and rise of fundamentalism are increasing gender inequality. There is increasing GBV and trafficking of women. \u2022 There are wide gender gaps in some indicators. Illiteracy among women is double than that of men. Maternal mortality is the highest among ASEAN countries, while migration and trafficking of women are both increasing. The ratio of boys and girls in primary/ secondary education is almost equal. 12 \u2022 There is low participation of women in formal employment. Women are concentrated in the informal sector (often difficult, low paid and dangerous jobs) 86 per cent of men are in the labour force in comparison to 50 per cent of women. Women generally get low paid jobs both in the private sector (e.g. in the textile industry) as well as in government. \u2022 The National Ministry for Women is trying to coordinate, monitor and evaluate and help implement gender policy, but gender sensitivity at the executive level is low. Laws have been passed to promote affirmative action in political parties and to combat human trafficking. The gender equality policy has been integrated into the Mid Term Development Plan 2004-2009. \u2022 Decentralised gender sensitive planning, budgeting, implementing and monitoring under the Mid Term Development Plan is in process. Gender disaggregated data is a priority area. Islamic Republic of Iran \u2022 Gender issues have been affected by political factors. Changes from reformist to conservative government has shifted perceptions, from seeing women as individuals to women as linked to family. There is tension between women\u2019s groups and government. \u2022 There is a National Action Plan on gender issues and there have been improvements in health, family planning and education. The number of women as graduates is an achievement but finding employment opportunities is a challenge for women. 80 per cent of the economy is in men\u2019s hands. \u2022 Political participation is low (only 12 out of 290 Parliamentary members are women). \u2022 Building capacity for gender empowerment is a priority. Good practices to build on include an initiative of the Association of Iranian journalists. This is a project on human rights and gender.

Lao PDR \u2022 Unsafe migration, and mobility of women is a significant concern. Statistics show that Thailand is the most common destination and migration is primarily illegal. Female migrants (between 15-20 per cent) work in Thai families. The pull factor is the shortage of unskilled labour in Thailand and the push factor s are the low level of education in Laos, combined with poverty and a lack of economic opportunities. \u2022 Trafficking and the sex trade are associated problem areas. Women are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, HIV-AIDS and drugs addiction. \u2022 Agencies such as International Organisation for Migration (IOM) are engaged in programmes to support migrants such as pre-departure briefing. There are new views of positive effects on economic growth of migrant remittances. However there is a trade-off: temporary workers and out-migration can affect domestic development. 13 \u2022 Although the government has made a lot of progress on CEDAW, stereo - typical attitudes are prevalent, and enforcement of laws is not adequate. The CEDAW committee has recommended that the Government of Laos should raise awareness, collect more gender disaggregated data and criminalise marital rape. \u2022 Mechanisms for the advancement of women are not sufficiently strong. Government officials do not have a good understanding of gender issues. \u2022 It is important to raise awareness for changing behaviour and negative norms, and build capacity both in central and local government. \u2022 Law enforcement measures need to be designed and measures for women\u2019s advancement need to put into place. Women need to be included in all levels of leadership. Malaysia \u2022 There has been progressive advancement of women. Maternal mortality is low and women have a high life expectancy. 61 per cent of women are in tertiary education. \u2022 The national Gender Gap Index, demonstrates a narrow gap on health and education but a wide gap in the labour force and political representation. \u2022 Policy interventions have been initiated \u2013 for example setting up Child Care Centres for increasing women\u2019s participation in the labour force. Maldives \u2022 Violence against women is a major concern in Maldives, one in every five women has experienced some kind of violence in her lifetime. \u2022 The country is going through rapid political and constitutional change, and political parties have expanded. Women can increasingly participate and push for more gender sensitive laws. \u2022 There is a lack of gender sensitive laws, despite the fact that the law already criminalises marital rape. A law against domestic violence is being enacted. \u2022 The 2006 census is not gender disaggregated, nor are statistical data in the country. \u2022 On the positive side, maternal mortality rate has been declining, there are sustained high rates of literacy (100 per cent enrollment in primary education and not much gender disparity). The labour force participation rate has doubled from 37 per cent in 2006. However with rapid economic growth there are large disparities in men and women\u2019s economic participation. \u2022 Drugs are an issue and prostitution is increasing. 14 Mongolia \u2022 In the policy sphere, there is political commitment. Women have Equal Rights constitutionally, and the CEDAW and Human Rights Conventions have been signed. While laws exist, their enforcement is an issue. It is important to consider if the fundamental causes of gender inequality are being addressed, despite political commitment. \u2022 Other policy measures can negatively affect gender equality. For example, the population growth rate is supposed to increase from 1.2 per cent to 4 per cent according to an official policy directing each woman to have 4 children to reach this level of growth. The UN and civil society has had a dialogue on this issue with government. This demonstrates what the UN can do to promote gender equality. \u2022 There is mainstreaming machinery in place, however gender focal points are invisible as they don\u2019t have resources or capacity. Procedures are not routinised. \u2022 The High Level Committee has changed several times which affects formulation of gender sensitive measures. Civil society has been very active in advocating for gender equality. \u2022 Statistics on gender gaps and gender inequali ty need to be clearly communicated to policy-makers. For example, generalizations such as \u2018poor people\u2019 need to be avoided, and instead the gender -disaggregated effects on poor women and men should be articulated. Myanmar \u2022 Traditionally, the relationship between men and women is seen as harmonious. However gender gaps exist in many spheres and are complicated by several factors such as lack of political participation of women in the state. The current priority for the country is democratic transformation and not gender. \u2022 There is no effective national machinery to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6ec5394-797d-4225-8245-d1cb5afcfbac": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6ec5394-797d-4225-8245-d1cb5afcfbac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the South and East Asia Stakeholders Consultation - Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "049b4566159e1b29cbef1c75b1adf90386243d3366d2ea486e6b2d5de12f6414"}}, "hash": "049b4566159e1b29cbef1c75b1adf90386243d3366d2ea486e6b2d5de12f6414", "text": "advise the government on gender issues and priorities, nor are there civil society organisations for women. \u2022 Reliable and credible data is lacking. In the border areas there is no information on GBV. Literacy rates are high as per government figures, but credible and reliable information does not exist. Nepal \u2022 Government efforts to improve gender equality have increased. However most gender focal points lack resources and capacity. \u2022 A gender-responsive budget committee has been established in the Ministry of Finance. From the current fiscal year, gender audits, gender budgets introduced in ministries. \u2022 A quota for women\u2019s political participation could be instrumental in encouraging gender equality. However there is a high degree of gender 15 discrimination, particularly as rural women are negatively impacted by armed conflict. \u2022 Trafficking is a huge problem, as are wage disparities, low skills and pay- scales. \u2022 Nepal is at the crossroads of social and political participation, this is the proper time and opportunity to ensure adequate measures to promote gender equality: legal provisions and policies; institutional sensitization; and strengthening the voices of women. Phillipines \u2022 While there have been many laws promulgated, weak legal frameworks, customary laws and household relationships are concerns. \u2022 Multiple discriminations linked to age, residence, ethnicity, religion and gender orientation exist. Vulnerabilities of children and women exist in areas of conflict and natural disasters. \u2022 There are gender inequalities in employment opportunities; occupational segmentation have increased out-migration, and there are negative impacts on women of globalization in areas such as in agriculture. \u2022 There is low representation of women in governance and judiciary. \u2022 Laws and policies have been put into place for gender mainstreaming: gender planning, Gender and Development (GAD) budgeting and capacity building. \u2022 Successes have been demonstrated in gender statistics, planning and policy and gender budgeting including at local levels. The department of education is incorporating gender sensitive components in basic education. Gender studies exist in the curriculum of higher education. \u2022 A women\u2019s legislative agenda has been prepared and presented to legislators for sponsorship in the senate and house of representatives. \u2022 Greater efforts have been made to enlist interest and commitments from different sectors for promoting gender equality goals. For example, there are groups like men organized for Violence Against Women and Children. New directions for financing GAD programmes are also being developed. Republic of Korea \u2022 Gender Impact Analysis (GIA) is a major intervention at central and state levels. As part of this differential impacts of policies on men and women are identified. Gender considerations are integrated under GIA through planning, design and implementation of programmes. \u2022 Several laws have been enacted to remove legal gender discrimination. The main laws to promote gender equity are the Equal Employment Act and Women\u2019s Employment Act. However de-jure gender equality is still remote. 16 \u2022 Gender budgeting is aimed at mainstreaming gender concerns in public finance and a number of Parliamentarians have been involved. In 2006 a national Fiscal Management Act was published. This sets a deadline of 2010 for gender components to be published in the Budget. \u2022 Education of public officials is a priority to ensure that gender sensitive thinking is institutionalized. \u2022 Over simplification of methodology needs to be avoided. Sri Lanka \u2022 The context of gender inequality is characterized by social barriers and concepts of impurity. While a woman may be in a high position in the public sphere, at home she may not be treated equally. The prevalence of GBV, pornography and negative images of women are negative factors. The media has a central role to counter stereotypes and sex symbol images of women . \u2022 The State has taken measures to combat gender inequality . While policies exist, gender equality does not exist. \u2022 There is a high literacy rate of women, yet women are concentrated in unskilled employment or are unemployed. For example, many women work in plantations, yet few women are in Trade Unions. Glass ceilings for women exist in employment. \u2022 Women have high rates of voting, but low political representation. \u2022 There are also some successes. For example, sexual harassment committees and children\u2019s desks in police stations have been established; in addition complaints mechanisms and programmes for the sensitization of the police have been introduced. Thailand \u2022 The experience of gender equality mainstreaming by the Government of Thailand via the CGEO policy mechanism is a significant initiative. A gender equality officer is selected from each Ministry. Chief Technical Officers/Chief Gender Equality Officers (CGEOs) have been established in 19 central ministries. There are 129 departments and independent organizations that implement the policy. \u2022 Throughout the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfa49231-5b1c-4511-b758-62a84566e49d": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfa49231-5b1c-4511-b758-62a84566e49d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the South and East Asia Stakeholders Consultation - Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa397bcd0d7e31d58fa6f6c5917f98314f11aa28c72640bf3c32492f7cb551ca"}}, "hash": "aa397bcd0d7e31d58fa6f6c5917f98314f11aa28c72640bf3c32492f7cb551ca", "text": "year, the government organizes workshops for gender mainstreaming and analysis. These are also used for reviewing and monitoring gender sensitive approaches and statistics. \u2022 Work is ongoing with Ministry of Education. Government officials are also being trained in the area of gender statistics. Timor Leste \u2022 There are low levels of women\u2019s representation in Ministries. There are also major gender inequalities in the areas of health and employment. 17 \u2022 Laws related to gender inequality have been promulgat ed. An initial CEDAW report has been finalized. \u2022 Women traditionally do not participate in political decision-making. Parliament has set a quota for women\u2019s participation at the Suqa level. \u2022 There are more boys than girls in higher levels of education. Although girls enrolment since 2006 has increased, secondary education for girls shows declining trends. \u2022 Timor Leste has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in South East Asia. \u2022 Bride price and high trafficking have contributed to low female status. Pakistan \u2022 A key issue is how power effects gender inequality. Due to Talibanisation in some areas there has been an erosion of the state in terms of addressing gender inequality at the household level. \u2022 Good quality data availability is a challenge, especially sex-disaggregated data and other gender-sensitive ways or organizing data. There are varying sources and unreliable quality of data which hinders the state\u2019s ability to act. \u2022 Civil society has become the main channel for donor assistance a nd is also a significant development partner of the government. The media is playing an important role in advocating for sensitive issues as well as providing checks and balances. \u2022 Routinisation of gender concerns is very important and it is important to move away from projects and move towards instruments such as expenditure and budgeting. Mainstreaming is one of the biggest challenges. Vietnam \u2022 There are comprehensive legislative frameworks for gender inequality and government funding committed to women\u2019s machinery. Effective implementation remains a challenge. \u2022 There are no overall gender gaps in primary and secondary education and there is strong labour force participation by women. \u2022 Cultural factors and beliefs are important although sensitive. Men are considered to be the head of the household, and practices such as sex selection exist. \u2022 Climate change is also a very significant factor. This is likely to have a disproportionate impact on women. \u2022 Macro-economic issues affecting gender inequality a re high inflation rates, movement of women from public to private sectors, privatization of basic services. These issues are also linked to health care provision. 18 \u2022 There are gender data gaps around gender based violence. Causality will be very important in this discussion. It is essential to consider the intersection of socio-economic stratification and gender inequality, as there is growing inequality accompanied by economic growth. \u2022 Strategic areas for reducing gender gaps could include macro-economic policy, climate change interventions, engaging men and addressing men\u2019s risk taking behaviour, and improving the evidence base for gender policy. \u2022 Experiences for investing in gender equality include mechanisms for working on gender equality (UN Gender Joint Programme) and the development and implementation of two gender laws Summary by Chair The Chair for the session remarked on the complexity of gender inequality which defies a one dimensional analysis. Any strategy to reduce the gap would need to be multi-pronged to be implemented seriously. The country presentations had raised diverse and core issues in the discussion and his concluding observations were as follows. \u2022 Policies: Many good policies have been established to promote gender concerns, but progress has not been commensurate. International agencies want to see progress overnight and have failed to realize that concerns are deep-rooted, that the necessary institutions do not exist or need strengthening. \u2022 Progress: Some progress has been made in dealing with gender inequality. At least if not in closing the gap then in preventing it from widening at an accelerating rate. More importantly there has been progress in raising awareness. Here the role of the media is crucial, but more needs to be done on the advocacy front, particularly in rural areas which is one of the places where a change in mindset needs to happen. The change in mindset is necessary to promote representation in decision making bodies. \u2022 Capacity and skills: A large proportion of women are still illiterate even after talking about gender inequality for decades now. But more importantly health is a serious concern, for example Maternal Mortality Rate is extremely high in many countries. Unless one has very good health there is little that one can do to promote women\u2019s advancement and gender", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fd1f9ec-3c63-4939-80a8-918269a6713c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fd1f9ec-3c63-4939-80a8-918269a6713c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the South and East Asia Stakeholders Consultation - Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a550c92db7b1dc4296b5e8435ef38e190b5fe1a9da15191af56d222243584ba"}}, "hash": "2a550c92db7b1dc4296b5e8435ef38e190b5fe1a9da15191af56d222243584ba", "text": "equality. \u2022 Violence: Gender Based Violence is high. One of the issues of concern is that it seems to be accepted by many communities. GBV has led to high suicide rates among women. Women are afraid to report to the police. Sri Lanka has an innovative approach: it has a special complaint unit. \u2022 Migration and trafficking: This includes sexual exploitation driven by poverty. High rates of unemployment could at first provoke migration but this might end up as trafficking. \u2022 Data: More disaggregated data is required. Many have doubts on the validity of data. There are also too many statistics drawn from disparate sources of data: selecting the right data to be used is a concern. 19 \u2022 Political commitment: Gender issues and how they are taken on, are influenced by the prevailing political conditions. in Iran, for instance, there is a drift from looking at gender issues from the level of the individual to the household level. Another view articulated was that political commitment by itself is not sufficient. It may raise awareness but that is different from actually addressing the issues. Political commitment may only exist on paper. \u2022 Legal systems: A large percentage of women are illiterate and do not understand the laws. Laws need to be made gender sensitive, reviewed or re - drafted. Gender sensitivity among politicians needs to be improved. There needs to be effective national machinery to address gender causes. \u2022 Gender budgeting: Examples were raised from a few countries such as Indonesia, and Nepal for example. Public projects need to implemented and monitored for gender sensitivity. \u2022 Champions: The need to raise awareness was seen as paramount. \u2022 Role of CSOs: what its role in promoting gender equality? SYNTHESIS OF KEY FINDINGS FROM COUNTRY PRESENTATIONS Ongoing measures in place \u2022 Progress has been made on constitutional provisions, legislation and affirmative action in some countries \u2022 CEDAW has been ratified by most countries \u2022 Women\u2019s concerns are mainstreamed at the formal level in many national development strategies \u2022 Gender budgeting has been adopted in some countries \u2013 in general it is auditing post facto instead of ex-ante measures \u2022 Women\u2019s quotas in decision-making bodies have been enacted or plans for enactment exist Successes \u2022 Women\u2019s socio-economic and political empowerment has progressed significantly \u2022 There have been improvements in access to education for girls and women \u2022 Gender sensitive schemes have been implemented on a varying scale in most countries \u2022 Women\u2019s political participation has increased at the national level though membership in local bodies remains low \u2022 Women are increasingly working in public administration, police and armies Issues and Challenges \u2022 Women\u2019s health is an issue in many countries 20 \u2022 Gender focal points exist in governments but lack capacity and resources \u2022 Data gaps are a significant issue for evidence based policy making \u2022 Gender-Based Violence is a concern across many countries \u2022 Lack of political will on gender equality \u2022 Lack of capacity to implement laws on the ground particularly in post conflict countries \u2022 Prejudice, stigma and stereotyping of women \u2022 Unsafe migration, mobility and trafficking \u2022 Women in the labour force are concentrated in low wage sectors \u2022 Sex-ratio between boys and girls major concern in China and India 14:00-16:15 Session III: Focusing the APHDR, Asian priorities Chair: Anuradha Rajivan, Regional Programme Coordinator, HDRU, RCC The Chair introduced the session and explained the exercise. The participants we re divided into four groups. Each group selected two themes provided (but not limited to) the breakout groups guidance note related to gender inequality. Participants were asked to examine the themes through a Human Development lens, and finally to synthesize their discussion into issues, solutions and three or more key messages to be shared in the plenary. The main objectives of the session were priortisation of themes for the APHDR. Each group would need to select the first of their chosen themes and di scuss materiality for the sub-region or multiple countries. Themes should be selected for their strategic relevance in bringing about change. The groups would need to consider types of gender-based inequalities and their effects, factors inhibiting positive change and roles of different social groups and structures. The group work could consider policy options, including ways to address the inhibiting factors. The Group work in this session produced the following presentations on Priority Theme 1. Each group identified also the second priority to be discussed in detail on the second day of the consultation.

The group chose political power and justice systems as priority theme one which incorporates voice and representation \u2013 both sensitive issues. This theme includes Gender Based Violence, rights based approaches, participation in decision making, legal instruments including CEDAW, empowerment to claim rights, and buy-in from leaders and senior decision makers. 21 Strategic relevance \u2022 Once you give the voice to women you can make the wider change. This allows you to address other key sub-theme issues (climate change, crisis management etc.). \u2022 CEDAW and instruments provide leverage to pressure governments. Issues \u2022 Inhibiting factors are: mindsets, unequal power in the household, ideas of masculinity and femininity (both held by women and men), popular culture and education promoting these, internalised gender identities and roles, lack of political will, governance constraints, weak institutional arrangements/support and economic dependence of women. \u2022 There is a need to distinguish between de-jure and de-facto power and actual decision-making processes. Who has the actual power? \u2022 Cultural and social aspects are inhibiting factors. Decision -makers need to be sensitized. \u2022 Countries have different issues, it is important to distinguish between countries where laws and policies are not yet in place, and those where they are in place but implementation is the issue. \u2022 There may be significant numbers of women in Parliament but this may not have sufficient impact. For example if there are strong party power relations, women may not have actual decision-making power. Numbers are the first step, but an understanding of how power and decision making functions is required. \u2022 The gender dimensions of property ownership, inheritance law, family law, adoption, family, marriage, nationality and citizenship laws have to be reviewed. Nationality laws often make women and children stateless. They cannot access services or benefits; the children of divorced parents may also suffer. \u2022 Measurement of inequality should include how men and women are treated differently under the law, extent of membership in political parties, unions, business leadership, differentiated treatment of certain sectors (family, some institutions are excluded from anti-discrimination laws in certain countries), case studies on access to justice. Solutions \u2022 Catalytic interventions would include building a social consensus, advocacy, legal reform, sensitizing media, men and decision-makers \u2022 Allocating budgets and other resources \u2022 Sharing knowledge and examples \u2022 Dialogue and buy-in from religious leaders \u2022 Facilitating new or changing leadership \u2022 Evidence based interventions \u2022 Demonstrated benefits Key messages \u2022 Need to sensitise decision-makers and agenda setters and make them allies and champions (CSOs, national mechanism, media, academics, international community) 22 \u2022 Assemble and present the evidence for policy and legal reform (as above as well as research institutes, government stats offices, Minis try of Planning, legislatures) \u2022 Raise awareness and sense of entitlement to exercise and claim rights of people at grass-roots and marginalized groups \u2022 Create incentives and disincentives for key decision -makers and agenda setters (governments and international community) Group B Priority Theme 1: Investing in Gender Equality Priority Theme 2: Gender and Justice Systems There was a discussion on all the themes, after a voting exercise, the group selected the overarching theme of Investing in Gender Equality . The group incorporated gender policies and laws as a dimension within this theme including institutional reform, data systems, budgets, policies and laws. The second theme selected was Gender and Justice systems. However, the group highlighted that an o verlap exists between the two themes selected. GBV, which received the highest number of votes, was not suggested as a priority theme. The group felt that GBV is a manifestation of gender inequality, and an HDR would be able to add value by focusing on underlying issues. Strategic Relevance \u2022 Gender gaps are persisting, prevailing and increasing. \u2022 Cross- country aspect and subsumes many other issues. \u2022 Investment means channeling resources into a policy formation and law making, planning, budgeting and monitoring for Gender Inequality. \u2022 Investment also requires building capacities for Implementation. Investment has a supply and demand side. Supply side is policy makers, law makers, State implementing bodies, private sector. Therefore there are Rights bearers and Duty holders.

Budgets in some countries are at local levels. However, women need knowledge and awareness so that they can exert their voices at this and other levels. Harnessing the collective voice of women and ensuring that they have voice not just participation, as well as the capability to make informed choices requires concerted action. In some countries, women are in Parliament, but they do not exert voice, do not understand their roles, so real participation is the challenge. \u2022 Socio-Economic inequality in all spheres of life: Social exclusion of women from change processes, gender Inequality in access to gender justice systems, wage gaps and glass ceilings. Due to globalization there is social stratification and widening gender gaps that need investments. 23 \u2022 Attitudes and prevailing traditional practices: Role of beliefs, cultural dimensions, religion and patriarchy that aggravate gender discrimination . These influence communities and women in particular to see discrimination as a way of life. Relationships within the household remain unequal and reinforce the voicelessness of women, e.g. On resource allocations, girls going to school, nutrition and caregivers role versus or as part of the labour force. \u2022 Inadequate resource allocation and budgets: There are gender blind/ insensitive budgets in most regions and areas. Although CEDAW commitments have been ratified, compliance should be monitored and resources particularly in health and education have to allocated to actualize commitment. Justice and law systems need reform and commitment and enforcement mechanisms need funding. Solutions Political inequality \u2022 Support electoral processes (law making and implementation) for greater representation of women at all levels. The group felt that policies should go beyond mere quotas and should embrace support for processes including law-making. This also includes of drafting of gender sensitive electoral laws. Examples: \u2022 In Malaysia, the Government in August 2004 adopted the policy of at least 30 per cent women at decision-making levels in public sector. UNDP is working with legislative, judicial and executive institutions on trying to ensure that the policy of at least 30 per cent women at decision -making levels will be met. \u2022 In Indonesia, there is an existing quota that is not being implemented. Lobbying of political parties for implementation of these laws by the media, is an innovative approach. \u2022 In Thailand, there are constitutional provisions for the representation of women in the political process. However quotas can also be limiting. In China, it was observed that once the quota was met, there was often no further action. \u2022 Capacity building of female representatives on governance at all levels: The concerns were that even if women are elected they o ften do not have voice. Examples of such capacity support are Women\u2019s Associations of elected officials/representatives - these can help support voice, women\u2019s caucuses, political education and awareness. Socio/ Economic inequality in all spheres of life \u2022 Enhance awareness amongst women and local community o f women\u2019s role in participation in the development process. \u2022 Asset ownership and inheritance laws need to be enacted as they are important for women\u2019s social and economic empowerment. \u2022 Target resource allocation in planning, implementation and M&E and women\u2019s participation in these processes. Attitudes and prevailing traditional practices 24 \u2022 Influence opinion makers and religious leaders to lobby for change. \u2022 Popular media needs to be sensitized, alt ernative media, responsible journalism, films, television etc and projecting women and men in non - traditional roles. \u2022 Advertising industry is another area that reinforces traditional stereotypes. There is a need to sensitize them to move beyond the depiction of women as commodities and in more gender balanced roles. Inadequate resource allocation and budgets \u2022 Gender budgeting, resource allocations, planning and monitoring for national and sub-national budgets.

She observed that a lot of ground had been covered in the country presentations and the group work had been very fruitful in assigning which themes would be strategic and transformative entry points for the APHDR. All the sessions tied into each other and complementarities between themes emerged. In this session, four possible themes emerged as Priority Theme 1 for the APHDR \u2022 Political Power and Justice System \u2022 Investing in Gender Equality \u2022 Mobility and Migration \u2022 Legal Systems and Access to Justice She highlighted the cross-cutting issues of relevance to be carried forward in relation to the overall discussion. These areas included the role of media and civil society organizations, policies and governance structures, the i ssue of accountability in the justice system, formal and informal justice systems, culture and religion and the complementarities of official structures and alternative systems. Many of these roles are critical in the articulation of gender inequality and would need to be explored in detail for the APHDR. Looking at the day\u2019s discussion, she also observed that it was clear that in the realm of gender equality, progress on policy formulation has been made by many countries. However the need for skills and capacity remains paramount. Policy interventions such as gender based budgeting were touched upon but remain important concerns. Gender Based Violence emerged as a serious issue across the region. The Chair thanked all the participants and closed the session. 9:00 - 10:15 Session V: Measures, Trends and Priorities for Asia Chair: Anuradha Rajivan, Regional Programme Coordinator, HDRU/RCC The Chair opened the session and noted the significance of measurement for capturing the issue of gender inequality at the macro-level and household micro- level. Selection of data and availability of the correct data is important for the AP HDR on gender to be of policy relevance. Approaches for capturing vulnerability are as equally important as achievement and empowerment measures such as GDI and GEM.

It was observed that gender gaps have existed since time immemorial and some societies have been more successful at dealing with them. Gender gaps are ultimately are about power and competition, unequal power, unequal treatment, unequal rewards. Popular measures such as the GDI and GEM are complex and difficult to understand. They have been less successful than expected. These indices are beset by several conceptual and empirical issues: \u2022 GDI/GEM are composite measures. The GDI focuses on gender inequality in Human Development while GEM focuses on gender equality in economic and political power for economically advantaged women. The empirical data illustrates that the correlations between GDI and HDI are close \u2013 the GDI tracks HDI closely. However the correlation between GDI and GEM is not close and varies across countries. \u2022 GDI/GEM are difficult to understand and interpret. In GDI there is the problem of dominance of the earned income component - equal penalty applied to all gaps for both GDI and GEM. The GDI underestimates the gender gap and tracks mortality, not health and morbidity. The GEM also suffers from data unavailability which results in low coverage and comparability. Moving towards more intuitive and finely calibrated measurement of gender inequality is important. An alternative index based on the methodology of the HDI can be constructed readily using the plural dimensions of gender vulnerability. The presenter proposed an alternative approach. \u2022 Drawing from Sen\u2019s \u201cplural view of gender inequality\u201d, it is possible to look at observable factors (multiple dimensions) that make men and women vulnerable to unequal power and unequal treatment. \u2022 A new index (GVI-Gender Vulnerability Index) can be composed using six dimensions of vulnerability drawing from the plural view concept. These six dimensions combine and add new categories to factor in over-laps and data limitations. \u2022 The six dimensions are demographic inequality, basic and special opportunity inequality, economic opportunities inequality, professional inequality, ownership inequality and household inequality. The interactive discussion highlighted several issues. With reference to considering representation of women as a measure of empowerment, it was mentioned that both men and women vote in democratic processes. Therefore elected representatives should be able to represent both genders. Why is it that men are not seen as representing women? Other possible dimensions for the index to consider were raised. As violence and trafficking are not included as part of the index, could there some way of measuring or incorporating them? The issue of measuring violence and cultural practice w as also underscored. Compatibility with MDGs and inclusion of vulnerability of men were flagged. The Beijing Platform could be a source for selecting other dimensions. Importance of the conceptual underpinning for the assignment of weights was raised as being crucial to the new index. Standardization and scaling is a significant issue - 28 should \u20181\u2019 be used as the index value? In this case, the lower the number the greater would be the reduction in gender inequality value. In popular interpretation however the lower the number the greater is the difficulty in seeing this as an improvement. The inclusion of qualitative indicators that may require subjective judgment was raised as a concern for the index. Other indicators such as those used by the Malaysian Gender Report could be reviewed in the process. The presenter underscored that the GVI is not official. Countries can be quite sensitive to indices. So it may not be carried in the report. The selected dimensions and indicators would measure the gap, not women\u2019s status per se. The indicators are CEDAW and MDG compliant. An important issue for the index would be simplicity as well as data availability. Many data sets are old and all countries may not have this information. Thus, issues of comparability may arise. Asian Trends in Gender Equality and Investing in Women, Pawadee Tonguthai, Invited Expert Ms Tonguthai\u2019s presentation highlighted the following points: \u2022 Within the economics framework for gender equality, the key arguments in micro-economics are concerned with allocative efficiency and supporting gender equality. In most societies, gender has implications on control of resources and influences men and women\u2019s ability to respond to market incentives. There is widespread evidence of gender inequal ity at the micro- level through existence of inefficiency, sub -optimal allocations and lower growth and welfare. \u2022 The macro-view focuses on aggregate behaviour and most significant arguments for gender equality come from modern growth theory. Investing in women may be an important factor in raising actual and potential growth through", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff763e66-2b9a-4e0b-bc89-62f3f91532c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff763e66-2b9a-4e0b-bc89-62f3f91532c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the South and East Asia Stakeholders Consultation - Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c975c27b6c787e77c652bdf3189f1abcef1128366e4823c195c74cffc7358d8"}}, "hash": "2c975c27b6c787e77c652bdf3189f1abcef1128366e4823c195c74cffc7358d8", "text": "improving quality of human capital, better returns for schooling and increase in allocative efficiency of inputs. \u2022 However empirical links between economic growth and aspects of g ender equality (legal dimension, political voice and opportunity) do not demonstrate a straightforward relationship. \u2022 Empirical evidence demonstrates a positive correlation between GDI and economic growth but not with GEM. On the legal dimension, there is little research on impact. On political voice, there is no empirical evidence to link with growth. What can be said is that when women have more bargaining power, there are better health and nutritional outcomes for children. \u2022 In terms of economic growth and opportunity of education, there is evidence demonstrating a larger impact of female education on growth than that of men. The wage gap in gender however shows an ambiguous relationship with growth rates. \u2022 In conclusion, the evidence linking gender equality (GE) and growth is not overwhelmingly strong. Indirect effects of GE on growth through impact on poverty alleviation need empirical testing. Interactive Discussion Participants raised several issues. A suggestion was to re-examine the framework from an efficiency standpoint but also from an economic justice, human development, poverty and human rights perspective. Justice in the economic arena 29 for women was emphasized as crucial. How can the gender relationships between men and women be changed and how does this relate to micro and macro policy? Other concerns raised were the intersection of gender with the phenomenon where productivity increases the rate of unemployment. Dimensions to be studied include the role of women in the care economy which often subsidises high growth. An emphasis on studying interventions such as early investments in women, which could mean less population growth and higher per capita income was suggested. Further research on studying distribution/redistribution of resources and how this links to aggregate growth was recommended. Greater research is required into which sectors include/exclude women in their allocations. The question of estimating women\u2019s unpaid work was highlighted. Women\u2019s unpaid work is not included in the computation of economic growth. In what way can it be included to measure contribution to economic growth? How can we measure unpaid work? A major area for research is to study the gender impact of policies in terms of increased public costs on health, crime etc. What are the ideas or innovations that can be used to measure the cost/impact of gender equality in sectors such as education? The Chair closed the session with a note of thanks for the substantive remarks raised by participants. 10:30-12:30 Session VI: Focusing the RHDR: Asian priorities Chair: Yumiko Yamamoto, Gender and Trade Advisor, RCC/UNDP The Chair introduced the next session as a continuation of the previous day\u2019s focus group discussions. The participants reconvened into the same four groups and continued group work. Each group discussed on the Priority Theme 2 that they had identified the previous day. Participants were asked to examine the themes through Human Development lens. The Group work in this session produced the following presentations (Session VII below) on Priority Theme 2. 1400-1530 Session VII: Focusing the RHDR: ASIAN priorities (cont\u2026) Presentation by the breakout groups on Priority 2 themes at the plenary Group A: Priority Theme 1: Gender and Justice Systems Priority Theme 2: Investing in Gender Inequality Strategic relevance \u2022 This theme relates to the efficiency argument. Thus, it is possible to have a complementary approach focusing on political and economic gaps. \u2022 If resources are not allocated, there will be very few changes in the status quo. If we don\u2019t invest in women, we can\u2019t capitalize on resources available. 30 \u2022 Investing in facilities, machinery, technology, services - to enable gender equality. \u2022 Boosting the economy, inter-generational pay-offs. Issues \u2022 Insensitivity of decision-makers; the state does not intervene in the family; tradition needs to be critiqued about its unchanging application to women, role socialization for women as mothers and wives (putting others first and inhibiting participation in the labour force). \u2022 Need to look at the macro- and micro levels when discussing investment, macroeconomic global policies that drive government policy. \u2022 Inequalities in investment in women at the household level in terms of education and health.

Group B: Priority Theme 1: Investing in Gender Equality Priority Theme 2: Gender and Justice Systems Issues \u2022 Women\u2019s access to justice is impeded by lack of voice, assets, resources, cultural barriers and awareness of rights. Laws often have complicated and inaccessible language. Both men and women are often ignorant about Women\u2019s Rights. \u2022 Some laws are biased. National level laws often draw upon traditional law that marginalizes women. There are ineffective justice systems at local level, informal and formal laws particularly in Intra-domestic/ Household conflict matters. Informal justice systems are biased against women. Some examples are inheritance laws and property rights, family laws, Shariah law, labour laws such as equal wage, law against sex selection. \u2022 Weak and corrupt judiciary and enforcement agencies, (police and lawyers): Gaps in implementation and enforcement. Laws are not enforced for various reasons (corruption). Elite capture of justice systems often marginalizes women\u2019s concerns. Solutions \u2022 Revise the existing laws, study the gaps, identify the differentiated gender impact of laws on men, women, boys and girls. There are already some successful stories. New legislation (eg. laws on sexual harassment in the work-place, on domestic violence, on prenatal sex selection) makes the legal system more gender sensitive. \u2022 Generate awareness, lobby and advocate for creating a dynamic among the masses for new laws. In fact, revision and advocacy need to go hand in hand. \u2022 Build capacities of judiciary and law enforcers on gender sensitization/implications of genders. \u2022 Increase the numbers of women recruited in judicial and legal enforcement agencies to ensure responsiveness to both male and female concerns. \u2022 Build capacity of media on investigative reporting of judicial and enforcement agencies to be alert to injustice so as to exert pressure that can act as a trigger to ensure accountability.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f9ab8cd-8baf-4fc2-8280-adf7a236e2f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f9ab8cd-8baf-4fc2-8280-adf7a236e2f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the South and East Asia Stakeholders Consultation - Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9c76bf5d8a691db117c985b6ee8278b25403de185abd39cd0ffaa08916cbfe1"}, "2": {"node_id": "28750148-6fbf-46d4-b0da-b163b081aff7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7669bc83d5f5698974ab65f891b4f4c80af74b798a35763301c68781676c7cab"}}, "hash": "c6b9a73f6e7a7ba7bf8ad5b08e38490ad2452de7a69c9090cceaa1cef965d2a1", "text": "32 \u2022 Engage popular media to sensitise men and women on positive images, against stereotyping of men and women on roles/ injustice and way forward. \u2022 Legal education/literacy services for men and women to ensure that women are supported to make their voices heard. \u2022 Dialogue with religious/community leaders on complementarities between religious law and national laws.

Recommendations \u2022 Strengthen women\u2019s security in crisis: Stop violence against women. \u2022 Build peace with and for women and involve women in all peace processes. Women must be involved in all stages of the peace and recovery processes, including as high-level negotiators in peace talks. Peace agreements offer opportunities for inclusiveness, democratic reform and gender equality. These opportunities must be seized. Gender provisions must be included in peace agreements and given priority as agreements are implemented. \u2022 Promote gender equality in disaster risk reduction: Support women and men to build back better. Women\u2019s unique needs must be incorporated in analyses of disaster risk and post disaster risk assessments. Temporary housing often denies women privacy, increases their vulnerability to exploitation and discrimination and marginalizes widows. This has an effect on the well-being of women and children. Women\u2019s experience and knowledge must be valued and incorporated in any plans or policies. \u2022 Ensure gender-responsive recovery: Promote women as leaders of recovery. \u2022 Develop capacities for social change: Work together to transform society. \u2022 Support full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1325.

Crisis prevention/recovery and mobility and migration were selected as secondary themes. Groups also clubbed themes \u2013 gender based violence (GBV) was discussed under gender and justice systems, while migration was discussed under economic equity and crises. All groups subsumed GBV as a cross-cutting outcome of unequal power relations. Political /legal and economic issues were discussed together by one group. A theme that did not get picked up was energy and environment. No group covered this directly. However, the groups that chose \u2018gender and crisis\u2019 dealt with it through the issue of gender and environmental crisis (food security, natural disasters, climate change etc.). The group that chose \u2018gender and migration\u2019 also discussed environmental factors of why men and women migrate. She summarized the overall discussions of issues, concerns and key messages on the two priority themes as follows: Theme 1: Politico-Legal Equity (Gender and Justice Systems) Issues \u2022 There is gender inequity in access to law-making structures and political power both in terms of representation as well as effective voice. There is low representation of women at all tiers of governance (political parties, parliaments, trade unions, local bodies, customary laws). Structural imbalances in gender equity are difficult to rectify. \u2022 There are global norms \u2013 ideas of equity, CEDAW versus local and national norms. Laws may be biased, national level laws often draw on traditional law that exclude women and promote gender inequality. Customary practices and laws need to be harmonized. This theme has strategic relevance as without a justice system vulnerable men and women have no options . \u2022 Weak and corrupt judiciary and enforcement agencies (judiciary, police and lawyers), gender insensitivity of judges, justice systems are not impartial (including local normative systems). 35 \u2022 Women\u2019s access to justice is impeded by ignorance, illiteracy and lack of voice, Issues like dowry killing, dowry deaths and warlords . Recommendations \u2022 Assess and revise existing discriminatory laws, study gaps, and identify the differentiated gender impact of laws on men, women, boys, and girls. Generate awareness, lobby advocate for new laws. This needs awareness creation and a new dynamic among men and women for new laws. Dialogue with religious/community leaders on complementarities between national laws and alternative/traditional systems. \u2022 Build capacities of judiciary, law enforcement agencies for gender sensitive implementation so that procedures are followed. \u2022 Build capacity of media for investigative reporting for pressure and lobbying and avoiding gender stereotyping. CSO\u2019s and media need to highlight gender insensitive issues such as sex selection, inheritance etc . \u2022 Legal education, literacy services for men and women to ensure that women\u2019s voices are heard. Key Messages \u2022 Laws of the book and laws on the street are different. \u2022 No Equal Rights without Women\u2019s Rights. \u2022 If justice is not engendered, women are endangered. \u2022 Access to justice can be a counter to unequal power relations. \u2022 Gender justice is power. Theme 2: Economic Equity (Investing in Gender Equality) Issues \u2022 Political inequality, under-representation of women, lack of voices of women in elected positions and at all tiers of government. (This overlaps with Gender and Justice systems but is important to understand that proactive investment is needed in this area). \u2022 Socio-economic inequality, social exclusion of women from change processes, gender inequality in access to justice. Wage gaps, glass ceilings, macro-economic trends show widening gender gaps across the region. Household relationships can privilege men over women, and power dynamics within households on male and female roles are problematic. \u2022 Attitudes and prevailing traditional practices, Gender Based Violence, existing mind sets, role of traditional beliefs and patriarchy in aggravating gender discrimination. \u2022 Inadequate resource allocation and budgets: gender blind insensitive budgets in most regions. Health and education budgets do not take into account gender differentiated impacts on women. While CEDAW commitments have 36 been ratified, financial commitments need to be actualised. Justice and enforcement systems need reform and funding. \u2022 Theoretical arguments advocate for efficiency but empirical evidence is mixed.

Concluding Remarks: Omar Noman, Management, RCC/UNDP Mr. Omar Noman thanked stakeholders for partic ipating in the meeting sharing their knowledge, expertise and experiences. He reflected that the consultations had been very substantive and had drawn from a range of perspectives across the Asian region. These inputs as well as forthcoming Pacific consultations would be vital in focusing the theme of the APHDR as well as drawing research, case studies and examples from the region. The continued engagement of all stakeholders in the \u201cgender journey\u201d would make the Report topical, regionally relevant and a t ool for furthering the dialogue on gender inequality across the Asia Pacific region. Chair: Ramesh Gampat, HDRU/RCC The Chair concluded the meeting with a vote of thanks and a request for participants to provide feedback on the consultation and nominations of gender champions that 37 HDRU could contact while preparing the Report. He hoped that all participants had enjoyed the process. He observed that the HDRU had gleaned a lot from the collective expertise at the consultation. Expected outcomes of the consultations had been fulfilled, namely stakeholder prioritization of sub-themes, buy-in and partnerships and thematic discussion on issues, solutions and advocacy messages under each selected sub - theme. He invited all the participants to join the Asia Pacific Human Development Network (http://www.undprcc.lk/ext/HDRU/index.asp) on gender as soon e-discussions will be initiated. HDRU would welcome the continued sharing of ideas, thoughts and experiences on this extremely sensitive and exciting theme. He invited all to contribute to the Report ensuring that it would be \u2018by and for the people of Asia Pacific\u2019. End of meeting 38 Annex I CONCEPT NOTE ASIA PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ON GENDER \u201cOVERCOMING UNEQUAL POWER\u201d ASIA STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION Meritus Pelangi Beach Resort & Spa, Langkawi, Malaysia, April 14th to 15th 1. THE ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORTS The Asia Pacific Regional Human Development Report (RHDR) on Gender will be the third in a regular series, led by the Human Development Report Unit, housed at the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo. The first RHDR in this series was the 2006 Report titled Trade on Human Terms: Transforming Trade for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific which was followed by the one on corruption, Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives: Accelerating Human Development for Asia and the Pacific, to be launched soon. HDRs are policy-advocacy tools to explore critical development issues from a human development perspective. There is a fundamental difference between a technical analysis of an issue versus an exploration from a human development lens, which is an important element of the value added of an HDR.2 HDRs aim to provide policy options by bringing people to the centre of development concerns for poverty reduction, countering inequalities, promoting internationally accepted development goals and, ultimately, promoting human development. 2. GENDER: OVERCOMING UNEQUAL POWER Relations between men and women are at the foundation of society. The proposed Asia Pacific Human Development Report provides an opportunity for contribution to transformative thinking by exploring the very fundamentals of gender-based inequalities that restrict choices and identifying strategic triggers for countering them. The overarching framework for the Report has been identified as \u2018unequal power and voice\u2019 with a focus on gender socialization and identities which influence opportunities and choices for women and men. There are expected to be many sensitive aspects to this work, for example, those involving an exploration of cultural norms and practices. Discussions so far have identified six themes for consideration under the overall framework of unequal power: justice systems, economic equality, energy and environment, gender-based violence, crisis prevention and recovery, mobility and migration.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1d1198f-faf0-4626-b8dd-aa6aa0dff95c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1d1198f-faf0-4626-b8dd-aa6aa0dff95c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the South and East Asia Stakeholders Consultation - Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Gender", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44f38d9f6ad1dac11a1d7ae507a6e307af953f589eb826f7a003383115562adc"}, "2": {"node_id": "142678d9-67bc-420d-86df-3744ae710666", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-south-and-east-asia-stakeholders-consultation-asia-pacific-human-development-report-gender", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d2cd567a34c7ae2487597b329d15c735f31f5049dc728958c9bab668fef7a67"}}, "hash": "d9c9584af3a76bf2b37e307c6bfecbb6d63fd57159d2f9a6ea68c31e724cf03c", "text": "2 For details, see APRI 2005. \u201c From Development to Human Development: Tool for Examining Themes from a Human Development Perspective .\u201d 39 In spite of the many attempts at bridging male-female gaps in recent decades, gender inequality persists across the world as in Asia Pacific countries, including some extreme forms of discrimination that threaten survival, sustenance and human dignity.

What should be the way forward when global norms are at variance with local ones? What could be the policy options? The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly, is often described as an international bill of rights for women. The Convention defines discrimination against women as \"...any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.\" By accepting the Convention, States commit themselves to undertake a series of measures to end discrimination against women in all forms, including to: \u2022 incorporate the principle of equality of men and women in their legal system, abolish all discriminatory laws and adopt appropriate ones prohibiting discrimination against women; \u2022 establish tribunals and other public institutions to ensure the effective protection of women against discrimination; and \u2022 ensure elimination of all acts of discrimination against women by persons, organizations or enterprises. As of April 2008, 185 out of 192 UN Member States worldwide have ratified, acceded or succeeded to the Convention. In Asia there are 24 countries which have ratified, acceded or succeeded out of 25 in the region.3 3.

A2I has revolutionized that process for a number of public services by providing them in a fast, easy to understand and affordable manner. IntroductIon Government offices in Bangladesh provide a wide range of public services at the dis- trict and sub-district levels. To gain access to these services, the rural poor typically have to travel long distances to get to the relevant government offices. This takes valu- able time away from their daily work and wages, and incurs costs for travel. It is against this backdrop, that UNDP, USAID and the Government of Bangladesh em- barked on the Access to Information (a2i) programme to improve service delivery, with special emphasis on meeting the needs of underserved communities. The programme first focused on increasing access to services in 2007, and then on simplifying service delivery the following year. Since then, Bangladesh has shown remarkable success in decreasing time, cost and bar- riers in accessing government services. In a few short years, the number of underserved people benefiting from e-Services climbed from zero to 4.5 million every month. The a2i initiative has steadily expanded. It has set up access points through the creation of Union Information Service Centres across the lowest government tiers to connect the bottom millions with public service access.

The following year, the Centres expanded to 30 locations, to 100 locations in 2009 and to all 4,545 rural government institutions by the end of 2010. Through these Centres, more than 4.5 million people each month now have easy access to a wide range of services. These include applications for land records, mobile banking, life insurance, exam results, telemedi- cine and information on agriculture. Travel distance has reduced from an average of 35 kilometres to reach the district headquarters, to only three kilometres to reach the Union Information and Service Centre. The rural model has been scaled up in 2013 to serve people in remote towns and urban areas. District e-service Centres \u2013 \u00bb\u00bb These Centres started with a single office in 2010 and now there are more than 64 spanning all district headquarters.

IngredIentS for SucceSSful exPAnSIon Creative Partnerships \u2013 The a2i operations serve as a bridge connecting government, private organizations and associations, and individual citizens. Such collaboration was needed for expansion, and helped in mobilizing more than USD 100 million from the government and private sector for scaling up the project\u2019s pilot initiatives. Partnerships with media were a major factor in building a wide awareness about project results and creating citizens\u2019 demand for improved public services. Policy reform \u2013 Support to targeted policies helped create the environment for e-ser- vices. The a2i programme collaborated with the Ministry of Planning to develop pri- orities for a Digital Bangladesh. This became part of the Sixth Five Year Plan, a driving strategy for national development.

The Digital Innovation Fair created an environment of healthy competition among Ministries, Directorates and district level offices to come up with ways to transform service delivery. chAllengeS One challenge related to the approach that a2i officials took regarding ICT in the early stages of the programme. E-Governance to them meant automation of back-office work. Workshops with high-level policy makers helped shed light on how ICTs could be used to improve service delivery. A \u201cQuick-Win\u201d workshop with all Permanent Secretaries re- sulted in 53 easily implemented service delivery ideas. The project was then ready to take off with high-level support and \u201cquick-win\u201d projects that could illustrate programme viability. Another challenge was resistance by service providers. To break through the business- as-usual approach to service delivery, it was necessary to sensitize government officials, teachers and entrepreneurs so they could be part of the process of providing e-services to people\u2019s doorsteps. Workshops and training were combined with hands-on design and delivery of the services. The lack of robust high-speed network connectivity in the country was an initial impedi- ment. Because a2i was able to establish Union Information and Service Centres in all rural local government institutions, and develop more than 50 partnerships with the public and private sector, the demand for high-speed networks has become increasingly in- tense. Policy advocacy is changing network possibilities. It has been important for the project to remain politically neutral. It has survived three administrations which is a testament to its apolitical approach. exIt StrAtegy Capacity development that has been promoted and facilitated by a2i has already shifted to the Ministry of Public Administration and various training academies within the gov- ernment. The e-Service initiatives are embedded in the administrative procedures in two Ministries. In addition, the creation of the Service Innovation Centre will nurture innova- tion within the civil service, facilitate research and development and promote partner- ships, including South-South and triangular collaboration.

[Photo: Shubhangi Singh/ UNDP India] INtroDUctIoN The poor and marginalized are too often denied the ability to seek remedies in a fair justice system. UNDP promotes effective, responsive, accessible and fair justice systems. In the absence of access to justice, people are unable to have their voice heard, exercise their rights, challenge discrimination or hold decision-makers ac- countable. UNDP\u2019s support to the Government of India in improving access to justice began as a pilot in 2006. It undertook a broad assessment of the justice sector in two states \u2013 Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. The analysis examined the criminal justice system, informal justice systems and legal aid services. The aim was to understand the challenges of marginalized communities in gaining access to justice. Based on the findings, the second project launched in 2009 had a wider scope and focused on ways to empower communities to demand justice and secure legal and government entitlements.

Since 2009, the pilot further expanded its geographic reach to seven Indian states and deepened its focus to include developing innovative interventions that can help marginalized communities overcome the barriers they face in achieving jus- tice. Ashwani Kumar, Law Minister said, \u201cThe project is an example of the efforts be- ing made for creating sustainable and positive change across the States. With a focus on those who are vulnerable and those that live at the periphery of society, the project has made an impact and yielded inspirational results by empowering women and children, scheduled tribes, scheduled castes and the poor by arming them with information on their rights and by demystifying justice delivery sys- tems.\u201d The project which aims to improve the institutional capacities of justice service providers has reached out to over two million people in 87 districts. Based on the success of this model, The Department of Justice rolled out a similar programme in Jammu and Kashmir and the eight North Eastern States last year. The 12th Five Year Plan of the Government of India unveiled recently by the Prime Minister has approved an allocation of US$15m for this new phase of up-scaling.

In only 2.5 years, it presented a viable model that the govern- ment is investing in and taking forward. The strengthened capacity of 25 NGOs are now taking the mandate \u00bb\u00bb of legal empowerment further and working on building sustainable demand. Strong UNDP partnership with the Department of Justice at the na- \u00bb\u00bb tional level and links with State Legal Services Authorities will ensure sustainability and relevance of initiatives. Today in India there is greater demand for judicial accountability in \u00bb\u00bb general, and delivery of legal aid in particular. chALLeNGeS Challenges that were successfully overcome included gaining the initial trust and securing a partnership with the Department of Justice, which had never before partnered with a UN agency. The same challenge applied to developing a solid relationship with the National and State Legal Services Authorities. UNDP is now a trusted partner of the Department of Justice and its legal aid delivery mechanisms. Constant engagement, assurances and building confidence and trust were key to engaging in this sensitive arena in India. SUStAINAbILIty / exIt StrAteGy The Government of India has progressively increased its own financial investment in this programme. Most recently, by placing these efforts within the 12th Five- Year plan, the Government has ensured programme sustainability over the coming few years. Based on this national support, UNDP\u2019s financial investment has been scaled back. ADvIce for otherS Secure buy-in from the government partners before planning any ini- \u00bb\u00bb tiatives.

The improvements we make in our judicial systems will have direct effects on fundamental aspects of national stability and on social and economic progress. The movement for judicial reform has gathered pace over recent years. At least in part this has been a response to increasing demands for the highest standards of integrity, accountability, professionalism, and efficiency to meet the imperatives of global trade and interaction. In part it has been urged on by wider and more informed discussion of human rights, access to justice, and good governance. Judicial reform is now, and must remain, at the centre of the stage when there is discussion about progress. The Asia Pacific Judicial Reform Forum is a network of 49 superior courts and justice sector agencies across Asia and the Pacific. It is united by a shared commitment to respond to the challenges of judicial reform. It was established pursuant to the Manila Declaration for a 21st Century Independent Judiciary in 2005 and it provides the means by which challenges, ideas, and experiences can be shared and explored. Searching for Success in Judicial Reform: Voices from the Asia Pacific Experience is the fruit of the Forum\u2019s first project. Its chapters reflect the priorities which the members of the Forum defined. It is a resounding achievement for our region to have drawn together the collective reform experience that is reflected in these pages. Searching for Success draws these experiences together to present a unique, practical guide to reform and development of courts across Asia and the Pacific. The chapters draw on the expertise of some of the region\u2019s most skilled justices, court administrators, and scholars. They offer a broad cross-section of case studies and reflections. Those who seek to develop and execute reform strategies will find in these chapters new perspectives from which to view the challenges before them. They will find an account of the ways in which issues have been dealt with by others. But more than this, they will find in Searching for Success the inspiration to continue pursuit of the goals of improving the work that each of us does, and the judicial institutions wherein each of us serves. Justice Antonio T. Carpio Supreme Court of the Philippines Chair, Project Board Justice Kenneth Hayne, AC High Court of Australia Chair, APJRF Secretariat x PREFACE Acknowledgements T he Asia Pacific Judicial Reform Forum was established by the Manila Declaration on Judicial Reforms framed at the International Conference and Showcase on Judicial Reforms hosted by the Supreme Court of the Philippines in 2005. The Forum\u2019s mandate is to promote improved effectiveness in judicial reform by facilitating and coordinating the exchange of reform experiences, ideas, and issues from throughout the region. Searching for Success in Judicial Reform: Voices from the Asia Pacific Experience is a publication by and for the region. The publication was led by a Project Board. We are grateful to all of the board members for their ongoing support and guidance: Justice Antonio Carpio, Philippines (Chair); Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek, Vanuatu; senior judge Zhang Genda, China; Justice Kenneth Hayne, Australia; Dr Faqir Hussain, Pakistan; Mr R.
