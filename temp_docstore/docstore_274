With heightened in- terest from different stakeholders, stimulus pro- vided by the November 2005 directives of the IRDA, and better awareness overall, by 2007 the sector witnessed rapid growth and estab- lished a growth trajectory closely linked to the overall growth of insurance in the country. From the viewpoint of insurers, microin- surance is starting to demonstrate its business potential. While investment from their side is still sporadic and limited to tie-ups with some facilitating agencies, most companies are eying microinsurance as a real business opportunity of the near future. Efforts by a few NGOs and MFIs have resulted in the introduction of mi- croinsurance as an add-on to their existing mi- cro-credit projects, demonstrating its potential and utility for the rural poor. These institutions have also managed to attract some companies to provide the necessary re-insurance. Their work can provide useful insights for the devel- opment of the sector. Asset provision and income generation schemes, by themselves, are not adequate for securing livelihoods in the face of risks faced by the poor. Under Goal 1 of the MDGs, poverty reduction also involves risk management to secure assets and income streams. Microinsurance is yet to take the shape of a movement, as has happened in the case of microcredit in India. This is mainly due to novelty of the concept, low demand for ser- vices from the potential clients on account of inadequate exposure and knowledge, a \u2018wait and watch strategy\u2019 adopted by companies, as well as lack of adequate infrastructure and an enabling environment. The study has proposed concrete steps to address constraints which will help demonstrate the \u2018insurability of the poor\u2019 in the near future. Chapter 6: Way Forward 85 Micro- insurance, which was poised for a take off in 2005, has in fact done so. However, it is yet to take the shape of a movement, as has happened in the case of microcredit. Chapter 1 1 Policies, programmes and innovations di- rectly aimed at poverty reduction have typi- cally focused on income generation through microcredit based self employment or rural works based wage employment. A few other types of interventions are also seen, for exam- ple, land redistribtion. 2 See CGAP 2003a.

Learning 9 Knowledge Sharing Events Case Studies, Research and Analytical Papers Acknowledgements 14 2 2011 Update The importance of understanding -and supporting -the transformative points of change that can create, retain and sustain capacities critical to the achievement and safeguarding of development results has been key to our work in 2011. The following pages present a \u2018recap\u2019 of how the team provided these capacity development (CD) services to our Country Offices and to the Practices, and through them to our national clients. The impetus to do more with less in 2011 saw a renewed focus on development and CD results. We were therefore mindful, more than ever before, that the outcome of effective and sustainable CD is to empower and enable institutions to take national ownership, and strengthen national institutional capacities to lead, plan, coordinate, manage and evaluate. The CD services included policy advisory and programme support, knowledge development and sharing. What the CD approach brought together was the synergy from the combined efforts of the practice/technical expert with the capacity development specialist, to work on the institutional reform/change management aspects. Our services included capacity diagnostics, change management and learning tools, capacity development indicators/trackers/ measures, evidence of what works in other institutions and contexts, and examples of adapted approaches for different practice areas. APRC\u2019s commitment to providing support to our clients in an integrated manner helped to dismantle the silos sometimes imposed by practice architecture. Addressing new development challenges called for new ways of working, and we responded to that call, in addressing issues such as climate change and accelerating the progress on MDGs. We therefore worked to complement the thematic practices in delivering CD services. Some notable examples were the support to a range of CD initiatives in the area of environmental sustainability and climate resilient development. In Indonesia, we helped formulate a capacity development plan for the pilot province of Central Sulawesi, where the Ministry of Forestry, together with FAO, UNEP, and UNDP is implementing the UN-REDD National Joint Programme, with the objective of 'supporting the Government of Indonesia in attaining REDD Readiness.' A cross-practice pilot mission in Lao PDR with the Environment and Governance teams helped initiate a Climate Fiscal Framework analysis to help them, and subsequently other countries in the region, to access global climate funds. Public Private Partnerships for waste management were strengthened in Nepal and Bhutan. Supporting the development of capacities of local governments to deliver on their mandates was the focus of our work in settings as diverse as the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh, and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific, in partnership with the Governance Team, and with UNCDF. We helped close the loop between policy and project work, capturing, collating and sharing knowledge based on the work that we have been doing jointly in the field. With the Disaster Risk Reduction team we brought out a flagship knowledge product, \u201cStrengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction: A Primer\u201d, developed through contributions by experts and specialists in both the areas. It is already being recognized as a substantive contribution to this critical area of development. In collaboration with the Asia Pacific Forum and OHCHR, the Governance team compiled a manual focusing on strengthening capacities for National Human Rights Institutions in both the Asia Pacific and Arab States regions, capturing the lessons of our joint work with NHRIs in seven countries, presenting the analytical framework adapted from the UNDP capacity assessment methodology and applied to support the NHRIs. We collaborated closely in the area of Poverty Reduction, working jointly towards policy options and capacity issues for social protection, as well as supporting accelerated progress towards MDG achievement. APRC provided support, integrated across the various practices, to the countries in the region to prepare for the 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, and a country led discussion on Technical Cooperation (TC) produced the \u201cBangkok Call to Action on Technical Cooperation for Capacity Development\u201d. From international to the local level we reinforced thus the message that \u201cCapacity Is Development\u201d. Dipa Bagai!

In addition, given that a substantial number of countries in the region have enacted new DRM laws, including the establishment of new institutional arrangements, there are significant changes that provide opportunities for engagement and policy influence. These include comprehensive new laws in Sri Lanka (2005), India (2006) and Thailand (2008). Environmental Sustainability & Climate Resilient Development During 2011, the Capacity Development team supported a range of CD initiatives in support of environmental sustainability and climate- resilient development. In Indonesia, the Capacity Development Team undertook a mission at the request of the UN- REDD programme, to formulate a capacity develop- ment programme in the pilot province of Central Sulawesi. The Ministry of Forestry, together with FAO, UNEP, and UNDP is implementing the UN-REDD National Joint Programme, with the objective of 'supporting the Government of Indonesia in attaining REDD Readiness.' Based on the mission findings, a proposal was developed for an institutional mechanism to address the significant demand for REDD+ knowledge and learning initiatives amongst all major stakeholder groups in the province. As a result, planning is underway to establish a \u201cREDD+ Knowledge and Learning Facility\u201d, which is proposed to be institutionally anchored to the Provincial REDD+ Working Group, and launched by mid-2012. Managed by IUCN and UNDP, Mangroves for the Future is a multi-stakeholder partnership initiative to strengthen environmental sustainability of coastal development and promote investment in coastal ecosystem management, with policy guidance from a National Coordinating Body 5 Joint workshop between CD team and ANDMA, Kabul.

To further improve the effectiveness of this role at the national level in Sri Lanka, the Capacity Development team, jointly with the regional Environment & Energy and Gender teams undertook a capacity development mission to explore a range of institutional and capacity needs, with a focus on identifying capacity gaps in gender mainstreaming within Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) practices. A preliminary summary of findings (baseline capacities) along with a draft capacity development framework has kick-started a planning and reflective process within the NCB in Sri Lanka. Given the anticipated increase in climate finance in the coming years, UNDP has been supporting countries to develop the capacities of relevant national institutions to directly access and manage climate financing resources. A cross-practice pilot mission was undertaken in Lao PDR with the involvement of the CD, Environment, and Governance teams. The mission included a Climate Fiscal Framework analysis, as well as an institutional assessment of capacity needs to qualify for accreditation as a National Implementing Entity to directly access the resources of the Adaptation Fund. As a result of the recommendations put forward by the mission, the government is in the process of formulating a program to address the identified capacity gaps to achieve accreditation. Local Governance and Local Development In Bangladesh, the team supported UNDP\u2019s Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Facility (CHTDF) in the design and launch of a CD programme, beginning with capacity assessments of the three Hill District Councils (HDCs). As a result of the positive response to the initial assess- ments of the three HDCs, CHTDF received addi- tional requests from other institutions to participate in the initiative. Specifically, the Chakma and Mong Circles (CHT traditional leaders) have now undertaken capacity self-assessments, and are in the process of designing multi-year capacity development plans, which will be sup- ported through the EU-funded CHTDF component \u201cSupporting Local Development in the CHT\u201d. In addition, the initiative has been upscaled further, with the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tract Affairs (MoCHTA) and the CHT Regional Council (RC) having also expressed keen interest to undergo capacity self-assessments, which will take place in early 2012. As a result of the capacity development initiative, MoCHTA, the RC, and the three HDCs have also agreed to form a committee with representatives from all the institutions to undertake CD strategies which require a common approach (for instance policy development), as well as to monitor implementation of capacity development plans.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "845cf0dd-3be8-46b1-a573-7942e04ac97d": {"__data__": {"id_": "845cf0dd-3be8-46b1-a573-7942e04ac97d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-development-2011-update", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Capacity Development 2011 Update", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-development-2011-update", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a4fa504917c9eaafd1c49a090adc5fd4876580aab87ad352b907408734183cb"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5f00eb4-9485-4fe3-89f8-f1653dc16cde", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-development-2011-update", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cca81bb72f6b4e32e7d11ff6357dc7cc8ef39f1ca0e101d83ab3fcc6fb06e065"}}, "hash": "c3a49525606169bb0900fd32a10dd12837f4572be83d72215c70b5222558b480", "text": "In the Solomon Islands, the Capacity Devel- opment team supported the launch of a Capacity Development Needs Assessment (CDNA) for provincial governments, under the auspices of the Provincial Government Streng- thening Programme (PGSP) of UNCDF.

The UNDG-AP Thematic Working Group on Social Protection was commissioned by the UNDG-AP Regional Directors to develop a joint document, the UNDG-AP Issues Brief on Social Protection, to support UNCTs in their work on social protection. The Issues Brief was develop- ed jointly by ILO, UNICEF and UNDP, with the Poverty and CD teams working closely together. The Issues Brief provides an overview of social protection in Asia and the Pacific and lays out a joint UN position on social protection in Asia and the Pacific. It also highlights potential entry points for UNCTs to support the development of national social protection strategies and imple- mentation of social protection, providing concrete examples of ongoing work on social protection in the region, and listing the resources available to UNCTs. An e-discussion on social protection brought together lessons and experiences on the topic from within and outside of the Asia-Pacific region, drawing from the experience and expertise of development practitioners - from UNDP and other UN agencies, civil society, academics and experts. The e-discussion enriched the social protection discussions at the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Regional Poverty CoP, in providing greater understanding of the complexity of social protection issues, and identifying UNDP\u2019s niche and opportunities for social protection interventions at the country level. The CD team contributed to this sharing and learning. The roll out of the MDG Acceleration Framework (MAF) in select countries, especially LDCs, has been an important priority for RBAP. To give a strong push to this work a training workshop on the MAF was organized in October, during the Asia-Pacific Regional Poverty CoP. It helped deepen understanding of the Framework, and to strengthen regional and country level capacity to rollout results-based MDG Acceleration action plans in countries, and facilitate rapid progress towards the MDGs by 2015. The CD team supported this agenda as an integral part of the APRC Task Force on MDG Acceleration, working closely with the Poverty Team, contributing to the workshop, and supporting the MAF roll out in countries. Public Private Partnerships for Local Service Delivery Over sixteen Country Offices were provided with PPPSD policy advisory and programme backstopping services in 2011. The close ties between the MDG poverty reduction agenda, local governance, environmental sustainability and services delivery allowed the team to closely engage with the governance, poverty, human development, gender and environment and energy practices. A clear focus has been on providing project assurance and support to the Promoting Inte- grated Sustainable Waste Management projects in Nepal and Bhutan supported by the global PPPSD facility with funding from DGIS (the Netherlands) and co-funding from municipalities. Local Service Delivery institutions in Nepal and Bhutan municipalities received Capacity Development support to improve waste management services through effective and sustainable pro-poor Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) contributing to MDG efforts. Nepal The PPPSD team, in collaboration with UNDP Nepal, has continued to support Biratnagar Municipality in implementing a PPP-ISWM initiative, which is further integrated in the national PPP for Urban Environment Programme, led by the Ministry of Local Development. In February, the Municipality selected a new private operator to be responsible for all levels of waste handling, from primary collection of waste from streets, commercial areas and households until the final disposal takes place.

Following the application of UNDP\u2019s capacity assessment tool in 2010, a Capacity Development Response strategy and subsequent action plan was designed in 2011, creating a roadmap for broader institutional reform, organisational change and (individual) capacity development. A new democratic municipal institutional set up, established in spring 2011, changed the downward accountability of Thimphu Thromde (TT), as well as its mandate to act upon the noted challenges and opportunities. This was an important impetus to reflect on TT\u2019s new role and mandate in relation to wider service delivery contexts in addition to ISWM. TT conducted several technical studies, collected data on solid waste flows and waste compositions, adjusted its current Management Information System, conducted a willingness-to-pay survey amongst 2,600 households and 550 building owners, and strongly engaged with citizens, schools and businesses through frequent interactions to discuss options to reduce and segregate waste and establish a tariff system. This new focus on creating partnerships with citizens to develop a sustainable waste management system has been identified as a critical success factor for the programme. TT entered this year into formal partnership agreements with different private sector organisations that now collect and recycle paper and carton, operate a pet bottle crushing plant and manage the landfill site. TT furthermore initiated a separate household collection system for organic waste, for the vegetable market and larger hotels, and financed and constructed a composting plant. It is anticipated that a private operator will manage the plant under a PPP modality from 2012 onwards. Widening access to energy services through Public Private Partnerships Engaging the private sector in providing energy services in rural areas through PPPs is seen as a viable and strategic solution by leveraging the private sector\u2019s capital, technical skills and oper- ational experiences, while also sharing business risks. Together with the APRC Energy and Environment practice, the PPPSD team partnered with ESCAP and IFAD on the initiative \u201cLeveraging Pro-Poor Public Private Partnerships for Rural Development\u201d. In September, during the inception workshop with country governments and private sector representatives, academia and the Thailand Business Advisory Council, the PPPSD team shared lessons learned from PPP (policy and programming) modalities and their merits, barriers, and prospects of success.

Pro-Poor Inclusive Micro-Enterprise Development The Government of Nepal (GoN) has requested UNDP\u2019s Capacity Development support for country-wide scaling up of the successful Micro- Enterprise Development Programme (MEDEP). Since its inception, MEDEP has supported 38 districts in Nepal to diversify livelihoods and increase the income of poor families through the creation of pro-poor micro-enterprises. In 2012, GoN will replicate the MEDEP model in over 45 districts. As a result, a new programme phase has been formulated with the support of the PPPSD team, and in October a Capacity Development Roadmap and Strategy was designed with the MEDEP team and key stakeholders. The CD approach is an integral part of GoN\u2019s Poverty Reduction strategy to facilitate the application of MEDEP within broader national systems and using sectoral approaches, and to ensure further institutional and organisational develop- ment at the local level. Knowledge Sharing & Learning Knowledge Sharing Events A Country-Led Approach Towards Reform of Technical Cooperation Seventy participants from over twenty countries met in Bangkok on 15th September to engage in a Southern-led discussion on Technical Cooperation (TC) reform and to spur Capacity Development ideas for the 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF4). In connection with UNDP\u2019s broader support to preparations for the HLF4 in Busan, the TC workshop was held back-to-back with both the Asia-Pacific HLF4 Consultation (14th September) and the Asia-Pacific Dialogue on Climate Change Finance and Development Effectiveness (12th-13th September). Technical Cooperation (technical assistance, training, educational grants) is perhaps the most visible and long standing instrument of development assistance.

Asia Pacific Urban Forum The fifth Asia Pacific Urban Forum (APUF), held in Bangkok in June, gathered over 600 participants for a week-long series of debates, presentations, exhibits and networking. In close collaboration with APRC\u2019s Poverty Reduction/HDR practices and in partnership with ESCAP, UNHABITAT, LOGOTRI, the French Embassy, ICLEI, UCLG, Rockefeller Foundation, AIT, UNEP and UNICEF, the PPPSD team helped organize two high level panel sessions: \u201cCities of Opportunity: Partnerships for an Inclusive and Sustainable Future\u201d and \u201cClimate Change Resilience for Sustainable Cities\u201d. During the APUF, participants had the opportunity to learn and share experiences of Public Private Partnerships, Private Sector/CSR contributions to inclusive and sustainable urban development, and innovative approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation, through a range of relevant knowledge products and tools from across Asia and the Pacific. Resulting from the success of the APUF, the Embassy of France in Thailand's Office for Regi- onal Cooperation entered into a cost-sharing agreement with APRC. The agreement focuses on utilising the Asia Pacific Human Development Report series to promote sustainable human development initiatives through policy dialogue and Public Private Partnerships, with an emphasis on the lead-up to Rio+20. The first multi- country dialogue and workshop is scheduled to take place in the first half of 2012. Capacity Development Facilities: A Review of Experience and Lessons Learnt Delegates from Afghanistan, Nepal and Timor- Leste met in Bangkok in September to share experiences, challenges, and lessons learnt with the use of Capacity Development Facilities (CDFs). CDFs are commonly defined as mechanisms through which capacity development support services are provided or funded, activities coordinated, and funds mobilized to support the implementation of a capacity development pro- gramme or its components. Since the introduction of CDFs, a significant body of experience has emerged with distinct differences in approaches responding to different circumstances. UNDP has embarked on a global review of these different CDF experiences. In the Asia Pacific region, these three countries offer substantive knowledge and experience on CDF and are crucial to solicit suggestions for a new CDF approach and modality. What have we found out from Afghanistan, Nepal and Timor-Leste?. The vivid discussion validated particular CDF findings from the global review and highlighted some key concerns: Country representatives emphasized the \u2018most relevant agency\u2019 approach to ensure sustainability. In addition, flexibility and country- specific management arrangements may be required to ensure effective CDF functioning. Participants strongly agreed to have exit and transformation strategies considered from the beginning based on a rigorous results framework.

In this way, it has been shaped by real experiences that illustrate the importance of a systematic approach to strengthening capacities for DRR and the current trends in doing so. The Primer will be continuously updated based on its use in the field and in order to remain relevant to the ever changing environment where it is applied. The development of the Primer reflects UNDP\u2019s longstanding commitment to supporting developing and high-risk countries through its 11 Representatives from Nepal listen to a session on CD Facilities.

This flagship publication presents an analytical framework which has been adapted from the UNDP capacity assessment methodology and applied to support the NHRIs in seven countries. Not limited to assessments alone, the manual also discusses strategies for addressing identified capacity needs, as well as presenting the country-specific experiences across two regions. Capacity Development Methodology for Public Private Partnerships in Service Delivery This methodology, developed in 2010, and piloted in 2011, builds upon practices and lessons derived from UNDP support provided to Governments, non- state actors (including private sector) and communities, in the specific context of Public Private Partnership for Urban Environment and Public Private Partnerships for Service Delivery. The methodology makes reference to the 2010 Commission on Sustainable Development, which recognized Public Private Partnerships as a global policy priority in sectors such as water and sanitation, integrated sustainable waste management, energy, transport, as well as social services like health, HIV/AIDS, education, and services to support rural development and environmental sustainability. The tool has been piloted and applied to several of UNDP\u2019s service delivery and economic development programs in Bhutan and Nepal. Case Study: \u201cThe Korean Development Experience and Aid Effectiveness\u201d Ensuring the effectiveness of aid to deliver development results is one of the most critical issues affecting progress on the Millennium Development Goals. This has been well recognized in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA), and was a key agenda item of the 4th High Level Forum (HLF4), held in Busan in late 2011. In this connection, the development story of Korea, the host country of the HLF4, has been highlighted by the international development community as offering lessons on effective use foreign assistance, as evidenced by the country\u2019s rapid economic growth. This timely case study provides an in-depth exploration and discussion of Korea\u2019s development experience, focusing on lessons learned in the mobilization and effective use of aid to achieve national development priorities. Case Study: \u201cCapacity Challenges to Delivering Basic Services in Post-Conflict Nepal\u201d This case study explores the challenges faced in Nepal to deliver basic services in a post- conflict context.

Among other recommendations, the study discusses strategies such as awareness-raising among stakeholders on the concept of PPP; establishing public private dialogue mechanisms between government and private partners; and supporting governments and their partners to create an enabling legal environment and institutional framework. Case Study: \u201cPartnerships for Effective Municipal Service Delivery in Bhutan\u201d This case study looks at the UNDP-supported PPP- ISWM project in Bhutan\u2019s Thimphu Municipality. It discusses the institutional and organisation- focused CD approaches employed in the project\u2019s pilot stage, which go beyond technical solutions, presenting them as imperative for affecting the transformational change needed to meet the challenges of new municipal mandates, severe service delivery constraints and high pressure to perform. By sharing lessons learned, the case study has been key to plans to scale-up the ISWM programme to two additional municipalities in Bhutan, and promotes the further integration of PPPs in other municipal services such as energy, water and sanitation. Additional Knowledge Products -A story on \u201cDevelopment Results and Capacity Development in Nepal\u201d was featured by the Learning Network on CD (LenCD), an important CD learning platform. -Stories focusing on PPPSD in the Philippines, India and Nepal were contributed to the publication \u201cMaking a Real Difference: UNDP stories from Asia and the Pacific\u201d, as well as to the Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change (forthcoming). -The team contributed substantively to a number of global e-discussions, as well as to e- queries from UNDP Country Offices and their partners, to share experiences including on PPPs, MDG scaling up initiatives, programming for municipal solid waste management, approaches to creating innovative engagements with informal actors in energy and water and sanitation services, and strengthening institutional arrangements for the delivery of social protection services. 13 Acknowledgements Dipa Bagai, Team Leader, Capacity Development Team Ashley Palmer, Capacity Development Programme Specialist, Capacity Development Team Diana Brandes - Van Dorresteijn, PPPSD Programme Specialist, Capacity Development Team/Global PPPSD Team Jaeyoung Park, Intern, Capacity Development Team Special thanks to Sawitree Limvongsakul, Client Engagement Associate, Management Support Unit Supaporn Daophises, Knowledge Management Associate, Management Support Unit Photo Credits 1.

Purpose of the Capacity Assessment User\u2019s Guide The Capacity Assessment User\u2019s Guide provides UNDP and other development practitioners with an overview of UNDP\u2019s approach to Capacity Development and Capacity Assessment and a step-by-step guide to conducting a capacity assessment using UNDP\u2019s \u201cdefault\u201d capacity assessment framework and Supporting Tool. UNDP presents its approach to Capacity Development and Capacity Assessment in its Practice Notes.1 This User\u2019s Guide should be used in conjunction with the Practice Notes as they provide explanations of terms and concepts referenced herein. 2. UNDP\u2019s Approach to Capacity Development and Capacity Assessment The Practice Note on Capacity Development provides practitioners with a basic understanding of core capacity issues to focus on in a development context, why such capacities are important, and how external partners can support countries\u2019 efforts to further deepen and effectively utilize such capacity to achieve their development goals. It also proposes default principles for supporting capacity development and points for mainstreaming capacity development into programming and operations. The Practice Note on Capacity Assessment provides practitioners with UNDP\u2019s \u201cdefault\u201d capacity assessment framework, intended to serve as a starting point for capacity assessment exercises. The framework is intended to provide a comprehensive view of the issues that could be addressed in a capacity assessment, yet be flexible enough for adaptation to the needs of any given capacity assessment situation. UNDP defines capacity as \u201cthe ability of individuals, institutions and societies to perform functions, solve problems, and set and achieve objectives in a sustainable manner.\u201d Capacity development (CD) is thereby the process through which the abilities to do so are obtained, strengthened, adapted and maintained over time. A capacity assessment is an analysis of current capacities against desired future capacities, which generates an understanding of capacity assets and needs, which in turn leads to the formulation of capacity development strategies. 1 See UNDP Practice Notes on Capacity Development and Capacity Assessment, July 2006. 4 The diagram below shows UNDP\u2019s articulation of the cyclical nature of the capacity development process. Figure 1: UNDP Capacity Development Process The capacity development process, including capacity assessment and definition of capacity development strategies, is integrated into the planning and programming process at the level of MDG- based strategies, poverty reduction strategies as well as UN Common Country Assessments and UNDAFs. This process is prescriptive in nature, as it is embedded in UNDP\u2019s Results Management Guide. The Capacity Assessment Framework is composed of three dimensions: \u2022 Points of Entry: UNDP recognises that a country\u2019s capacity resides on different levels \u2013 enabling environment, organisation and individual \u2013 and thus needs to be addressed across these levels. A capacity assessment team selects one level as its point of entry, and may \u201czoom in\u201d or \u201czoom out\u201d from that level as needed. (Capacity assessments at the individual level are generally conducted within the context of an organisational assessment; as such, they are not addressed in detail in the Practice Note on Capacity Assessment or this User\u2019s Guide.) \u2022 Core Issues: These represent the issues upon which UNDP is most often called to address. Not all of these issues will necessarily be analysed in any given assessment, but they provide a comprehensive set of issues from which a capacity assessment team may choose as it defines its scope: 1) leadership; 2) policy and legal framework; 3) mutual accountability mechanisms; 4) public engagement; 5) human resources; 6) financial resources; 7) physical resources; and 8) environmental resources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80c422f4-554f-4b3a-b246-907461720192": {"__data__": {"id_": "80c422f4-554f-4b3a-b246-907461720192", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-diagnostics-methodology-users-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Capacity Diagnostics Methodology: User's Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-diagnostics-methodology-users-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20ba709b26be1bc5c87d1d3db693e9c596432c6a7bab456e549cbc9c488b8486"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4cdc1b9-8833-4a06-8d2c-ddd20b281c41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-diagnostics-methodology-users-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3c4d6da131116f0cb1cd02cde879205a376e64584d2e08ed9623cf1036b9e1c"}}, "hash": "5cbca8cf513c175f8dba706a543e53b426f7ad874d24fcc2159bedb704df6f53", "text": "The issue of human rights serves as an \u201coverlay\u201d on any capacity assessment. \u2022 Cross-Cutting Functional Capacities: Specific functional capacities are necessary for the successful creation and management of policies, legislations, strategies and programmes.

Section IV is comprised of questions and indicators for each cross-section of the capacity assessment framework. The Annexes provide answers to frequently asked questions, additional detail on indicators and select UNDP capacity development resources. 6 II. Assess Capacity Assets and Needs A capacity assessment must be deployed correctly to yield the intended outcomes. The following steps guide the technical process and are recommended in undertaking a capacity assessment exercise. These steps are intended to deepen local engagement and dialogue around process, strategies and intended results and to build consensus around them. 1. Mobilize and design 2. Conduct the capacity assessment 3. Summarize and interpret results Before beginning, there are several operational considerations that should be taken into account: \u2022 Understand that capacity assessment is a set of activities, not a solution \u2022 Leverage the framework as a point of departure for a capacity assessment \u2013 it is flexible and needs to be adapted by the assessment team to suit its specific needs/context - Select one cross-section to all 100 cross-sections; once a point of entry has been determined, a core issue(s) or a cross-cutting functional capacity(ies) can serve as the primary driver of a capacity assessment - Go into more depth on any given cross-section \u2013 split \u201cBudget, Manage & Implement\u201d into three sub-capacities - Formulate questions as appropriate \u2013 use questions in Section IV of the User\u2019s Guide; develop additional questions; break down questions provided into more sub-questions - Customize according to how much time is allotted for a given project \u2013 one week assessment or a three-month assessment \u2022 Define desired capacities prior to undertaking the assessment, as they do not emerge from a capacity assessment \u2022 Do not necessarily expect \u201csurprises\u201d from the assessment, but rather confirmation and consensus \u2022 Consider capacity assessment as a dynamic, ongoing process\u2026 not a one-time event \u2022 Leave prioritization of investment until after the assessment of capacities has been completed 1. Mobilize and Design It is important for local participants to gain ownership of the exercise and for other stakeholders to be identified and engaged appropriately, providing political and administrative oversight, assisting in the design and implementation, and ensuring thorough analysis and follow-up. Following are the key steps for this phase: \u2022 Clarify objectives and expectations with primary clients \u2022 Identify and engage national/local stakeholders throughout the process \u2013 design, assessment and summarization/interpretation \u2013 to ensure ongoing success \u2022 Adapt \u201cdefault\u201d Capacity Assessment Framework to local needs, including selection of point of entry, core issue(s) and cross-cutting functional capacity(ies) to be addressed \u2022 Determine how the assessment will be conducted (team, location) \u2022 Cost the capacity assessment exercise (based on team composition, duration and depth) (Step in bold type is addressed in further detail below) 1.1 Adapt \u201cDefault\u201d Capacity Assessment Framework to Local Needs2 2 In doing so, it is incumbent upon UNDP development practitioners to know and apply prescriptive processes and content (the \u201cnon-negotiables\u201d of a UNDP engagement). 7 Once the objectives of the assessment have been articulated, the assessment team defines the scope and scale of the capacity assessment. The Capacity Assessment Framework can be used to frame this dialogue, the result of which is the selection of the point of entry, the core issue(s) and the cross-cutting functional capacity(ies) to be assessed. The assessment team may choose to use any number of \u201ccross- sections\u201d of the framework \u2013 from one to all of them. It is not mandated that that the entire framework be used in any given assessment. Different objectives will suggest different applications of the capacity assessment framework; for example, for an organisational point of entry, it is expected that the team may narrow the focus by selecting a few core issues, but may require additional detail", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2cfddb0-a373-49b0-a47a-359c05d6bcaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2cfddb0-a373-49b0-a47a-359c05d6bcaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-diagnostics-methodology-users-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Capacity Diagnostics Methodology: User's Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-diagnostics-methodology-users-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b438ed83899f40e338906c6ea5c68f4968a79b312a66d3b1918b06f79289753"}}, "hash": "6b438ed83899f40e338906c6ea5c68f4968a79b312a66d3b1918b06f79289753", "text": "for the cross-cutting functional capacities.

Capacity Assessment Supporting Tool Reference Open the \u201cStep 1. Assess Capacity\u201d tab in the Supporting Tool. Click on the drop down menus (starting with cell E6 and E9) to select core issues and point of entries. Repeat this for each combination of core issue and point of entry as determined by the assessment team (continuing in cells E56 and E59, E106 and E109, etc.), up to 20 combinations (10 core issues by 2 points of entry). The Supporting Tool begins with Leadership and Enabling Environment, but any combination can be selected and in any order (a text box will appear if a combination is selected that has previously been selected). All five cross-cutting functional 8 capacities are automatically included for each combination of core issue and point of entry; however, it is not necessary to include all five cross-cutting functional capacities in any given assessment. 2. Conduct the Capacity Assessment Viable capacity development strategies nurture and reinforce existing capacities. The capacity assessment uses existing capacities as the starting point, and throughout the process, identifies capacity needs against pre-determined desired capacities. \u2022 Define desired capacities and capacity levels \u2022 Articulate questions to understand existing capacity assets \u2022 Assess capacity level (Steps in bold type are addressed in further detail below) 2.1 Define Desired Capacities and Capacity Levels Once the scope and scale of the capacity assessment have been defined through selection of one or more cross-sections of the Capacity Assessment Framework, the assessment team defines the level of desired capacity for each cross-section. Some capacities may need to be further developed than others; however, not all capacities necessarily need to be fully developed for achievement of the country\u2019s development objectives. The desired level of capacity will be used as the basis of comparison against existing capacity determined during the assessment, which will in turn determine the level of effort required to bridge the gap. Capacity level can be determined quantitatively or qualitatively, depending on the preference of the assessment team. If the team decides to use a quantitative ranking, then the ranking system for desired capacity should be the same as that used for assessing existing capacity (see Assess Capacity Level below). 2.2 Articulate Questions to Understand Capacity Assets For each of the cross-sections of point of entry, core issue and cross-cutting functional capacity, questions have been formulated that represent capacity dimensions commonly addressed during capacity assessments (see Section IV). This set of questions has been developed based on a review of an existing body of knowledge, composed of existing capacity assessment tools and resources, case studies, project documents, from within the United Nations system and from other public and private sector organisations involved in capacity assessment. The questions provided here are intended to serve as thought-starters. Given the contextual demands of any assessment, it is expected that these questions will be adapted, added to and/or deleted, to address context-specific needs. Some questions represent a \u201cbundle\u201d of questions and may need to be unbundled before being addressed. Depending on the approach the assessment team has decided to pursue \u2013 quantitative and/or qualitative \u2013 the questions will need to be adapted accordingly; for example, more open-ended questions are appropriate for a qualitative assessment, but will need to be made more specific or \u201cclosed\u201d for a quantitative assessment. Finally, the questions are not intended to represent an exhaustive set of questions for any capacity assessment. Illustrative questions for each cross-section of point of entry, core issue and cross-cutting functional capacity are in three categories: 9 1. Overall Question: represents a point of departure and is automatically populated in the Capacity Assessment Supporting Tool for each cross-cutting functional capacity based on the selection of point of entry and core issue 2. Additional Questions: represents potential areas for exploration; may be included in an assessment as deemed appropriate by the assessment team 3. Additional Areas of Exploration: included for several cross-sections, but not all, are additional dimensions of capacity that may be explored. Again, these are thought-starters for the assessment team as it determines the scope and scale of its assessment, and as it formulates questions to assess capacity References to \u201cauthorities\u201d at the enabling environment level should be tailored to relevant national and/or local players, as appropriate.

Assess Capacity\u201d tab of the Supporting Tool (cells F19, F26, F33, F40, F47 for the first combination of point of entry and core issue, and continuing below for each cross-section). As stated above, you may use this overall question as a point of departure to formulate additional questions; or the team may need to redirect the line of questioning depending on the needs and expectations of the client. Enter additional questions formulated by the assessment team into the \u201cStep 1. Assess Capacity\u201d tab by typing in the questions in the green-colored cells that appear (starting in F20-24). If desired, the default questions that are automatically populated into the tool can be ignored (they cannot be deleted). 2.3 Assess Capacity Level Capacity level can be determined quantitatively and/or qualitatively, depending on the preference of the assessment team. Ideally, the assessment team generates both a quantitative ranking and qualitative information to support the ranking. An assessment is made for each question in each cross-section. For a quantitative assessment, numerical ratings are given reflecting the level of current capacity. For a qualitative assessment, a short narrative is given to provide evidence to support the rating. Level of Existing Capacity 1 No evidence of capacity (most likely in a conflict or post-conflict environment) 2 Anecdotal evidence of capacity 3 Partially developed capacity 4 Widespread, but not comprehensive, evidence of capacity 5 Fully developed capacity that is endogenously sustainable It is important that the assessment team discuss the capacity levels prior to conducting an assessment to ensure a common understanding regarding the interpretation of each level. The team should adjust the level definitions as it sees fit. The team should also determine prior to conducting an assessment what will be done with the results, e.g., will they be used to compare across entities (e.g., institutions, districts), and if necessary, ensure consensus on definitions across assessment teams. 10 To determine the appropriate level to assign (1-5), the assessment team may identify appropriate indicators for each capacity (see Section III, B for additional detail on indicators) and then collect data in a variety of ways, e.g., case study approach, interviews, observable practices; and from a variety of sources, e.g., policy documents, reports, statistics. See the Capacity Assessment Practice Note for additional detail on data collection approaches. Capacity Assessment Supporting Tool Instructions Open the \u201cStep 1. Assess Capacity\u201d tab. For each question, including those that have been automatically generated (if the team has decided to use them) and those added by the team, make a quantitative and/or qualitative assessment. If making a quantitative assessment, use the numerical ranking scheme above and enter number into column H. If making a qualitative assessment, provide anecdotal information in column I. The average score for all questions within a cross-cutting functional capacity is calculated (example: cell H18). The average score for all cross-cutting functional capacities is then calculated to provide an overall rating for the cross-section. (example: cell E12). Figure 3: Step 1. Assess Capacity Assets \u2013 ILLUSTRATIVE 3. Summarize and Interpret Results Once the assessment has been completed for selected cross-sections, the summary rating is carried forward to the summary worksheet. The summary worksheet provides an overview of capacity levels for each cross-section within the scope and scale of the given assessment. The assessment team compares the assessed level of capacity against the desired level of capacity, as determined during the Mobilize and Design phase. The team then makes a determination whether the existing capacity level is sufficient or needs improvement. This determination provides direction in terms of which areas to focus capacity development strategies. It does not always follow that a low rating means a significant capacity improvement is required; a relatively low rating may be adequate in the context of a given enabling environment or organization. 11 Findings may be discussed with various stakeholders at several points during the overall process. It is important that findings are presented in a way that allows for the consideration of comments, validations and other forms of feedback Capacity Assessment Supporting Tool Instructions Open \u201cStep 2.

The capacity development plan should consist of high-priority, short- to medium-term strategic initiatives (one year or longer) and immediate quick impact activities (less than one year) that build the foundation for ongoing capacity development as well as build momentum for the process. The following steps guide the technical process and are recommended in undertaking the formulation of capacity development actions. 1. Define capacity development strategies 2. Define progress indicators (for capacity development strategies and capacity development) 3. Cost (for capacity development strategies and capacity development) Before formulating capacity development strategies, there are several operational considerations that should be taken into account: \u2022 Select capacity development strategies based on findings from a capacity assessment exercise \u2022 Identify indicators that are measurable and distinct \u2022 Use cost information to help prioritize actions \u2013 but only after capacity assessment has been completed 1. Define Capacity Development Strategies UNDP\u2019s Practice Note on Capacity Development provides detail on seven capacity development strategies which may be applied to address capacity development needs in a variety of sectors that speak to integrated approaches to development. Selection of capacity development strategies should be predicated upon findings from the capacity assessment exercise.3 Capacity Development Strategies Capacity Diagnostics: Needs and capacity assessments, measurement and monitoring, advisory services, local R&D... Knowledge Services and Learning: Large group training, technical and tertiary education, on-the job skills transfer, focus groups\u2026 Leadership Development: One-on-one coaching, mentoring, management skills development\u2026 Institutional Reform and Change Management: Results-based management, performance management systems, functional reviews, PAR in transitions, procurement services\u2026 Multi-stakeholder Engagement: Process facilitation, institutional twinning, e-networks, community dialogue spaces, integrated planning and problem analysis... Mutual Accountability Mechanisms: M&E processes, social watch, peer and partner reviews\u2026 Incentive Systems: Salary supplements, non monetary benefits, pay and compensation\u2026 3 See UNDP Practice Note on Capacity Development, May 2006, for further detail on capacity development strategies. 13 Strategic Capacity Investment Areas UNDP can apply a combination of these strategies, or elements and instruments of them (on-the-job skills transfer, process facilitation, etc.) to provide capacity development services in the following areas, where it has a comparative advantage through its policy expertise, knowledge base and on-the-ground programme experience. The following applications are not intended to represent an exhaustive list, but areas of UNDP focus and expertise. Statistical Literacy: Strengthening national and local government and non-state actor capacities for statistical literacy and policy analysis to provide policy options to government, NGOs and the legislature. National Aid Policy and Management: Developing more effective national aid policy and management capacities to access, negotiate, coordinate and manage the needed development finance in order to reach the MDGs. Democratic Governance: Strengthening democratic governance capacities by reinforcing the capacity of societal/local change agents to effectively engage and demand more equity based development choices and services. MDG-Based National Planning: Supporting the inclusion of short- and long-term capacity development strategies into MDG-based national plans and PRSs. Procurement: Strengthening national procurement capacities to deliver essential development services. Local-Level Integrated Development: Promoting local-level integrated development through MDG target setting, integrated planning, strengthening local administration and public-private partnerships for service delivery Fragile Contexts and Transitional States: Prioritizing capacity development strategies in fragile contexts and transitional states to support leadership and accountability mechanisms, conflict resolution and resilience facilities, and public administration reform. Fiscal and Administrative Decentralization: Ensuring state agency responsiveness, accountability and transparency to their clientele, and the enabling reforms at the national level that make this happen. Mutual Accountability Mechanisms: Enhancing national and local level state-citizen accountability processes and mechanisms for state- people mutual accountability and oversight.

Based on its assessment, costing and available funding, the team may need to revisit its capacity development strategies. Prioritization of strategies, however, should be addressed after the assessment and strategy formulation effort is completed. 3.2 Cost Capacity Development Less straight-forward is the process for determining or projecting costs required for longer-term capacity development. If an assessment team feels that these costs cannot be accurately projected, it is suggested that this costing exercise be limited to an actual costing of inputs in order to avoid any issues of credibility or legitimacy.

Questions and Indicators by Point of Entry Key Operational Considerations (reprised from Section II B. Conduct the Capacity Assessment and Section III B. Define Progress Indicators) The questions provided here are intended to serve as thought-starters. Given the contextual demands of any assessment, it is expected that these questions will be adapted, added to and/or deleted, to address context-specific needs. Some questions represent a \u201cbundle\u201d of questions and may need to be unbundled before being addressed. Depending on the approach the assessment team has decided to pursue \u2013 quantitative and/or qualitative \u2013 the questions will need to be adapted accordingly; for example, he more open-ended questions are appropriate for a qualitative assessment, but will need to be made more closed for a quantitative assessment. Finally, the questions are not intended to represent an exhaustive set of questions for any capacity assessment. Illustrative questions for each cross-section of point of entry, core issue and cross-cutting functional capacity are in three categories: 1. Overall Question: represents a point of departure and is automatically populated in the Capacity Assessment Supporting Tool for each cross-cutting functional capacity based on the selection of point of entry and core issue 2. Additional Questions: represents potential areas for exploration; may be included in an assessment as deemed appropriate by the assessment team 3. Additional Areas of Exploration: included for several cross-sections, but not all, are additional dimensions of capacity that may be explored. Again, these are thought-starters for the assessment team as it determines the scope and scale of its assessment, and as it formulates questions to assess capacity References to \u201cauthorities\u201d at the enabling environment level should be tailored to relevant national and/or local players, as appropriate. A team should strive to define indicators that are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timebound. Illustrative indicators for each cross-section of point of entry, core issue and cross-cutting functional capacity are found in Section IV. Similar to the illustrative questions, the indicators are meant to be illustrative of the various types of indicators that could be applied.

A final note about the questions and indicators: there is not a one-to-one relationship between the questions and indicators in this Section. Each Core Issue section can be used alone or in conjunction with other Core Issue sections, depending on the scope and scale of the assessment as determined during the mobilize and design step. 19 Template Core Issue Context per UNDP Practice Note on Capacity Assessment Cross-Cutting Functional Capacities Engage in Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue Overall Question: Additional Questions: Indicators (not a one-to-one relationship between questions and indicators) Analyse a Situation and Create a Vision Overall Question: Additional Questions: Indicators Formulate Policy and Strategy Overall Question: Additional Questions: Indicators Budget, Manage and Implement Overall Question: Additional Questions: Indicators Monitor and Evaluate Overall Question: Additional Questions: Indicators Additional Areas of Exploration: Included for several cross-sections, but not all, are additional dimensions of capacity that may be explored.

Poor leaders can set efforts back by decades, and twist ownership to suit their own agendas, gearing it toward a culture of entitlement or excessive nationalism that is detrimental to capacity development. Successful leadership results in enhanced understanding, improved relationships, and greater collective effectiveness among working teams and their partners. Since people with overlapping goals have a better sense of how parts of the system fit together, good leaders build upon relationships and trust, mobilizing energy in a way that is sustainable, fosters ownership and generates commitment. Leadership development is thus an important response to capacity challenges. Among capacities assessed in this category are the abilities to foster ownership; manage relationships with key external stakeholders, including the ability to negotiate; develop, communicate and give direction on vision, mission and values; develop and implement a system for overall management; and create an environment that motivates and supports individuals.

Policy and Legal Framework \u2013 Enabling Environment Context (per UNDP Practice Note on Capacity Assessment) Without a strong policy and legal framework in place, countries can experience problems of poor adherence to international norms and standards, prevalence of anti- poor and gender bias in justice systems, and poor implementation of national laws and regulations intended to benefit disadvantaged groups. In addition, there is often a very real gap between \u201claw in the books\u201d and \u201claw in action\u201d which can limit access and result in injustice.

Public administration is also the main vehicle through which the relationship between the state and civil society and the private sector is realized. Assessing capacities to manage and support an accountable public administration and ensure the reforms required, often on a long-term and sustained basis, is essential to effective governance and to providing a sound basis for equitable development.

A concept key to external resources is Direct Budget Support (DBS), which is broadly defined as joint government/donor mechanisms to permit external resources to be channelled directly through national budgets, using national allocation, procurement and accounting systems, to supplement public expenditure on nationally agreed priorities. DBS, including the pooling of funds to support sector or programme approaches, has become a preferred method of development assistance for some governments and by some donors. Among capacities assessed in this category are national and local capacities to negotiate, manage, utilize and monitor DBS in ways that best support the human development agenda and achieve the MDGs, including capacities for the management of development finance and development cooperation.

Poor leaders can set efforts back by decades, and twist ownership to suit their own agendas, gearing it toward a culture of entitlement or excessive nationalism that is detrimental to capacity development. Successful leadership results in enhanced understanding, improved relationships, and greater collective effectiveness among working teams and their partners. Since people with overlapping goals have a better sense of how parts of the system fit together, good leaders build upon relationships and trust, mobilizing energy in a way that is sustainable, fosters ownership and generates commitment. Leadership development is thus an important response to capacity challenges. Among capacities assessed in this category are the abilities to foster ownership; manage relationships with key external stakeholders, including the ability to negotiate; develop, communicate and give direction on vision, mission and values; develop and implement a system for overall management; and create an environment that motivates and supports individuals.

Many developing countries are struggling with critical conditions, such as armed conflict, HIV/AIDS prevalence, natural disasters and the \u201cbrain-drain\u201d phenomenon. All these deplete, and in some cases destroy, the capacities of countries and their prospects and hopes for development. In such cases, a capacity assessment needs to take into account any medium- to long-term trends resulting from a particular crisis or issue. Human resource capacities are at the heart of enhancing human development, and the capacity assessment framework may be expanded with queries in this segment to address this area in greater depth. Specific areas of assessment include recruitment and promotion policies; performance assessment and management mechanisms; incentives (monetary and non-monetary); monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; and training.

A concept key to external resources is Direct Budget Support (DBS), which is broadly defined as joint government/donor mechanisms to permit external resources to be channelled directly through national budgets, using national allocation, procurement and accounting systems, to supplement public expenditure on nationally agreed priorities. DBS, including the pooling of funds to support sector or programme approaches, has become a preferred method of development assistance for some governments and by some donors. Among capacities assessed in this category are national and local capacities to negotiate, manage, utilize and monitor DBS in ways that best support the human development agenda and achieve the MDGs, including capacities for the management of development finance and development cooperation.

What is the \u201cvalue add\u201d of a UNDP methodology? UNDP\u2019s \u201cdefault\u201d capacity assessment methodology establishes a framework and provides standards for any UNDP engagement. As such, it promotes adherence to a comprehensive and integrated capacity development process and increases the focus and impact of UNDP\u2019s work. The key is in the adaptation of it by users who understand their environment and their stakeholder / sponsor needs, and who can customize it accordingly. 2. What is the link between MDG-Based Development Strategies and the UNDP Capacity Diagnostic Methodology? As a tool for understanding capacity assets and needs, capacity assessments provide valuable input into policy and strategy formulation work at the level of MDG-based development strategies and poverty reduction strategies. It also provides a basis for defining the UN\u2019s role to support capacity development with these national processes. 3. What is the link between the Millennium Project Needs Assessment and the UNDP Capacity Assessment? The Millennium Project Needs Assessment and the UNDP Capacity Assessment Methodology are complementary in nature. Needs Assessments focus on \u201cinterventions,\u201d i.e., what needs to improve, and the financial requirements to fund the interventions. Capacity Assessments focus on the current and desired levels of capacity in a given enabling environment or institution, the gap between them, and most important, the resulting capacity development strategies \u2013 how the improvements will occur and how much such will cost to undertake. Capacity assessments therefore can be worked on simultaneous to and as part of an MDG needs assessment in analysing and presenting a more comprehensive and integrated programme and resource response. It is important to note that it is not possible to create a one-to-one relation between a capacity gap and a desire poverty reduction outcome.

One could also assess the functioning of the office of the president (but not necessarily the individual capacities of the president him/herself). 5. How were the Core Issues identified? What do they represent? These represent the issues upon which UNDP is most often called to address. Not all of these issues will necessarily be analysed in any given assessment, but they provide a comprehensive set of issues from which a capacity assessment team may choose as it defines its scope 6. What are the Technical Capacities? Technical capacities are those associated with particular areas of professional expertise or knowledge, such as fiscal management, agriculture, education, etc. Technical capacities vary and are closely related to the sector or organizational context in focus. They are most often the province of specialized agencies. 67 Design and Application 7. Do I have to use the entire Capacity Assessment Framework? No, you do not have to use the entire Capacity Assessment Framework. It should be leveraged as a point of departure for a capacity assessment \u2013 it is flexible and needs to be adapted by the assessment team to suit its specific needs/context. During the mobilize and design phase of an assessment, the assessment team determines the scope and scale of an assessment; this will determine the point of entry, the core issues and the cross-cutting functional capacities to be included in the assessment. 8. Do I have to use the Supporting Tool (excel spreadsheet)? No, you do not have to use the spreadsheet. What is important is adhering to the capacity development process, and in this context the \u201cassess capacity assets and needs\u201d and \u201cdefine capacity development strategy\u201d steps. The Supporting Tool is just that\u2026 a tool that can be used as these steps are carried out; however the process could be carried out using whatever mechanism is accessible to and for the team. 9. How can this be implemented without access to certain data sources? How do you manage indicators without certain data sources? Successful execution of and follow-up to a capacity assessment depend in a large part on the quality and availability of data. To a certain extent, you are limited by what data are available; however, to the extent that data are not available, it is the responsibility of the team to be creative in identifying means of obtaining data (conducting field-based interviews, leveraging representative samples, using observational techniques) and/or designing proxies for indicators for which there is limited or no data. 10. Do I have to provide both quantitative data and qualitative information? Capacity level can be determined quantitatively and/or qualitatively. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. It is the responsibility of the assessment team to determine during the mobilize and design phase which type is best to collect based on a number of factors, e.g., how accessible the data are, how reliable the data will be and how the data will be used. 11. How do you weight the importance of various core issues or cross-cutting functional capacities? In the Capacity Assessment Supporting Tool, each assessment ranking is given equal weight. If the assessment team wishes to assign different weights to different dimensions, they can amend the process \u2013 by either adding a weighting mechanism in the Supporting Tool or calculating it manually. 12. How do I interpret capacity assessment results? Interpretation of the capacity assessment results depends in large part on the desired level of capacity determined during the mobilize and design phase. Once the assessment has been completed for selected cross-sections, the assessment team compares the assessed level of capacity against the desired level of capacity. This comparison helps the team determine whether the existing capacity level is sufficient or needs improvement, which in turn helps the team identify areas in which to focus capacity development strategies. It does not always follow that a low rating means a significant capacity improvement is required; a relatively low rating may be adequate in the context of a given enabling environment or organization. 13. How do you bridge from capacity assessment to capacity development strategy formulation? The interpretation of capacity assessment results discussed in question #11 creates the bridge between assessment and strategy formulation. 14. Who does prioritization? Does it happen before or after costing? It is the responsibility of the assessment team to conduct the assessment and make recommendations regarding capacity development strategies, including a sense of indicators and costing. It should not, however, be the responsibility of the assessment team to prioritize 68 recommendations. It is expected that the stakeholder/sponsor group will determine prioritization.
