Intellectual ProPerty rIghts and access to affordable arVs In chIna 20 additionally, companies that produce formulations have not made them available at affordable prices in china either. In 2006 the cheapest treatment for children was eight times more expensive than the cheapest treatment for adults in the absence of fdcs. the Msf study concluded that intellectual property protection, among other factors, has had a wide-ranging impact on public health and access to medicines in china including: restrictions on drug choice, lack of availability of needed drugs, and high prices for originator drugs.

When the chinese government launched a national aIds treatment programme in 2003, there was no appropriate formulation of 3tc for treatment. In the retail market, only the formulation with dosage for treating hepatitis b was available from gsk. no generic 3tc was available due to various exclusive rights enjoyed by gsk since the 1990s even though china did not provide for product patents yet at that time (see below on those other exclusive rights). as a consequence, the national programme did not include 3tc when it first began providing art because of both the prohibitive price and lack of domestic production. doctors have attributed 46 the information on the case study of lamivudine was provided by Msf. see especially: \u201cbriefing note - accessibility of lamivudine (3tc) in china\u201d (august 2006, updated March 2008). reference was also made to hu yuanqiong, Wang xiangyu, et.al.(2009) \u2018Multi-sector approaches on Improving access to arVs in china\u2019, in abIa (ed.)

(b) access barriers to 3tc in china the domestic pharmaceutical industry in china is a major supplier of the 3tc active pharmaceutical ingredients in the world, but the finished product had been only available in china from gsk. gsk had maintained its market monopoly on 3tc since the 1990s. an agreement was signed between the Moh and gsk on 3tc 300 mg in July 2006/2007 providing for a donation of 118,000 boxes for 20,000 persons. If a similar quantity of generic 3tc had been purchased it would have cost less than us$1million (us$8.4/box). the terms of the agreement were confidential. Process patents: the original patent application on 3tc was filed in 1990 in china, at a time when china did not grant patents on pharmaceutical products, but only on processes. Product patents were allowed only in 1993 when the Patent law of china was revised to implement the country\u2019s obligations under a bilateral agreement with the united states. gsk also owned a group of process patents covering the manufacturing process of 3tc, and according to analysis by M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, which provided a strong and broad protection that could also affect 3tc as a product.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "548aae8c-5719-4d07-a3da-d2085d49e5fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "548aae8c-5719-4d07-a3da-d2085d49e5fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Intellectual Property Rights and Access to Affordable ARVs in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ab8112502797934039916dd736483f8b7eb1cc54c9a14a3bc29ff4e2ca3380f"}, "2": {"node_id": "62dd7bb1-2901-4468-8e75-8420c3d73722", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58ce40010a9caeb030b3ebe304e3ebf2df0a86ff91f01571a156ebf0be722b1c"}}, "hash": "ac11cbef0b58ab6dd0d66da93c7e8b6ccf4ba8754d5ca80e198bd4da75fec1ff", "text": "In May 2007, gsk published a statement on its china website, announcing that they owned five process patents that still were valid in china.47 gsk further claimed that \u201cthe protection provided by Patent no. 99126580.7 extends to all finished products of lamivudine that are suitable for pharmaceutical use and any unlicensed manufacture, sale or use of a finished pharmaceutical product of lamivudine will infringe this patent\u201d48. however, according to M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, the patent application Zl99126580.7 was a divisional application of no.

It was therefore surprising that gsk made allegations that such a patent could block all finished products.49 Regulatory protection: In the absence of product patents before 1993, there were two types of protection on 3tc accorded under china\u2019s drug administration regulations by the sfda. the effect was similar to a patent protection, which also blocked the introduction of generic versions of the drug. Administrative Protection: this was a type of retrospective market exclusivity awarded in china to medicines that were patented abroad, but not in china, between 1 January 1986 and 1 January 1993. the Regulations on Administrative Protection for Pharmaceuticals were approved by the state council on 12 december 1992, and entered into force on 1 January 1993. In essence, administrative 47 http://www.gsk-china.com/english/html/newscentre/china-news.asp - \u201cstatement on lamivudine patent position\u201d dated 15 May 2007. 48 emphasis added. 49 a patent search was conducted by Medecins sans frontieres and an analysis made by their in-house legal experts. Intellectual ProPerty rIghts and access to affordable arVs In chIna 22 protection was created to fill the void of product patents, which were not available in the country before 1993. although this protection was the result of the bilateral agreement with the us in 1992, it was eventually extended to drugs patented in any other country. article 1 stated that the regulations were \u201cenacted with a view to expanding economic and technological cooperation and exchange with foreign countries, providing administrative Protection to the lawful rights and interests of the owners of the exclusive right of foreign pharmaceuticals\u201d. article 3 provided that \u201centerprises and other organizations and individuals from the country or the region, which has concluded bilateral treaty or agreement with the People\u2019s republic of china on administrative protection for pharmaceuticals, may apply for administrative Protection for Pharmaceuticals in accordance with these regulations\u201d. article 13 provided for that a certificate for administrative Protection for Pharmaceuticals would last for seven and a half years from the date of issuance of the certificate. even in the absence of product patents, the administrative Protection accorded to 3tc from april 1999 to october 2006 succeeded in preventing the domestic production and importation of generic 3tc, and thus also fdcs and paediatric formulations comprising 3tc. New Drug Protection (NDP): this type of protection was established in 1999 in order to encourage technology transfer. applicants for the registration of new drugs could be granted market exclusivity on the condition that they produced the new drug in china, or transferred the technology to a chinese manufacturer within two years of the ndP certificate being granted. article 18 of the administrative Protection of drugs, national drug administration bureau (19 december 1992) stated: \u201c... the state council\u2019s department of health and its divisions in all provinces, autonomous regions and cities shall not allow the manufacturing or sales of such drug by another party or entity.\u201d however, there was a safeguard clause that allowed sfda to \u201clicense others for production\u201d in the public interest. In exchange, sfda would prohibit other companies from manufacturing the drug, and could not accept applications for registration of generic versions of the drug until the protection period has expired. In the latter case, this extended de facto the market exclusivity by an additional one to three years, the average time needed by sfda to register a drug. ndP was granted until 2002, when it was abolished and replaced with another system of exclusivity called the \u2018drug monitoring period\u2019. nevertheless, all drugs for which ndP was obtained prior to 15 september 2002 maintained their full term of protection for six, eight or twelve years, depending on the category to which the drug belonged. 3tc obtained an ndP that was valid until december 2006. during the period of protection, sfda was prohibited from even accepting applications for registration of generic versions of the drug.

In addition, there are a number of safeguards that could be adopted in china, in the spirit of the doha declaration on the trIPs agreement and Public health, to minimize the negative impact of such provisions and to safeguard public health.53 \u201cChill factor\u201d on domestic generic manufacturers: In anticipation of the expiry of the administrative Protection (october 2006) and new drug Protection (december 2006) over 3tc, several chinese manufacturers submitted applications to register generic 3tc. however, beyond the preliminary stage there were no further actions to fulfill registration requirements. It is understood that domestic manufacturers were hesitant because of concerns over possible infringement of gsk\u2019s process patent.54 the May 2007 announcement by gsk of its broad process patent and the precedent set by the courts\u2019 confirmation of the validity of patent claims over Viagra (active ingredient sildenafil citrate) also contributed to creating a \u2018chill factor\u2019. Viagra entered the chinese market in July 2000. It was granted a patent in september 2001 that would last until 2014. In october 2001, 12 domestic companies opposed the patent because drugs produced by some chinese companies had already been using the active ingredient of Viagra in local drugs. In July 2004, following a re-examination the state Intellectual Property office (sIPo) declared the patent for Viagra invalid in china because it did not conform with article 26 of the Patent law which states that a patent application must include a description of the drug \u201cin a manner sufficiently clear and complete so as to enable a person skilled in the relevant field of technology to carry it out\u201d. In september 2004, Pfizer filed an appeal against the ruling. the case went to court in april of 2005. In June 2006, a beijing court ruled in favour of Pfizer. gsk\u2019s assertion (in august 2006 and the web posting of their statement on 15 May 2007) of the broad process patent claim and threat of infringement actions against generic manufacturers and importers is understood to have created a chill factor too. however, an important development also took place later with regard to arVs. a domestic manufacturer, anhui biochem united Pharmaceutical co., ltd successfully challenged a gsk patent and won the case through an official adjudication by a sIPo patent re-examination committee on 30 december 2010. anhui biochem had succeeded in obtaining registration for the marketing of its generic product (a combination of zidovudine + 3tc) shortly before the patent re-examination decision. It is the only company that is marketing this generic fdc at the time of writing. the only other fdc currently in the market is gsk\u2019s combivir. for the generic version of single dose 3tc, there are five domestic manufacturers and one joint venture with gsk, which obtained the registration for various dosages in 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively. 51 World trade organization, report of the Working Party on the accession of china.

Most patients live in remote rural, often poor, areas and there is a long supply chain from the central to the provincial, county and finally village level. It is still a challenge for provincial governments to plan for purchase of 3tc a year in advance due to the geographical complexity of china and the different degree of capacity at every level of the supply chain.55 While planned procurement and supply chain management are important factors to ensure that there is no interruption in arV treatment, there are concerns among many in the care and treatment community that dependency on a limited number of originator companies and donations is not sustainable. this is particularly so in the light of the government\u2019s policy to provide selected free arVs. M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, which has had field experiences since 2003 in two provincial treatment centres, reported that they had been contacted numerous times regarding stock-outs of arVs; the healthcare facility concerned has either run out of the drug, never stocked the drug or have insufficient quantities to meet patients\u2019 needs. this means that patients must often turn to the private market. In the absence of publicly available national data on stock ruptures, anecdotal evidence suggests that 3tc and efavirenz (efV) are often not available. both of these are included in the free national art list and form part of the first-line regimen.56 according to Msf, the costs of treatment and care were significant, even when there was access to free arV drugs.57 however, the cost per patient had decreased as a result of the availability of cheaper drugs and the access campaign. the global campaign for access to affordable drugs has contributed to the lowering of international prices that is also enjoyed by a number of countries. In 2005 the government price for a generic arV combination (stavudine or zidovudine, didanosine, and nevirapine) was about cny 3,500 (us$437 at 2005 prices) per person per year. there was no publicly available information regarding the government price paid for a 3tc-based combination, although this was the recommended first-line regimen, as the terms of supply from gsk for 3tc were kept confidential.58 In addition to the expenses that patients already faced, increased costs resulting from the need for access to more expensive second-line aIds therapy grows \u2013 it is estimated that prices can 55 briefing by dr. han Meng Jie (director, state council aIds Working committee office) at the meeting of the un theme group on hIV/aIds care and treatment, 27 March 2008. 56 at 2006 prices, one month\u2019s supply of 3tc (150 mg, 60 tablets) costed cny 1300 (us$162), and a month\u2019s supply of efV (600 mg, 30 tablets) cny 619 (us$77) in the private market.

Patent restrictions are a major obstacle to more domestic production of end products. even the import of cheaper originator or generic arVs available in the international market is currently prevented or subject to conditions imposed by the originator company (or its licensee). Where the arVs are available, the cost of patented arVs is high and so increased need will also strain the public health budget and put the arVs out of the range of almost all those who need treatment. a big gap in the national arV treatment programme remains if there is no sustainable and affordable supply of lamivudine (3tc). generic fixed dose combinations (fdcs) with 3tc were also not available in china until 2011 when the last gsk patent expired (and even then there is only one domestic company producing generic zidovudine+3tc at the moment). Paediatric formulations are not economically attractive as the number of treatment recipients under the government scheme is small, so there is no motivation to consider generic production \u2013 in that scenario patents pose additional barriers. such situations show the problems of patients in terms of adherence and drug resistance. In meeting the problems of hIV/tb co-infections, appropriate fdcs for tb treatment are also needed, but not available. given the high burden of pills and its impact on treatment compliance, fdcs are again very urgently needed. 59 Ibid. 60 see footnote 2 at page 35. 61 Ibid. at page 26. Intellectual ProPerty rIghts and access to affordable arVs In chIna 26 second-line arVs are now the next big gap for both aIds and tb treatment. While this is still limited for PlhIVs, there is no government scheme for second-line treatment for those with tb. table 5 reveals the patent landscape of the fdc of arVs containing tdf in china.

C.1 An overview of China\u2019s pharmaceutical industry the development of the chinese pharmaceutical industry is mainly driven by disease treatment, health recovery and the birth rate of a population of more than 1.3 billion. the investment in healthcare is growing rapidly in china in recent years. this has resulted in the fast growth of china\u2019s pharmaceutical industry. It is also one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical markets with 15-20 percent average annual growth since 1998. china\u2019s pharmaceutical industry has an educated workforce, entrepreneurial culture, relative low labour and resource costs although these have been rising in recent years. all these factors contribute to the fast growth of china\u2019s pharmaceutical industry. now china has emerged as a strong player of aPI and finished pharmaceutical products manufacturing. the chinese industry is dominated by generic production with an estimated 97 percent of drugs produced by domestic suppliers. In 2009, the gross production of china\u2019s pharmaceutical industry was about us$137 billion, which was increased by 21 percent.64 In recent years, there are almost 5,000 companies with sfda good Manufacturing Practice (gMP) certification. More than 160 products of nearly 80 companies have passed european gMP certification. 317 aPI or intermediates have acquired dMf registration numbers of the us fda.65 china is the largest supplier of aPI in the world. aPI constitutes a major trading component in the export and import of china pharmaceutical products, which accounts for 60.55 percent. from January to august 2011, the export of aPI from china was 4.02 million tons, an increase of 32.87 percent compared to the previous year. the value of exports also increased by 28.81 percent to us$14.83 billion. however the average price of the exported products fell by 3.05 percent. china is still at the lower end of the supply chain in global pharmaceutical production. the major markets of china\u2019s aPI are India and other asian countries, which account for 45.51 percent of the aPI exports. following the asian market are europe and north america. India accounts for 14.45 percent of the value of aPI exports and us is the second one with 13.44 percent. the top 10 countries for china\u2019s aPI export are India, us, Japan, korea, the netherlands, brazil, Italy, spain and belgium.66 currently china\u2019s pharmaceutical industry can provide more than 1,400 aPIs and over 4,000 finished pharmaceutical products. Its aPI industry is represented in almost all segments, such as anti-infectives, cardiovasculars, gastrointestinal and metabolism drugs and anti-inflammatory 63 see footnote 18. 64 http://www.stats.gov.cn/was40/gjtjj_detail.jsp?searchword=%d6%c6%d2%a9&channelid=6697&record=17 65 http://wenku.baidu.com/view/0dfade11cc7931b765ce1586.html 66 http://www.cccmhpie.org.cn/Pub/1757/39637.shtml, published on october 14, 2011.

Intellectual ProPerty rIghts and access to affordable arVs In chIna 30 a concern over the outsourcing by Mncs to chinese companies is that the latter will become \u2018locked\u2019 into relationships that delay or even prevent domestic generic end products from being made for the domestic market and for other developing countries in need of affordable essential drugs. this concern is reinforced by the trend in India, where the implementation of pharmaceutical patents and moves by originator companies to take over or merge with Indian generic producers, may change the profile of the generic sector in the world\u2019s largest supplier of generic arVs. C.3 Prospects for China from the above discussion it can be seen that china can potentially be a supplier of finished arV products for the domestic market as well as for export to other countries, especially developing countries that have great need for affordable arVs and other essential medicines. as a leader in aPI production, china can also be a bigger supplier of aPI and related-technology to other developing countries to strengthen generic production in those countries. generic medicines production can be an important component of chinese overseas investment and development assistance programmes, such as the china-africa cooperation initiatives. china\u2019s foundation in science and technology can also contribute to the research and development of innovative pharmaceutical products (medicines, vaccines, medical devices, etc) for both the domestic and global markets. In order to fulfill these potential prospects, china would need to formulate and implement a set of policies, including an appropriate intellectual property strategy that maximizes the use of the trIPs agreement flexibilities discussed below. Importantly, on 13 January 2012 the state council approved the China Action Plan to Prevent and Control HIV/AIDS during the 12th Five-Year Plan80 Period (2011-2015). of particular significance for access to affordable medicines with regard to intellectual property and domestic production is the following: \u201c\u2026commerce, industry and information, intellectual property rights and health authorities shall explore the feasibility of obtaining licenses for production of imported, high cost, patented drugs by domestic enterprises to substantially reduce costs of drugs. development and reform, food and drug supervision, industry and information and health departments shall strengthen guidance and coordination of domestic pharmaceutical enterprises to speed up research and development, production, examination and approval of hIV/aIds medications.\u201d81 MaxIMIsIng flexIbIlItIes In Patent laW for PublIc health for a long time, patents on pharmaceutical products and chemical substances were the exception rather than the rule in many countries, including developed ones.

IP/c/40). for pharmaceutical products ldcs have an even longer period, until 1 January 2016, before they need to provide for pharmaceutical patents and to protect undisclosed information on pharmaceutical products for purposes of market registration. ldcs have the right to seek further extension if needed.83 despite the transition periods for developing and ldcs, in reality many countries, because of unawareness, external pressures or inadequate technical assistance, implemented trIPs obligations before they needed to do so. Many countries also enacted national patent laws that go beyond the trIPs requirements. the transition period played a crucial role in the case of India. India\u2019s Patents act 1970 had been formulated with one important goal: to develop a strong domestic generic pharmaceutical industry, supported by complementary policies and financing. the post-1970 patent regime and the transitional period without product patent protection permitted India to develop a thriving pharmaceutical industry and to become a major supplier of pharmaceutical products domestically and globally (including low-cost active pharmaceutical ingredients). this also created conditions for some of the companies in the industry to growingly invest in research and development.84 the amendment of India\u2019s Patents act to enable India to implement the trIPs agreement from 1 January 2005 went through intensive and difficult public debate. at the centre of the debate was the maximization of trIPs flexibilities. the amended law retains several important flexibilities even 82 economist, 27 May 1995 (asia edition) 83 article 66.1 of the trIPs agreement; doha declaration on the trIPs agreement and Public health (2001), paragraph 7. 84 report of the Who commission on Intellectual Property, Innovation and Public health (2006) at pages 83-84 http:// www.who.int/intellectualproperty/documents/thereport/chPublichealthreport.pdf Intellectual ProPerty rIghts and access to affordable arVs In chIna 32 though India must now allow for patents on pharmaceutical products. however, India has also lost considerable policy and legal autonomy and the future of India as a major generic medicines supplier, especially to developing countries, is uncertain. this means that the potential role of china as a generic producer of finished pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients becomes more important. D.1 Striking a balance in the TRIPS Agreement the introduction of intellectual property rights into the negotiations of trade agreements called the uruguay round (1986-1994) was very controversial with most developing countries objecting to such a move. In the end, as part of a compromise package of agreements, the trIPs agreement was accepted. even though the freedom of individual countries to formulate their own patent or other intellectual property system was reduced, the fundamental concept of the need of balance of rights and interests was retained. thus the trIPs agreement recognizes that \u201cintellectual property rights are private rights\u201d. It also recognizes \u201cthe underlying public policy objectives of national systems for the protection of intellectual property, including developmental and technological objectives\u201d (Preamble). article 1 of the trIPs agreement states that \u201cMembers may, but shall not be obliged to, implement in their law more extensive protection than is required by this agreement \u2026 Members shall be free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the provisions of this agreement within their own legal system and practice \u2026\u201d.85 article 7 on objectives states that: \u201cthe protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to balance of rights and obligations\u201d .86 article 8 on Principles states that: \u201c1.

While recognizing that \u201cintellectual property protection is important for the development of new medicines\u201d, the declaration also recognizes \u201cthe concerns about its effects on prices\u201d (paragraph 3). It was agreed that \u201cthe trIPs agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health\u201d and accordingly while the commitment to the trIPs agreement was reiterated, the declaration \u201caffirm that the agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of Wto Members\u2019 right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all\u201d (paragraph 4). In this connection, the declaration \u201creaffirm(ed) the right of Wto Members to use, to the full, the provisions in the trIPs agreement, which provide flexibility for this purpose\u201d (paragraph 4). It is important to note that the doha declaration did not create any new rights but reaffirmed what was already in the trIPs agreement. although hIV, tuberculosis and malaria and other epidemics were highlighted, there are no limits on the types of diseases in the doha declaration. thus governments are not restricted to any diseases when it comes to ensuring affordable essential medicines for their citizens. two influential reports emphasized the crucial importance of the trIPs agreement flexibilities for developing countries: \u2022\ufffd Integrating Intellectual Property rights and development Policy \u2013 report of the commission on Intellectual Property rights, established by the united kingdom (2002)90; and \u2022\ufffd report of the Who commission on Intellectual Property rights, Innovation and Public health (2006)91. 88 see, e.g., ellen t\u2019hoen, TRIPS, Pharmaceutical Patents and Access to Essential Medicines: Seattle, Doha and Beyond, available at http://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/topics/ip/thoen.pdf. 89 on the impact of the doha declaration, see c correa and d Matthews, The Doha Declaration ten years on and its impact on access to medicines and the right to health.

International public interest groups, the foreign private sector and foreign governments were also free to submit their views. china has long been a target for the industries and governments of developed countries, especially the us, who have sought to ensure \u2018high standards\u2019 for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in china. china had lost room for manoeuvre since the early 1990s when it entered into its first bilateral IPr agreement with the us and continued to make more concessions in the bilateral negotiations with the us and other developed countries in order to be accepted to join the Wto. bilateral IPr agreements between china and the us were negotiated in 1992, 1995 and 1996. the biggest concession was allowing for product pharmaceutical patents since 1992 when there was no international obligation to do so. related to this was the retrospective granting of 7.5 years exclusivity through \u2018administrative Protection\u2019 by sfda, for drugs that were patented abroad, but not in china, between 1 January 1986 and 1 January 1993. by the time china joined the Wto in 2001 after nearly 15 years of Wto accession negotiations, china had agreed to a number of \u2018trIPs- plus\u201997 obligations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c81cf90-5e3e-4d7b-ae08-1b4d39cec46e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c81cf90-5e3e-4d7b-ae08-1b4d39cec46e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Intellectual Property Rights and Access to Affordable ARVs in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36aeec9e19d0a2395954b5d2ffa0adbad955a8cf22328f9e7022153629262045"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd2c4090-9828-4bef-bdd2-42651f705e48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49a5184a23fd38bd2b78c238a5376aa962ae1499dce30177adb3951c29b45202"}}, "hash": "13f8720b6510ed2305414171d22953ef78f902e5222f8efe23e586eca2f9f3b8", "text": "a Joint commission on commerce and trade (Jcct) was established in 1983 as a forum for high-level dialogue on bilateral trade issues.

Interestingly, the pharmaceutical sector chose not to have its interests asserted in this complaint.\u201d. awareness has increased in china among policy makers and regulators, patent examiners, researchers, the hIV community, relevant ngos and the domestic pharmaceutical companies about the importance of trIPs flexibilities for the production and distribution of generic medicines, and for ensuring access to affordable arVs and other essential medicines. for instance, at the same symposium mentioned above, deputy commissioner of sIPo, li yuguang, said: \u201c\u2026 the grant and protection of the exclusive rights (of patent) is not the ultimate goal of the patent system. the real purpose \u2026 is to stimulate innovation and invention and promote scientific and technological progress. from this angle, we should reasonably balance the relationship between patent right holder\u2019s exclusive rights and the public interests. no bias should be allowed. While strengthening patent protection, we should prevent damage to just public interests caused by the improper exercise of patent rights. If we allow patent right holders to abuse their exclusive rights, directly preventing the vast patients who are suffering from diseases and even facing the threat of death from gaining medicine to survive, we are going counter to the goal of our IP system. In this sense, we should immediately adopt effective measures, bring the active roles of patent protection into full play, and eliminate the negative influences brought by patent rights abuse, exploring more feasible plans to resolve public health problems and increase access to medicines, and promoting the harmony and balance between IPr protection and public interests maintenance. the system of compulsory licensing of Patent Implementation is an important measure to prevent exclusive rights abuse and maintain public interests. In simple words, under the legal conditions, the state governmental departments can authorise a third party to exercise some certain patented technologies according to law even without authorisation from the patent right holders.\u201d E.1 China\u2019s National Intellectual Property Strategy on 5 June 2008 china\u2019s National Intellectual Property Strategy was publicly announced.

Its main duties included: putting forward suggestions about the implementation of the strategy-formulation work, undertaking day to day work assigned by the leading group, monitoring the implementation of the decisions made by the leading group, coordinating national intellectual property strategy- related matters among related ministries. china is one of the few developing countries that have formulated a national intellectual property strategy, and it has done so through a transparent process that involved a wide range of ministries, numerous studies (both macro issues and research on specific sectors and industries) and consultations within the country and with foreign experts. Inputs from the domestic and international public health community on access to affordable essential medicines were also a contribution to the strategy formulation.100 several visits were also made to the patent offices in the brazil, India, Japan, europe and the us. there were four phases in the formulation process: the preparation phase, the substantial research phase, public opinion and comments-soliciting phase and the final phase. In 2006, when most of the research groups had concluded their substantial research work, comments were solicited from related government agencies, enterprises and others. there was considerable interest in international IP experiences and listening to the opinions and suggestions of other countries on national intellectual property strategy formulation work. on 12 January 2006, nIPso held a meeting to solicit comments on china\u2019s national Intellectual Property strategy formulation Work from foreign embassies in beijing. on 23-24 february 2006, an international seminar was held in beijing.101 this was followed on 13 July 2006 with a meeting to listen to opinions and suggestions from foreign enterprises in china. nIPso also established a specific governmental website to disseminate related information and collect views and opinions from people of various circles. the main contents of the national IP strategy include not only analysis of macro issues such as the impact of IP on economic and social development but also some case studies of some typical industries that are mostly influenced by IP. It comprises a general outline part and a special topics part. the national intellectual property strategy outline is intended to guide china\u2019s IP work in the next 15 to 20 years.

Intellectual ProPerty rIghts and access to affordable arVs In chIna 40 E.2 Patent ownership in China there has been an impressive growth of patent applications and grants in the last decade in china. Patent grants increased by 28.80 percent in 2000-2006, with a slightly higher rate for foreign owned patents (30.90 percent against 26.30 percent of domestic patenting)105. 92.867 invention patents were granted in this period for domestic applicants and155,190 to foreign applicants106. In 2011 alone, sIPo granted 172,000 invention patents, up by 27.4 percent from the previous year; 112,000 (65.1 percent) were granted to domestic applicants and 60,000 (34.9 percent) to foreign applicants107. on 1 october 1993, china acceded to the Patent cooperation treaty (Pct) which entered into force in the country on 1 January 1994. this was also part of the obligation under the 1992 bilateral IPr agreement with the us. the Pct makes it possible to seek patent protection for an invention simultaneously in each of a large number of countries by filing an \u2018international\u2019 patent application. such an application may be filed by anyone who is a national or resident of a Pct contracting state. It may generally be filed with the national patent office of the contracting state of which the applicant is a national or resident or, at the applicant\u2019s option, with the International bureau of the World Intellectual Property organisation (WIPo) in geneva.108 as a receiving office of the Pct, sIPo received a total of 17,473 Pct applications in 2011, up 35.3 percent from the previous year109. In 2011, sIPo received 66,320 Pct applications that entered china\u2019s national phase, up 6.0 percent year on year, among which 65,996 were invention patents applications and 324 were utility model applications. since 1994, sIPo had received a total of 541,009 Pct applications that entered china\u2019s national phase110. In 2011, the largest number of patent applications classified by sector received by sIPo related to pharmaceuticals.111although specific data is not available, the percentage of pharmaceutical patents can be expected to be even much higher for foreign patent holders compared to domestic patent holders. certainly, the patents on arVs are almost exclusively held by foreign entities. there is a noticeable proliferation of patent applications and grants in the pharmaceutical field. large numbers of applications on developments with no or low inventive step are often filed. this trend should be of concern to the various relevant government authorities, as there are serious implications for china\u2019s development prospects in terms of research and innovation, as well as for access to essential products such as affordable pharmaceutical products. E.3 China\u2019s Patent Law and Implementing Regulations the Patent law of china was adopted on 12 March 1984 and entered into force on 1 april 1985.

In 1992, following the first bilateral IPr agreement with the united states, there was a revision of the Patent law repealing the exclusion of patents on pharmaceutical products and substances. by so doing, china that was in the midst of a long negotiation process to join the Wto, prematurely allowed product patents. as mentioned, Members of the Wto that were developing countries had a right not to allow for pharmaceutical product patents until 1 January 2005 if they did not grant them at the time the trIPs agreement entered into force for them. a third revision of the Patent law was undertaken in 2006. a draft for Patent law amendment was submitted by sIPo to the state council on 27 december 2006. after several rounds of discussions at the state council and the standing committee of the 11th national People\u2019s congress, the amendments were adopted on 27 december 2008, entering into force on 1st october 2009. the third Patent law revision was undertaken in parallel with the formulation of the national IP strategy, both of which entailed considerable research and analysis as well as a wide solicitation of domestic and international views and inputs.

In december 2007, 21 project teams submitted their research reports in relation to 16 important issues, including the improvement of legislation on compulsory licensing. In March 2008 the legal affairs department of sIPo completed the preliminary draft of the revised regulations to be aligned with the revised Patent law. the Patent examination guidelines of 2006 were revised in 2010. the revisions adopted in 2008 related to public health were aimed at increasing the use of trIPs flexibilities. they are discussed in the following sub-sections. E.3.1 Scope of patentability/exclusions from patentability the Patent law uses the term \u2018invention-creations\u2019 to refer to inventions, utility models and designs (article 2). \u2018Inventions\u2019 mean new technical solutions proposed for a product, a process or the improvement thereof. Pharmaceutical products and processes and improvements thereof can be patented under the Patent law as inventions for 20 years from the date of application, upon a successful examination. a utility model or design can be protected for 10 years from the date of application (article 42). no patent right shall be granted for any invention that violates the law or social ethics, or harms public interests (article 5). In addition, article 25 of the law lists out exclusions from patentability: \u2022\ufffd scientific discoveries; \u2022\ufffd rules and methods for intellectual activities; \u2022\ufffd methods for the diagnosis or for the treatment of diseases; \u2022\ufffd animal or plant varieties113; \u2022\ufffd substances obtained by means of nuclear transformation. 113 Processes for producing animal or plant varieties may be patented. Intellectual ProPerty rIghts and access to affordable arVs In chIna 42 E.3.2 Patentability Criteria and Examination of Patent Applications an important \ufb02exibility under the trIPs agreement is the right of Wto Members to de\ufb01ne the patentability criteria under article 27.1 in accordance with their particular national priorities. article 27.1 of the trIPs agreement states that patents \u201cshall be available for any inventions \u2026 provided that they are new, involve an inventive step and are capable of industrial application\u201d. however there is no requirement on how these criteria are to be applied. Wto members can thus adopt their own definitions of the patentability standards. appropriate patentability standards may be an important tool for the promotion of genuinely new and inventive pharmaceutical products, and to ensure access to affordable essential medicines. a common belief is that patents are normally granted to protect new medicines, but while the number of patents annually obtained to protect genuinely new pharmaceutical products is small and declining, thousands of patents are granted for pharmaceuticals. a large number of patents cover minor modi\ufb01cations of older existing drugs114. the general terms used in trIPs article 27.1 have permitted Wto Members to keep different criteria to assess patentability. the de\ufb01nition of such criteria constitutes a key aspect of patent policy, with implications in other areas, such as industrial and public health policies. the narrower the novelty standard, the lower the bar to assess inventive step, and the broader the concept of industrial applicability or utility, the greater the number of applications that may be granted in a particular country. a greater number of grants made on the basis of low standards of patentability may lead to unnecessary limitations on competition without benefit to society.115 article 22 of china\u2019s Patent law sets out the requirements for granting a patent, whereby the invention or utility model must \u2018possess the characteristics of novelty, inventiveness and usefulness\u2019. Novelty means that the invention does not form part of the prior art including published patent applications filed with sIPo by any unit or individual for any identical invention. Inventiveness means that, as compared with the prior art, the invention has prominent substantive features and represents a notable progress. Usefulness means that the invention can be made or used and can produce effective results. under the Patent law, china applies a substantive examination system. the 2001 sIPo guidelines for examination (revised in 2006 and 2010) develop the provisions of the Patent law and its Implementing rules. the Patent office makes decisions on applications, on behalf of sIPo. the Patent review board, set up by sIPo, is responsible for examining requests for re-examination and requests for invalidation and for making decisions accordingly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3390847-e128-464d-9c31-bdeb4e5c6e82": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3390847-e128-464d-9c31-bdeb4e5c6e82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Intellectual Property Rights and Access to Affordable ARVs in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7afb76b5a471f04e6bbb6492de3b1f8b27b74758ececf792b10d9cfb67362bfa"}, "2": {"node_id": "984d16ab-0b98-4498-aae4-f62e75289bcd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc4ef0d9a2c59014cdb71ce99a4d57d22f31838a100f7e8e526b7e89d10848f0"}}, "hash": "9e7406428c43b872d0d075107a4b0a59a3b0176608779aa7de72871d3af9f2d8", "text": "some of the grounds for rejecting a patent application are as follows: \u2022\ufffd the invention does not fall under the definition of invention. \u2022\ufffd the invention violates the law or social ethics, or harm public interests, according to article 5 of the Patent law. 114 c correa, Guidelines for the examination of pharmaceutical patents: Developing a public health perspective", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69927b2a-b5b8-476c-921c-3f14f02125df": {"__data__": {"id_": "69927b2a-b5b8-476c-921c-3f14f02125df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Intellectual Property Rights and Access to Affordable ARVs in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82f873d53ef773e4a88006ae64ac620a8e3ccce43ef6a3c7dbf1392d0c04f3b7"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f932d4c-ea02-4505-b4c2-aa6ec53cb26d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7ead7460847c55443bee8a8fdbec0ed634d2bc03f61fec5ab5f453a8e2242cd"}}, "hash": "d6e4e5543cb3286bd5bbbfe1ade6ea61d8a4f15142c47fc757e9c87eb3ad4fd2", "text": "(2007), Who-Ictsd-unctad-undP, geneva. 115 Ibid. 43 e.

It is interesting to note that gsk had announced during the world hIV conference in 2006, that it would withdraw combivir patents world-wide. however, information from sIPo showed that during the whole process of patent examination and re-examination, gsk never requested to withdraw its patent application in china.116 although there was no product patent on combivir in china, there was \u2018administrative Protection\u2019 from the sfda conferring exclusivity on lamivudine (3tc) until october 2006. as discussed above in section b, gsk continued to assert that one of its then existing process patents was broad enough to cover products containing 3tc. this continued to prevent domestic production or import of generic 3tc until 2011. though there was ultimately a successful challenge to the gsk patent in late 2010 the period between this and the expiry of the questionable patent was very short. 116 communication from Msf in 2007.

In order to standardize the procedures for granting such licenses, including the content and the hearing of the request, the Measures on the Compulsory Licence for Exploitation of a Patent were promulgated in 2003. the 2003 Measures have been revised to be in line with the latest (2008) amendments made to the Patent law and Implementing regulations. In 2011 the public was invited to provide comments and consultation meetings were held with relevant government bodies, domestic and international ngos and private companies. since compulsory licensing applies to all processes and products, consultations also covered non-public health related fields. the Measures for Implementation of 117 only patents on inventions and utility models can be subject matter of compulsory licenses, not designs. 45 e.

In March 2006, a proposal from dr. shao yiming (chief scientist at the national centre for aIds and a virologist) was submitted to the china People\u2019s Political consultative congress (cPPcc). dr. shao himself was a member of the cPPcc. the proposal contained the following suggestions: \u2022\ufffd that Moh immediately organize experts to research and establish a list of urgently needed, patented anti-aIds antiretroviral drugs in china. \u2022\ufffd that Moh start the procedure of compulsory licensing of generic drugs as soon as possible, according to the chinese law and the relevant procedures of the Wto decision. \u2022\ufffd that sfda assist manufacturers to undertake production and grant registration as soon as possible. \u2022\ufffd that relevant sections of the country provide technical support to generic manufacturers in order to acquire approval from the Who, so that they can enter the international generic drug market. \u2022\ufffd that the Ministry of commerce and Ministry of foreign affairs, through china\u2019s commercial and diplomatic channels, help african countries to acquire generic drugs made in china for patients\u2019 use. china should consider anti-aIds drugs as part of its other aid activities for africa. on 14 March 2008 a civil society \u201cProposal about Improving drug registration Process, Modifying relevant Provisions and ensuring arV supply\u201d was mailed to the national People\u2019s congress, the national committee of the cPPcc and the Ministry of health. the proposal was made by thomas cai (head of aIds care china) and Wan yanhai (director of aizhi Institute, who represented the concerns of the hepatitis b community). It highlighted the control of arV patents by foreign pharmaceutical companies and the delay in the availability of tenofovir (tdf) and lamivudine, the latter being an essential drug for both the aIds and hepatitis b communities. the proposal requested, among other things, a \u201cfurther revision of the Patent law and its implementation provision and to adopt more of the flexibilities in the International treaty (trIPs) that is beneficial to china while china carries out its obligation at the Wto\u201d. such a move would \u201cprotect the right of chinese citizens to life and health and reduce the financial burden of the chinese People\u201d. since 2010 there have been some indications from the Moh at a high level that compulsory licensing is an option for consideration.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9211d084-ba45-4ec3-8ca8-ce2d5a630a01": {"__data__": {"id_": "9211d084-ba45-4ec3-8ca8-ce2d5a630a01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Intellectual Property Rights and Access to Affordable ARVs in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "250e11c6f54b3cd5a8ce8d96b0dc4a5ac2666e9465d33e8ba657974e28e9ca26"}, "2": {"node_id": "7cb6f75c-b8ab-4730-8112-c5ac3cc4b66e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b98ccbb777ed07ff03d2c296dd9bc4aa6eadd0b14ce2fbfcc5cc03853b7b9e9a"}}, "hash": "1e711d73db1d51396af42d6a6683b220a62d3daa2a46f092fa3c48c93c44408a", "text": "In line with the ongoing health reform in the country, a revision of the essential medicines list has taken place and, as seen from the above discussion in section b, china\u2019s national response to the hIV epidemic has been progressing significantly on 120 opening plenary, International symposium on trIPs and Public health, beijing, 10 June 2008. organized by the Ministry of commerce, the Ministry of health and the state Intellectual Property office. 47 e.

If a country has no manufacturing capacity, a bolar provision is still useful because it can speed up the registration of a generic product by a foreign supplier so that affordable imports are available.

E.3.6 Parallel importation there are significant price differences for patented pharmaceutical products in different markets. a country can legally import the cheapest patented product (without the consent of the patent holder) by applying the principle of \u2018international exhaustion\u2019. this means that the first sale by the patent holder or its authorised agent/representative, or by a compulsory licensee, in any country will exhaust the parallel intellectual property right in the importing country. Medicines under a parallel import are usually purchased from a party other than the patent holder (e.g. a wholesaler) who first purchased the medicines from the patent holder or its authorized representative. the report of the Who commission on Intellectual Property, Innovation and Public health explains this: \u201c \u2018exhaustion\u2019 in intellectual property law essentially means the exact point in the process of sale where the rights of the patent holder become \u2018exhausted\u2019. Where the principle of international exhaustion is applied in national law, this is equivalent to allowing what are called parallel imports. In practice, this means a situation, for example, where a wholesaler in country a makes available to a purchaser in country b a product patented in both countries at a lower price than it is available in country b. If country b allows parallel imports, then the purchaser could import the product at a lower price than the product is available locally. thus, in principle, parallel imports are a means to reduce the cost of medicines where there are significant inter-country differences in prices\u201d (page 123). 122 report of the Who commission on Intellectual Property, Innovation and Public health (2006), definition in the glossary. 49 e. IMPleMentIng trIPs flexIbIlItIes In chIna the trIPs agreement (article 6) allows countries to permit parallel importation. however, national laws must explicitly provide for parallel importation. It is advisable to do so by providing for the widest scope, i.e. using the principle of \u201cinternational exhaustion\u201d for any product legitimately put on the market abroad. article 69(1) of china\u2019s Patent law provides for this flexibility as follows: \u201cafter a patented product or a product directly obtained by using the patented method is sold by the patentee or sold by any unit or individual with the permission of the patentee, any other person uses, offers to sell, sells or imports that product\u201d this shall not be deemed to be an infringement of the patent right. thus china is taking a positive step by applying the principle of international exhaustion to allow for parallel imports, i.e. the possibility of importing, for instance, the cheapest priced patented product from anywhere in the world. It would be important to interpret that \u2018permission of the patentee\u2019 does not exclude situations where a product has been commercialized under a compulsory license or government use. E.4 Data protection one very important factor for timely and economical market entry of generic pharmaceutical products is the reliance of the generic manufacturer on the clinical and other test data of the originator company. the market monopoly conferred by a patent for a minimum of 20 years is balanced by generic manufacturers entering the market much later but not having to repeat all the clinical trials and other tests for drugs that are proven to be equivalent. this balance is crucial for promoting access to affordable medicines. In some jurisdictions test and other data have been subjected to restrictions so that generic manufacturers and drug regulatory authorities are prevented from relying on such data to register generic versions of the drugs for a certain period. the legal regime that is used is called \u201cdata exclusivity\u201d. according to article 39.3 of the trIPs agreement, \u201cMembers, when requiring, as a condition of approving the marketing of pharmaceutical or of agricultural chemical products which utilize new chemical entities, the submission of undisclosed test or other data, the origination of which involves a considerable effort, shall protect such data against unfair commercial use. In addition, Members shall protect such data against disclosure, except where necessary to protect the public or unless steps are taken to ensure that the data are protected against unfair commercial use\u201d. article 39.3 was very controversial in the trIPs agreement negotiations, where developing countries explicitly rejected the notion of \u201cdata exclusivity\u201d that would prevent drug registration authorities from relying on test and other data from originator companies to register generic versions of the same drug. generic manufacturers", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80164e72-d4f3-47c3-83c8-43ef785e2f87": {"__data__": {"id_": "80164e72-d4f3-47c3-83c8-43ef785e2f87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Intellectual Property Rights and Access to Affordable ARVs in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c61488d91eccace1d50b66b6ae9607b352a7e2ba069e514ed103add3c6480acc"}}, "hash": "c61488d91eccace1d50b66b6ae9607b352a7e2ba069e514ed103add3c6480acc", "text": "would also be obliged to seek the consent of the originator company to use its data for the registration of the generic product. Moreover, there are strong ethical reasons not to repeat clinical trials once the generic version is proven to be equivalent to the originator drug. In the marketing approval/drug registration process, the regulatory authority that relies on test data developed by one particular company to approve a generic version is not itself making unfair commercial use of the data. so national drug registration authorities should not be restricted by article 39.3 and can rely on the data concerned in considering market approval of a generic medicine. these authorities are nevertheless bound to comply with the obligation of non- disclosure. Intellectual ProPerty rIghts and access to affordable arVs In chIna 50 there are four conditions under article 39.3 for a party to obtain data protection in the drug marketing approval process: \u2022\ufffd the pharmaceutical product utilizes new chemical entities; \u2022\ufffd the data is undisclosed; \u2022\ufffd the data was obtained with considerable effort; \u2022\ufffd the submission of the data is necessary to obtain marketing approval. It is only when these conditions are satisfied that the Wto Member concerned has to meet two obligations under article 39.3: \u2022\ufffd to protect the data submitted for marketing approval against unfair commercial use and \u2022\ufffd to protect the submitted data against disclosure by the authorities to third parties. however, disclosure is permitted in two circumstances i.e. to protect the public and to disclose data after taking steps against unfair commercial use. however, the global pharmaceutical industry, the us government and the eu have consistently demanded developing countries to provide for data exclusivity, especially through bilateral trade or IPr agreements, far beyond the requirements of the trIPs agreement. the report of the Who commission on Intellectual Property, Innovation and Public health re- affirmed that data exclusivity is not required by trIPs and is therefore \u201ctrIPs-plus\u201d. It warned about the negative effects that such exclusivity might have in developing countries. While stressing the trIPs-plus nature of data exclusivity the report noted that \u201cdeveloping countries need to decide in the light of their own circumstances, what provisions, consistent with the trIPs agreement, would benefit public health, weighing the positive effects against the negative effects. a public health justification should be required for data protection rules going beyond what is required by the trIPs agreement. there is unlikely to be such a justification in markets with a limited ability to pay and little innovative capacity. thus, developing countries should not impose restrictions for the use of or reliance on such data in ways that would exclude fair competition or impede the use of flexibilities built into trIPs\u201d (recommendation 4.20). the report stressed that it would be necessary to study the impact on access to medicines that such regulations may have when applied in developing countries123 where, as it is the case for patents, data exclusivity is not likely to encourage any r&d. the opposite result is likely - high prices even in the absence of patent protection. china agreed to provide data protection for 6 years as a condition to join the Wto. this is contained in article 35 of the regulations for Implementation of the drug administration law, applied under the responsibility of the sfda: \u201cthe state protects undisclosed data of drug study and other data which are independently acquired and submitted by drug manufacturers or sellers to obtain production or marketing approval of the drugs in question which contain new chemical entities. no one may make unfair commercial use of the said data. 123 a number of studies have been made with this purpose. for an analysis of the economic literature on the impact of exclusivity, see Maskus, k.

Provincial std/aIds associations have also been strengthened. by the end of october 2007, std/aIds associations had been established and further developed in 18 provinces, while many districts and cities had also been motivated to establish std/aIds associations. civil society organizations and community-based groups are implementing an increasing number of aIds interventions at various levels. the number of community-based groups, including PlhIV support groups, women\u2019s groups and most-at-risk intervention groups increased from around 100 to over 400 by 2007. More than 6,000 volunteers are working within MsM community groups nationwide at the present time. by participating in project design, implementation and monitoring, the initiatives and commitment of community-based and PlhIV groups continue to be strengthened, which reflects the gIPa principle. some civil society organizations played an active role in the global fund country coordinating Mechanism (ccM) reforms. the faith- based organizations, such as buddhist, Islamic and christian groups, also participated in the f Intellectual ProPerty rIghts and access to affordable arVs In chIna 52 hIV awareness campaigns and support activities in xinjiang, yunnan, ningxia, shaanxi, hunan, liaoning and other areas\u201d. 124 however, the Joint assessment also identified challenges: \u201cCapacity development and engagement: all society involvement is insufficient. Mass organizations involvement is limited, while the capacity and experience of civil society organizations is not satisfactory. difficulties in obtaining formal registration and legal status have limited the number of community-based organizations working in the aIds field and constrain the further development and professionalism of these organizations. Communication channels: there are inadequate communication channels and dialogue between individual civil society organizations, and between civil society, government and other bodies. Private sector involvement: Involvement in aIds work by business enterprises and individuals remains limited and the principles and opportunities to incorporate hIV awareness and prevention into the workplace are not widely understood\u201d.125 the Joint assessment proceeded to make some recommendations: \u201cfurther adjust and complete regulations and laws to establish an enabling policy environment for the development of civil society organizations dealing with aIds. through different methods, strengthen communication within civil society organizations and between these organizations and related government agencies. given the role of civil society organizations in fund-raising, the government also needs to provide support with supplementary financial and technical assistance in accordance with the actual needs. technical support and guidance should assist civil society organizations to link with target groups that government agencies have difficulty accessing, thereby becoming key partners in the aIds response, covering both implementation and evaluation of outcomes and impact. corporate social responsibility contribution and individual commitment should be fostered, backed by more intensive workplace hIV awareness and anti-discrimination campaigns.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

is a component, has to be one where governments and civil society share the responsibility to search for the best ways to respect human rights. since late 2007 the hIV community and the hepatitis b community have explored their common concerns and needs. In tandem with treatment and care support, fighting against discrimination and bringing awareness to the broader society, these communities are also beginning to take on issues related to the legal basis for access to affordable essential drugs. 124 footnote 2, at pages 14-15. 125 Ibid. at page 35 126 Ibid. at pages 35-36 53 f. the role of cIVl socIety at the same time, the un technical Working group on care and treatment has contributed to civil society inputs in various ways in the period 2006 to 2008. this Working group co-chaired by the Who china office and undP, and included among others the unaIds, china national center for aIds/std control and Prevention (a government body), clinton foundation, M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, china-Msd hIV/aIds Partnership, third World network, family health International, global fund Watch Initiative a chinese ngo. the goal of the Working group is to expand access to care, treatment and support for PlhIV in china. care and treatment issues encompass a wide range of activities ranging from planning care and treatment programs to access to and quality of arV medicines and diagnostics and monitoring and evaluation. the main objectives of the Working group are to: \u2022\ufffd share information, experiences and data; \u2022\ufffd Provide in-depth discussions on topics and issues to promote increased understanding and action; \u2022\ufffd Increased networking and collaboration. an area of focus for the Working group was to tap the intellectual property expertise of members especially from M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res and third World network, and to share this with the governmental and civil society groups. the emergence of the china access to Medicines research group in 2007, which brings legal and pharmaceutical expertise, as well as conduct outreach to policy makers, the research community and other ngos is very encouraging. as the capacity of domestic civil society groups continues to be built, international ngos can also respond to opportunities to provide feedback and inputs in legislative revisions and amendments. for example sIPo solicited public feedback to a draft of the proposed revisions to the Patent law in 2006 and also conducted an on-line session. a call for public feedback is instituted for revision of implementing regulations and measures. consultations are also conducted from time to time. sfda also solicited opinions on its revision of the Provisions for drug registration by publicizing a draft for comment on 10 March 2007. a second draft was open for further inputs in June 2007. the transparency in law making and revision is in large part a response to transparency obligations under china\u2019s bilateral and multilateral obligations but it can also be said that a culture of consultation is emerging. the issue is the extent to which the inputs and feedback from consultations (as in other countries or institutions) are taken into account. nevertheless in a country where civil society is emerging in various sectors, the hIV community is one of the most vibrant sectors. the potential cooperation between the hIV community and hepatitis b community over a common essential drug \u2013 lamivudine (3tc) \u2013 is positive as it provides a clearer picture of the scale of need for an essential drug and the obstacles to affordable and sustainable access. civil society groups have the ability to monitor situations on the ground, alert the government to potential problems (such as shortages of lamivudine in some treatment centres) and be part of the national treatment programme.

Key populations The term \u2018key populations at higher risk of HIV\u2019 or \u2018key populations\u2019 refers to those who are most likely to be exposed to HIV or to transmit it, and whose engagement is critical to a successful response. In all countries, key populations include people living with HIV. In most settings, men who have sex with men, transgender persons, people who inject drugs, sex workers and their clients, and sero-negative partners in sero-discordant couples are at higher risk of exposure to HIV than other people. 6 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations Acknowledgements This report is a direct follow-up to Global Commission on HIV and the Law: Risks, Rights and Health (July 2012) and the Asia-Pacific Regional Dialogue of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law convened in Bangkok in February 2011.

National frameworks 1.1 National HIV strategies and plans should include specific targeted actions for: law reform; increased access to justice for people living with HIV (PLHIV) and key populations; and capacity development of parliamentarians, judiciary, police and other key institutions to implement and enforce HIV-related human rights and protective laws. 1.2 Donors including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria should support government and civil society programming on HIV-related human rights, including access to justice programmes. 1.3 Governments should support research to inform efforts to improve the legal environment for HIV responses, including monitoring and evaluation of the impact of HIV-related laws, and of capacity development, legal empowerment and access to justice interventions. Governments should support participatory evaluations of HIV- related human rights legislation in partnership with PLHIV organizations. 2. Law reform 2.1 Law reform should be informed by systematic legislative reviews that assess laws against the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights. Governments should ensure comprehensive protective legislation is in place that addresses the following rights: a. Right to equality and protection from discrimination. b. Right to protection from HIV-related vilification, stigmatization and insult. c. Right to protection from violence. d. Right to privacy and confidentiality. e. Right to voluntary and informed consent to HIV testing and treatment. f. Rights of young people. This includes consideration of young people\u2019s rights to confidentiality and to consent to testing and treatment, independent of their parents. g. Right to pre-test and post-test counseling. h. Right to participation of PLHIV and key populations in planning and delivering HIV programmes. i. Right to access to the means of HIV prevention. 10 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations j. Right to education and information on HIV prevention, treatment and care. k. Right to the highest attainable standard of health, including access to ARVs. l. Sexual and reproductive health rights of PLHIV and key populations. 2.2 Anti-discrimination laws should include a clear and comprehensive definition of conduct that constitutes unlawful HIV-related discrimination, including: a. Discrimination in the areas of employment, health care, access to places, accommodation, education, childcare, insurance, funerals and provision of other goods and services. b. Discrimination on the grounds of HIV status and presumed or suspected HIV status, and discrimination against family members or other associates of PLHIV. c. Discrimination by public and private sector bodies. 2.3 Protective legislation should prevail over other legislation. 2.4 Protective laws should include provisions to make laws enforceable and accessible for PLHIV and key populations, including: a. provisions empowering individuals to claim redress (such as compensation or reinstatement) through the courts, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes or other mechanisms; b. provisions establishing criminal and administrative offences and penalties, for violation of provisions relating to non-discrimination, non-consensual testing, breach of confidentiality and other human rights violations; c. provisions enabling PLHIV to lodge complaints to courts and/or national human rights institutions (NHRIs) or other bodies without risking public disclosure of their HIV status; and d. provisions for public interest litigation and for the making of court orders to address systemic issues, such as changing discriminatory policies. 3. Access to justice and legal empowerment 3.1 Governments, lawyers\u2019 associations and funders should give priority to supporting access to justice and legal empowerment programmes for PLHIV and key populations. 3.2 Legal aid services should be provided for PLHIV and key populations for complaints relating to discrimination, violence protection and other human rights violations. 11 Summary of recommendationS SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS Specialist HIV legal advice services should be provided to PLHIV and key populations through telephone hotlines and outreach. 3.3 Support should be provided to \u2018know your rights\u2019 campaigns and community legal education. 3.4 Support should be provided to peer-led advocacy initiatives, so that PLHIV and key populations can self-advocate their rights and negotiate resolution of complaints and protection of their rights in relation to health care services, police, and other bodies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "218657da-38eb-4819-b663-9a98283695f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "218657da-38eb-4819-b663-9a98283695f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5cbb9991ee8c0573c7a6452869351936a599dc8b3a454087f6b9269d4c3018a"}, "2": {"node_id": "679873f0-b332-404a-bee9-86919297d24d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3c407649c9e63372eccbca6c29350d3c941ff95d5c2866844ed9980cc14d494"}}, "hash": "66d84894642432eef6facc33bd3a4f5dd9b92f624885d72f27897ba202dd4ee7", "text": "3.5 Support should be provided to community-based HIV organizations to provide human rights advocacy services including advising clients of their human and legal rights, referring clients to relevant grievance bodies, collecting data on human rights issues and conducting advocacy campaigns for law and policy reform. 4.

Introduction 1.1 Objectives The objectives of this study were to: i. document the experiences of countries of Asia and the Pacific in enacting and enforcing the provisions of national HIV laws addressing HIV-related discrimination and other HIV-related human rights violations; ii. describe additional or alternative approaches (other than inclusion of protections of rights within national HV laws) that have been pursued in Asia and the Pacific for the protection and promotion of human rights in the context of HIV; iii. supplement the findings of the review with inputs from consultations with civil society, government partners, UN agencies and other stakeholders; and iv. provide recommendations to improve legal protections for people living with HIV (PLHIV) and other key populations.1 1.2 Methodology The study was conducted in the period June 2012 \u2013 December 2012. It involved the following steps: i. Development of a draft paper based on a literature review. The focus of the paper was on low and middle-income countries of Asia and the Pacific, with particular attention to case studies of the experience of states with national HIV laws (Cambodia, China, Fiji, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Viet Nam). ii. Circulation of the draft paper to receive inputs from stakeholders including national legal experts, UN country offices, PLHIV networks and other civil society stakeholders. iii. Travel to Papua New Guinea (September 2012) to further explore the case study and consult on recommendations with UN, government and civil society partners. Travel to China (November 2012) to attend a national legal workshop and consult with UN agencies and legal experts on the case study. iv. Revision of the draft paper to develop a final report, based on all inputs. The final report includes regional recommendations. Some suggestions for consideration are also made in the respective country chapters. Detailed country-specific 1 The term \u2018key populations at higher risk of HIV\u2019 or \u2018key populations\u2019 refers to those who are most likely to be exposed to HIV or to transmit it, and whose engagement is critical to a successful response. In all countries, key populations include people living with HIV. In most settings, men who have sex with men, transgender persons, people who inject drugs, sex workers and their clients, and sero-negative partners in sero-discordant couples are at higher risk of exposure to HIV than other people. 14 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations recommendations are provided for Papua New Guinea, where a country visit was conducted. 1.3 Rationale and focus The UN Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS (2011) reaffirmed that the full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is an essential element in the global response to HIV (see Annex III for a description of the human rights relevant to HIV recognized by international human rights law).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9ba3489-e2f4-45bd-b31f-5fc6b881c6f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9ba3489-e2f4-45bd-b31f-5fc6b881c6f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4db6c401b6b87dbe67122a54c69caf797242b023cab3d2c5396912dba25a4467"}, "2": {"node_id": "dfef20ed-53d5-4dc8-8e9d-46e57c4da27b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d33f21b77659090405554cacb5df93b17b62ff27c6056cf208c97b8e92bd6ac2"}}, "hash": "2f69563498222c0be7878b0f53b4a551caf10dfbd351a9349978ee13ce3cd326", "text": "The enactment of laws to protect the human rights of PLHIV and key populations at higher risk of HIV is essential to creating an enabling environment for effective HIV responses.2 The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia Pacific (ESCAP) Resolution 66-10 (2010) calls on member states to ground universal access to HIV services in human rights and to address legal barriers to HIV responses, and ESCAP Resolution 67-9 (2011) commits states to initiate reviews of national laws, policies and practices to enable the full achievement of universal access targets with a view to eliminating all forms of discrimination against PLHIV and key affected populations.

Ensuring protective legislation is in place is insufficient \u2013 attention must also be paid to how the law is implemented and enforced. In his 2012 Report on HIV/AIDS to the UN General Assembly, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon observed: The world must move from rhetoric to reality in the commitment to a rights-based approach to HIV. All countries should undertake an immediate, comprehensive review of national legal and policy frameworks to remove obstacles to effective and rights-based AIDS responses. Meaningful laws prohibiting HIV-based discrimination should be in place in all settings and should receive implementation support and include concrete mechanisms and services to increase access to justice for all people affected by the epidemic.3 The Report of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2012) also emphasized the need to strengthen implementation and enforcement of protective laws: Often, legislation commits a nation to guaranteeing internationally affirmed human rights of equality, liberty and health.

National legislation may prohibit discrimination, but the law is often ignored, laxly enforced or aggressively flouted\u2026 To make law real on the ground, the state must educate health care workers, legal professionals, employers and trade unionists, and school faculties about their legal responsibilities to guarantee inclusion and equality. People living with or affected by HIV must be informed of their rights. The legal ideal of non-discrimination must be defended by enforcement: prompt and affordable access to redress in cases of violations, including affordable, accessible legal services and confidentiality of proceedings.4 This study identifies the laws that states of Asia and the Pacific have put in place to provide legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations and the lessons learned from implementation and enforcement. These laws include omnibus national HIV laws, protections enshrined in national constitutions, and rights under general laws such as laws relating to employment, disability and health. Some countries in this region have had laws in place addressing HIV-related human rights violations for over a decade. Yet little research has been conducted to assess the impact of these laws on individuals, institutions and society more broadly. This study examines how these laws have been operationalized, enforced and applied, the obstacles that PLHIV and key populations face in claiming their rights under the law, and the experience of countries in implementing legal empowerment and access to justice approaches. This study sought to explore the factors that might be limiting the impact of national HIV laws and other protective laws. Ongoing reports of discrimination against PLHIV and key populations across the region suggest that stronger legal, educational and community empowerment responses to discrimination are required. The People Living with HIV Stigma Index, Asia Pacific Regional Analysis5 found that HIV-related stigma and discrimination are evidenced across all areas of life, including in the key areas of employment and health care, in nine countries in Asia and the Paci\ufb01c.6 However, most people who experienced rights abuses did not attempt to seek redress through legal mechanisms. Of the people who did attempt legal redress, most had not been successful within 12 months.

Legislation: priority issues that protective laws should address; ii. Access to justice: the importance of legal aid, community legal education and legal empowerment; and iii. Capacity development: strengthening the capacity of law and justice institutions (including parliamentarians, the judiciary, police and national human rights institutions) and other sectors to respond to HIV-related human rights issues. The study does not focus on the impact of criminalization of key populations, although it is important to acknowledge that punitive criminal laws and police practices contribute to reluctance to seek legal redress under protective laws and obstruct the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms of sex workers, people who inject drugs, transgender people and men who have sex with men (MSM). The harmful impacts of criminalization of key populations have been described in previous studies.8 2. Findings and recommendations 2.1 National HIV laws Omnibus national HIV laws Omnibus national HIV laws are laws that seek to comprehensively address all the legal aspects of HIV in one piece of legislation. In Asia, the first national HIV laws were introduced in the mid-1990s. Mongolia enacted its first Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention in 1993 and Viet Nam issued an Ordinance9 on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in 1995. Comprehensive omnibus national HIV laws were enacted in the Philippines in 1998 and Cambodia in 2002. By 2012, eight countries10 of the Asia Pacific region had enacted omnibus national HIV laws: Cambodia, China, Fiji, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea 8 The impact of criminalization on human rights has been described in other UNDP regional studies: Godwin J. (2012), Sex work and the Law in Asia and the Pacific, Bangkok: UNDP; Godwin J. (2010), Legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific: An agenda for action, Bangkok: UNDP; Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2011), Report of the Asia Pacific Regional Dialogue, Bangkok: UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Office. 9 This report includes ordinances within the broad definition of enforceable laws. In Viet Nam, the hierarchy of laws includes \u2018Laws\u2019 issued by the National Assembly and \u2018Ordinances\u2019 issued by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. 10 The jurisdiction of Taiwan (Province of China) also has a comprehensive HIV law: HIV Infection Control and Patient Rights Protection Act (2007) (originally the AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1990). Pohnpei, a state of the Federated States of Micronesia, has also enacted a comprehensive HIV law: Pohnpei HIV Prevention and Care Act of 2007. 17 Part I - IntroductIon, fIndIngs and recommendatIons (PNG), Philippines and Viet Nam. A further three countries (India,11 Nepal12 and Pakistan13) have prepared draft omnibus national HIV bills for consideration by their parliaments. Together, these diverse countries have accumulated substantial experience in drafting legislation for HIV-related human rights protections. These omnibus HIV laws typically address a wide range of issues, including: \u2022\ufffd public health requirements (such as regulation of HIV testing and safety of the blood supply); \u2022\ufffd civil and political human rights and fundamental freedoms (such as rights to non- discrimination, equality, liberty, security of the person and privacy); \u2022\ufffd social and economic human rights (such as the right to health and the right to information and education); \u2022\ufffd roles and responsibilities of national agencies in the HIV response.

For example, Fiji\u2019s HIV/AIDS Decree is prefaced by a statement that, when interpreting or applying the Decree or exercising powers, duties or functions all persons and courts should, as far as possible, apply the principles of international human rights laws as defined by relevant treaties and the standards identified by the United Nations International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights and the United Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (for the full text of Fiji\u2019s Guiding Principles, see Annex V).14 Another example is provided by the national HIV law of Lao PDR, which states the principle that HIV control and prevention should be carried out \u201censuring that equality, justice, compassion, and non-discrimination and non-stigmatization principles are respected\u201d, and \u201censuring the principles of confidentiality and privacy for people living with HIV/AIDS\u201d.15 The Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act is also prefaced with a statement of principle, as follows: AIDS is a disease that recognizes no territorial, social, political and economic boundaries for which there is no known cure. The gravity of the AIDS threat demands strong State action... discrimination, in all its forms and subtleties, against individuals with HIV or persons perceived or suspected of having HIV shall be considered inimical to individual and national interest.16 The statement of principles in Viet Nam\u2019s national HIV law refers to principles of multi- sectoral collaboration, social mobilization, integration of HIV prevention and control activities into socio-economic development programmes, harm reduction intervention measures in the prevention of HIV transmission, elimination of stigma and discrimination and facilitation of HIV-infected people and their family members to participate in prevention and control.17 The Pohnpei HIV Prevention and Care Act (Federated States of Micronesia) commences with the statement that \u201cdiscrimination, in all its forms and subtleties, against individuals with HIV, or persons perceived or believed as having HIV shall be considered inimical to individual and state interest\u201d. 14 Section 3, HIV/AIDS Decree 2011 (Fiji). 15 Article 6, Law on HIV/AIDS Control and Prevention 2010 (Lao PDR). 16 Section 2, Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1998. 17 Article 3, Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 2006 (Viet Nam). 19 Part I - IntroductIon, fIndIngs and recommendatIons Punitive provisions undermine a human rights-based approach Enactment of an omnibus national HIV law provides an opportunity to proclaim overarching principles and a commitment to a human rights-based approach, but it also carries risks.

Mandatory HIV testing and forced disclosure violate human rights to privacy, freedom and security of the person. These measures also contribute to stigma and discourage people from accessing HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services. Provisions of national HIV laws identified in this study that contradict the principles of a human rights-based approach include laws that allow compulsory testing of military personnel (Viet Nam and Fiji)19, and laws that require the consent of a parent or guardian for HIV tests conducted on adolescents under 18 years old (e.g., Cambodia).20 China\u2019s AIDS Regulations have been criticized because they do not override other punitive laws, such as mandatory testing laws for certain industries (see 4.5.2). Laws that impose criminal penalties for HIV non-disclosure, exposure or transmission are stigmatizing and may conflict with human rights principles. The national HIV laws of Cambodia, China and Lao PDR criminalize intentional transmission of HIV, and PNG\u2019s national HIV law criminalizes non-disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners.21 The 18 UNAIDS (2008), Guidance Note: Addressing HIV-related Law at National Level, Geneva: UNAIDS. 19 Article 20 of Decree No. 108/2007/Nd-Cp of June 26, 2007, Detailing the Implementation of a Number of Articles of the Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention And Control (Viet Nam); and Sections 22(2) and 29 of the HIV/ AIDS Decree 2011 (Fiji). 20 Law on the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS 2002, Article19 & National AIDS Authority (2005) Implementing Guidelines of the Law on the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS. 21 Cambodia: Law on the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS 2002, Articles 18 & 50; China: AIDS Regulations 20 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations Global Commission on HIV and the Law has recommended that countries not enact laws that explicitly criminalize HIV transmission, exposure or failure to disclose HIV status, because invoking criminal laws in cases of adult private consensual sexual activity is disproportionate and counter-productive to enhancing public health. In most instances it is more effective to address sexual behavior through voluntary education, counseling and health promotion, rather than legal penalties. Where exceptional cases of deliberate HIV transmission arise, these should be dealt with under general laws such as aggravated assault offences in penal codes. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the Global Commission on HIV and the Law recommended that states prosecute HIV transmission that is both actual and intentional, using general criminal law, rather than HIV-specific laws.22 Fiji\u2019s HIV/AIDS Amendment Decree 2011 provides an example of good practice. The HIV/ AIDS Amendment Decree 2011 was passed to remove HIV-specific criminal offences for HIV transmission or exposure from the original HIV/AIDS Decree 2011. The Government of Fiji decided that, as prosecutions could occur under general criminal laws, there was no need to provide an HIV-specific offence. Participatory approaches to developing legislation Participation of PLHIV and key populations in the development of legislation produces laws that are responsive to needs, protective of human rights and supported by communities. Participation also helps to build community knowledge about and confidence in the law, laying foundations for building the capacity of communities to claim their rights. Enactment of a national HIV law can provide an opportunity to bring stakeholders together (e.g., legislators, PLHIV organizations and other civil society stakeholders) to reach agreement on priorities. Examples of participatory processes include: \u2022\ufffd Fiji\u2019s HIV/AIDS Decree was drafted after a lengthy consultation period engaging the Ministry of Health, UN agencies, and civil society groups. \u2022\ufffd The Law on HIV/AIDS Control and Prevention of Lao PDR was enacted after a consultation process engaging civil society, including PLHIV, through the Lao Network of PLHIV (LNP+), supported by UN partners. \u2022\ufffd In 2011, the Philippine Legislators\u2019 Committee on Population and Development conducted community consultations on a new national HIV law, which engaged UN agencies and civil society including PLHIV and key populations through Pinoy Plus Association, Inc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "724ad150-a2df-46fa-970a-f69fd1215f9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "724ad150-a2df-46fa-970a-f69fd1215f9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2231ab90c68877c5d79abe2a5a7be2a4655e9f18f4787952be70db655408d6da"}, "2": {"node_id": "190d43f4-c649-4073-a999-f62f4b9485c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8d77a3602a8cf0bba0c92e86f44d05684a3f528eb167498dca6c6c7a1122d03"}}, "hash": "8b06fbda32ffc5f29b6cace0839ed3760516a2707d666168a1ab1f21be1f93e9", "text": "(PPA+, a national network of people living with HIV), Action for Health Initiatives, Inc.

The Bill stalled after disagreements involving the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Home Affairs and the National AIDS Control Organisation, which indicates the need to ensure all ministries are supportive of reform proposals at an early stage. It is important that national HIV laws are periodically reviewed and updated, based on community inputs. Reviews can identify new developments that require a legislative response. For example, reform Bills tabled in 2011-2012 in the Philippines proposed measures to respond to a rapid escalation of the epidemic among MSM and people who inject drugs. Reviews can also recommend the removal of existing provisions that contradict human rights principles or are harmful to public health e.g., a review of the national HIV law conducted in Mongolia in 2012 led to the removal of HIV-related travel and employment restrictions, and strengthening of the human rights protections of the existing national HIV law.24 Lessons from Africa There may be lessons to be learned from the experience of countries in Africa. Concerns were raised by human rights non-government organizations (NGOs) after many national HIV laws were enacted in the period 2005-2010 in African countries that contained provisions that conflict with a human rights-based approach. A study of HIV legislation in Africa made the following findings:25 \u2022\ufffd 19 countries in Africa had adopted HIV-specific legislation; \u2022\ufffd Several HIV-specific laws fail to integrate human rights principles; \u2022\ufffd Most HIV-specific laws in Africa do not integrate accurate information and proven strategies about HIV; \u2022\ufffd Most HIV-specific laws in Africa fail to address protection and access to services for vulnerable groups. Africa has seen the proliferation of national HIV laws that address some types of HIV- related discrimination, but also include punitive measures such as mandatory HIV-testing for members of key populations (e.g., sex workers), pregnant women or those wishing to 23 The 2007 Bill was the basis for the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill 2012 (India). 24 UNAIDS (2013), UNAIDS applauds Mongolia for removing restrictions on entry, stay and residence for people living with HIV, Press statement, 31 January 2013, Geneva: UNAIDS. 25 Eba P.

A body of law has been built up over the last 15 years in India that demonstrates how constitutional rights may be used to protect individual\u2019s rights in such areas as non-discrimination, access to health care and privacy (see South Asia Chapter 9.1). Litigation based on constitutional rights in India has resulted in the establishment of important legal principles, including the right of PLHIV to non-discrimination in employment, the right of PLHIV to antiretroviral therapy, the right of prisoners to health care, decriminalization of homosexuality, and recognition of sex workers\u2019 human rights (in a context in which most aspects of the sex industry remain criminalized).

ZY,31 the Bombay High Court held that a public sector employer cannot deny a person employment solely because the person is HIV-positive, and that the determination of whether a person is capable of performing their job must be made by conducting an individual enquiry taking into account the state of medical knowledge. The denial of employment on the ground of HIV status was found to infringe rights under the Constitution of India to equal treatment before the law and the right to life and personal liberty. The court suppressed the identity of the employee. The availability of a formal process for public interest litigation has also been beneficial in India. The rules relating to public interest litigation in India allow NGOs and other organizations to commence legal action on matters of public interest. This means that a case can be brought to court without exposing an individual to the costs and stresses associated with complex, lengthy litigation. Apart from India, this review did not identify examples of the successful use of constitutional rights to protect the human rights of PLHIV through concluded court proceedings. There are several examples of the successful use of human rights guaranteed by national constitutions in the context of human rights violations affecting key populations. The status of women and of key populations such as sex workers, transgender people and MSM have been improved as a result of litigation based on constitutionally guaranteed human rights. For example: \u2022\ufffd Laws criminalizing sex between adult men have been held to be invalid due to violation of constitutionally guaranteed human rights to privacy and equality. Judgments in Fiji,32 Hong Kong SAR,33 the Philippines,34 Nepal35 and India36 have interpreted constitutional rights to equality before the law, non-discrimination and/or to privacy to apply to the protection of the rights of homosexual people in a variety of circumstances.

The Supreme Court held that sex workers enjoy constitutional protection of their human rights to respect, dignity, privacy, life and liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. Eviction had deprived the sex workers of their livelihood, which amounted to deprivation of their right to life.42 With the exception of the Naz Foundation case, HIV was not a significant issue in these court cases involving key populations. Nonetheless, these cases contribute to creating an enabling legal environment for HIV responses by reducing stigma and discrimination affecting key populations at risk of HIV. 37 In response to a petition filed by Islamic jurist Dr Mohammad Aslam Khaki, the Supreme Court made a series of rulings in 2009.

Many countries have NHRIs that have a general mandate to accept complaints of human rights violations. NHRIs or other specialized agencies may also be able to investigate alleged HIV-related rights violations on their own initiative.43 In some cases the mandate of these agencies to receive HIV complaints is created through provisions of the national HIV law (e.g., the PNG HIV law empowers the Ombudsman Commission to receive complaints). In other cases, HIV complaints are accepted under the general human rights mandates of NHRIs as defined by national constitutions or human rights legislation. An Asia Pacific regional workshop on HIV for NHRIs held in 2010 issued a statement recommending that NHRIs: \u2022\ufffd Inquire, investigate and provide prompt and appropriate remedies for complaints related to HIV received from PLHIV, third parties, and own motions, and refer cases to relevant authorities when necessary. \u2022\ufffd Monitor national laws, policies, practices and programmes and ensure their compliance with international human rights standards and advocate for the rights of people living with and affected by HIV.44 2.2.2 Application of disability discrimination laws to HIV and AIDS Legislative protections against discrimination on the basis of disability may also provide an avenue for seeking redress for PLHIV. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) contains a \u2018social model\u2019 of disability, which is broad enough to encompass HIV. The CRPD does not explicitly include HIV or AIDS within its open-ended definition of \u2018disability\u2019, but countries may do so in their domestic laws. This social model of disability recognizes that factors such as stigma can be disabling, as well as physical factors. Few countries in the Asia Pacific region have strong disability discrimination laws. This may change as governments ratify the CRPD, which entered into force in 2008.45 Ratifying states must amend national laws to protect persons with disabilities from discrimination. 43 E.g., Human Rights Commissions in the Philippines and India, the Ombudsman Commission in PNG and the Hong Kong Equal Opportunity Commission. 44 Regional HIV/AIDS and Human Rights Workshop for national human rights institutions (NHRIs), 10-12 March 2010, Bangkok. 45 Asia Pacific states that had ratified or acceded to CRPD by 2010 included: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Cook Islands, India, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Vanuatu. 26 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations There are examples of PLHIV using disability discrimination laws to enforce their rights in Hong Kong SAR (see below) and Australia.46 In Australia, HIV-related discrimination is covered by the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, which includes \u201cthe presence in the body of organisms capable of causing disease\u201d within the definition of disability. This phrase is also used in the definition of disability in New Zealand\u2019s Human Rights Act 1993. A study of European legislative protections found that 16 European countries include HIV within their disability discrimination laws.47 In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 does not mention HIV or AIDS directly. However the US Supreme Court has confirmed that HIV and AIDS are \u2018disabilities\u2019 under the Act.48 Inclusion of HIV within disability laws is sometimes opposed by PLHIV because of the stigma of being labeled as \u2018disabled\u2019, particularly given the importance of challenging false assumptions regarding the capacity of PLHIV to work, attend schools, and live full and active lives. Some disability groups may also be concerned about inclusion of HIV within disability laws, given that these issues are traditionally dealt with in separate policies and programmes.49 However, given the adoption of the broad \u2018social model\u2019 of disability by CRPD, countries should consider whether inclusion of HIV within national disability discrimination laws could offer an additional legal avenue to protect the rights of PLHIV.

Complaints may be made to the National Commission for the Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities or to a court. Persons with disabilities or caregivers may request an organization to represent them.52 \u2022\ufffd Malaysia\u2019s Persons with Disabilities Act 2008 sets out rights to be enjoyed by persons with disabilities in access to public facilities, public transport, education, employment, information and communication. However, the Act does not explicitly confer a right to take court action for violations and does not establish a complaints procedure. \u2022\ufffd The Magna Carta for Persons with Disability53 of the Philippines adopts a definition of disability focusing on a person\u2019s physical or mental impairment, so HIV is not likely to be considered a disability unless the person has AIDS or is in the symptomatic phase of HIV disease. The Magna Carta for Persons with Disability provides remedies for persons with a disability who experience discrimination, public ridicule or vilification. \u2022\ufffd Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act 1995 of India provides that certain government bodies cannot dispense with, or reduce in rank, an employee who acquires a disability during his service or deny a promotion to a person on the ground of their disability. \u2022\ufffd The Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act54 of Sri Lanka protects the rights of persons with disability relating to employment, education and access to buildings open to the public. A person with a disability or the National Council for Persons with Disabilities may seek a remedy from the High Court. 2.2.3 Other general laws Few examples have been found of the use of non-HIV specific laws (apart from constitutional rights) to enforce HIV-related human rights in the Asia Pacific region. This may be because many countries do not have national human rights laws or strong human rights provisions in employment laws, health laws, or other general laws. An exception is India, where several successful cases have been litigated in industrial courts and labour courts. An example of application of rights under the general law is the case of Xiaoli (Alias) v. The China Times.55 In this case, a Beijing court recognized a violation of the rights of a child with HIV. The court ordered that a public apology and compensation be provided to a child by a newspaper that disclosed the child\u2019s HIV-positive status in violation of the child\u2019s rights to privacy and reputation under the general law. 52 See Namsiripongpun W.

Laws can enable individuals who experience rights violations to seek redress through the courts, administrative complaints or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms. Redress may be provided through court orders or negotiated agreements/settlements that provide for compensation, reinstatement, a public apology or other remedies intended to provide justice to the individual who has been wronged. Successful court outcomes for individuals can also set useful precedents that clarify legal obligations. This can help other people with similar cases to resolve complaints through negotiation. Successful court outcomes can 56 Lawyers Collective HIV/AIDS Unit, Mumbai.

Laws can enable public interest litigation on behalf of a class of individuals to achieve fundamental or systemic changes through the courts, such as a declaration that a discriminatory law is invalid or an order that a discriminatory policy or practice must be changed across an entire sector or industry. For example, in India, the law criminalizing unnatural sex was \u2018read down\u2019 by the courts so as to effectively decriminalize homosexuality as a result of public interest litigation taken by an HIV non-government organization concerned that the law impeded HIV prevention efforts and hence violated rights to health and non-discrimination enshrined in the Constitution.61 iii. Laws can enable the state to prosecute individuals or organizations for human rights violations and impose criminal or administrative penalties for violations to punish the offender and deter others from offending (fines and/or imprisonment, or disciplinary proceedings against registered professionals). For example, the national HIV laws of the Philippines, Viet Nam and Fiji enable criminal or administrative penalties to be imposed for rights violations. iv. Laws can enable guidelines or implementing regulations to be promulgated that prevent human rights violations from occurring in specific sectors (e.g., by promoting compliance with guidelines and standards). For example: in Cambodia action to prevent discrimination in the workplace is required by implementing regulations; and in the Philippines the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Labor and Employment have issued guidelines requiring employers to put in place HIV policies addressing protection from discrimination. v. Laws can empower government agencies or national human rights institutions (NHRIs) to actively monitor and address systemic or institutionalized discrimination, e.g., by empowering NHRIs to monitor the human rights environment for PLHIV, to conduct inquiries into discriminatory policies and practices and to issue recommendations for amending discriminatory laws and policies and other actions required to protect human rights. vi.

Implementation can be supported by promotion of the law through community education, and education targeting specific sectors such as health care workers, uniformed services, the judiciary/magistracy and the legal profession. Parliamentarians can also play a role in supporting implementation. 2.3.2 Challenges in enforcing HIV-related rights through court action HIV-related stigma and discrimination are widespread across the region.63 However, with the exception of India, there are very few reported cases in which PLHIV have challenged discrimination or other rights violations in the courts. Most cases are resolved without resorting to court proceedings. Successful court cases under national HIV laws Notwithstanding the fact that omnibus HIV laws have been on the books for over a decade in some countries, the only examples in the studied countries of reported court judgments where the protective provisions of a national HIV law have been enforced are two cases in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Nine other cases under the national HIV law have been lodged in the PNG courts, but are yet to be concluded. Several other PNG cases have been settled out of court (see 14.2). In Viet Nam, legal services report a large number of cases arising of complaints under the national HIV law, but the vast majority of cases are resolved through mediation and negotiation, rather than formal court hearings.64 One employment discrimination case in China (based on employment law and the national AIDS Regulations) resulted in a successful settlement after a court-supervised mediation (see 4.4.3). Many other discrimination cases in China have been settled through negotiation and ADR processes (see 4.4.1). This is not to say that other successful resolved court cases exist, but if they have occurred, the results have not been disseminated amongst civil society so as to build a body of jurisprudence and increase confidence in the courts as an avenue for redress. Successful court cases under general laws PLHIV and HIV organizations in India have been successful in numerous court cases based on constitutional rights, employment law, patent law and other general laws (see 9.1.3). Court proceedings have also successfully been used protect the privacy of a child with HIV in China (see 4.3) and by HIV NGOs to challenge pharmaceutical patents for ARVs 63 GNP+, ICW, IPPF, UNAIDS (2011), People Living with HIV Stigma Index, Asia Pacific Regional Analysis 2011, Geneva: UNAIDS. 64 UNAIDS and UNDP (2012), Legal services for people living with HIV and key at-risk populations in Viet Nam: an assessment of the current situation and recommendations for the future, Hanoi: UNAIDS and UNDP, p.42. 31 Part I - IntroductIon, fIndIngs and recommendatIons in Thailand (see 9.4). Many HIV cases have been addressed at Village Court level in PNG under the general powers of Village Courts to address use of insulting words and to keep the peace, but the facts of these cases are not recorded (see 14.3.2). Similarly, in the Philippines some PLHIV have used the Barangay (Village) justice system to resolve complaints (see 7.6). It is likely that many court cases have not been captured by this review. Reasons why this review may not have been able to identify all HIV-related court cases in the countries considered include: \u2022\ufffd court actions may have been settled privately through negotiation prior to a court hearing or judgment; \u2022\ufffd courts may have decided HIV-related cases, but the decisions of the courts may have not been formally published, or reported in the press; \u2022\ufffd court reports may not be systematically analyzed or may not be available in English; \u2022\ufffd complainants may not have been willing to publicly share their experiences of seeking redress through the courts.

The low number of successful court 65 Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) describes processes of settling disputes by means other than litigation (taking a case to court). ADR includes conciliation, mediation and arbitration processes. A conciliation or mediation process provides parties in a dispute an opportunity to settle informally with the assistance of a trained third party. An arbitration process is a more formal method that includes a decision by the arbitrator. 32 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations cases taken under HIV laws indicates the importance of ensuring a stronger focus on implementation, including community legal education and improved access to justice. The PLHIV Stigma Index study found that there were good levels of knowledge of the existence of some national HIV laws e.g., 80 percent of a sample of PLHIV were aware of the national HIV law in Cambodia, 85 percent of a sample of PLHIV were aware of the national HIV law in the Philippines, and 31 percent of a sample of PLHIV were aware of the HIV Decree in Fiji.66 However, awareness of the existence of the law does not mean that PLHIV are knowledgeable about the nature of the legal protections provided under these laws and how to enforce their legal rights, or have trust and confidence in the legal system as a mechanism for redress. Some populations lack confidence that the legal system will deliver a meaningful remedy for human rights violations. In many countries, corruption is common, resulting in a general lack of confidence in the legal system. Lack of trust in the legal system may be a particular concern for criminalized populations such as sex workers, people who use drugs, and MSM. In some contexts, the judiciary and prosecutors are not perceived as independent from the executive branch of government. This may be problematic if a person is seeking to take legal action against a government agency for human rights violations or seeking to persuade authorities to initiate a prosecution of a government agency. Some PLHIV groups have reported a reluctance of the judiciary to accept, hear or enforce cases relating to HIV specifically, or relating to sensitive human rights issues more generally. A regional study on HIV-related discrimination conducted by Reidpath and Chan observed that in some Asian countries, anti-discrimination laws that originate in countries\u2019 efforts to meet international human rights obligations are not necessarily in keeping with local custom.67 They argue that in some contexts the legal system at a fundamental level may not be supportive of a human rights-based approach: (PLHIV) have not sought protection through the courts, and it is clear that the failure to test the laws is not because (PLHIV) are not subject to discrimination... Rather, the system is not structurally geared towards the protection of the rights offered to (PLHIV) under the law.68 The observations by Reidpath and Chan were made in 2005, and significant progress has been made since then in strengthening legal protections, although the general finding (that pre-existing norms and values may obstruct enforcement of human rights laws) remains a valid concern. 66 GNP+ et al (2011), op cit., p.47. 67 Reidpath D., Chan K.

The existence of rights protections in national HIV laws and general laws can lead to effective resolution of complaints and prevention of rights violations without recourse to the formal legal system.

Training for health care workers on legal obligations can reduce discrimination against PLHIV and key populations in their interaction with the health system. This has the potential of changing attitudes over time, improving quality of and uptake of health services leading to improved public health outcomes. Even if the law has not been tested in court, the existence of protective laws may have other benefits e.g., in changing attitudes and encouraging the adoption of non-discriminatory practices. Discriminatory policies and practices will be abolished if protective laws are promoted and compliance with legal requirements is actively monitored. Even unsuccessful court cases can be beneficial. Litigation can help to bring attention to gaps or weaknesses of the law that need to be addressed. Lawsuits that fail in court may be an important part of a broader strategy to build momentum for law reform. For example, the series of unsuccessful employment discrimination cases considered by Chinese courts in 2010-2011 highlighted the need for anti-discrimination laws to be strengthened. After attention was drawn to these cases in policy debates, the Premier of China, Wen Jiabao, called for strengthening of protective anti-discrimination laws in 2011.69 Another Chinese court case involving a challenge to an insurance company was unsuccessful, but ultimately the case resulted in a positive outcome when advocacy associated with the case led the Insurance Association of China to request the removal of discriminatory HIV exclusion clauses from insurance policies.70 Many examples of good practice in legal empowerment and access to justice are emerging. Examples of initiatives that have benefited PLHIV and key populations include: i. In Viet Nam, a comprehensive \u2018Learn About Your Rights\u2019 training manual\u2014developed by local and regional law NGOs and UNAIDS\u2014is being used to train law students and lawyers about HIV-related rights, and to promote legal literacy among PLHIV. 69 Wen Jiabao meets HIV/AIDS patients, urges less discrimination, Want China Times, 20 December 2011. 70 See: Insurance fix a win for HIV patients, China Human Rights Net, 15 July 2009. 34 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations ii. In China, Indonesia, Nepal, PNG and Viet Nam, needs assessments have been conducted to determine the nature and extent of unmet need for HIV-related legal aid services.71 iii. In China, studies have been conducted by UNDP and the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) to identify stakeholders in the legal response to HIV, and a national network of lawyers engaged in delivering HIV-related legal services is being established with UNDP support. iv. In the Philippines, the Aid4AIDS Network has been established comprising legal organizations and institutions, law schools, alternative law groups, and private lawyers who provide HIV-related legal advice and representation. v. In Mongolia, the first training for legal aid lawyers on HIV and the law was organized by the National Legal Institute of Mongolia in cooperation with UNDP in 2012. Lawyers at the meeting examined the national Law on HIV/AIDS to identify provisions that breach human rights. vi. The PNG Development Law Association has established an HIV legal service, which has initiated claims to test the legal protections of the national HIV law on behalf of PLHIV. vii. Legal services in China and Viet Nam have extended their reach by providing access to legal advice through telephone hotlines and by providing outreach to sites such as methadone clinics, self-help groups of PLHIV, and drop-in centres for sex workers. viii. Specialist HIV legal services in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia,72 Nepal73 and Viet Nam have been effective in reaching marginalized communities with relatively high HIV prevalence, such as sex workers, people who use drugs, MSM and transgender people. ix. In Fiji, the sex worker network Survival Advocacy Network (SAN) has mobilized sex workers to advocate for sex workers\u2019 human rights. SAN found that many sex workers had limited knowledge about their rights and mechanisms for redress for police abuses and other violations. In response, SAN has implemented a programme of legal rights training, access to legal services and working with police. Sex workers report that physical violence by the police has reduced. This is, in part, a direct outcome of sex workers having better knowledge of their legal rights and being able to negotiate with police, making them less vulnerable to unlawful arrest, exploitation and extortion.74 71 IDLO funded needs assessments in Yunnan (China), Indonesia, Nepal and PNG.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19274609-f8bb-45d8-af24-56612a405ff7": {"__data__": {"id_": "19274609-f8bb-45d8-af24-56612a405ff7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea4c023c3f2b7d258373076b7d8bfda819a96180581afe69210a3fd544f2bce1"}, "2": {"node_id": "9197cb03-a199-4a7b-82d6-891b2c1788bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f7da483a78717843a4a4f19814b995987d3caf0c1a73c75fc5811dca051e8e6"}}, "hash": "61232cfe718fbbeb9b530ca7a16d100838cdfd6fcfd1084205a1066e9e6e8420", "text": "72 The Community Legal Aid Institute (LBH Masyarakat) is an NGO that provides legal aid to people who use drugs in Indonesia.

Community-based legal empowerment initiatives have played an important role in protecting and advocating the human rights of sex workers, MSM and transgender people in several South Asian countries. Examples include Durjoy Nari Sangha (a sex worker organization in Bangladesh) and Blue Diamond Society (BDS) (a community- based organization of Nepal\u2019s Federation of Sexual and Gender Minorities). Durjoy Nari Sangha provides legal rights education and legal advice and referrals for sex workers.75 BDS provides legal advice and in 2012 was supporting around 50 court cases. People seeking legal redress for violent attacks made up the majority of cases. Civil cases usually concern property rights. Documenting human rights violations such as discrimination and violence informs advocacy strategies. BDS also supports public interest litigation and provides legal empowerment training to increase community knowledge of human rights and build skills about how to claim these rights.76 xi. In India, legal aid services for PLHIV have been delivered through a range of models including general non-governmental legal aid clinics, in-house lawyers at community organizations or service centres, legal outreach at healthcare sector clinics and hospitals, specialized government legal aid clinics and specialized NGO legal aid service providers. These various legal aid services are generally well connected with communities or community led. The Lawyers Collective HIV/ AIDS Unit (India) provides a model of a specialist HIV legal service that has the capacity to initiate high profile public interest litigation in relation to violations of constitutional rights, in addition to providing services on a daily basis to individual clients. The Naz Foundation case,77 which led to reading down of the sodomy law effectively decriminalizing homosexuality in India, demonstrates how lawyers are able to work with NGOs to mobilize resources and political support for high profile public interest litigation. On the other hand, MX v ZY was one example of a case that created precedent for PLHIV workplace equality based on servicing the needs of an individual client, MX.78 xii. Access to justice can be promoted by use of community-level or traditional justice systems to resolve HIV-related disputes, provided that efforts occur to ensure human rights principles are applied. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), Village Court magistrates have been trained on HIV, human rights and gender equality principles.79 Laws that recognize that PLHIV are eligible for government legal aid can also promote access to justice. In Viet Nam, the Decree on Legal Aid specifies that PLHIV are entitled to receive government legal aid, if the person does not have capacity to work and requires support.80 Pakistan\u2019s HIV/AIDS Bill proposes to legislate to guarantee access to legal aid by introducing the following provisions: 75 UNFPA, UNAIDS, Asia Pacific Network of Sex Workers (2012), op cit., pp.94-96. 76 Ibid, pp.107-113. 77 Naz Foundation India Trust v.

Rather, it aims to provide general regional recommendations on effective approaches to human rights protections. The recommendations apply to human rights protections found in national HIV laws, and to protections found in general laws. Each country needs to develop locally appropriate mechanisms for protection of HIV-related human rights. This may be achieved through including protective provisions in a national HIV law or in other laws such as labor protection laws, disability discrimination laws or health laws.

Discrimination by public and private sector bodies. 2.5 Protective legislation should prevail over other legislation. 38 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations 2.6 Protective laws should include provisions to make laws enforceable and accessible for PLHIV and key populations, including: a. provisions empowering individuals to claim redress (such as compensation or reinstatement) through the courts, ADR or other mechanisms; b. provisions establishing criminal and administrative offences and penalties, for violation of provisions relating to non-discrimination, non-consensual testing, breach of confidentiality and other human rights violations; c. provisions enabling PLHIV to lodge complaints to courts and/or national human rights institutions (NHRIs) or other bodies without risking public disclosure of their HIV status; and d. provisions for public interest litigation and for the making of court orders to address systemic issues, such as changing discriminatory policies. 3. Access to justice and legal empowerment 3.1 Governments, lawyers\u2019 associations and funders should give priority to access to justice and legal empowerment programmes for PLHIV and key populations. 3.2 Legal aid services should be provided for PLHIV and key populations for complaints relating to discrimination, violence protection and other human rights violations.

Commentary on recommendations 1. National frameworks a. National HIV strategies and plans should include specific targeted actions for: law reform; improved access to justice for PLHIV and key populations; and capacity development of parliamentarians, judiciary, police and other key institutions to implement and enforce protective laws. An example of inclusion of human rights in national plans is the Philippines 5th AIDS Medium Term Plan 2011- 2016, which includes support to mechanisms for stigma reduction and protection from discrimination, including human rights education for key populations, PLHIV, and \u201chuman rights protection in prevention and treatment, care and support service delivery points, and the fulfillment of human rights guarantees through operational redress mechanisms.\u201d b. Donors including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria should support government and civil society programming on HIV-related human rights. An example of donor support to improve access to justice is the Health and HIV Programme of the International Development Law Organization (IDLO). The programme provided support to HIV-related legal services in Papua New Guinea (PNG Development Law Association), Indonesia (LBH Masyarakat) and China (Yunnan University Legal Aid Centre), with support from the OPEC Fund for International Development.82 82 IDLO (2010), HIV and Health Law Program 2009 \u2013 2012, First Annual Report 2009-2010, Rome: IDLO. 40 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations c. Governments should support research to inform efforts to improve the legal environment for HIV responses, including monitoring and evaluation of the impact of HIV-related laws, and of capacity development, legal empowerment and access to justice interventions. Governments should support participatory evaluations of HIV-related human rights legislation in partnership with PLHIV organizations. Systematic collection and analysis of data in relation to the number and nature of human rights cases arising and resolved under protective laws is important to inform programmes and the reform of policies and laws. A national body should be assigned the responsibility to collect, analyze and report data on implementation of protections from human rights violations through court cases and other measures. This would enable governments and communities to track the nature and extent of human rights violations, and the impact of legal protections. Governments should invest in monitoring and evaluation of HIV-related legal empowerment and access to justice interventions. Evaluation should include assessment of the benefits that arise through different mechanisms for addressing rights violations, including the formal court system, ADR processes, informal negotiation and peer advocacy without recourse to the courts. Very little social research has been conducted on the impact of protective laws on stigma and the quality of life of PLHIV, or on social attitudes and practices. Governments should fund social and policy research that explores issues such as: \u2022\ufffd whether protective laws have had an impact on the enjoyment of human rights and prevalence of stigma in specific contexts such as provision of health care services; \u2022\ufffd whether laws are effective in providing remedies for institutionalized or systemic discrimination; \u2022\ufffd the effectiveness of court and ADR processes in determining HIV-related claims; and \u2022\ufffd the nature of obstacles faced by PLHIV communities and key populations in gaining access to the legal system to address human rights violations and law enforcement issues. 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2baf25b4-6de2-4b27-bd7b-ffa57c349823": {"__data__": {"id_": "2baf25b4-6de2-4b27-bd7b-ffa57c349823", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8641d1ce64448eae6a1110859e9e343d54beef8545eb54e76f57a4e5b6f3c66e"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d05b359-f70f-4c94-bfa7-c4297489d357", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7092d774e3e7094684a946cec4716fb52a0536c9f0b7f64048dcb7ba6fbb0505"}}, "hash": "6a0a9af0216a3128bf1cdeffb4fca0f845c085def1d56427fc06b983a27dd5af", "text": "2.

In the past comprehensive reviews have been conducted in Cambodia,84 Nepal85 and Australia,86 and a number of countries are conducting reviews in response to the ESCAP Resolution. Legislative reviews should provide an analysis of the compliance of laws and law enforcement practices with the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights. Legislative reviews can inform whether it may be more effective in the country context to address HIV through a national HIV law, or through other legislative mechanisms such as incorporation of HIV into labour laws or general human rights laws. Legislative reviews also provide an opportunity to ensure criminal laws and law enforcement practices relating to sex work, injecting drug use, homosexuality and transgender status are consistent with the human rights protections offered by national HIV laws and other protective laws. UNAIDS recommends that legislative reviews should: \u2022\ufffd be participatory, involving government, the UN, and civil society and (where they exist) the NHRI; \u2022\ufffd engage key parliamentarians, the judiciary and relevant ministries; \u2022\ufffd be informed by feedback on enforcement of law from affected women, youth and key populations at risk; and \u2022\ufffd include discussion with civil society of strategies for improving access to the law.87 Governments should ensure comprehensive protective legislation is in place that addresses the following rights: a. Right to equality and protection from discrimination. Laws may include a broad prohibition on all forms of HIV-related discrimination or may specify a list of areas of unlawful discrimination (preferably a non-exhaustive list). Laws that prohibit discrimination on other grounds, such as discrimination on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status and disability, also help to address vulnerabilities to HIV created by inequality and social exclusion. Specific issues relating to drafting of anti-discrimination provisions are discussed under recommendation 2.2. equitable delivery of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programmes to people living with and affected by HIV.\u201d 84 Watchirs H., Ward C.

Right to protection from HIV-related vilification, stigmatization and insult. Some jurisdictions address stigmatization or vilification as separate from discrimination. In PNG and Fiji, stigmatization is defined to include inciting hatred, ridicule or contempt.88 In Viet Nam, stigmatization is defined as an attitude of contempt or disrespect towards another person because of the awareness or suspicion that such person is infected with HIV or has close relationship with an HIV-infected or suspected HIV-infected person.89 In Mongolia, insult of PLHIV is prohibited.90 c. Right to protection from violence. It is particularly important that legal protections exist to protect women and girls, and to protect MSM and transgender persons who may be targeted because they do not conform with gender or sexuality norms. Sex workers and people who inject drugs also have specific violence protection needs that are often overlooked because of their criminalized status.

Some countries have included reference to people \u2018affected by HIV\u2019 without specifying key populations. Hong Kong SAR provides legal protections against discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, and China provides legal protections against discrimination for former drug users who are receiving treatment. It is good practice to address both direct and indirect discrimination (e.g., Fiji\u2019s HIV/AIDS Decree 2011, India\u2019s HIV/AIDS Bill 2007). Indirect discrimination is less obvious than direct discrimination. An example of indirect discrimination is where all people are subject to the same policy, but the policy has an unfair impact on a subgroup. A policy that requires all employees to comply with strict working hours may seem to not discriminate because it applies to everyone in a workplace. However, it may in effect be discriminatory if it has an unfair impact on PLHIV who need flexible working hours to be able to attend medical appointments. Some countries have issued detailed regulations or guidelines to clarify responsibilities and support implementation of non-discrimination requirements. In Cambodia, the National AIDS Authority published Implementing Guidelines to provide specific detail of the responsibilities of people and institutions to implement the national HIV law. In Viet Nam, prohibitions of discrimination in the national HIV law have been strengthened by a Decree on Handling Administrative Violations,109 which supplements the national HIV law by setting specific administrative penalties for various forms of discrimination against PLHIV (restricting access to health services, employment and education). In contrast, the prohibition on discrimination of China\u2019s AIDS Regulations (2006) has been criticized for being a poorly defined normative statement that lacks specificity and is difficult to enforce through the courts. Implementing regulations should provide for detailed standards to be enforced to ensure non-discrimination in specific sectors such as health care services, insurance and prisons. For example: \u2022\ufffd The Hong Kong Equal Opportunity Commission has the power to develop Codes of Practice, which are intended to provide detailed guidance on the implications of the discrimination statutes.110 \u2022\ufffd In the Philippines, implementation of workplace provisions of the national HIV law has been supported by government guidelines that require private sector workplaces to have HIV workplace policies in place that address discrimination, and government agencies are required to submit an annual report to the Philippine National AIDS Council on the status of implementation of their workplace HIV policies and education programmes.111 109 Decree No. 69/2011/ND-CP of 08/08/2011. 110 E.g, see: HK EOC (2011) Code of Practice on Employment under the Disability Discrimination Ordinance. 111 Guidelines for the implementation of HIV and AIDS Prevention and Control in the Workplace Program, Department of Labor and Employment, 2010; Civil Service Commission Guidelines in the Implementation of Workplace Policy and Education Program on HIV and AIDS, 2010. 47 Part I - IntroductIon, fIndIngs and recommendatIons \u2022\ufffd In Australia, complaints regarding the provision of insurance services made up a high proportion of the HIV complaints received by that country\u2019s Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the 1990s.

Complaint mechanisms Complaint mechanisms, judicial and ADR processes should be affordable, speedy and confidential. As an alternative to courts, complainants should have the option of having their complaints addressed through NHRIs or other bodies with authority to conduct mediation or conciliation. Some legislative models provide for initial consideration of discrimination complaints by an administrative agency (such as an equal opportunities commission, disability rights commission, human rights commission or ombudsman), which may seek to conciliate or mediate the complaint. For example, in the Philippines, workplace HIV discrimination must be reported to the Department of Labor and Employment or the Civil Service Commission, which are required to resolve cases and can apply administrative 112 The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (2001), HIV/AIDS and Human Rights: The Role of National Human Rights Institutions in the Asia Pacific, Bangkok: UNAIDS, p.16. 113 HIV/AIDS Decree 2011 (Fiji), Section 4(1). See also: HIV/AIDS Management and Prevention Act 2003 (PNG), Section 3. 48 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations sanctions.114 Consideration of the complaint by the administrative agency may be required before the matter can be taken to court, or may be offered as a parallel option to court proceedings. Decisions of NHRIs in most countries are not legally binding, but are affordable to citizens. NHRIs should promote their complaint-handling mandate to PLHIV communities, and involve NGOs and community-based organizations in the investigation of complaints. Community-level dispute resolution bodies may be appropriate to resolve some HIV- related complaints. For example, HIV-related disputes have been considered by Village Courts in PNG and the Katarungang Pambarangay (district or village-level dispute resolution body) in the Philippines. If ADR is not appropriate as a way of resolving a complaint (for example, if there are concerns that power imbalances between the parties may be exacerbated to the detriment of a PLHIV, or a complainant is seeking a public hearing), complainants should be able to access a court that can make binding, enforceable orders to remedy human rights violations. Another model involves establishment of a body with specific expertise in HIV-related issues. India\u2019s HIV/AIDS Bill 2007 proposed establishment of a \u2018Health Ombud\u2019 to be appointed at district level, with a mandate to address complaints of violations of the national HIV law. Kenya\u2019s HIV/ AIDS Prevention and Control Act 2006 has established a specialist HIV Equity Tribunal, which was set up to hear complaints of HIV-related human rights violations while also providing for simplified procedures, such as witnesses and speedy procedures. However, it may be difficult to find political support for HIV-specific models in settings with relatively low-level or concentrated epidemics. Civil, criminal and administrative remedies The national HIV Law of Lao PDR is an example of good practice in relation to remedies, as it provides that a finding of unlawful conduct may result in a range of outcomes including civil compensation, warnings, education, disciplinary proceedings or criminal penalties.115 PNG\u2019s national HIV law and Pakistan\u2019s HIV/AIDS Bill also represent good practice by specifying a wide range of orders that courts may make to remedy unlawful discrimination.116 Redress for violations should be available under civil, criminal and administrative laws. Criminal prosecutions should be reserved for the most serious violations of human rights. It is good practice to provide an option to make a civil or administrative claim for rights violations, especially as a lower standard of proof is generally required in non-criminal matters (which means that it is easier for a complainant to prove their case). Enforcing the criminal law against an offender who violates rights may be of limited benefit to the person who experienced the violation.

Whereas defining discrimination as a criminal offence may be beneficial in deterring people from committing acts of discrimination, it also may deter some PLHIV who have experienced discrimination from lodging a complaint if they fear that the case will be difficult to prove, that they will not receive compensation, or they fear or distrust the police or prosecutors\u2019 office. Remedies for discrimination, breach of privacy rights and other human rights violations should be available under administrative and/or civil court processes. Legislation should enable courts or tribunals to make orders to remedy discrimination, e.g., an order for compensation, an order that a person be reinstated, that policies or practices be changed or that a public apology be given. A reverse burden of proof should apply in discrimination cases where action is taken under civil or administrative law.117 Where a reverse burden of proof applies, the burden is on the defendant to show they did not contravene the law.118 Once the person claiming discrimination has produced prima facie evidence of possible discrimination, the burden should shift to the alleged discriminator to produce evidence that the person was not the victim of discrimination. To make it easier for people to obtain a legal remedy for unlawful discrimination, laws in some European and Latin America countries provide a reverse burden of proof in non-criminal discrimination cases. \u2018Onus\u2019 or \u2018burden\u2019 of proof is an important legal concept, particularly in adversarial legal systems (such as the common law countries of Asia and the Pacific). A reverse burden of proof makes it easier for people to take legal action because it means that the complainant does not have to prove their case. c. provisions enabling PLHIV to lodge complaints to courts and/or national human rights institutions (NHRIs) or other bodies without risking public disclosure of their HIV status; A factor that deters PLHIV from taking legal action is concern about disclosure of identity. To address this, some national HIV laws have specific provisions to ensure confidential court proceedings. Provisions can require courts to suppress the identity of PLHIV and to enable individuals to sue under a pseudonym or nominate someone to file a case on their behalf. Some Chinese courts have issued orders to protect the confidentiality of PLHIV who have lodged cases in the courts, at the request of their attorneys. Indian courts also allow the identity of PLHIV to be suppressed in the reporting of cases. PNG\u2019s national HIV law empowers a court to exclude all or any persons from the room where the proceedings are being conducted, to order that only persons specified by 117 See: Roberts C. (2012), Far From a Harmonious Society: Employment Discrimination in China, Santa Clara Law Review 52(4) 1531, p.1555 118 See e.g., Equality Act 2010 (United Kingdom); European Commission Directives: Sex discrimination: Directive 1997/80/EC; Discrimination relating to equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin: Directive 2000/43/EC; Discrimination relating to equal treatment in employment and occupation: Directive 2000/78/EC. 50 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations the court may be present during the proceedings, or to order that the publication of a report of the proceedings be prohibited. The court has discretion to make such orders where it consider that because of the social, psychological or economic consequences to the person to whom the information relates, the information should not be publicly disclosed.119 d. provisions for public interest litigation and for the making of court orders to address systemic issues, such as changing discriminatory policies. A complaint-based mechanism is important for redressing individual wrongs, but it may not be effective in bringing about systemic change. The system for providing remedies should not be confined to an individual complaint-based system of redress. It should also allow for public interest litigation and class action-type challenges so that cases can be taken on behalf of groups whose rights are harmed by particular policies or practices. Where systemic discrimination is causing human rights violations, NGOs or other institutions should be able to able to lodge complaints in the public interest \u2013 it should not be necessary for the victim of a violation to personally approach a court. Protective laws should provide for a monitoring/enforcement body with the ability to initiate public inquiries into rights violations on its own initiative. Courts or other appropriate agencies should be given broad remedial powers to address not just individual cases, but also systemic violations. This might take the form of broad investigatory power or the power to conduct public inquiries.

Legal aid should be available from lawyers who are independent from government, so that people can be confident in the advice provided if they are seeking to challenge discriminatory government practices. Ways of providing legal aid may include government payments to subsidize the fees of private lawyers, the provision of lawyers in offices of NGOs or community based organizations (such as human rights NGOs or PLHIV organizations), the provision of pro bono legal services provided at no charge by the private legal profession, or providing access to government legal aid offices where appropriate.121 Consideration may also be required to waive any court fees for lodging claims or filing appeals in human rights cases. Legal aid services should include provision of community-level paralegals who can provide legal information, advice and referrals through outreach to clinics, drop-in centres and other community sites.122 Country reports submitted to UNAIDS in 2012 indicate that most countries in Asia and the Pacific report having some form of legal services available for responding to HIV-related human rights violations.123 However, the scale and quality of most of these programmes is not known, and responses to the PLHIV Stigma Index in the region suggest that there remain unmet needs in terms of HIV-related legal services. 3.3 Support should be provided to \u2018know your rights\u2019 campaigns and community legal education. 3.2 Support should be provided to peer-led advocacy initiatives, so that PLHIV and key populations can self-advocate their rights and negotiate resolution of complaints and protection of their rights in relation to health care services, police, and other bodies. 3.3 Support should be provided to community-based HIV organizations to provide human rights advocacy services including advising clients of their human and legal rights, referring clients to relevant grievance bodies, collecting data on human rights issues and conducting advocacy campaigns for law and policy reform. Legal literacy and human rights education programmes can be delivered by community- based organizations such as networks of PLHIV and other key populations, human rights NGOs and lawyers\u2019 associations.

An example of good practice is Cambodia\u2019s Parliamentary Handbook on HIV/AIDS. The Parliamentary Handbook encourages parliamentarians to play a leadership role in advocating implementation of Cambodia\u2019s HIV/AIDS Law through discussions with provincial leaders and communities.125 4.2 Governments should provide training for police and public security personnel on HIV and human rights to address police abuses and to ensure that police act to protect and promote the rights of PLHIV and key populations. An example of good practice is the Poro Sapot project in PNG, which delivers sensitization to police on HIV and human rights using MSM and sex workers as educators. In 2011, the project reached over 500 police in three provinces.126 In Thailand, a sex worker led organization (SWING) has delivered HIV training to 36 police cadets and works in partnership with tourist police to improve responses to violence directed at sex workers.127 4.3 Justice Ministries and professional associations should include HIV-related legal and human rights issues in training of judges, magistrates and prosecutors.

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and UNAIDS have published a Handbook on HIV and Human Rights for National Human Rights Institutions.131 The Handbook emphasizes the importance of ensuring that NHRIs are accessible to PLHIV communities: In addition to physical accessibility, services need to be provided in ways that empower people. If those whose rights have been violated find a national institution unapproachable, unfriendly or discriminatory, it will not be accessible to them. To facilitate the active involvement of people living with HIV, national institutions can meet representatives of networks of people living with HIV to learn about their experiences and concerns, and discuss what support would be useful in order to build their human rights capacity. National institutions should identify the key human rights-related issues for people living with HIV, and what actions and services by the national institution would be considered most useful and most urgent.132 The Handbook recommends: \u2022\ufffd New staff induction and internal training programmes should include a component on HIV and human rights. Local groups of PLHIV, and AIDS service organizations, can be good sources of information or possible trainers and educators. \u2022\ufffd Efforts should be made to hire, at managerial, professional and administrative levels, staff with the requisite skills who come from marginalized communities or who identify closely with the people they are working for. \u2022\ufffd NHRIs need to develop the necessary expertise to adjudicate HIV-related cases and have procedures in place to protect confidentiality.

UNAIDS and the International Development Law Organization have published a Toolkit on HIV- related legal services. The Toolkit includes an example of a training module and a two-day workshop programme for legal service providers. The Toolkit emphasizes participatory methods of learning and involving community representatives including PLHIV to ensure relevance to local needs.134 4.6 NGOs and CBOs including PLHIV organizations should be supported to conduct sensitization, education and training of key sectors such as the law and justice sector, health care services, schools and colleges on HIV-related legal and human rights issues. In India, PLHIV networks of the Indian Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (INP+) have addressed stigma and discrimination through collaborations with medical associations for training of health care workers, and with business federations and industries for workplace training (with support of the International Labour Organization (ILO)).135 4.7 Media organizations should ensure staff are sensitized to HIV and human rights issues to ensure media coverage of HIV reduces, rather than compounds, stigma. Media organizations can provide leadership in combating stigma and discrimination by challenging prejudicial attitudes and portraying PLHIV positively, rather than invoking fear or demonizing PLHIV. Media regulation including industry codes of practice should discourage reporting that violates privacy rights, spreads misinformation about infection risk, or incites violence towards or hatred of PLHIV or key populations. Fear of disclosure of HIV status in the media deters PLHIV from taking legal proceedings or other action to challenge rights violations. Media organizations should avoid sensationalist coverage of court cases involving HIV and respect the confidentiality of PLHIV involved in legal proceedings. 4.8 HIV-related human rights considerations should be mainstreamed into law and justice programming.

Consideration should be given to integration of HIV into mainstream law and justice initiatives aimed at promoting access to justice for all socially disadvantaged and marginalized populations. For example, HIV issues should be included in the general training of legal aid lawyers and the judiciary. HIV issues can also be integrated into efforts to improve the law and justice sector response to related issues such as responding to and preventing violence and promotion of gender equality. 56 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations PArt II Country case studies: National HIV laws in Asia 57 CAMBODIA 3.1 Overview of the Law on the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS The National Assembly of Cambodia enacted the Law on the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS136 (HIV/AIDS Law) in 2002. The HIV/AIDS Law includes wide-ranging provisions relating to public health and human rights. The key human rights protections of the HIV/ AIDS Law are summarized below. Rights to equality and non-discrimination The HIV/AIDS Law prohibits discrimination against people known or suspected of having HIV/AIDS and their families. Article 2 of the HIV/AIDS Law states that the HIV epidemic requires a multi-sectoral response to prohibit all kinds of discrimination against people suspected or known to be infected or affected by HIV/AIDS.

The National Stigma Index study conducted in Cambodia in 2010 was based on interviews with 399 PLHIV. The study found 51 percent of respondents lost employment because of HIV status; 12 percent were forced to change place of residence or unable to rent accommodation because of their HIV status; 9 percent of children were dismissed, suspended or prevented from attending schools because of their parents\u2019 HIV status; and 4 percent of respondents were denied health services including dental care. Only 7 percent of PLHIV who were aware that their rights had been violated had attempted to access legal assistance, but only 6 percent of respondents knew of legal services or human rights organizations that could be approached for help.139 There have been significant efforts by government and civil society to promote compliance with the non-discrimination provisions of the HIV/AIDS Law.

The Handbook encourages parliamentarians to play a leadership role in advocating implementation of the HIV/AIDS Law through discussions with provincial leaders and communities. The Handbook also encourage parliamentarians to review and reform legal frameworks with the aim of removing barriers to prevention, treatment, care and support: It is vital, as the epidemic evolves and new laws emerge and older ones become amended, that Members of Parliament continue educating their constituents and become advocates for the intended meaning and impact of the laws. Leaders must lead by example. By becoming engaged in fostering public participation and working with people living with HIV, with networks concerned with HIV and AIDS, and with members of key populations, they can improve democracy and oversight of the response to the epidemic.142 Despite extensive efforts to promote the HIV/AIDS Law by government and civil society, there are no reports of prosecutions or formal legal actions taken by citizens to enforce the provisions of the HIV/AIDS Law in response to human rights violations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e211c66-0ae1-462d-8545-70c557e16e83": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e211c66-0ae1-462d-8545-70c557e16e83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "755db9dcb6ce641a95f1db8d8a7f79a3a4da703040ed1ccc1dea1e0b4815b200"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0cf90cf-0228-4bd6-a32a-21d37e3ad47a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77b9d2b588328eda033ee2ab81916a4bb8a35f278882c02f800a10b22b2ae81f"}}, "hash": "b0f02cd77699aa909a62792a9c2bb3430c92518aa98e4bf6934887b3619c09e2", "text": "The Government\u2019s 2012 Country Progress Report to UNAIDS noted: \u201cStigma and discrimination and the weak enforcement of specific policies and laws protecting the human rights of PLHIV have remained a challenge in the current reporting period.\u201d143 Little analysis appears to have been conducted of the reasons for non-enforcement of the human rights provisions of the HIV/AIDS Law.

For example, KHANA has referred to the anti-discrimination provisions of the law in advocating for the rights of HIV-affected families facing eviction.145 KHANA identified the following concerns with the HIV/AIDS Law: In practice, Article 40 (discrimination regarding loans/ credit) is not properly, effectively or consistently applied, although this is extremely difficult to prove. Similarly, Article 41 (discrimination in hospital and health settings) is not properly, effectively or consistently applied, although this is also extremely difficult to prove. In a hospital in Sihanouk Province, a doctor elected not to perform necessary surgery on a pregnant HIV+ patient, and the patient died as a result. It is particularly difficult to assess whether this Article is upheld in private hospitals and medical facilities. Once again, in practice, Article 52 (penalties for discriminatory conduct) is not upheld. Regarding confidentiality, regardless of laws protecting PLHIV, it is impossible to determine whether or not various institutions or individuals disclose PLHIV status without consent. No data has been collected to confirm whether these laws related to disclosure and confidentiality are upheld. We recognize that a major problem in terms of the difference between the law and how it is (or is not) upheld stems from insufficient or misinformed public understanding about the rights of PLHIV and other marginalized individuals. Because individuals are unaware of their rights, they are unable to harness existing laws to enact justice.146 3.2.2 Implementing Guidelines The National AIDS Authority published Implementing Guidelines for the HIV/AIDS Law in 2005.147 The Guidelines explain the HIV/AIDS Law in plain language, and provide specific detail on the responsibilities of people and institutions to implement the law and to increase awareness and understanding of the law. The Implementing Guidelines were developed by the National AIDS Authority, and were informed by a series of consultations with Government, NGOs, and UN agencies. The Implementing Guidelines are intended to inform the activities of the National AIDS Authority in promoting and implementing the HIV/AIDS Law. A training programme developed by the National AIDS Authority assisted dissemination of the Guidelines. The Implementing Guidelines stress the human rights aspects of the HIV/AIDS Law, and provide further information as to how to implement a rights-based response. For example in relation to participation of PLHIV in HIV responses the Guidelines state: People living with HIV should be involved in all aspects of responding to the epidemic, including the design, delivery, and evaluation of policies and programs for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support\u2026It is important for people 145 IHAA (2009), HIV-affected families evicted in Cambodia see: http://www.aidsalliance.org/NewsDetails. aspx?Id=400 146 Email to UNDP from Dr. Oum Sopheap, Executive Director KHANA, 8 October 2012.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b39aa458-373d-4497-9144-75cf3e8d0bbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "b39aa458-373d-4497-9144-75cf3e8d0bbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4179f6f0859c3e3cde78cb590f9ef65f71d80d0e1393cc21b78db3fb43db381b"}, "2": {"node_id": "acb087b0-7fd1-46a2-9821-f31eea61c80f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f3f1d42cf6158458cb22708c706114e7d2d4d8cd0a34ac90836cc98050c1c18"}}, "hash": "70ffc76e62e2dd4dcfdbf27f35ac67c0681f3f291d93a6df9f92cfd7dd4e26cd", "text": "Oum Sopheap, Executive Director KHANA, 8 October 2012. 147 National AIDS Authority (2005), Implementing Guidelines of the Law on the Prevention and Control of HIV/ AIDS, Phnom Penh: National AIDS Authority and the Policy Project. 63 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa CAMBODIA living with HIV/AIDS to be involved in all aspects of the response to the epidemic because they are the people most affected by the epidemic, and the life experiences of (PLHIV) should inform the development of all HIV/AIDS policies and programs.

For example, the Implementing Guidelines caution against over-reliance on the exercise of power to prosecute PLHIV for intentional HIV transmission as a way of combating HIV: There is a risk that over-reliance on the criminal law, and on punitive approaches to HIV transmission, will undermine HIV prevention education initiatives by contributing to stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS. In this context, people living with HIV/AIDS may come to be viewed as criminals, ostracized or isolated from their families and communities. It is well established that stigma and discrimination help fuel the HIV/AIDS epidemic, by making people living with or at risk of HIV infection harder to reach with prevention, treatment, care, and support programs. Because of the complex issues associated with criminal prosecutions for HIV transmission, the National AIDS Authority, in partnership with the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Interior, will develop guidelines for court officials on the circumstances in which the use of Article 18 of the HIV/AIDS law should be considered.149 3.2.3 Implementation of the HIV/AIDS Law in workplaces After the HIV/AIDS Law was enacted, additional regulations (\u2018Prakas\u2019 \u2013 regulations issued by the relevant Minister) were issued to further implement the HIV/AIDS Law in the context of employment. The Prakas on the creation of the HIV/AIDS committee in enterprises and establishments and the prevention of HIV/AIDS in the workplace, issued by the Minister of Labour and Vocational Training in 2006 aimed to stimulate discussion, raise awareness and promote workers\u2019 education on HIV prevention in the workplace. Enterprises are required to establish HIV/AIDS Working Groups or HIV/AIDS Committees. In relation to discrimination, the Prakas states: In the spirit of decent work and respect for the human rights and dignity of persons infected or affected by HIV/AIDS, there should be no discrimination against workers on the basis of real or perceived HIV status. Discrimination and stigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS hinders efforts aimed at promoting HIV/AIDS prevention. The Prakas also addresses gender equality as follows: The gender dimensions of HIV/AIDS should be recognized. Women are more likely to become infected and are more often adversely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic 148 Ibid, pp.7-8. 149 Ibid., p.20. 64 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations than men due to biological, socio-cultural and economic reasons. The greater the gender discrimination in societies and the lower the position of women, the more negatively they are affected by HIV/AIDS. Therefore, more equal gender relations and the empowerment of women are vital to successfully prevent the spread of HIV infection and enable women to cope with the consequences of HIV/AIDS. Concerns have been raised that the Prakas omits specific reference to the rights of girls in relation to gender equality.150 To demonstrate leadership, line ministries should encourage relevant stakeholders to establish and/or reinforce HIV/AIDS workplace policies to support staff members who are living with or affected by HIV.151 Another Prakas was issued that addresses the rights of Cambodian migrant labourers to HIV information.152 3.2.4 Implementation under the National HIV/AIDS Plan Cambodia\u2019s Third National Strategic Plan for a Comprehensive and Multisectoral National Response to HIV and AIDS (NSP III) (2011-2015) includes a specific commitment to \u201censure a supportive legal and public policy environment for the national response to HIV and AIDS (Strategy 5)\u201d. The Plan states that there will be strategic focus under NSP III on implementation and enforcement of the provisions of the HIV/AIDS Law. NSP III includes a specific Objective as follows: Objective 1: Intensify implementation and enforcement of the Law on Prevention and Control of HIV and AIDS.

NSP III also notes the need to establish an enabling environment for prevention particularly in the area of entertainment work and harm reduction, including protection of human rights and access to prevention, care and treatment services without fear of harassment, arrest or punishment. NSP III states that there will be an assessment of the impact of enforcement of criminal laws on vulnerability to HIV or access to HIV services for most-at-risk populations, with particular attention to the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation and the Law on Drug Control. The Government\u2019s 2012 Country Progress Report to UNAIDS on implementation of the UN Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS noted that some laws and policies present obstacles to effective HIV responses. The Law on Drug Control and the Village/Commune Safety Policy may have made it more difficult to access people who use drugs due to law enforcement practices at commune level. In response, new policy initiatives such as the Community Most at Risk Populations Partnership Initiative and the Continuum of Prevention, Treatment and Care have been introduced to mitigate the unintended impact of legislation such as the Law on the Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation, the new Drug Law and the Commune/Sangkat Safety Policy.153 Stakeholders have also raised concerns about the need for revision or clarification of some provisions of the HIV/AIDS Law. The HIV/AIDS Coordinating Committee (HACC) has called for amendment to Article 19, which is interpreted by the Implementing Guidelines as requiring parental consent for all HIV tests conducted on persons under 18. Lowering the age at which parental consent is required for testing would encourage more younger people to be tested, particularly MSM who may not want their parents to be aware of risk behaviors. HACC has also called for clarification of entitlements that flow from Article 153 National AIDS Authority (2012), Cambodia Country Progress Report: Monitoring the Progress towards the implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV and AIDS, p.37. 66 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations 26, which provides that the State shall ensure that all PLHIV receive primary health care services free of charge. The components of primary health care that PLHIV are entitled to receive for free need to be defined, and health insurance or other financing measure need to be provided by the State to ensure that PLHIV can access these health services.154 The HIV-specific offence for intentional HIV transmission carries a severe penalty of 10 to 15 years imprisonment (Article 50). Such HIV-specific punitive provisions are stigmatizing to PLHIV. There is a risk that this provision may be used inappropriately to target vulnerable populations such as sex workers and MSM. UNAIDS recommends that states prosecute intentional transmission using general criminal law, rather than HIV-specific laws.155 3.3 Other legal redress mechanisms for human rights violations The Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia recognizes all human rights guaranteed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "130076cc-612d-4dfb-a7f1-6c4138aa9b65": {"__data__": {"id_": "130076cc-612d-4dfb-a7f1-6c4138aa9b65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72de114deb8a25f7d3f7180a3628e15d9f815e5b0cb67bca0a5a92e7eb816b7e"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f9dc388-1e99-41f3-bf1a-f19124d996d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "530d68aec572b682acd32d0d9da6b66d4282a64a4363765967c85109d155d669"}}, "hash": "bacaacd30a534744422b1b7cb7feee0d104971503af3c309bcea92e37ba2d27b", "text": "Article 31 states that the Kingdom of Cambodia shall recognize and respect human rights as stipulated in the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the covenants and conventions related to human rights, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights.

Promotion of the HIV/AIDS Law has contributed to broader efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination by promoting non-discriminatory attitudes and practices. However, the impact of this law is undermined by the lack of practical mechanisms to enable PLHIV to seek redress for HIV-related human rights violations. Although, in theory, violations of the law can be addressed through administrative or criminal law sanctions, enforcement of the human rights provisions of the HIV/AIDS Law through the courts has not occurred to date. Addressing the needs of PLHIV within mainstream access to justice programmes requires consideration in Cambodia.

The AIDS Regulations provide a legal statement of the rights of PLHIV, including the right to marry, to access health-care services, to enjoy equal employment opportunities and education. The AIDS Regulations have also provided a legal basis for implementation of politically sensitive prevention measures by government, including condom promotion, methadone maintenance therapy and needle and syringe programmes.162 Rong Tang described the significance of the AIDS Regulations as follows:163 This regulatory document summarises the lessons and experiences in the legislation for HIV in the past years... It clearly forbids discrimination against PLHIV and their relatives, and identifies intervention strategies for high risk groups. The document also establishes the mechanism for voluntary counseling and testing (VCT); and the privacy rights of, and the relief system for, PLHIV and their relatives. Supported with penalty clauses, it clarifies and specifies the mandates and responsibilities of the government, health and medical organizations and the testing and quarantine institutions, and further clarifies the legal consequence of offending the lawful rights and interests of PLHIV and their relatives. Chapter I of the AIDS Regulations contains general provisions, including a broadly worded right to non-discrimination, in the following terms: 160 China HIV/AIDS Media Partnership et al., (2008), AIDS-Related Knowledge, Attitudes, Behavior, and Practices: A Survey of 6 Chinese Cities.

The Law protects the legal rights of PLHIV and AIDS and their relatives. It includes the rights of marriage, employment, assessment of medical treatment and education. Any institute or individual shall not discriminate against PLHIV, AIDS patients and their relatives. Chapter II addresses education and communication, and includes a requirement that government agencies not discriminate against PLHIV and their relatives in the following terms: Article 10. The people\u2019s governments and the relevant departments of the people\u2019s government at various levels shall organize and develop education and care for, and shall not discriminate against, PLHIV and AIDS patients and their relatives. The people\u2019s governments and the relevant departments of the people\u2019s government at various levels shall advocate health and civilized life-style, shall build well-supportive social environment for AIDS prevention and treatment. Chapter III addresses HIV prevention and public health measures, including provisions relating to national disease surveillance, voluntary counseling and testing, behavior change programmes with vulnerable high-risk populations (defined to include sex workers, men who have sex with men or people who inject drugs), methadone maintenance treatment for people who inject drugs, condom supply and promotion, peer-education for the purpose of raising individual health literacy and reducing risk behavior, HIV prevention and treatment for prisoners, implementation of standard infection control precautions to prevent occupational transmission in health care settings and safety of donated human tissue and the blood supply. Chapter III also states the legal obligations of PLHIV, in the following terms: Article 38. People with HIV and AIDS patients shall perform the following obligations: 1. Accept epidemiological investigation and direction of agencies of diseases control and prevention or inspection/quarantine; 2.

Medical care institutions shall not reject or make excuse to HIV positives or AIDS patients in treating their other diseases. Chapter V relates to implementation responsibilities of government agencies including budget allocations and monitoring. Chapter VI addresses legal liabilities. Government officials may be held liable for failing to implement prevention, treatment, care or support measures as required by the Regulations, and officials may be subject to administrative or criminal liability. Article 55 provides that health care workers who fail in their duties may be penalised by demotion, dismissal, loss of certification or prosecution in the case of criminal conduct. Such duties include the duty to provide health care to PLHIV. Article 56 creates sanctions for breach of confidentiality by health care services, (see Article 39), which may include sanctions under the law on prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and revocation of certification. Article 62 provides that people with HIV or AIDS who spread HIV on purpose shall have legal liability for compensation in accordance with the civil law, and if a crime is committed, an investigation shall be carried out for criminal liability in accordance with the law. To supplement the AIDS Regulations, the State Council issued a Notice on Further Strengthening the HIV Response in 2010.164 The Notice is an important statement of policy that courts may have regard to if seeking to apply the AIDS Regulations or other HIV- related laws. The part of this Notice addressing the rights of PLHIV states as follows: (11) Enhance the protection of rights and interests to promote social harmony. Relevant policies shall be implemented to eliminate social discrimination and protect the legitimate rights and interests of PLHIV and their families in health seeking, employment and schooling. Development and capacity building of designated general hospitals and infectious disease hospitals shall be enhanced to strengthen their capacity in diagnosis and treatment and protect the rights and interests of PLHIV in access to diagnosis and treatment services. HIV/AIDS in prisons and other custody settings shall be incorporated into national and local HIV/AIDS plans. Efforts shall be made to strengthen HIV/AIDS IEC, HIV testing and ART for AIDS patients for incarcerated inmates, establish and improve regulations on the management of PLHIV who have committed crimes, ensure their access to treatment and support 164 Document of the State Council, Guo Fa [2010] No. 48. 72 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations services after they are discharged, strengthen legal and moral education for PLHIV to raise their sense of social responsibility, guide PLHIV to actively participate in HIV/ AIDS activities and intensify strict crackdown against illegal acts that lead to the transmission of HIV on purpose and crimes committed with the abuse of HIV status. This re-statement of the obligation of non-discrimination and the rights of incarcerated PLHIV is helpful. However, the reference to the need for moral education of PLHIV and an intensified crackdown on purposeful HIV transmission suggests a punitive approach that may jeopardize efforts to combat stigma. 4.2 Legal status of the AIDS Regulations The AIDS Regulations of 2006 update existing regulations. The first regulations addressing the public health aspects of HIV were issued in 1988 and numerous other regulations were subsequently promulgated focusing on public health aspects of HIV.165 The 2006 AIDS Regulations update and consolidate measures addressing the public health aspects of HIV and additionally address rights to non-discrimination and confidentiality. It is important to understand that the AIDS Regulations are only administrative regulations and are subject to overriding laws that have a higher priority in the legal hierarchy, such as laws that permit discrimination in some forms of state employment and criminal laws relating to sex work and drug use. Jinmei Meng, an expert in Chinese HIV-related law, describes the limited legal impact of the AIDS Regulations as follows: Where there are conflicts between the prohibitive laws against prostitution and drug use on the one hand and the specific legislation on HIV prevention on the other, the former always takes priority because it has a more powerful legal effect. In China, the descending order of legal effect of different legislation begins with constitutional law, followed by laws made by the National People\u2019s Congress and its Standing Committee, then administrative regulations introduced by the State Council of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdaecb07-6b9a-49e0-8570-f518089c637f": {"__data__": {"id_": "bdaecb07-6b9a-49e0-8570-f518089c637f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "853447e8c60e59ab7355991f897fb7cf799c70ddfbed7334c08244f19d63fa58"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f4eb61b-3ef7-4c81-83f3-830fe0bfd36a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "147a5e8eccbf6515845862e9c025d0d4eae4fbaf244eb72eb5f2c96e7b7aca75"}}, "hash": "9097d514b8a57c20013c6c78a64156e641f09138fb0005d8591ee0729470682b", "text": "PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China) and local regulations formulated by local congresses, and finally rules of departments and rules of local government. The top specific legislation on HIV is the Regulations on AIDS prevention and treatment, an administrative regulation issued by the State Council. The majority of specific legislation on HIV is formulated by administrative departments such as the Ministry of Health. In contrast, the key pieces of anti-prostitution and anti- drug legislation are made by the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) or its Standing Committee, such as Criminal law (The National People\u2019s Congress of the PRC 1997), Public order administrative punishment law (The Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress 2005) and the Law on the prohibition of drugs (The Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress of the PRC 2007). 165 Certain Regulations on the monitoring and control of AIDS, Approved 26 December 1987 by the State Council and jointly promulgated 14 January 1988 by the Ministry of Public Health, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, the State Education Commission, the National Tourist Administration, the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the National Foreign Experts Bureau. 73 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa CHINA The hierarchical order of China\u2019s law making bodies (from high to low: NPC -> State Council -> Ministry of Health and local bodies) has predetermined the weak effectiveness of regulations issued by the bodies ranked lower in the hierarchy, especially when these contradict laws promulgated by bodies ranked higher. In other words, the legal effect of this legislative arrangement determines that the enforcement of anti-prostitution and anti-drug laws takes priority over the enforcement of HIV-related public health law, a ranking which undermines the efficacy of responses to HIV.166 Rong Tang describes the limitations of the AIDS Regulations and the subordination of the AIDS Regulations to other conflicting laws as follows:167 Since promulgation of the Regulations is based on the legislative principle of nationalism, and other national laws have not been amended to enable the Regulations, there is still a lack of sufficient safeguards for the human rights of the groups affected by HIV. The articles concerning the safeguarding of rights are very general and are not practical to enforce from case to case. The core element for HIV prevention and control is anti-discrimination. Although the Regulations define the principle of non- discrimination against PLHIV \u2026 the concept of discrimination is not further defined explicitly, nor are the legal liabilities for discriminatory behaviors, nor the means for relief and assistance. The Regulations on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control is a normative administrative document for national governance that the State Council formulated based on the Constitutions and other relevant laws. Many laws conflict with the Regulations, however, and legitimacy of the Regulations is secondary to the Constitutions and laws. If the Regulations conflict with other laws, the laws with higher level of legitimacy should be observed. The laws that conflict with the Regulations include: (A) Medical practitioners are legally authorized to forbid the sufferers of some diseases to marry.168 (B) The rights of PLHIV are constrained by laws (General Standards on Physical Examinations Relating to the Employment of Civil Servants (Provisional); The Measures on Implementing the Regulations on the Qualifications of Teachers; The Physical 166 Jinmei Meng (2012), HIV Governance through law: achievements and challenges of China\u2019s legal environment, International Journal of Asian Pacific Studies, Vol. 8, No. 1, 57\u201375, p.64. 167 Rong Tang (2008), op cit., pp.11-13. 168 Ibid; The Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Maternal and Infant Health Care (1994, NPC) stipulates: \u201cPhysicians shall, after pre-marital medical examination, give medical advice to those who are in the infective period of any target infectious disease or who are in the morbid period of any relevant mental disease; both the male and female planning to be married shall postpone their marriage for the time being\u201d.

However, Chinese courts may be reluctant to apply constitutional human rights provisions in civil and administrative litigation. The prevailing view of judges is that the court\u2019s role is not to interpret the Constitution (this being the function of the National People\u2019s Congress or its Standing Committee), and therefore the courts should not quote the Constitution as a legal basis in a judgment.177 Employment Promotion Law (2008) The Employment Promotion Law provides: When hiring personnel, an employer may not refuse to employ someone on the grounds that he or she is a carrier of an infectious disease.

Although the Employment Promotion Law was a significant advance in protecting the rights of workers with infectious diseases, procedural barriers exist and the law needs to be strengthened. The China Labour Bulletin identified the following factors to be addressed: The Employment Promotion Law clearly remains deficient in several areas of administration, effectiveness, and coverage. \u2022\ufffd The law relies on already under-staffed and over-worked local labour bureaus to oversee and implement anti-discriminatory policies and regulations. \u2022\ufffd Since prospective employees are not actually employees under the law, cases of employment discrimination in hiring are not subject to the labour dispute arbitration system and victims must use the formal court process, which can cost a lot more and can take much longer to complete proceedings. \u2022\ufffd Fines for violations of the Employment Promotion Law are hopelessly inadequate. A 1,000 yuan fine for conducting HBV screening does not deter employers from conducting such tests. Moreover, employers can simply require individuals to sign documents indicating that they took the test \u201cvoluntarily.\u201d The law states that those who have been discriminated against are entitled to initiate legal proceedings, but it offers no explanation to the courts on what standards are to be followed, what types of compensation should be paid to victims and what punishments should be meted out to violators. Chinese courts are known to be unwilling to hear cases without regulations or laws that adequately explain how cases should be tried.179 Roberts has identified fundamental weaknesses in protections from discrimination under Chinese employment law: Litigation costs are often too high, and the likelihood of success at a discrimination claim is too low, to make pursuing litigation worthwhile. The lack of incentive to bring discrimination claims against employers is exacerbated by the lack of a clear or guaranteed remedy upon a successful case. Plaintiffs must satisfy a heavy burden of proof in employment discrimination claims. In the United States, once the plaintiff establishes his prima facie case 178 See: Webster T.

Unlike previous laws and regulations that failed to specify a penalty for violations, the 2007 regulations introduced a fine of 1,000 yuan for employers who discriminate on the grounds of HBV status. The Employment Promotion Law has primarily been used by people with HBV, rather than PLHIV. There is only one reported case where a PLHIV has succeeded in achieving legal redress for discrimination under the Employment Promotion Law (see Xiao Qi\u2019s case, below). By contrast, many HBV cases have been successful: Studies indicate that over 70 percent of HBV discrimination cases are now accepted in the courts, with more than 200 reported cases by 2011. Prior to the law\u2019s implementation, the anti-discrimination group Yirenping brought less than 20 cases per year; that number immediately rose to 70-80 cases per year after implementation. In addition to bringing more cases before the courts, the stronger laws and greater willingness of courts to accept these cases has also given workers greater leverage and bargaining power in out-of-court settlements.181 This suggest that HIV claims may be more successful if the Ministry of Labour and Social Security issued detailed HIV regulations clarifying non-discrimination requirements in specific industries or contexts, to complement the Employment Promotion Law. Webster conducted an analysis of all types of discrimination cases brought under the Employment Promotion Law, which provides legal protections for five disadvantaged groups: women, ethnic minorities, disabled persons, people with infectious diseases, and rural workers. Webster found that the majority of law suits (twenty-two of twenty- five) were brought by people with HBV. Of the nineteen fully adjudicated cases, fifteen resulted in compensation for the plaintiff. According to Webster: HBV lawsuits follow a pattern: Plaintiff passes the written and oral examinations of his prospective employer, who then makes a job offer, possibly conditioned on a medical examination. When the applicant\u2019s medical examination reveals that he carries HBV, 180 Roberts C. (2012), Far From a Harmonious Society: Employment Discrimination in China, Santa Clara Law Review 52(4) 1531, p.1555. 181 Employment discrimination in China, China Labour Bulletin, 21 November 2012. 78 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations the employer either rejects the application or rescinds the offer. After an attempt at mediation, the applicant sues in court (avoiding the sidestep of labor arbitration) for economic damages, emotional distress damages, or breach of contract. He or she may also request an apology. Chinese courts have some discretion in deciding whether to accept cases. Some courts refuse to accept cases of discrimination in hiring because it is not listed in the Supreme People\u2019s Court\u2019s causes of action. Nevertheless, many judges have accepted these cases, interpreting the disputes as implicating the right to health or the right to privacy. The first hurdle for many plaintiffs, then, is to find a judge or court willing to hear the case.182 Civil law and tort liability It is possible to bring an action based on general principles of China\u2019s civil law relating to injury to reputation and violation of privacy.

Rights to information Another possible avenue for enforcing rights is to seek information about government policies and practices. The following describes actions taken under the Regulations on Freedom of Information 2008: In March 2009, the Beijing Aizhixing Institute supported three groups to make freedom of information requests in Beijing, Henan and Hubei. By December 2009, the groups had submitted a total of 35 requests for government information and received 23 valid responses. The requests sought information on: \u2022\ufffd the public health budget; \u2022\ufffd the public health system\u2019s proposed implementation of Regulation on HIV Prevention and Treatment; \u2022\ufffd regulation on false medical information; \u2022\ufffd government policy on PLHIV; and \u2022\ufffd details on government assistance for PLHIV.

The China Stigma Index study found that of the respondents who had experienced rights violations, 110 respondents (31.2 percent) had tried to seek redress. Of those that chose not to take any action against a violation of their rights, the primary reason given was a lack of faith in the possibility of success: This lack of faith in the possibility of success seems to be based on a solid reality: of those that had sought redress for a violation of their rights, only 19.8 percent had been successful in their action, while for 68.3 percent the matter had still not been resolved. 37.8 percent of people who had had their rights violated had sought help from government employees to obtain redress. Of those people, 15.8 percent had had the matter resolved.193 There have been five court cases reported in the media in which PLHIV have sought to enforce their rights to legal protection from discrimination in China, one in relation to insurance and four in relation to employment. There are indications that the courts may be more willing to consider HIV cases in the future. Over twenty cases of discrimination on the grounds of Hepatitis B status have been taken to court under employment laws, and others have been settled through mediation, resulting in imposition of fines and payment of compensation.194 Wilson conducted a study of HIV-related discrimination litigation in China based on interviews conducted in 2007\u20132010. Wilson\u2019s study found that many HIV discrimination cases are settled out of court because the courts have been reluctant to accept employment discrimination cases brought by PLHIV. Wilson argues that the popularity of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) means that few HIV cases have been brought to court: Instead of litigation, legal aid lawyers have employed alternative dispute resolution (ADR), primarily negotiating out-of-court settlements. Legal aid stations seek to try impact litigation cases and to change popular attitudes toward HIV/AIDS carriers\u2019 legal rights, but the negotiated settlements that they reach are struck without formal legal judgment or society\u2019s knowledge. Usually, the settlements provide HIV/ AIDS carriers with financial compensation in exchange for instituting discriminatory practices such as restricting an employee\u2019s right to work or right to education.195 193 Institute of Social Development Research, China Central Party School (2009), op cit., p.15. 194 See: Webster T.

HIV prevention and control is a complex systematic program that involves multiple issues, including those in politics, law, policy, religion, morality, and the preconceptions of individuals and institutions... The issue of judicial judgment concerning HIV is that some cases are often rejected by the courts. Some jurists are of the opinion that all issues involving laws should be appealed to the courts where the judge will make the ultimate determination. However, the scope for courts to accept cases is still very limited at the present time. Many non-legal factors need to be taken into account in deciding whether a case is to be accepted or not. Moreover, in a lawsuit concerning HIV, administrative authorities, human rights and vulnerable groups are often involved. In the end, the principled judgment of the courts is often interfered with by many external factors.197 4.4.2 Insurance discrimination Li Wei v. Ping\u2019an Health Insurance Company (2008) was the first case to test the anti- discrimination provisions of the AIDS Regulations. The case was unsuccessful in that the court did not find that the insurance company had committed unlawful discrimination by excluding PLHIV from medical benefits. However, ultimately the case resulted in a positive outcome for PLHIV as a result of pressure being placed on the insurance industry to end discriminatory practices. Advocacy associated with the case succeeded in securing 196 Ibid, p.50. 197 Rong Tang (2008), op cit., pp.13, 15. 83 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa CHINA a change in the national policy of the Insurance Association of China directing health insurance companies (e.g., accidental death and disability) not to exclude HIV.198 Li Wei\u2019s case is described by Wilson as follows: Li alleged that the Ping\u2019an Health Insurance Company, which provided his insurance policy, discriminated by excluding HIV/AIDS carriers from medical benefits. The policy lumped HIV/AIDS in with health damages caused by warfare, actions of soldiers, bombs, rioting or the actions of criminals. Li claimed that such an exclusion against HIV/AIDS, which stood out as a medical condition in a list of violent acts, discriminated against a category of more than 700,000 persons. On June 25, 2009, a Kunming municipal court heard the complaint but ultimately rejected it... The attorney representing Li contended that although the policy had been approved in 1999, it violated China\u2019s AIDS Law... The insurance company failed to have an attorney ensure that its policies were updated to comply with relevant state law and regulations. The plaintiff also argued that the policy did not include required calculations on insurance coverage costs in its brochures...The attorney challenged the insurance company representative to offer calculations that would show it would be prohibitive for the company to insure medical costs related to HIV/ AIDS. Second, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel alleged that the policy discriminated against HIV/AIDS carriers by failing to cover medical claims related to an HIV/AIDS carrier who was involved in an accident such as being hit by a car... the court could not determine if the written policy would exclude coverage for a HIV/AIDS carrier who had an ordinary accident such as being struck by a car. The court determined that the exclusion, on the face of it, did not inherently constitute discrimination, despite the non-discrimination article in China\u2019s AIDS Law and AIDS Prevention Rules.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8d66819-50aa-4d59-8e82-c378d95f18e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8d66819-50aa-4d59-8e82-c378d95f18e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffc9e07d63385a4c88130ae58ed095b466efcd75400a18527f3ba9b0efbeda50"}, "2": {"node_id": "56361d0c-788f-4ec6-af92-88b47eef2af7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61df2ecd9b65bc43e1c898c0c4c3270fc2b567df7a71a239a23ce9d300578e28"}}, "hash": "d8fe570b1068a543f4b32d0a5b7790fa42110caa300911682b997a58a2e089b9", "text": "\u2026Although the courts did not find that Ping\u2019an Insurance Company had infringed upon Li Wei\u2019s right to medical coverage, the Insurance Association of China issued a paper requiring all insurance companies not to exclude HIV/AIDS carriers from health coverage, effective 1 October 2009.199 According to the Asia Pacific Council of AIDS Service Organisations, important lessons from this case were: i.

Involvement of legal professionals and the media was significant in bringing about change.200 4.4.3 Employment discrimination Four cases have arisen in the period 2010-2012 in which PLHIV have requested courts to consider complaints of unlawful discrimination due to rejection of applications for teaching positions. These discrimination cases sought to challenge the discriminatory conduct of the relevant Education Bureau based on provisions of the Employment Promotion Law and Infectious Diseases Law, as well as the HIV Regulations. The names used to describe the cases are pseudonyms. Only one case resulted in a positive outcome for the complainant, when compensation was agreed at a court supervised mediation. However, as yet, no court has ordered an education bureau to employ a PLHIV. (i) Xiao Wu\u2019s case (2010) Wilson describes Xiao Wu\u2019s case (2010) as follows: Xiao Wu was a student in Anhui Province who upon graduation applied for a teaching position at the Municipal Education Bureau and the Personnel Office of Anqing City. In May 2010, Xiao Wu passed a written exam for the position, and in June, his interview qualified him for the job. During a required physical examination as part of the application process, authorities discovered that he was HIV positive. Based upon that discovery, the school found him unfit for employment. After a period of angry reflection and consultation with lawyers, Xiao Wu filed a case in court in Anqing City, Anhui Province. Xiao Wu and his lawyer, Yu Fangqiang, from Yirenping, a public interest law firm in Beijing, claimed discrimination based on legal principles found in China\u2019s Constitution, Labor Law, Employment Promotion Law, China\u2019s Infectious Diseases Prevention Law, and AIDS Prevention Rules...The rules on civil service employment, however, ran against these general statements against discrimination in employment. The Standards Used for Civil Servant Physical Examinations (Trial Implementation) flatly states, \u201cHIV/AIDS, inappropriate,\u201d and The Handbook on Physical Examinations Used for Civil Servants notes that \u201cphysical examinations cannot be completed once it is discovered that an applicant is discovered to have HIV.\u201d \u2026The defendants argued that they acted within the legal guidelines of the relevant regulations, so the case should be dismissed. The court decided with the defendants in their lawful use of regulations to deny Xiao Wu employment. One commentator lamented that the various laws related to discrimination and employment lacked a common \u201cequal standard\u201d (pingdeng yuanze) and detailed definitions by which to judge discrimination claims. Implicitly, the courts, by failing to act on such cases, have indicated that they do not take it upon themselves to help settle such 200 Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2011), Report of the Asia Pacific Regional Dialogue, Bangkok: UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Office. 85 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa CHINA discrepancies in terminology in legal expressions, instead waiting for implementing guidelines or instructions from legislative bodies. Xiao Wu\u2019s case is extraordinary in several respects. First and against the basic argument of this paper, Xiao Wu overcame his fear of public exposure to use litigation (rather than alternative dispute resolution) to address his grievance. Second, the courts have been reluctant to hear cases related to discrimination, but they accepted this case.

Although ultimately this was a disappointing outcome for PLHIV, some commentators observed that the fact that the initial court accepted and heard the case was a very positive development: This is positive news in most respects. The standard operating procedure for Chinese courts up until now is to dismiss these discrimination cases, including HIV. We\u2019ve seen some very positive trends with sexual harassment over the past few years, and now perhaps HIV cases will begin to be accepted by judges. The Central Government has, via legal reform in 2006, made their intentions clear that such cases should be taken seriously. By hearing the case, the issue was indeed taken seriously.202 (ii) Xiao Jun\u2019s Case (2011) The second employment discrimination case was Xiao Jun\u2019s Case (2011), which arose in Sichuan. This case was also unsuccessful and has been described as follows: 201 Wilson S. (2012), op cit., pp.48-52. 202 Harris D.

Xiao Jun filed a lawsuit at Yanbian County Court. Xu Xinghua from Beijing Changjiu Law Firm and Huang Xiang from YULAC were entrusted by Xiao Jun as representing lawyers for this case. Yanbian County Court accepted the case on October 28, 2010. The first trial was held on February 18, 2011. The two lawyers spoke in defense of the client at the court. On March 21, 2011, the Court issued an administrative verdict, which found against the plaintiff. The Court found that the action of the Education Bureau was consistent with relevant public service regulations and not unlawful. Xiao Jun appealed to the Mediation Court of Panzhihua on March 28, 2011. The appeal was unsuccessful.203 (iii) Xiao Hai\u2019s case (2011) A third employment case arose in Guizhou Province in 2011. The Court refused to accept Xiao Hai\u2019s case for consideration. In rejecting the case, it was reported that the judge suggested that he turn to the local government to solve the issue rather than the courts.204 It was reported in the Global Times as follows: An HIV carrier, rejected for a position as a primary school teacher, launched a lawsuit against local authorities in Guizhou Province for employment discrimination Wednesday. The candidate, giving the name Xiaohai, was told by the Human Resources and Social Security Bureau in Sandu Shui Autonomous County that he was not hired as a teacher on April 3 this year because he carried the HIV. He was also told he passed the written test and interview. An officer surnamed Wei at the county bureau told the Global Times that the bureau refused to hire Xiaohai because the physical test standard for civil servants indicates people with HIV/AIDS cannot be hired. Chen Wensheng, Xiaohai\u2019s attorney at Qiance Law Firm in Guizhou Province, submitted the indictment against the county government and the human resources and social security bureau to the intermediate people\u2019s court in Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Wednesday afternoon. \u201cFirst we require the court to confirm that the rejection of Xiaohai is employment discrimination and illegal, and get them to repeal the rejection,\u201d said Chen. \u201cSecondly, we request the court make authorities reconsider whether Xiaohai can be hired as teacher, as their basis for the refusal is against law.\u201d According to Chen, all citizens in China have the right and obligation to work. Also, the Employment Promotion Law implemented in 2008 formulated in the 30th article that employers may not refuse applicants because they carry an infectious disease. Moreover, Chen said, the Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, and AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations dictate employers must not discriminate against AIDS patients or HIV carriers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22f6e273-36b8-4278-86a0-92d77adf1bdf": {"__data__": {"id_": "22f6e273-36b8-4278-86a0-92d77adf1bdf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9b88d8d37b0bedee80009d7c299c63bf43330c5ed4657d6f93409f3791525f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "2630c198-8ef8-4541-9ac5-1ff5296a4165", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8b118b2c3f7808de8772a22c53fed18bc1c1ec88ce34ca22471de73eea1a3af"}}, "hash": "d3695c6f1e446c220e2ee8d3022bafa30885bc2b30db3de2a76e2c41eb5472b5", "text": "And the regulations also stressed AIDS patients and HIV carriers are protected by law in regards to marriage and 203 Lessons learned from an HIV legal aid service operating in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China: Yunnan University Legal Aid Center 2009-2011 & Daytop Legal Service Project 2011-2012, Health Policy Initiative / Greater Mekong Region and China, May 2012. 204 Li Li (2012), Opening the door of opportunity, Beijing Review, 19 January 2012. 87 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6364b6f9-6143-4a55-8547-b0f0eb3184a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6364b6f9-6143-4a55-8547-b0f0eb3184a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71961c4a34b0db1f87a77a66bd2d0e2468137d6e02fe6f66240061dbd86edad4"}, "3": {"node_id": "60ba8051-7389-4f3f-8bd0-0b488a5d4373", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9ce37f25ab42103319dadcfebdced6263fe085ee5517aa83421a274051984e9"}}, "hash": "e1707fe54a755593053d562331882bc4695cf18c7c45a06375f9f4a7ae2a02dd", "text": "HIV laws In asIa CHINA employment.

Compensation was obtained as a result of a mediation agreement between the parties, rather than after a formal court hearing. Xiao Qi claimed that he was discriminated against by Jinxian County Educational Bureau in Jiangxi Province for being denied a teaching post because a pre-employment health check showed that he was HIV-positive. He cited the Employment Promotion Law and AIDS Regulations to support his claim. Jinxian People\u2019s Court presided over a mediation of the case, which resulted in an agreement for payment of 45,000 yuan compensation. However, the agreement only relates to compensation and the Educational Bureau is not required to employ Xiao Qi.206 This court-approved settlement received significant media coverage, hence may have some impact on future practices in employment and the willingness of PLHIV to seek redress. 4.5 Issues arising in implementation of the AIDS Regulations 4.5.1 Enforcement of anti-discrimination provisions is problematic Several commentators have raised concerns regarding the enforceability of the non- discrimination provisions of the AIDS Regulations. Jinmei Meng states: \u2026 the enforceability of the legal provisions on the prohibition of HIV-related discrimination is questionable. These provisions are highly abstract, resembling political declarations. They cannot be applied to individual discrimination cases. Victims of HIV discrimination have to seek protection from other laws such as employment law or public health law and often find that there are insufficient concrete provisions on available legal remedies for them. The legal responsibilities of hospitals that refuse to admit PLWHA are unclear in public health law. Similarly, in employment law, HIV-related discrimination victims who are denied employment opportunities cannot claim compensation from potential employers who refuse to employ them because no employment contract has yet been established between them\u2026 The Chinese anti-discrimination legal mechanism is rather weak and does not specify a clear legal definition of discrimination. There is no specific government agency dealing with non-discrimination and equal opportunity. To establish an effective 205 Pang Qi (2011), HIV carrier sues local govt., Global Times, 8 September 2011. 206 China\u2019s first successful AIDS discrimination claim, People\u2019s Daily Online, 26 January 2013. 88 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations anti-discrimination legal system would be one condition enabling the prohibition of HIV-related discrimination.207 The three applicants for positions as teachers whose court cases failed submitted a petition to the State Council to register dissatisfaction with the lack of enforcement of the non-discrimination provision of the AIDS Regulations. Advocates requested the State Council to take action to resolve existing conflicts between national and provincial laws: Guidelines state that civil servants should not be carriers of an infectious disease. However, a five-year-old national law in China is supposed to safeguard the employment rights of people with HIV\u2026 Mr Yu (Yu Fangqiang, an HIV activist who heads the Nanjing-based organisation Tianxia Gong) told the BBC: \u201cLocal governments often tend to obey regulations set up by a higher level which are against the national law. The State Council has the responsibility to check if there is any contradiction between departmental regulations and the law of the state: if there is, the regulations of the departments should be removed.\u201d208 The policy justification for continued discrimination against applicants for teaching positions is unclear. Justifications that have been suggested include concerns regarding reduced life expectancy and the fact that HIV cannot be \u2018cured\u2019, anticipated workplace absences due to illness, liability of public sector employers for health insurance costs, infection risk to staff and students, concern that the moral status of teachers may be undermined in the eyes of the community, and concerns regarding the generally hostile reaction of parents and students.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60ba8051-7389-4f3f-8bd0-0b488a5d4373": {"__data__": {"id_": "60ba8051-7389-4f3f-8bd0-0b488a5d4373", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71961c4a34b0db1f87a77a66bd2d0e2468137d6e02fe6f66240061dbd86edad4"}, "2": {"node_id": "6364b6f9-6143-4a55-8547-b0f0eb3184a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1707fe54a755593053d562331882bc4695cf18c7c45a06375f9f4a7ae2a02dd"}}, "hash": "d9ce37f25ab42103319dadcfebdced6263fe085ee5517aa83421a274051984e9", "text": "None of these reasons provide a convincing justification for discrimination, particularly given advances in HIV treatment and the lack of evidence of workplace infection risk.

Beijing. 89 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa CHINA UNAIDS issued a statement in 2012 noting with concern the existence of provincial and local regulations requiring mandatory HIV testing for employees in certain industries and requirements for HIV pre-marital HIV testing. These regulations include the \u201cHunan Province Regulations on Implementation of \u201cAIDS Prevention Regulations\u201d and \u201cYili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture Provisions on HIV Prevention and Control\u201d. The UNAIDS statement called for removal of such mandatory provisions: The inclusion of HIV testing in recruitment processes and as a condition of continued employment has no proven public health benefit since HIV cannot be transmitted through the casual contact in a working environment. As well as denying people living with HIV the right to employment, the inclusion of such provisions is likely to prove counter-productive to public health goals by further stigmatizing HIV and preventing those most at risk from accessing HIV testing and other prevention, treatment, care and support services\u2026 UNAIDS urges relevant government departments to reconsider policy stipulations requiring employees to demonstrate HIV negative status as a precondition for recruitment or continued employment, including those stipulations contained in China\u2019s Standardized Health Check Requirements for Civil Service Recruitment.210 4.5.3 The role of NGOs in HIV responses is not fully recognized Rong Tang argued (in his 2008 report) that the AIDS Regulations neglect the role of NGOs in HIV prevention and control: Article 6 of the Regulations stipulates that, \u201c[t]he government encourages and supports the Labor Union, the Communist Youth League, Women\u2019s Federations and the Red Cross and other groups to assist the government at all levels to implement work in HIV prevention and control.\u201d Although the Regulations recognize the role of social groups in HIV prevention and control, the relevant social groups mentioned include only the Labor Union, the Women\u2019s Federation and the Communist Youth League as organizations with official status. The roles that a large number of NGOs (both national and international) have played in the response to the HIV epidemic are neglected. However, these roles cannot be fulfilled by the government.211 The State Council Notice on Further Strengthening the HIV/AIDS Response (2010) provides further detail on civil society roles as follows: Mobilize social participation in HIV/AIDS response. People\u2019s organizations (e.g., trade union, youth league, women\u2019s federation, Red Cross and association of industry and commerce), social groups, foundations, people-run non-enterprise units and grassroots organizations (e.g., residents\u2019 committees and villagers\u2019 committees) shall be fully mobilized to participate in HIV/AIDS response.

Media reports in 2012 highlighted restrictions on access to treatment as a result of lack of enforcement of the AIDS Regulations.213 Access of PLHIV to hospital services for non-HIV related care After a case came to media attention in 2012 of a PLHIV who was refused cancer treatment by a cancer hospital in Tianjin, the Ministry of Health issued a circular directing health authorities at all levels to take substantial measures to guarantee equal rights to medical treatment for PLHIV.214 In 2010, China Alliance of People Living with HIV/AIDS (CAP+) collected 38 case studies of refusal of surgical operations on PLHIV. The study also found that mandatory pre- operative HIV testing is a widespread practice. The study found cases at different levels of the health system across the country, including large general hospitals and privately run hospitals. Refusal of surgical services was found to be pervasive across a range of operations including complicated and simple surgical procedures. In the Chinese health system, PLHIV have historically been treated at HIV/AIDS designated hospitals, which are not equipped for conventional surgical operations. The study found that the existence of designated HIV hospitals has been used an excuse for other hospitals not to provide general medical services to PLHIV. CAP+ noted the lack of adequate complaint handling processes: 212 Speech by UNAIDS China Officer-in-Charge, Ms. Nana Kuo, at opening ceremony of Fourth Red Ribbon Beijing Forum Meeting, 12 December 2012. 213 Wang Ruoyao, Cheng Qun (2012), Protests mount over free AIDS clinics\u2019 closure, Xinhua, 6 June 2012. 214 Ban on HIV discrimination, CNC World, 24 November 2012. 91 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa CHINA According to China\u2019s laws and regulations, the public health administrative departments shall receive the complaints regarding medical services within their jurisdictions; in real situation, however, the local public health administrations rarely set up effective platforms (telephone hotline, Internet, affairs handling hall, etc.) for the patients to seek assistance. As a result, it is very difficult for the patients to seek assistance on their own. Some areas have announced the channels available for raising complaint regarding medical services, but most of the channels only exist in name and the rest cannot ensure smooth complaint filing. In addition, the poor access to surgical operations is generally not due to limited physical conditions such as technologies and resources conditions, but mostly due to the attitudes of personnel at the health facilities. Therefore, to establish smooth channels for filing complaints, the key is to change the people\u2019s attitudes. Moreover, complaints are the last resort for PLWHA when they are in critical conditions or the disease allows no more delay, while the absence of standard procedures for complaint filing and failure to handle the complaints timely often lead to huge losses to the patients. Therefore, we propose to establish a platform for supervision and complaint to address the lawful complaints of the patients and avoid preventable losses. CAP+ made the following recommendations to government: Recommendation 1 It is recommended that State Council AIDS Working Committee Office or the Ministry of Health immediately carry out law enforcement inspection and supervision on the implementation of Article 41 of the Regulations on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, and make extensive publicity through the media. Such campaign shall be designed to address the behaviors of the evasiveness and refusal of health facilities to give surgical operations on PLWHA\u2026 Recommendation 2 It is recommended that the Ministry of Health formulate relevant supporting regulations and protocols and establish long-acting mechanism to ensure and promote the implementation of Article 41 of the Regulations (including establishing a platform for supervision and complaint, provide for the timeline of case handling, investigation and evidence collection, hearing and notification, etc) \u2026 Recommendation 3 It is recommended that local health administrations cancel the designation of \u201cHIV/AIDS designated hospitals\u201d of all types and incorporate HIV/AIDS treatment into conventional health care systems.

The private settlement of social conflict has similarly affected China\u2019s administrative response to grievances related to HIV/AIDS. In 2003, China\u2019s central government sought to address HIV/AIDS carriers\u2019 needs with its Four Free and One Care (simian yiguanhuai) policy, which guarantees access to medical treatment, including anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for rural citizens and those with low incomes... State officials use the policy to stave off litigation, arguing that the state has addressed HIV/AIDS carriers\u2019 needs with the policy. Therefore, litigation is not necessary for HIV/AIDS carriers. One attorney and legal scholar recalled his experience in trying to file cases on behalf of HIV/AIDS carriers and hemophiliacs, \u201cThe courts can say there is already the Four Frees, One Care policy that gives you free medicine, so you don\u2019t really need anything and we won\u2019t take the case.\u201d Judges avoid openly using such an excuse for refusing to hear cases, but the policy and political pressure from health bureaus and local governments combine to discourage judges from accepting filings by HIV/AIDS carriers\u2026. A significant stumbling block to the pursuit of potential anti-discrimination cases brought by HIV/AIDS carriers is the underdeveloped nature of Chinese law. China lacks an anti-discrimination law, and the general legal expressions banning discrimination against HIV/AIDS carriers lack implementing instructions. Chinese courts are not bound to follow judgments in analogous cases, but courts tend to follow precedents. Without model verdicts in HIV/AIDS discrimination cases to emulate or clear implementation guidelines, the courts are reluctant to hear cases involving HIV/AIDS carriers\u2019 claims. A Chinese attorney trained in AIDS law and who has worked on anti-discrimination cases complained about the anti-discrimination clause in China\u2019s AIDS Prevention Law, Discrimination is not defined. It says that people should not discriminate against each other in three ways [employment, access to healthcare, and access to education]. It is written beautifully, but it does not stipulate what you are to do if someone discriminates against an HIV or AIDS carrier\u2026With regard to what should be done about discrimination, it just says, \u201chospitals should not discriminate.\u201d ...We think that it is great that the anti-discrimination clause is there, but we would like to have something that clarified assuming responsibility by persons (: Officer of HIV/AIDS INGO (2008-12), interview by author, Beijing (17 January 2008)). The vagueness of China\u2019s laws and the contradictory statements in laws and regulations impede judges from converting general anti-discrimination principles into awards for HIV/AIDS carriers who encounter discrimination. Moreover, Chinese courts are still heavily influenced by political considerations, so judges are reluctant to render verdicts that they fear will be overturned or that will have repercussions for 93 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa CHINA their pay or their careers. Local officials can exercise sway over lower courts because they (rather than Ministry of Justice) evaluate and pay the salaries of judges.215 Confidentiality is also a concern: An attorney noted that a plaintiff who pursues litigation could request a closed hearing, but the plaintiff must enter a true name (rather than a pseudonym) in court documents, and court documents would include the true name of the plaintiff. When such documents are put into circulation, they effectively reveal the identity of the HIV/AIDS carrier-plaintiff, a problem that the courts have begun to resolve in three recent cases involving alleged discrimination described below. Although Chinese courts have developed procedures to protect the privacy of HIV/AIDS carriers in court proceedings, some infected people have had their cases revealed to the public, which has brought further discrimination. Rather than risk the exposure that a trial might bring, HIV/AIDS carriers who face discrimination typically turn to alternative dispute resolution (ADR) to seek settlement of their grievances. Additionally, the numerous obstacles to litigating HIV/AIDS-related cases encourage most would-be plaintiffs toward ADR, which has a greater chance of gaining compensation for HIV/AIDS carriers than litigation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fbf9bc8-0deb-4529-bef6-c2f65ff1eef7": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fbf9bc8-0deb-4529-bef6-c2f65ff1eef7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0467bd45d4e22ce0233ca1c71e420fea4f65d228b364a2187637b294e6775505"}, "2": {"node_id": "5023b130-6bfe-431b-941b-64af92891c05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9d21cf3ba7cc5886c0c6ad61e9ecbc5dba14581b910ec46ba0e7497957c724c"}}, "hash": "683f7189bc672064fa6e773a4d4f411eee52e87e32d704fa9abbbd18c773091b", "text": "A Shanghai lawyer who advocates for HIV/AIDS carriers and the gay community argued that ADR was more useful than litigation in handling employment discrimination for the following reason: \u201cIf we don\u2019t go to courts and use non-litigious means, using ADR or petitions, then the government or work unit can make plans, or a hospital or unit can arrange, with an individual to resolve the problem.

They are worried that their identities will be revealed during the litigation or negotiation procedure, which may result in discrimination or other adverse consequences.

There are number of legal aid centres, private law firms and legal academics who have developed expertise in HIV related law, although the coverage of these services remains limited. In separate reviews, UNAIDS China office (2011)218 and Peking University (2010)219 have documented the range of HIV-related legal services provided in China. NGOs active in provision of HIV related legal representation, advice and education include the Yunnan Daytop Drug Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre, Beijing Yirenping Center, and the Dongjen Centre for Human Rights Education. A workshop of legal service providers held in 2011 reported the following conclusions about HIV-related legal service provision in China: Legal aid centres provide training and education to PLHIV, men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers (SW), people who inject drugs (IDU), NGO activists, students and lawyers across China. This is encouraging, but there is still room for improvement in the following areas: \u2022\ufffd Target groups: key providers of public services (e.g., healthcare workers, police, teachers, judges, government officials) are not being reached. This is a concern, since these groups wield considerable social influence. \u2022\ufffd Regional coverage: although HIV training is available to lawyers from the whole of China, coverage of other groups is patchy. One legal aid centre has succeeded in training local police (in Yunnan), but this has not been repeated elsewhere.

Legal aid centres and lawyers provide legal counselling, mediation and litigation services to clients from across the country. Moreover, they have succeeded in covering all the major groups. These achievements deserve to be recognized, however, there are still numerous weaknesses that need to be overcome, the most serious of which is that the majority of resources are still being directed to relatively high-profile regions, populations and issues at the expense of the most marginalized... 218 UNAIDS (2011), Strengthening the Response of Legal Service Providers to HIV/AIDS: Workshop report, Yunnan Kunming Hotel, 15-16 September 2011, UNAIDS. 219 Labor Law and Social Security Law Institute at Peking University Law School (2010), Mapping Initiatives to Strengthen the Legal Environment for the Response to HIV in China, Rome: IDLO.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3827db59-61aa-4cbf-ac17-cdc51e67f5a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "3827db59-61aa-4cbf-ac17-cdc51e67f5a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8a19a1bcff6bdaca19824d7d354dd9ec191c7b15af77551a3e2dde005d3e5d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "95ef5600-178e-46bd-a764-210208e0eb99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "908a061b734d4a35aaf16d5731c52d457b9886acac4da53a53158dbec8bcd1c8"}}, "hash": "944f9d098ea302dc72f1a6bd03be97c203f2e80af5c20a3bbd559af2f8d77f95", "text": "95 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa CHINA \u2022\ufffd Service efficiency: legal aid centres show varying degrees of efficiency in handling HIV/AIDS enquiries, with some reporting 100 cases per year, and others less than 20.

For example, the Dongjen Centre for Human Rights Education\u2019s Korekata AIDS Law Center provided legal counselling in 43 cases in 2011, and represented clients in three cases involving litigation.221 In 2008, the Beijing Aizhixing Institute acted in three disputes involving HIV infection via blood transfusion, two cases concerning children orphaned by AIDS, and 15 cases related to PLHIV rights.222 In its first year of operation, the Yunnan University Legal Aid Center, which specialized in HIV-related advice, had 131 client contacts (2009-2010). However, the focus of the service was legal counselling and few cases proceeded to court. The Yunnan Daytop Drug Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre provided legal services to 224 clients by June 2012, most of whom were PLHIV, people who use drugs, or MSM.223 4.7 Lessons from Hong Kong SAR224 Hong Kong\u2019s Disability Discrimination Ordinance includes an explicit statement that persons who are HIV-positive or have AIDS are protected by the Ordinance.225 PLHIV, their families and associates are protected against discrimination, harassment or vilification 220 UNAIDS (2011), Strengthening the Response of Legal Service Providers to HIV/AIDS, Yunnan Kunming Hotel 15- 16 September 2011, Workshop Report. 221 Dongjen Centre for Human Rights Education and Action Annual Report 2011. 222 Labor Law and Social Security Law Institute at Peking University Law School (2010), Mapping Initiatives to Strengthen the Legal Environment for the Response to HIV in China, Rome: IDLO, p.22. 223 UNDP praises HIV legal service in SW China, English.news.cn, 13 December 2012. 224 Lessons may also be learned from Taiwan (Province of China). Taiwan\u2019s HIV Infection Control and Patient Rights Protection Act (2007) provides, Article 4: The dignity and the legal rights of the infected shall be protected and respected; there shall be no discrimination, no denial of education, medical care, employment, nursing home, housing or any other unfair treatment; regulations governing the protection of their relevant rights shall be formulated by the central competent authority in consultation with various central competent enterprise authorities. 225 Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Disability Discrimination Ordinance, No. 86 of Hong Kong Government, (Cap 487) Section 61(2). 96 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations in the areas of employment, education, services and facilities, and clubs and sporting activities. The Disability Discrimination Ordinance provides an aggrieved individual with the right to lodge a complaint with the Hong Kong Equal Opportunity Commission (HKEOC) and the courts. The HKEOC can conciliate complaints and has the power to support court actions, to commence litigation in its own name, to intervene in court proceedings and to institute its own investigations and inquiries into systemic inequality and discrimination on the ground of disability. In addition to protections offered by the Disability Discrimination Ordinance, the Personal Data Privacy Ordinance provides rights to privacy. The application of the Disability Discrimination Ordinance to resolve a HIV-related dispute was demonstrated by the Richland Gardens case. Legal action was taken by PLHIV against three residents of a housing estate (Richland Gardens) who protested against the location of an HIV treatment centre. Patients and the Health Centre workers were harassed and vilified by a group of Richland Gardens\u2019 residents. It was claimed that the defendants obstructed staff of Kowloon Bay Health Centre, which provided a HIV treatment service. Several attempts at conciliation failed. The HKEOC settled the case after obtaining written apologies from the defendants.226 4.8 Conclusion The AIDS Regulations represent an important milestone in China\u2019s HIV response, and have a strong focus on rights to non-discrimination, to health care and confidentiality.

A strength of China\u2019s legal system in handling HIV-related complaints is the availability of negotiated settlements and well-established ADR processes as an alternative to the formal court system. In the absence of a strong national HIV law, PLHIV need to look to other laws for protection. However, there are very limited remedies available from employment law or public health law, and constitutional guarantees of human rights are generally not enforceable by individuals in the courts. The Employment Promotion Law has been useful to challenge discrimination related to HBV (in relation to which more detailed regulations 226 Richland Gardens - Case Settled out of Court. EOC Newsletter, March 2002 Issue No. 21. 97 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa CHINA have been issued), and may also be useful in HIV cases as indicated by the successful settlement of Xiao Qi\u2019s case. The Tort Liability Law of 2010 offers an untested alternative for PLHIV seeking a civil legal remedy for violation of rights to privacy and health care. Advocacy regarding the need to strengthen anti-discrimination laws given the unsuccessful employment cases led to a breakthrough on World AIDS Day 2011, when Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao emphasized the importance of eliminating discrimination in laws and policies.227 In 2012, incoming Premier Li Keqiang criticized discriminatory practices of health facilities that refused to treat PLHIV.228 This will increase pressure on government to rectify the legislative situation, and may encourage the courts to accept more claims of discrimination for consideration when they arise.229 The central government has repeatedly stated a commitment to elimination of HIV-related discrimination, and in its 2012 report to UNAIDS, the Government of China reported the following action in relation to human rights: \u2022\ufffd research has been organized to identify and remove clauses of laws and policies which may contain discriminatory content; \u2022\ufffd steps to eliminate discrimination in healthcare settings have been incorporated into the annual work plan; \u2022\ufffd content regarding AIDS response services, domestic violence and protection of vulnerable communities has been incorporated into the National Human Rights Action Plan.230 The impact of the protective provisions of the AIDS Regulations has been limited due to the administrative nature of the regulations, which are of lesser priority than the laws defining standards relating to employment of public servants, and the anti-prostitution and anti-drug laws. The impact of the AIDS Regulations has also been limited by the lack of detail as to the remedies available for violations of rights and enforcement mechanisms. China\u2019s legal system is evolving and there have been some modest developments in legal redress for health consumers, as evidenced by successes in use of the courts by people with HBV seeking redress for discrimination.231 The growing number of lawyers and NGOs that offer assistance to address HIV-related legal issues and efforts to develop a national network of lawyers with an interest in HIV are important developments that may help improve access to justice and advocacy for stronger legal protections. 227 Wen Jiabao meets HIV/AIDS patients, urges less discrimination, Want China Times, 20 December 2011. 228 UNAIDS (2013), Media release: Addressing HIV-related discrimination in health care settings: a key part of the response, 4 April 2013, Beijing: UNAIDS China. 229 See: Howard R., Wu R., Chang K., Hsu L.

A Committee of the National Assembly with the support of the Ministry of Health\u2019s Centre for HIV/AIDS and STIs (CHAS) led the consultation process in 2009-2010. Consultations were held with relevant ministries, state agencies, mass organizations and local administrations. Technical assistance to the consultation process was provided by the UN Joint Programme of Support to an Effective Lao National Assembly (SELNA), which is a programme implemented by the National Assembly with the support of the United Nations. An Opinion Paper was developed by SELNA and the Joint UN Team on AIDS to provide recommendations relating to the draft HIV/AIDS Law for the National Assembly Committees on Social / Cultural Affairs and Law.232 Consideration was given to legislative best practice in Asian countries, and international standards set in international conventions and treaties ratified by Lao PDR. UNAIDS also provided recommendations on provisions to be included in the legislation. A working team harmonized proposed amendments to assist the finalization process. This process resulted in amendments to 232 Support to an Effective Lao National Assembly (SELNA) (2010), Opinion paper and analysis of the draft project on a law on HIV/AIDS in the Lao PDR.

The target population of the study was PLHIV who access ARV treatment centres. The survey found that only 22 percent of 305 PLHIV interviewed had heard of the HIV/ AIDS Law. Only 21 percent of respondents believed that government policies could effectively protect their rights. PLHIV in the south had lowest level of knowledge regarding declarations, laws, and policies that deal with the protection of rights of PLHIV. The study found that, independent of region, knowledge of supportive non- discrimination policies is associated with 39 percent lower incidence of stigma. It also showed that geographical region is a highly significant predictor of the incidence of social stigma events, with the south experiencing about 97 percent more social stigma events than the central region. Other key findings of the Stigma Index survey included: \u2022\ufffd The main forms of stigma and discrimination reported by PLHIV were being gossiped about (23 percent of sample), being forced to change their place of residence (4 percent), and being verbally insulted (11 percent). \u2022\ufffd 8 percent of respondents reported losing their job or income because of their HIV status (4 percent because of co-worker discrimination, 4 percent because of poor health, and 10 percent because of a combination of both or another reason). PLHIV prefer not to be disclosed in the workplace because they worry about losing their job, losing respect or loyalty from people, receiving bad reactions, behaviors, or discrimination from the people around them. 233 Lao Red Cross, Lao Network of People living with HIV, French Red Cross (2012), The People Living with HIV Stigma Index, Results from 3 provinces in Lao P.D.R.: Luangprabang, Vientiane Capital and Champasack, 18th May 2012 (Unpublished Draft). 103 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa LAO PDR \u2022\ufffd 2 percent of respondents had been dismissed, suspended or prevented from attending an educational institution because of their HIV status and an additional 2 percent of those who have children had their child face similar discrimination events in school. \u2022\ufffd Less than half (43 percent) of PLHIV are aware of an organization where they can seek help if they experience stigma and discrimination. \u2022\ufffd Disclosure of HIV status by healthcare professionals is reported. 11 percent of disclosures to social workers or counselors happened without consent, 30 percent of those disclosed to community leaders were disclosed without consent, and 5 percent of disclosures to family members occurred without the respondent\u2019s consent. Disclosing a person\u2019s HIV status without his consent, is a violation of the rights of PLHIV that is unfortunately highly prevalent in Lao PDR, even in the health sector \u2022\ufffd The proportion of people that fear discrimination is higher than the percent of people that actually suffer discrimination, indicating that they are aware that these events have occurred to other PLHIV. \u2022\ufffd PLHIV reported higher incidences of stigma if they were in the younger age group (16-29), were an ethnic minority, had a low level of education, were sexually active, were migrant workers, had a poor health status, and were not taking their medications. Implementation of the HIV/AIDS Law As yet, there are no reports of the human rights provisions of the HIV/AIDS Law being actively enforced to protect PLHIV from violations. The Government has indicated the intent to develop further regulations to provide more detailed directions regarding implementation and enforcement. Implementing regulations are required to support enforcement of the HIV/AIDS Law. The Global AIDS Response Progress Country Report, Lao PDR 2012 states that action in the period 2012-2015 will include support to implementation: Policy and legal environment: Enhance the new HIV Law enforcement, including dissemination of the law and development of the under law decree for implementation; improving the registration process for national associations, especially a legal aid system to support HIV casework. \u2026The section of the Decree relating to enforcement of the law and which will stipulate how the law should be implemented is still under consideration.234 Some provisions of the HIV/AIDS Law relating to HIV transmission are punitive in nature, and have given rise to concerns that enforcement may be harmful to public health and the human rights of PLHIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba1eb653-e7ec-485f-bac8-714dbb3f6be7": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba1eb653-e7ec-485f-bac8-714dbb3f6be7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8532ee6c37fb848af53097f7eb599af97917632c37129ae416b9eb46d5818aee"}, "2": {"node_id": "3edc7933-a181-41ec-911b-2df58d50e5b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd11a5d3df4b5fe178afc159ccc6de8a8f97f94a7ef7bc1b6730c16554e837c6"}}, "hash": "6e5fc4c9f032a912c9f175b74afa2bfaa9cfd8b1aa706231b6990ee765719a7f", "text": "The Global AIDS Response Progress Country Report, Lao PDR 2012 states that the international community is concerned about the clause in Article 234 Center for HIV/AIDS/STIs (CHAS) (2012), Global AIDS Response Progress Country Report, Lao PDR 2012, CHAS & UNAIDS, p.18. 104 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations 52 that prohibits individuals from engaging in risky behaviour influencing the spread of HIV.235An approach that emphasizes mutual responsibility for risk reduction of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d035af7-ae7a-4946-acdc-f45fc823449f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d035af7-ae7a-4946-acdc-f45fc823449f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58f80077d763047f5c1d4b22f58f040b658fa44cddf839ea4e51d624bfaa4ec3"}}, "hash": "58f80077d763047f5c1d4b22f58f040b658fa44cddf839ea4e51d624bfaa4ec3", "text": "both partners in sexual relationships may be more effective than imposing legal responsibility on PLHIV. The SELNA Opinion Paper, which argued against inclusion of a prohibition on PLHIV infecting others, stated as follows: Criminalizing HIV transmission is likely to damage proven HIV prevention efforts by making people fearful to get tested or disclose their status, and undermine the message that all people must take steps to protect themselves from HIV transmission rather than rely on the knowledge of status and disclosure of their sexual partner. The criminalisation of HIV transmission does not serve a public health or HIV prevention function. There may be rare circumstances of intentional, wilful HIV transmission where criminal prosecution may be indicated in the interest of retribution or justice. However, this is best carried out through general criminal law provisions. UNAIDS asks governments to limit criminalization of HIV transmission to the intentional transmission of HIV, that is, where someone engaged in acts with the deliberate purpose of transmitting HIV and did indeed transmit the virus. Following these concerns, some jurisdictions have recently passed HIV laws without any provisions criminalising HIV transmission and/or exposure. The International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights state: \u201clegislation should not include specific offences against the deliberate and intentional transmission of HIV but rather should apply general criminal offences to these exceptional cases.\u201d236 Access to justice Lack of access to legal services and the formal court system limits the extent to which the HIV/AIDS Law provides meaningful redress to individuals who experience HIV-related rights violations. There is limited access to the formal court system in Lao PDR. Most people use customary or semi-formal justice systems (e.g., Village Mediation Units) to resolve disputes rather than the courts.237 Other protective laws relevant to HIV vulnerability of women and children Protective legislation relevant to populations at risk of HIV include the Law on Development and Protection of Women (2004), and the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Children (2007). The Law on Development and Protection of Women advances gender equality and addresses gender-based violence and discrimination against women. A Decree was issued in 2006 to make the Law on Women\u2019s Development and Protection fully enforceable. The violence protection provisions of the Law on Development and Protection of Women are limited in that they only cover violence in matrimonial relationships and exclude violence occurring against women in other relationships.238 235 Article 52 prohibits PLHIV from engaging in risky behaviour influencing the spread of HIV infection. 236 OHCHR and UNAIDS (2006), op cit. 237 UN and National Assembly of Lao PDR (2011), Concept Note: GBV Legal Review Assessment, Towards a Comprehensive Anti-GBV Legislation in Lao PDR. 238 Ibid., p.13. 105 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa LAO PDR It has been noted that anti-trafficking measures introduced by Lao PDR targeted at preventing trafficking of children into exploitative situations assist in reducing HIV vulnerability, given that trafficked children risk exposure to HIV.239 The 2006 Decree promulgating the Law on Women\u2019s Development and Protection established severe penalties for human trafficking as a criminal act and provides survivors comprehensive rights including safety, privacy and medical assistance. A UNICEF report describes the link between involvement of young women in sex work, violence and HIV: Many girls involved in sex work come from poor rural areas, have dropped out of school and arrive in urbanized centres in the hope of securing employment. Unable to find work they often turn to commercial sex largely driven by clients that are classified as businessmen, professionals and immigrant workers within the Lao PDR. Their experiences are often violent. Forced sex, sexual coercion and sexual exploitation are experienced by girls engaged in high risk sexual behaviour. Female sex workers report that clients will pay more for unprotected sex and older male clients leverage more power through coercion, threats not to pay if sex is with a condom, or providing misinformation about HIV.240 There is a need therefore to ensure that sex workers are able to access legal protections from violence and exploitation, without fear of arrest or police harassment. 5.4 Conclusion The HIV/AIDS Law addresses public health and human rights aspects of the epidemic, and represents a significant advance for Lao PDR in positioning the national HIV response within a human rights-based framework. The findings of the Stigma Index study confirm that HIV-related stigma and discrimination persist at significant levels.

The 1993 Law was updated in 2004 and further revised in 2012. The main provision of the 2004 Law on Protection of the Rights of PLHIV is Article 10, which provides: \u2022\ufffd The rights and freedoms of a person with HIV or AIDS shall not be restricted on a basis of the presence of his/her disease, unless otherwise stipulated by law. \u2022\ufffd Any form of insult or discrimination against a person with HIV or AIDS shall be prohibited. \u2022\ufffd An official or citizen shall be prohibited to divulge information on people with HIV or AIDS. The penalty for breach of Article 10 is a fine of 20,000-50,000 MNT (Mongolian Tugrik) (in the case of an individual), 40,000-60,000 MNT (in the case of an official), or 200,000- 250,000 MNT (in the case of a business entity or organization). Article 2 provides that if the Law is inconsistent with any international treaty to which Mongolia is a party, then the provisions of the international treaty shall prevail. Article 6 defines the powers of state bodies and local self-administrative bodies in the prevention of HIV.

Article 11 also requires that a person diagnosed with HIV must immediately inform his wife or her husband, or a partner on the disease. Penalty for a breach of Article 11 is a fine 20,000-50,000 MNT. Article 7 provides that a person infected with HIV/AIDS shall be treated in isolation if he or she cannot fulfill the duties set forth in this Law based upon his or her inability or unwillingness to control his or her behaviour. Article 11 provides that: \u2022\ufffd a citizen of Mongolia who has lived abroad and has been infected with HIV/AIDS shall inform the state board organization responsible for hygiene and epidemiological control about his or her condition upon arrival in Mongolia. \u2022\ufffd a foreign citizen who is determined to have been infected with HIV/AIDS shall face deportation in accordance with appropriate legislation if he or she refuses to meet the legal requirements of a health organization of Mongolia. Article 12 provides that mass media, religious and non-governmental organizations and business entities shall participate in HIV/AIDS awareness activities and training. To ensure the HIV Law operates as intended, changes have been made to other laws. For example, in 2011 the Law on Health was amended as it stated that citizens have responsibilities to be involved in disease diagnosis. This article conflicted with an article in the HIV law stating that HIV testing should be on a voluntary basis. 2012 law reforms In 2009, a working group of five parliamentarians and a technical working group were convened to revise and update the law on HIV. UNAIDS participated in the technical working group. An early version of the draft law was subject to revisions as a result of extensive consultations. A Revised Draft Law was prepared for submission to parliament in 2012. The Revised Draft Law excluded certain provisions of the 2004 law that were considered problematic from a human rights perspective and included strengthened 109 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa MONGOLIA protections of human rights of PLHIV, particularly in relation to non-discrimination, confidentiality and consent to testing.242 As a result, law reforms were passed by Parliament in 2012 that removed all travel restrictions and some other discriminatory provisions for PLHIV. The Law on Prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome of 2012 removed all HIV-related restrictions on entry, stay and residence, and employment restrictions that prevented people living with HIV from undertaking certain jobs, including in the food industry. The new law also requires the creation of a multi-sectorial body comprised of government, civil society and private sector representatives to guide the national response. Changes that were supported included: 1. The removal of : \u2022\ufffd the power of government to define the jobs and services that are restricted for people living with HIV; \u2022\ufffd the obligation on PLHIV to immediately disclose their HIV status to their partner, wife or husband upon learning of it; \u2022\ufffd the provision allowing isolation of PLHIV who fail to fulfill legal obligations; \u2022\ufffd the provision allowing for the deportation of foreign nationals living with HIV. 2. The introduction of: \u2022\ufffd a new section devoted to the powers and role of non-health sectors, private sector and non-governmental organizations in HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, including for people at risk of HIV infection. \u2022\ufffd a provision on the national coordination structure with a multi-sectoral mandate (National Committee on AIDS) and; \u2022\ufffd provisions on protecting of rights and privacy of PLHIV and as well as elimination of stigma and discrimination due to HIV/AIDS (no compulsory testing, provision for equal employment opportunity).243 2010 NGO Recommendations to the Universal Periodic Review The following submission by the National AIDS Foundation and other NGOs was made to the UN Human Rights Council\u2019s Universal Periodic Review of Mongolia:244 242 National Committee on HIV and AIDS (2012), Country AIDS Response Progress Report 2012, Government of Mongolia, p.16. 243 Email correspondence from Altanchimeg Delegchoimbol (UNAIDS), 7 December 2012. 244 Mongolian Minorities\u2019 Report \u2013 Ninth Round of the Universal Periodic Review (2010).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1071a0a3-5e38-48ae-9170-8cc7bc01715a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1071a0a3-5e38-48ae-9170-8cc7bc01715a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a7f311e480e46f163260a5d0168776c45e658f7973c855a552414a1ce4a6d4b"}, "2": {"node_id": "6fadb8f8-3b7c-46aa-9b62-53053a3a068b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4aae61fe7c0c20a50c34c0bf4ca3775e035da8d2320ad0365c46f1c34212cc5"}}, "hash": "f915f06cb8c1b980fc4b8b890780a02c321f4a0780a689c30cccd7a048c488b9", "text": "110 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations Discrimination and human rights violations against PLWHIV: PLWHIV are subject to discrimination and a range of human rights", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "179aa3aa-7b7d-4feb-8155-5f49a590399b": {"__data__": {"id_": "179aa3aa-7b7d-4feb-8155-5f49a590399b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a8a2ee8a132cc4f66286e53dfcd63347b9de02e76ea6847319c16c596e5b3ca"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ce3f656-24e9-4027-b3ef-5b7d123e2513", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df99b8b8b1d73a00942e8154246b201ae342e6bdaed0fc6cee515980520e70df"}}, "hash": "633bf217a7382b59ecf1a7a5b15dcf71bdc7db4d9aba1620dca55cf8d71cc570", "text": "violations.

The Mongolian National Strategic Plan on HIV, AIDS and STI 2010-2015 includes commitments to a human rights based response. For example, one of its guiding principles is: 4.2.3 Promoting human rights \u2013 The Mongolian national response to HIV and AIDS and STIs builds on the fundamental human rights of all Mongolian citizens, including the freedom from: discrimination on account of race, sex and gender roles; the right to health; the right to participation; and the right to information. Protection of 111 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa MONGOLIA these human rights is particularly important in the context of HIV and AIDS, which disproportionately affects marginalized population groups such as people living with HIV, MSM, SWs (sex workers) and IDUs (injecting drug users), who often face stigma, discrimination, social exclusion and denial of their human rights. In this context, a human-rights-based approach emphasizes the legal obligations of the state in realizing the rights of all its citizens \u2013 including the right to health \u2013 as well as the importance of empowerment and active involvement of communities and individuals infected or affected by HIV and AIDS. The Strategic Plan further states: Legislation needs to protect the basic human rights of people living with HIV in terms of their health, labor and other human rights, and the human rights of sexual minorities. The Strategic Plan states that the following activities will be carried out: \u2022\ufffd Assessment of stigma, discrimination and human rights violations as part of a broader needs assessment of most at risk populations. \u2022\ufffd Preparation of legal amendments to strengthen the human rights position of most at risk populations. \u2022\ufffd Development of a training programme on human rights issues, to empower most at risk populations through increased knowledge and skills for self protection of their human rights. \u2022\ufffd Advocacy among policy makers and legislators to support the creation of a more supportive legal environment. \u2022\ufffd Health care workers, law enforcement staff and media workers will be sensitized on the importance of HIV prevention services among most at risk populations. According to the 2012 UNGASS Progress Report, NGOs rated the government\u2019s HIV- related human rights policies at 7 out of 10, but rated enforcement of the policies at 3 out of 10: \u2026enforcement of human rights policies has progressed very slowly and rates very lowly at three out of ten.

Citizens of Mongolia, either individually or in a group, have the right to lodge complaints to the National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia, for violations of human rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution, laws and international treaties. The Labor Law prohibits discrimination in employment and education against persons with disabilities. However, there are no reports of legal actions to enforce HIV-related rights under these general laws. In 2007, the Government of Mongolia published a Tripartite Declaration on HIV/AIDS Prevention in the World of Work. The Declaration commits government, employers and trade unions to adhere to the principles stated in the ILO Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work. The Declaration states that the response to HIV in the workplace should include actions in the following areas: \u2022\ufffd Develop an HIV prevention policy at the workplace; \u2022\ufffd Establish an HIV/AIDS prevention committee; \u2022\ufffd Organize training on HIV prevention; \u2022\ufffd Encourage and support efforts to combat stigma and discrimination against workers living with the HIV; \u2022\ufffd Promote care and support of workers living with HIV and AIDS; \u2022\ufffd Maintain workers\u2019 privacy regarding their HIV status; \u2022\ufffd Carry out the risk assessment to establish healthy and safe workplace and develop and implement risk decreasing activity; \u2022\ufffd Eliminate HIV testing as a prerequisite for employment or as an excuse for terminating employment, and to replace such unacceptable practices with the offer of voluntary confidential counseling and testing. 6.4 Conclusion The Government of Mongolia has established a strong human rights policy framework for the national HIV response by updating the 2004 HIV Law to bring it into line with policy developments. HIV prevalence is low in Mongolia, with a cumulative total of only 120 reported diagnoses by June 2012. There are no specialist legal services focusing on HIV-related rights. Although there are reportedly very high levels of stigma and discrimination, there are no reports of PLHIV using legal mechanisms to protect their human rights. 113 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa MONGOLIA The lack of use of the law to protect HIV-related rights may reflect low levels of access to and trust in the formal legal system, and concerns of PLHIV that disclosure of identity in the course of legal proceedings will result in stigma and discrimination. Considerations of cost and limited access to legal aid impede access to the formal justice system, not just for PLHIV but for most Mongolian citizens. Although recent efforts have been made to establish a network of legal aid centres, most legal services are concentrated in major cities and lawyers rarely practice in rural areas and in the new urban settlements.246 In 2012 training for lawyers on HIV/AIDS and the law was organized by the National Legal Institute of Mongolia with support from UNDP Mongolia. Lawyers who attended the training included lawyers in private practice and representatives of Legal Aid Centres located in border provinces and the capital. This was the first training for lawyers on HIV/ AIDS to be held in Mongolia. Lawyers at the meeting examined the Law on HIV/AIDS to identify provisions that breach human rights. This provided a chance to review whether the new Revised Draft Law on HIV/AIDS of 2011 addressed all concerns.247 246 UNDP Mongolia, Access to justice and human rights. http://www.undp.mn/a2jhr.html 247 UNDP Mongolia (2012), Mongolian lawyers to contribute to reduction of HIV/AIDS related stigma and discrimination, UNDP Mongolia News, 23 June 2012. 114 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations 7.1 Overview of RA 8504 and the 2012 AIDS Bill Republic Act (RA) 8504 The Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC) has the responsibility to oversee the implementation of the Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act (RA 8504).

Discriminatory acts are punishable with a penalty of imprisonment for six months to four years, and a fine not exceeding ten thousand pesos. A prosecution for unlawful discrimination under RA 8504 requires court action to be taken by a prosecutor (fiscal) or police. Costs of a prosecution are borne by the state. In addition, the Act provides that licenses or permits of schools, hospitals and other institutions found guilty of committing discriminatory acts and policies shall be revoked.254 Acts of discrimination against an individual seeking employment, or in the course of employment, must be reported to the Department of Labor and Employment by those in the private sector and to the Civil Service Commission by those in government employment. The Department of Labor and Employment and the Civil Service Commission are required to resolve any such matters brought to their attention, including by administrative sanctions.255 Penalties are not prescribed for compulsory HIV testing, failure to obtain informed consent prior to testing, failure to provide pre and post-test counselling, or breach of confidentiality. Although no penalty is prescribed, a remedy may be available to enforce these statutory obligations through civil or administrative court proceedings. Many of the provisions of RA 8504 are implemented at local level through city AIDS ordinances, which typically call for the creation of Local AIDS Councils to serve as planning and policy making bodies for prevention and control programmes. These ordinances usually require regular STI testing of entertainment establishment workers, among other measures (but not compulsory HIV testing, as this is prohibited by RA 8504). 2012 HIV Bill Several Bills were filed in 2011-2012 intended to update RA 8504.256 The Revised Philippine HIV and AIDS Policy and Program Act of 2012257 was passed by the House of Representatives in early 2013 but stalled in the Senate.

No court proceedings have been taken to enforce rights under RA 8504.258 The UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2012-2016 argues for a strengthened legislative framework: (T)he law does not include provisions to address the needs of key populations at higher risk, and may no longer be responsive to current AIDS situation. Furthermore, a large segment of society \u2013 including personnel of key national and local agencies who are supposed to implement it \u2013 is still largely unaware of the law\u2019s existence. More so, even some of those who may be aware of the law are unsure of how to operationalize it. As a result, the law is hardly enforced. The capacities of key institutions to carry out their mandates remain weak; programmes are unfunded or under-funded, and programme implementation, monitoring and coordination has been largely at the \u201cproject\u201d level. \u2026Moreover, certain provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Act, which prohibit the distribution of clean needles and injecting equipment, and restrict the provision of information and services to people who need them are inconsistent with the AIDS Law, which promotes the right of (key populations) and people living with HIV to prevention services. Other laws are discriminatory or either applied selectively, such as anti-vagrancy ordinances, anti-loitering, anti-trafficking, or other ordinances intended to promote \u201cpublic order\u201d but which seem to specifically target female sex workers and MSM. The Stigma Index Philippines report compiled by Pinoy Plus assessed reports of rights abuses in the previous twelve months and found that 18 PLHIV of a sample of 80 had experienced rights abuses, three of whom had attempted to seek legal redress. In only one case had the matter been resolved (presumably through negotiation rather than court action). Fifty nine percent reported a past experience of forced medical and health procedures (including forced HIV testing). The report found that 85 percent of the sample of PLHIV was aware of and had read or discussed RA 8504. However, the report notes the concern: \u2026barely 28 percent had the courage to confront, challenge or educate someone who was stigmatizing and/or discriminating against them.

For example, in 2011 PNAC issued an advisory note in response to specific complaints of breach of privacy through the internet. The Advisory stated: Beginning late July 2011, PNAC Secretariat received complaints on Internet-based communications activities contrary to policies and provisions of R.A. 8504. The Secretariat confirms that individuals or groups behind these activities blatantly disregarded rights to privacy of persons perceived, suspected or living with HIV... Content producers who made publications that violated provisions of R.A. 8504 are asked to voluntarily withdraw all offending information immediately. To prevent future unlawful provision of HIV and AIDS information or services, the PNAC Secretariat also strongly recommends review of R.A.8504, specially its standards on information and education.263 A study conducted by the Remedios Foundation and University of the Philippines explored HIV discrimination in the context of health services in Manila.264 The study found that despite the existence of RA 8504, serious discrimination in the provision of health care services still occurs. This was attributed to an absence of written regulations and inadequate training among health staff. Key findings were as follows: (T)he data reveals that this is particularly problematic in the practice of private hospitals. Here, not only did the hospitals appear to have failed to integrate RA 8504 into their internal regulations, but key informants working in those hospitals appeared to be completely unaware of the legislation and their obligations under it. This highlights the fact that the establishment of the law without adequate investment in education and enforcement is insufficient to achieve real change. The failure of private health care settings to adopt appropriate internal policies conforming to RA 8504 creates serious opportunities for discrimination. 7.3 Government initiatives under RA 8504 With the passage of Republic Act 8504 in 1998, key government agencies formulated policies in support of a comprehensive response, including: \u2022\ufffd Policy Guidelines on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. \u2022\ufffd Policy and Strategies for STD/HIV/AIDS in the workplace. \u2022\ufffd Integration of HIV/AIDS education in all schools nationwide. \u2022\ufffd Guidelines on the Entry of People with HIV/AIDS to the Philippines. \u2022\ufffd Policy Guidelines on HIV/AIDS testing among children. 263 PNAC (2011), Public Advisory: PNAC cautions on unlawful HIV and AIDS information. 264 Ortega N., Bicaldo B., Sobritchea C., Tan M.

These guidelines restate the requirements of RA 8504 and IRR. A handbook developed by ILO and the Employers Confederation of the Philippines has also supported implementation of the workplace provisions of RA 8504.265 One of the key implementation challenges for agencies seeking to promote compliance with RA 8504 has been the decentralized system of government. Local Government Units (LGUs) and local AIDS Councils are primarily responsible for implementing HIV prevention and control responses. LGUs are largely autonomous, and are not bound by national policy. This underscores the importance of allocation of resources for promotion of RA 8504 and implementation at the local level.266 In 2011, UNDP and the government launched a three-year programme targeting LGUs (Promoting Leadership and Mitigating 265 International Labour Office, ILO Subregional Office for Southeast Asia and the Pacific and the Employers Confederation of the Philippines, (2008), Managing HIV/AIDS in the workplace: employers handbook for action, Makati City: ILO, 2008. 266 See: UNDP (2011), Innovative approaches: UNDP Philippines, Decentralizing AIDS Responses\u2013 Local Government, Bangkok: UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre. 122 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations the Negative Impacts of HIV and AIDS on Human Development). The programme develops leadership capacities of local governments and Regional AIDS Assistance Teams comprising representatives from the Department of Interior and Local Government, the Department of Health, and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). The DSWD with UNDP support implemented a project on Mitigating the Economic and Psychosocial Impact of HIV and AIDS, which established HIV care and support referral systems. Sections 34 and 35 of the IRR refer to the need for HIV referral systems to be developed for delivery of community-based services. The project resulted in publication of A Referral System for Care and Support Services for Persons Living with HIV (PLHIV) and their Families in the Community (2010). An accompanying document, Program Manual on Care and Support Services for Persons Living with HIV and AIDS and their Families (2011) is an operations manual to guide implementers in the delivery of care and support services to PLHIV, their children, and their families. These documents adopt a rights-based approach and emphasize principles of non-discrimination, privacy, confidentiality, informed consent, gender equality, empowerment, and greater and meaningful involvement of PLHIV. 7.4 RA 8504 under the Philippine HIV/AIDS Medium Term Plan Successive HIV/AIDS Medium Term Plans have committed to action to implement, review and strengthen RA 8504 since it was enacted in 1998. However, progress has been slow. Amendment of RA 8504 is a specific indicator under the 5th AIDS Medium Term Plan (AMTP) 2011-2016. The 5thAMTP includes a new focus on legal services for PLHIV and recommends that social care services for PLHIV include legal support for cases of \u201cdiscrimination, stereotyping, and other legal offenses\u201d and provision of legal updates on human rights and RA 8504.267 The 5th AMTP includes a commitment to establish mechanisms and processes to protect rights and address grievances of people living with or at risk of HIV: Redress mechanisms268 refer to the systems by which guarantees to the protection of rights, as embodied RA 8504, are fulfilled. In addition, a framework that demonstrates a strong shift toward a client-oriented approach, with a mechanism through which PLHIVs and HIV-vulnerable persons can avail of legal services for the redress of their grievances arising from situations related to their health condition, will have to eventually integrate and cover all domains of the response. The mechanism\u2019s accessibility is also meant for integration into design development and the adoption of comprehensive programs, into capacity building of services and personnel, and into standards for education and other communications activities where its content is relevant.

The review described the weaknesses of the legislation to include: 1. While the Act provides for penalties for unethical practices, unsafe practices and procedures, and discriminatory acts and policies, the Act itself is largely ineffective in enforcing compliance with specific preventive campaigns, such as pre-and post testing counseling by private testing laboratories and clinics. 2. The Act fails to provide workable mechanisms for redress of grievances against discriminatory acts, policies, or human rights violations. 3. There is no provision in the Act or its IRR for legal support services for PLHIV, many of whom are poor, marginalized and financially burdened by the cost of prevention and care. 4.

School supervisors should undergo trainings on these modules, and they, in turn, train their teachers on the subject. \u2022\ufffd Pinoy Plus, an NGO, suggested that the DepEd impart HIV education to students via youth development training or physical education subjects and pushed for HIV orientation as well as gender and sexuality seminars for parents. \u2022\ufffd DOJ proposed the inclusion in the law of a penal provision to ensure compliance with the requirement of integrating HIV education into the school curriculum. \u2022\ufffd The law should specifically address the plight of overseas Filipino workers diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, pointing out their unique and special needs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22c0501a-082e-469a-a63d-394c7d6ddd7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "22c0501a-082e-469a-a63d-394c7d6ddd7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19ad030d0f9793ce32aa4f03786014f76c216de8f2a834fc39fa30dfc3aaa6c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d45aebb-d253-40a5-b83f-0923eadfc1a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea06f85864370f46371b5effc3626e831a6e76fa00eb76db63738574f7f2062b"}}, "hash": "faa74381199346a3ecdc0713f6460e839be21752f85a3fd0e91e62b173d4b941", "text": "\u2022\ufffd The law does not contain any provision that ensures legal representation for people with HIV/AIDS, as well as proper training for prosecutors assigned to handle cases concerning the rights of PLHIV. \u2022\ufffd DOJ suggested that the law should more clearly spell out the rights of PLHIV. 272 Congress of the Philippines Committee News, Vol 13, No 108. 15 May 2006.

Findings included as follows: Respondents shared a range of experiences that highlighted the widening gap between the intent of the law and the current status of HIV epidemic in the country. The majority of experiences shared demonstrate the need to revisit the sections of RA 8504 that deal with confidentiality, testing, pre and post-test counseling, stigma and discrimination, local response to HIV, and conflicts with policies on drug control. \u2026The amendments to RA 8504 also need to address emerging issues in HIV-related stigma and discrimination. Anticipated challenges in anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment financing in the near future and an increasingly accessible financial market, is encouraging many people living with HIV (PLHIV) to look into insurance and health maintenance options available to them. The implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of RA 8504 mandate the creation of a task force to formulate life or health insurance packages for PLHIV. The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) has an Outpatient HIV/ AIDS treatment package for PLHIV on antiretroviral drugs. However, many private health maintenance organizations still exclude HIV from their coverage, despite recommendations from policymakers on insurance packages in relation to HIV. \u2026Many contributors noted the policy conflict between RA 8504 and Republic Act 9165 (RA 9165) or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 that has delayed the implementation of evidence-informed intervention programs such as harm reduction for persons who inject drugs (PWID) in high-burden sites like Cebu City. Section 12 of RA 9165 criminalizes possession of drug paraphernalia, including needles and provides that possession of such equipment is prima facie evidence of drug use, which has serious implications for personnel carrying out needle-exchange programs for PWID. Discussants pointed out that this amendment process is an opportunity to reconcile policies on HIV prevention with existing policies on drug control.273 7.5.4 Review of RA 8504 and local government A study undertaken in 2011 assessed the implementation of RA 8504 by local government authorities in Quezon City and Pasay City. Findings included: While the law has provided the national government a legislative basis to expect or believe that responsibility for HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support will be dutifully shared by LGUs (Local Government Units), this spirit of the law has not been 273 Ramon San Pascual, Philippine Legislators\u2019 Committee on Population and Development Foundation, post of 6 April 2011 to: Solution Exchange for the HIV & AIDS Community, Informing the AIDS Law Amendment Process by Identifying Gaps, available at: http://www.solutionexchange-un.net/repository/ph/cr2- en-06042011-1.pdf 126 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations implemented fully at the local government level. Most LGUs still lack the instruments and management systems, if not political will, to mobilize resources and plan for specific activities that are vital to prevention\u2026 This study also probed on the implementation in Quezon City and Pasay City of the provisions in the AIDS Law that are oriented towards LGU response. Provisions of the AIDS Law related to IEC (information, education, communication) at the local and community level (Sections 10, 11, 14 and 18) seem to have been mainstreamed into local social welfare programs. Health Centers, on the other hand, are not equipped yet to do a thorough going provision of information on HIV and AIDS as part of their services in the barangays. Mobilization of local resources for prevention, particularly for the production of IEC materials (Section 18), has been highly inadequate especially in Pasay City. The AIDS Law\u2019s provision on universal precautions (Section 24) is also not observed or heeded due to the lack of popularization of the Law. The section related to counseling and testing (Section 31) should not be difficult to implement as the Social Hygiene Clinic (SHC) physician, nurse and midwife are trained in counseling. However, the provision of counseling services in the SHCs faces quality assurance issues. In both cities, care and support are not yet part of the activities of the health and social welfare offices.274 In 2013, Quezon City Council approved a new Ordinance addressing HIV-related discrimination.

An alternative to court proceedings is to seek an investigation by the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) of the Philippines. Under the Constitution, the CHR is empowered to investigate human rights violations. CHR does not have the power to adjudicate complaints, but it can mediate disputes. The CHR provides legal aid and counseling services, monitors complaints with concerned agencies and conducts public inquiries into human rights issues. The CHR\u2019s Legal and Investigation Office investigates cases and may resolve cases through mediation. The CHR may recommend further legal action such as a criminal prosecution. A study conducted by ACHIEVE found only three HIV- related cases that had been brought before CHR for investigation.277 \u2022\ufffd The decision of the Supreme Court in the Ang Ladlad Case (2010) clarified that the provisions of the Constitution relating to equality before the law and non- discrimination extend to LGBT populations.278 This may have far-reaching (but as yet untested) implications in terms of challenging discriminatory practices (particularly in government services and the public sector) and application of laws. The Ang Ladlad Case established that the Constitutional principle of non-discrimination requires laws of general application relating to elections to be applied equally to all persons, regardless of sexual orientation. Other laws that are applied unequally to homosexual or transgender people can be challenged under the Constitution. \u2022\ufffd The Magna Carta for Persons with Disability279 provides remedies for persons with a disability who experience discrimination, public ridicule or vilification. Disability is defined as \u201c(1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more psychological, physiological or anatomical function of an individual or activities of such individual; (2) a record of such an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d Where a violation of a persons\u2019 rights under the Act is established, a court may order equitable remedies (e.g., order for change in policy or practice) or a penalty may be imposed. Although neither HIV nor AIDS are specifically referred to in this law, PLHIV may be able to argue that they have an impairment coming within the definition of this law (particularly if they are experiencing HIV- related illnesses). \u2022\ufffd The Magna Carta for Women includes provisions relating to women\u2019s rights to comprehensive, culture-sensitive, and gender-responsive health services and programmes (including for HIV). 277 Positive Justice Report, referred to in: UNAIDS Philippines & Pinoy Plus (2011), op cit., p.19. 278 Ang Ladlad LGBT Party represented by Danton Remoto v.

The study resulted in the publication of a resource manual on redress mechanisms for human rights violations. The resource manual identifies that there may be a variety of legal avenues of redress available in any given case involving violation of HIV-related legal rights, e.g., a criminal prosecution under RA 8504 or another Act that defines criminal offences such as the Revised Penal Code, a civil court claim, an administrative court claim, (e.g., disciplinary action against government employees by the Civil Service Commission), proceedings to resolve workplace disputes in the National Labor Relations Court, National Labor Relations Commission or National Mediation and Conciliation Board, or other forms of alternative dispute resolution (e.g., through private mediation, court annexed mediation or mediation by the CHR; and other forms of mediation, conciliation or arbitration).

ACHIEVE documented five cases of violations of rights guaranteed under RA 8504.289 7.7 Conclusion RA 8504 has provided a human rights-based policy framework for development of the national HIV response. However, enforcement mechanisms require strengthening and PNAC is urging that the Act be updated particularly given recent rapid rises in HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs and MSM. RA 8504 has provided a framework for policy development in the health, education and local government sectors. Policies developed for public hospitals and public sector workplaces may have helped to prevent discrimination by raising awareness about the provisions of RA 8504 and explaining how the law applies in different contexts. However, although several supporting policies have been issued to promote implementation, implementation has been inconsistent and slow, and the Act is not systematically promoted to communities of PLHIV and key populations, or to the sectors responsible for implementation. Several reviews of RA 8504 have been conducted since 2005 by legislators, community stakeholders and academics. The various reviews that have been conducted mean that RA8504 has been subject to more analysis and debate than any other national HIV law in the region. Concerns regarding disclosure of identity during court proceedings mean that PLHIV have been deterred from pursuing formal complaints under RA 8504. Formalizing access to low cost mediation, conciliation or arbitration services is likely to facilitate greater use of the law to protect rights. The Act has lacked a process for lodging confidential complaints in relation to human rights violations, except through a formal prosecution. Speedy, transparent and effective mechanisms for enforcement are required. 289 Positive Justice: Utilization of People Living with HIV of the Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1998 (RA 8504). 131 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa THE PHILIPPINES The Act should provide for a range of mechanisms for redress that could include administrative procedures or informal dispute resolution processes. With respect to labour rights, the Act could highlight the role of both the judiciary and the labour inspectorate in ensuring effective implementation. Revision of the Act should include a reference to the ILO international labour standard on HIV and AIDS adopted in 2010.290 Stakeholders have also highlighted the need to give more attention to the gender dimensions of the epidemic, including intimate partner violence and the disproportionate impact of HIV on women and girls in HIV-affected households.291 The Stigma Index study found that 30 percent of HIV-positive Filipino women surveyed reported that they were coerced into the method of giving birth, and the Philippines had the highest level of reported coercion into infant feeding practices in the region (37 percent of the sample).292 These aspects could be specifically addressed in legally enforceable guidance on mother-to-child transmission. A comprehensive gender analysis of the current law and the proposed amendments currently under consideration would help to ensure specific issues such as these are addressed. An updated national HIV law is anticipated in the near future. The Bill approved by Congress in 2013293 proposes significant improvements, including strengthened mechanisms for handling discrimination complaints, intensified prevention efforts with key populations including MSM and new harm reduction measures for people who inject drugs, clarification of the rights of young people to consent to testing, and prohibition of the use of condoms as a justification for police raids. 290 International Labour Office (2010), Recommendation concerning HIV and AIDS and the World of Work, 2010 (No.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a797304-cf75-48e6-896a-ffaf30aca8f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a797304-cf75-48e6-896a-ffaf30aca8f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5cbbd1d22dacd51024814476fd6f307d53e96733c995286e8fefd2230d9a1d76"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d6682ff-1959-4fa3-a94b-99dfa4c4e8eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4388d0685283c3e635470ca2b25e0e60db0dbc0a108580b2d958d9380f30d150"}}, "hash": "feb6c5ddfff0e6bd1a1ab7626fd0e103ad7b5a6a055fe66ebf8f67ca8edcf549", "text": "200), Geneva: ILO. 291 Email correspondence from UN Women (2012). 292 GNP+, ICW, IPPF, UNAIDS (2011), op cit., p.85. 293 House Bill 6751 (House of Representatives), was approved January 2013 but stalled at Senate Committee stage.

Decree 69 of 2011 defines the sanctions available for HIV-related administrative violations.301 Sanctions include fines, orders for a public apology, suspension of a professional licenses, and restoring the person to their original position had the violation not occurred e.g., reinstatement of employment. The process for seeking redress generally involves making a complaint to a government agency, investigation of the complaint by the agency and an administrative decision to resolve the case. If the complainant is not satisfied, a complaint can be made at a higher level (e.g., a complaint can be referred from District People\u2019s Committee to a Provincial People\u2019s Committee). The standard time for deciding an administrative case is 10 days. This period can be extended for up to 60 days in complicated cases.302 As an alternative to an administrative complaint, it may be possible to lodge a civil claim in court for a judicial remedy. This process is generally more costly, time consuming and complex than seeking an administrative decision to resolve the complaint. According to the Learn About Your Rights Training Manual on HIV and the Law in Viet Nam: Most violations with respect to the rights of PLHIV are civil in nature. A civil complaint means that a PLHIV is claiming that someone has violated a law, such as the Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control PLHIV\u2019s \u2026and has personally caused personal mental or physical harm to him/her\u2026 An advantage associated with choosing to bring a case to court is that compensation for mental and physical damages can be awarded and the person who has had their rights violated can personally receive money. This is different from an administrative complaint where any fine paid by a person violating another person\u2019s rights goes to the national budget and not to the person whose rights have been violated...303 301 See: UNAIDS & Policy, Law and Development Viet Nam (2011), Learn about your rights: Training Manual on HIV and the Law, Hanoi: UNAIDS, pp.207-209. 302 Ibid, p.209. 303 Ibid., p.211. 138 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations 8.3 Constraints on enforcement of the HIV/AIDS Law HIV-related stigma and discrimination is reportedly widespread.304 The Stigma Index study conducted in 2011 confirmed that PLHIV face significant levels of stigma and discrimination.

The Stigma Index study reported that the vast majority of respondents did not seek legal redress when faced with violations of their rights. The most common reason for not seeking legal redress was a lack of confidence in the success of the legal process, particularly among MSM in Ho Chi Minh City (60 percent) and female sex workers in Ha Noi (36.2 percent). Among those interviewed who confirmed that they had experienced rights violations, only 10.8 percent responded that they had taken action to protest or make a claim. 29 percent confirmed that they had \u201cno or little confidence that the outcome would be successful\u201d. Among the 10.8 percent who ever took an action to protect their rights, only 20.9 percent (i.e. 9 of 43 people) reported that they had sought and accessed legal support. Among people who inject drugs in Dien Bien, the most common reason for not taking action to protect their rights was that they were advised against doing so (22.0 percent), while 13.8 percent of female sex workers in Ha Noi also received such advice. Insufficient financial resources and a perception that the process was too bureaucratic were also cited as reasons for not seeking legal help.306 The Stigma Index study concluded that greater efforts are needed to ensure adherence to the law, which requires training and education for national and provincial health care providers and government workers and greater support to PLHIV in seeking legal redress for violations of their rights.307 It has also been argued that there may also be a clash between the focus of the HIV/ AIDS Law on protections for individual rights and the Viet Namese political culture, such that the focus of the law on individual rights is \u201cjuxtaposed with a strong view about community values.\u201d308 The National Committee for AIDS, Drugs, and Prostitution Prevention and Control reported in the Viet Nam AIDS Response Progress Report 2012 that the implementation of the HIV/AIDS Law remains weak due to \u201clate introduction of developed policies to commune authorities, law enforcement agencies and the community, and a limited understanding of HIV-related policies among those who implement them.\u201d Enforcement is also hindered due to \u201cremaining inconsistencies between public security measures to control drug use and sex work and public health measures to reach the populations engaged in these activities\u2026Low compliance with the Law on HIV, especially in the area of stigma and discrimination, continues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b6818fb-aa75-423d-92db-bacd3f8c7c23": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b6818fb-aa75-423d-92db-bacd3f8c7c23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89f1c05e1f2ba8d6d640e892718fad62b4351313a736a7ca1189f64073aa03c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0dbd3a4-725a-45a5-81db-02f63cb1247b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f895a198ae2fbcd7a5e14fa988cb82207ce492a4f0e244530420e33432f99a6"}}, "hash": "0bdc4f90c5d984078168a90d076048521420e2ebe55645f876b640cf7a57bc14", "text": "Compliance with regulations is low among law- enforcement agencies and monitoring mechanisms and sanctions are very weak.\u201d309 306 See: UNAIDS and UNDP (2012), Legal services for people living with HIV and key at-risk populations in Viet Nam: an assessment of the current situation and recommendations for the future, Hanoi: UNAIDS and UNDP, pp.31-32. 307 Viet Nam Network of People Living with HIV (VNP+) (2012), op cit., pp.62-63. 308 Dang V., Le D., Chu Q., Doan N., & Reidpath D.

Programmes have been developed to raise PLHIV\u2019s awareness about their rights... Efforts have also been made to make legal support services available, including legal aid systems for HIV casework and private sector law firms providing free or reduced-cost legal services to PLHIV. However, the clinics require further capacity strengthening, especially as stigma and discrimination remain significant barriers to accessing HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services.312 UNAIDS and UNDP sponsored an independent assessment on legal services for PLHIV in Viet Nam in 2012. Findings of the assessment included: 313 \u2022\ufffd Despite the powerful legal framework provided by the Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, stigma and discrimination against PLHIV and violation of their rights continue to take place in communities, health care and education facilities, workplaces and families. \u2022\ufffd There is a lack of systematized data on the legal services provided to PLHIV and key populations. \u2022\ufffd Legal services for PLHIV have been provided by: \u203a Provincial Legal Aid Centres (PLACs); \u203a Legal Consultancy Collaborators (LCCs) of the Viet Nam Lawyers Association. Some LCCs provide services to PLHIV as a part of their legal advice services to the general population. Some LCCs provide HIV-specific services (e.g., LCCs funded by the Health Policy Initiative from 2009-2012); \u203a LCCs of social organizations (e.g., Women\u2019s Union) and legal clinics of universities and other educational institutions. 312 National Committee for AIDS, Drugs, And Prostitution Prevention And Control, Viet Nam AIDS Response Progress Report 2012, p.34. 313 UNAIDS and UNDP (2012), Legal services for people living with HIV and key at-risk populations in Viet Nam: an assessment of the current situation and recommendations for the future, Hanoi: UNAIDS and UNDP.

Health Policy Initiative (HPI) support to five HIV-specific legal services The Health Policy Initiative (HPI)(funded by USAID) provided support to five LCCs under the VLA to provide specialist HIV-related legal services from 2009-2012. These centres were located in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, An Giang, Hai Phong and Quang Ninh. The Hanoi centre, operated by CCLPHH also received funding from the Ford Foundation and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Each of these HIV-specific LCCs was staffed by one lawyer, one legal consultant and four part-time collaborators. After HPI funding concluded in 2012, some of these services merged with either the PLAC or LCCs under VLA. The assessment reported that the following were the most common types of HIV-related cases that these specialist LCCs handled: Matters Method of Settlement Children living with HIV not allowed to attend school. Schools often blamed this on objection from other children\u2019s parents. LCC held discussions with the school to confirm the children\u2019s rights. Meetings with parents of other children were frequently held to explain HIV transmission and HIV laws. Amicable settlement was reached subject to successfully convincing other children\u2019s parents to withdraw their objection. PLHIV were dismissed from employment. LCC held discussions with the employer and got relevant bodies involved to reconcile the dispute. Commencement of lawsuit was sometimes necessary.

During the custody, his health worsened due to interrupted HIV medical treatment. In a meeting at Hanoi Centre, his family members were advised on legal procedures to be taken to protect his right for medical treatment. The Centre made representations to relevant authorities such as Police Office, Prosecutor Office, the Provincial AIDS Committee and the Medical Centre where Dong was treated requesting release from custody. Dong was sent home to continue his ARV treatment under police supervision. The Hanoi Centre handled 8,238 cases from 2009-2011. 2,862 cases were inquiries from PLHIV in law dissemination meetings. Advice was provided in civil matters, criminal matters, administrative matters, land disputes, labor matters, matters related to social protection policy and general legal matters unrelated to HIV. The assessment found that the vast majority of cases handled by the Hanoi Centre involved provision of advice on legal options and the process for lodging claims, and negotiations with authorities on behalf of clients. The Hanoi Centre rarely represented clients in court. There was one litigation case handled by Hanoi Centre in the period 2009-2011, in which the Centre provided a lawyer to defend a criminal matter.

The manual has become part of the regular curriculum for law clinics in some law schools. In 2012 a national network of law schools, NGOs and PLHIV was formed to expand rights education activities to more provinces and communities. UNDP and UNAIDS also supported the Institute for Policy, Law and Development to develop training resources for women living with or affected by HIV (including female sex workers and female partners of men who inject drugs), and to educate 75 women living with or affected by HIV on their rights under the law on HIV. In 2012 UNDP and UNAIDS reported that they are focusing their efforts on the following areas: i. Capacity enhancement of the legal sector in order to increase the quality of legal services delivered to PLHIV and key populations, building on the recommendations of the independent assessment. ii.

To improve compliance with the HIV/ AIDS Law requires sustained efforts to educate PLHIV, employers, health care providers and government agencies about the law and law enforcement mechanisms, and to improve access to legal aid services. The development of the Training Manual on HIV and the Law and the training programmes conducted based on the Training Manual provide a model for other countries in how to approach capacity building of PLHIV communities, self-help groups, law students, lawyers and NGOs. Improving access to legal services for PLHIV and key populations will support increased enforcement of the rights protections contained in the HIV/AIDS Law. Legal education and legal aid services have largely been funded by foreign donors. As international support to the national HIV response reduces, many of these programmes are coming to an end. Donor support has made an important contribution to strengthening capacities for providing HIV-related legal service provision and providing access to justice. The challenge for the Government of Viet Nam is to build on this foundation and the lessons learned to develop sustainable approaches. The recommendations of the legal services assessment published in 2012 should inform policy. The assessment included a recommendation that the Ministry of Justice, the National Legal Aid Agency, and the Viet Nam Lawyers Association should submit a Project on Development of Legal Services for PLHIV and Key Populations for the period of 2012 to 2020 to the Prime Minister, requesting the following: i. Development of a Government policy to promote the development of legal services for PLHIV and key populations; ii. Amendment to the Law on Legal Aid as to include PLHIV as eligible groups subject to state legal aid services; iii. Amendment to the Law on HIV Prevention and Control so as to include legal services for PLHIV and key populations as one of measures of HIV prevention and control; iv. Inclusion of legal dissemination and education for PLHIV in the Government Decree to guide the implementation of the Law on Legal Dissemination and Education. v. Amendment to regulations on functions of the Ministry of Justice, the National Legal Aid Agency and the Viet Nam Lawyers Association to define their roles in provision of legal services for PLHIV and key populations.320 320 UNAIDS and UNDP (2012), op cit., p.48. 149 OTHER LEGISLATIVE MODELS 9.1 South Asia 9.1.1 National HIV Bills of India, Nepal and Pakistan India, Pakistan and Nepal have developed bills proposing omnibus national HIV laws.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6e18315-ea4c-4208-a808-01b7bd75302a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6e18315-ea4c-4208-a808-01b7bd75302a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fc05c31eb80269ceec5fde8952f694280a61c2e469ee3090e81ff792fcf3b55"}, "2": {"node_id": "406cc798-f0c5-4d26-a682-60c811af0683", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10274751938f7d3cc039a4bf328c9261616353ab90c0d4fde306a03716594dfb"}}, "hash": "f0662a544b32912743c654db61c2903e347984a15549c35978a741246b2006c6", "text": "However, these bills have not been considered by the parliament of each respective country or passed into law.

However, Sri Lanka has not introduced HIV-specific legislation to protect the rights of PLHIV. A Regional Legal Reference Resource for South Asia published by IDLO in 2012 summarizes developments related to HIV, MSM and transgender people. The Regional Legal Reference Resource makes the following observations in relation to the significance of the national HIV Bills of India, Nepal and Pakistan: Anti-discrimination provisions in the HIV Bills drafted by India, Nepal and Pakistan, go some way in addressing discrimination on the grounds of HIV status. Importantly, anti-discrimination provisions extend beyond the public sector, to encompass the private sector (Pakistan, Nepal and India) and \u2018familial and personal life\u2019 (Nepal). Equally, the extension of discrimination on the basis of HIV status to presumed HIV status (for example, \u2018on suspicion\u2019 that a person is HIV positive \u2013 in the Indian, Nepal and Pakistan Bills) represents an important recognition of the impact of stigma on key populations at higher risk. Provisions in the Nepal and Pakistan Bills could be further strengthened by express provisions to include key populations at higher risk under these anti- discrimination provisions. Notably, in India, Nepal and Pakistan, the HIV bills have remained in draft form, for not less than five years. There is now a reasonable argument to suggest there is a need for comprehensive review of all three bills to ensure they reflect national developments and international lessons learned. The challenge of gathering sufficient political will to pass these bills remains. Given the personal and political agendas which change and shape a bill during its passage through parliament, the question needs to be asked whether omnibus HIV laws hold the answer to protecting 9. Other legislative models 150 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations HIV-related rights. These bills must be viewed in light of their potential to progress the rights agenda and potential to harm the rights-based response to HIV. 321 India The HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill 2012 has been drafted for consideration by the Cabinet of the Government of India. This represents the culmination of a ten- year process. An advisory group chaired by the National AIDS Control Organisation first requested an NGO, the Lawyers Collective, to prepare a draft Bill in 2002. The Lawyers Collective prepared the first version of the Bill after consultations conducted in 2003- 2004 with PLHIV, key populations, women\u2019s and children\u2019s groups, health care providers, trade unions, lawyers and other civil society organizations. Feedback was also sought from State Governments, State AIDS Control Societies and Central Government Ministries. This first version of the Bill was submitted to the National AIDS Control Organisation in 2006. After the Health Ministry referred the Bill to the Law Ministry, the Law Ministry proposed a redraft of the Bill after deleting numerous provisions that PLHIV organizations had requested be included.322 In 2012, a new version was circulated, however this version stalled after the Ministry of Home Affairs and the National AIDS Control Organisation disagreed regarding the application of the Bill to uniformed services. The Ministry of Home Affairs requested that military forces and police be exempt from the Bill\u2019s prohibition on mandatory HIV testing and from the requirement that HIV status be kept confidential.323 A key lesson from this experience of delay is that it is critical to ensure that the Ministries of Home Affairs and of Law/Justice are supportive of the rights-based approach early in the drafting process, and that this support continues throughout the progress of a draft law through political processes, taking into account changes in governments and bureaucracies. The Lawyers Collective has argued that enactment of the Bill into law is required to fulfill India\u2019s international obligations, recognizing the inadequacy of the existing legal framework:324 \u2022\ufffd India has no existing anti-discrimination legislation to cover discrimination on the grounds of HIV. \u2022\ufffd The guarantee of equality in the Indian Constitution is available only against state entities and there is no restriction on discriminatory practices in the private sector, be it in healthcare, employment, or education. \u2022\ufffd Most legal issues that arise in the context of HIV are governed by common law \u2013 where law is defined by principles set down in prior case law by judges.

Nepal The first draft of the Nepal\u2019s HIV Bill325 was developed in 2003, but has been amended a number of times. As at 2012, the Bill was being reviewed by Ministry of Health and Population. It will need to be reviewed by the Ministry of Law and Justice. As at 2011, the Nepal Bill included provisions in relation to discrimination, right to privacy and confidentiality of HIV status, and a prohibition of mandatory HIV testing. The Bill proposes that consent would not be required for HIV testing in the following circumstances: (a) 325 HIV and AIDS (Prevention, Control, Treatment, Re-integration and Protection of Rights) Bill. 152 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations in the course of investigation of certain crimes, (b) pursuant to a court order, and (c) in the course of treatment of a minor or an individual who is unable to consent because of physical or mental state.326 Pakistan Pakistan developed a draft HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment Bill in 2007.327 According to the IDLO Regional Legal Reference Resource: Legal commentators suggest a lack of political commitment has impeded the passage of the Pakistan Bill... Competing political, social and economic priorities have resulted in a situation where the Pakistan Bill has been pending for five years.328 The Bill proposes to establish an enabling environment by protecting vulnerable populations against stigma and discrimination on the basis of their HIV status. The Bill defines discrimination to include: \u201cany act or omission including a policy, law, rule, practice, custom, tradition, usage, condition or situation which directly or indirectly, expressly or by effect, immediately or over a period of time imposes burdens, obligations, liabilities, disabilities or disadvantages on, or denies or withholds benefits, opportunities or advantages, from, or compels or forces the adoption of a particular course of action by any person or category of persons, based solely on a person\u2019s HIV status, actual or perceived.\u201d The Bill prohibits discrimination in both the public and private sectors, and prohibits anyone from publishing, propagating, advocating or communicating whether by words, or by actions, against any person on grounds of his/her suffering from HIV. The Bill provides for a fine in the event of violation of the provisions on discrimination and provides that the Courts are permitted to pass appropriate orders having regard to the circumstances of the case to prevent or redress breaches of the Act.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70009030-a2cd-433c-b10c-bec3d4db64f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "70009030-a2cd-433c-b10c-bec3d4db64f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db9d35e72e8857d75046676b5edac209c5239c0ce0167ecba9c34420a4307276"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc90c66f-d9ce-4b58-a8b2-195da03f0909", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3294d8f78897b5e38cfccecddf84db7fc4cb4e7bb3e1c9f6bf7c7c8b3659143a"}}, "hash": "11c24678c6a2e2a9e27f18d0e899804a972d4b71477596f360869949adb9796a", "text": "The Bill also addresses confidentiality of medical status and prohibits compulsory testing. 9.1.2 Other legal redress mechanisms for human rights violations The Regional Legal Reference Resource makes the following findings (inter alia) in relation to legal protections for HIV-related human rights in South Asia:329 \u2022\ufffd The Constitutions of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka enshrine the principles of equality and non-discrimination\u2026broad Constitutional protections guarantee equality, non-discrimination, and some recognition of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a65aa2e0-dd78-416b-acf0-ce6e813d6500": {"__data__": {"id_": "a65aa2e0-dd78-416b-acf0-ce6e813d6500", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92e4ba7a1e7256afa5a63d66793e625c2f9019ed84ec22b1e63ac9e6cf468c8f"}, "3": {"node_id": "2bcd42cc-b87c-49f8-8ce5-e23aa1966099", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "760cff68ce694a302b4a73eecef2733adb1ac67d704ab6e411bef1918fcc915e"}}, "hash": "be29757fbb51e1687539fc129d7d95c790b1816a8c8ac730d2aaf3ef1e0add9c", "text": "the right to health.

While the Islamabad Bill proposes anti-discrimination protections for PLHIV, it also seeks to make HIV testing mandatory for marriage, prison inmates, commercial sex traders, sex offenders, certain victims of crimes, habitual drug users, truck drivers, and patients receiving repeated transfusions of blood. 328 IDLO (2012), op cit, p.26. 329 Ibid., pp.14-20. 153 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa OTHER LEGISLATIVE MODELS within national statutes tend to be more accessible to citizens and law enforcement agencies, and easier to claim in a Court of law. \u2022\ufffd There is no stand-alone anti-discrimination legislation which specifically protects PLHIV or sexual minority populations in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan or Sri Lanka. \u2022\ufffd Bangladesh has broad anti-discrimination laws, but no provisions that specifically provide for PLHIV or people of diverse sexual orientation or gender identity. \u2022\ufffd In India, the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act 1995 (PWD Act), provides that certain government bodies cannot dispense with, or reduce in rank, an employee who acquires a disability during his service; or deny a promotion to a person on the ground of their disability. (The Act only applies in respect of certain diseases and HIV is not included). While the application of the Act is narrow, activists have advocated for the inclusion of people living with HIV in the Act on the basis that discrimination experienced by PLHIV is similar to that experienced by other people with disabilities. The Draft Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill 2012 proposes to broaden the definition. \u2022\ufffd The Country Code of Nepal contains some provisions related to certain types of discrimination on the basis of disease, under Chapter 19 on Decency/Etiquette (Adal). No. 10(B) of Chapter 19 provides that in the event a person commits torture or banishes any ill person from his or her place of residence (by rejecting that person or committing any inhuman or degrading treatment), on the ground that he or she has suffered from any disease, the person shall be liable to the punishment of imprisonment for a term ranging from 3 months to 2 years or a fine of 5,000-25,000 Nepali Rupees, or both. This provision may be interpreted to cover ill-treatment and/ or ostracism of people living with HIV. Notably, the provision covers ill-treatment at a social level only (place of residence), not ill-treatment at an institutional level. Incidents of discrimination against children by schools are reported in India. Over 60 children living with HIV were denied admission to schools from 2008-09 to 2011-12, according to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).330 Rejection of children on the grounds of HIV by schools may be challenged as a violation of their rights under the Right to Education Act 2009. 9.1.3 Use of the legal system to enforce HIV-related rights in India Although there is no overarching national HIV legislation, PLHIV have been able to access the legal system to seek remedies for human rights violations in a variety of circumstances.

The Commission\u2019s intervention has secured proper medical treatment to an AIDS patient at a Government Hospital in Delhi. The unemployed HIV positive patient had complained to the Commission on 18 September 2003 that he had been denied proper treatment by Government and non-Government hospitals in Delhi. The Commission pursued the case with the hospitals concerned; consequently, the patient is now being given proper medical treatment. In the light of this case, the Commission has directed that in medical cases dealing with HIV positive patients, hospitals should offer proper treatment without the poor patients having to approach the Commission. In addition to individual complaints, \u2026systemic recommendations on various aspects of \u2018Human Rights & HIV/ AIDS\u2019 were sent to the concerned authorities in the Central Government and in various States. The Commission has mounted a multi-media campaign to disseminate information on human rights and HIV/AIDS to various target groups. Legal empowerment, legal aid and access to justice Community-based legal empowerment initiatives have played an important role in protecting and advocating the human rights of sex workers, MSM and transgender people in several South Asian countries. Examples include: \u2022\ufffd Durjoy Nari Sangha is the largest sex worker organization in Bangladesh and a strong advocate for sex workers\u2019 rights. In addition to HIV prevention, services offered by Durjoy Nari Sangha include legal rights education and legal advice and referrals for sex workers.354 \u2022\ufffd Blue Diamond Society (BDS) is the leading community-based organization of the Federation of Sexual and Gender Minorities. BDS\u2019s advocacy strategies involves review of laws, documenting human rights abuses, advocacy campaigns and forming alliances with human rights and legal bodies, such as the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Nepal Bar Association. BDS provides legal advice for individuals who have experienced human rights violations. Complainants are assisted to consider legal and non-legal options. In 2012 BDS was supporting around 50 court cases. People seeking legal redress for violent attacks made up the majority of cases. Where complaints are against police, these are filed with the NHRC for investigation. Based on its findings NHRC makes recommendations to the relevant ministries. Civil cases usually concern property rights. If such cases cannot be resolved out of court, BDS files the case with the relevant court. Documenting human rights violations including cases such as discrimination in health care settings, violence and denial of housing, help to build an understanding about the nature and extent of such incidents.

PLHIV have successfully asserted rights under the Constitution of India to non-discrimination, equality, life and privacy. PLHIV have been supported in taking legal action by specialist HIV legal services, including the Lawyers Collective HIV/AIDS Unit and legal services operated by NGOs and state AIDS control societies (e.g., Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society). 355 Ibid, pp.107-113. 356 Burke-Shyne N. (2012), South Asian Video Conference Report HIV-Related Legal Services, World Bank. 161 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa OTHER LEGISLATIVE MODELS Although these successes are notable, the legal framework for protection of HIV-related human rights at the national level remains weak in India and the other South Asian countries. The HIV response would benefit greatly from national laws that clarify issues such as rights to non-discrimination, informed consent and privacy as they apply to PLHIV and key populations. The proposals for national HIV laws in India, Nepal and Pakistan have the potential to deliver a strengthened human rights-based legal response to HIV. However, there is also a risk that punitive provisions might be inserted in the legislation as it passes through the parliamentary process. It is therefore important that efforts focus not just on drafting national HIV laws, but also on strengthening rights protections available under general anti-discrimination and human rights laws, and providing legal empowerment programmes to ensure that PLHIV have improved access to the justice system. 9.2 Indonesia Indonesia does not have a comprehensive national HIV law. There was an attempt to develop a draft national HIV law, but it was not completed: In mid-2004, the Indonesian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development began preparing a draft Bill on HIV and AIDS Management. This Bill was expected to address all matters related to the prevention and management of HIV however; in light of the urgent need to respond to SARS, Avian Flu (H5N1) and Swine Flu (H1N1), the draft Bill formulation team broadened the scope of the Bill and changed the title of the Bill to The Bill for the Prevention and Management of Dangerous Diseases. At the time of the Stakeholder Meeting, the Bill had not been finalized.357 A Presidential Regulation was introduced in 2006 (PR No. 75/2006 on the National AIDS Commission), which restructured the National AIDS Commission and made it directly accountable to the President. Some provincial, district and municipal governments have introduced local HIV laws (Perda). Fifteen HIV regulations have been introduced at provincial level, and 34 regulations have been introduced at district or municipal / city level.358 There is also a Decree at the national level that addresses workplace HIV issues. The Decree of the Minister of Manpower and Transmigration on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in the Workplace359 draws on the ILO Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work and includes a prohibition on compulsory testing and a broad obligation to protect workers from discrimination. Article 2 of the Decree provides: 1.

Examples included: \u2022\ufffd Denial of access to or poor treatment in health care settings; \u2022\ufffd Various forms of police abuse; \u2022\ufffd Women living with HIV forced to undergo sterilization or pressured to use birth control; \u2022\ufffd Stigmatization and discrimination by families and communities; \u2022\ufffd Denial of access to school or expulsion from school either because child was HIV positive or the child\u2019s parents were HIV positive; \u2022\ufffd Local regulations that force sex workers to test for HIV; and \u2022\ufffd Refusal of employment because of gender identity. Barriers to accessing legal advice and representation were reported to include: \u2022\ufffd A lack of trust between key populations and lawyers; \u2022\ufffd A lack of sensitivity to the experiences and needs of key populations by lawyers; \u2022\ufffd Discrimination by legal aid services, such as refusal to provide legal advice or representation to people who inject drugs; \u2022\ufffd Police routinely discouraged people from seeking legal assistance, advising that using a lawyer would only increase the penalty they received; and \u2022\ufffd People in detention were often assaulted when they asked for access to a lawyer. The needs assessment concluded that these barriers highlight the value of the community legal empowerment model, which focuses on building relationships with key populations, engaging and training paralegal community members to improve communities\u2019 access to legal information, advice and representation and confidence to claim their rights.361 LBH Masyarakat implements this model with people who inject drugs and other marginalized populations. 360 IDLO (2010), Stakeholder report: Rapid Needs Assessment of the Legal Needs of People Living with HIV and Key Populations in Jakarta, Rome: IDLO. 361 Ibid, p.5. 164 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations 9.3 Singapore and Brunei Part IV of the Infectious Diseases Act 1977 (Singapore) and Part IV of the Infectious Diseases Act 2010 (Brunei) contain very similar provisions relating to HIV.

Section 25 provides for protection of the identity of PLHIV. Disclosure of identity attracts a fine of $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both. The Section states that any person who, in the performance or exercise of functions or duties under the Infectious Diseases Act, is aware or has reasonable grounds for believing that another person has AIDS or HIV infection shall not disclose any information which may identify the other person. 165 Part II - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In asIa OTHER LEGISLATIVE MODELS The Act defines numerous exceptions to this duty. For example, disclosure of identity is permitted: with the consent of the PLHIV; when ordered by a Court; to any medical practitioner or other health staff who is treating or caring for, or counselling, the person; or to the victim of a sexual assault. Section 25A allows disclosure by a medical practitioner for the purpose of informing the spouse, former spouse or other contact of the infected person, provided that the medical practitioner: a. reasonably believes that it is medically appropriate and that there is a significant risk of infection to the spouse, former spouse or other contact; b. has counselled the infected person regarding the need to notify the spouse, former spouse or other contact and he reasonably believes that the infected person will not inform the spouse, former spouse or other contact; and c. has informed the infected person of his intent to make such disclosure to the spouse, former spouse or other contact. Section 25A also provides that the Director of Medical Services may disclose any information relating to any person whom he reasonably believes to be infected with AIDS or HIV infection to: health care workers who have been exposed to a risk of infection from AIDS or HIV Infection; a police officer or any provider of first aid who has experienced a significant exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials of any patient. The Brunei legislation contains provisions modeled closely on Singapore\u2019s legislation, with minor variations, including: \u2022\ufffd A power to require a PLHIV to undergo counselling and comply with precautions. (Section 23) \u2022\ufffd An offence for non-disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners. (Section 24) \u2022\ufffd An offence for unauthorized disclosure of HIV status by health authorities, subject to a range of specific exceptions. (Section 26) 9.4 Thailand Thailand does not have a national HIV law. The Thai Constitution prohibits discrimination on the grounds of health status.362 The Thai courts have been used successfully by HIV NGOs to challenge patents on ARVs. In 2002, Thailand\u2019s Central Intellectual Property and International Trade Court ruled in favor of the AIDS Access Foundation, the Thai Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS and two people living with HIV and ordered Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) to amend its Thai 362 Article 30 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand BE 2550 (2007) states that unjust discrimination on the grounds of health status shall not be permitted. 166 LegaL protections against HiV-reLated Human rigHts VioLations patent on the ARV didanosine. The court ruled that the company had the exclusive right to produce didanosine only in low doses, while other drug companies could produce the drug in higher doses. The Thai court ruled that because pharmaceutical patents can lead to high prices and limit access to medicines, patients are injured by them and can challenge their legality.363 In 2004, BMS reached an agreement to return its patent for didanosine to Thailand. In exchange, the Foundation for Consumers and three HIV-positive people agreed to settle the legal suit filed against BMS in 2002 challenging the patent. These consumer victories allowed the Thai government\u2019s treatment programme to scale- up using generic medicines. 363 Ford N., Wilson D., Bunjumnong O., Angerer T.

Overview HIV is addressed in the public health laws of some Pacific island states and territories,364 but only three jurisdictions have enacted provisions that specifically address HIV-related human rights concerns. Jurisdictions that have enacted HIV legislation addressing human rights are Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Pohnpei State (Federated States of Micronesia). The Oceania Society for Sexual Health and HIV Medicine (OSSHHM) has observed that no Pacific Islander (outside of PNG) has tried to seek legal relief for HIV-related human rights violations, and that there needs to be stronger measures in place to support PLHIV and other sub-populations to make a complaint, take legal action and see it through to judgment.365 Apart from Papua New Guinea, Pacific island states and territories have low HIV prevalence. The low number of PLHIV in the Pacific islands means that HIV is often not perceived as a political or legislative priority. UNDP and the Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community provide technical assistance to support development of national HIV laws. The Governments of Tuvalu and of the Solomon Islands have commenced discussions with stakeholders on drafting of human rights-based national HIV legislation, and the Government of Vanuatu has prepared a policy paper on a human rights-based HIV response.366 The Government of the Cook Islands prepared an HIV (Care and Support) Bill in 2011, in response to events surrounding the first local HIV diagnosis. A Fijian national was tested for HIV as a requirement for renewal of his work permit in 2010, and tested positive for HIV. He was forced to leave Cook Islands, as the test result was not kept confidential.367 The Bill proposes a human rights framework for the national HIV response and was being considered during 2012. The Cook Islands Government requested that development of the law be led by the National HIV, STI, and TB Committee, which consists of Government ministries and departments including the Ministry of Health, faith based organizations, Cook Islands Family Welfare Association, Cook Islands Red Cross Society, Cook Islands National Council of Women, key affected populations (Te Tiare Association and Cook Islands National Youth Council), organization representing the positive voice (Pacific Islands AIDS Foundation), and other development partners. A drafting project was supported by UNDP to prepare the Bill for consideration.368 364 See e.g., Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Act 1988, Marshall Islands (Chap.13, below); Public Health Act 1992 (Samoa) included HIV/AIDS in the schedule of notifiable diseases. In Samoa a similar amendment was made in 1987/88. In Vanuatu, the Public Health Act 1994 made similar changes to include HIV within general public health provisions: Jowitt A.

The Decree was drafted after a lengthy consultation period that engaged the Ministry of Health, UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNDP, and civil society groups. The Decree has a strong human rights orientation and explicitly requires its provisions to be interpreted so as to apply the UN International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights.370 The Decree provides legal protections against discrimination and stigmatization, and defines rights to confidentiality and informed consent.

The amendments also included removal of the criminal offence of deliberately infecting a person with HIV or attempting to do so, removal of the power of migration officers to refuse entry to Fiji", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52e6c999-d1cf-4252-b67c-e0d6c14404c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "52e6c999-d1cf-4252-b67c-e0d6c14404c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Legal protections against HIV-related human rights violations: Experiences and lessons learned from national HIV laws in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2a3fcd1fdfceb1b68fa6cdb59dd701510817a8a43e899a4694aa738a50be833"}, "3": {"node_id": "e9925163-2f33-4eca-9178-aa0b185cf5a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/legal-protections-against-hiv-related-human-rights-violations-experiences-and-lessons-learned-national-hiv-laws-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d3416024318e4c48adf233a80c5b89273e61cc031d163dbfd670693c1829f51"}}, "hash": "acd923aceb63c250169d56a6068cb35c092e5cabe5674d76de22497dff34f1ea", "text": "or PLHIV, and removal of the provision that allowed for mandatory HIV testing when required by a written law or by order of the Minister for Health. The HIV-specific offence of deliberately infecting another with HIV was considered unnecessary, given that the Crimes Decree 2009 already includes an offence for negligently doing an act likely to spread a disease dangerous to life372 and that the UN International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS Human Rights recommend against criminal offences specifically targeting PLHIV.373 Nazhat Shameem, a former judge of the High Court of Fiji, makes the following observations about the history of the Decree: 369 Fiji has a military government and currently has neither a parliament nor a constitution. 370 See: Shameem N. (2011), The HIV/AIDS Decree 2011, A paper delivered at the Attorney-General\u2019s Conference, Sigatoka, December 2011. 371 Section 34. 372 Section 383. 373 See: Shameem N., (2011), Making the law work for HIV \u2013 the Fiji HIV/AIDS Decree 2011. Address by Nazhat Shameem at the 10th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 26-30 August 2011. 11. Fiji 171 Part III - Country Case studIes: natIonal HIV laws In tHe PaCIfIC FIJI Why was Fiji able to so effectively pass this Decree, and then, having found that some sections in it were inconsistent with the International Guidelines, how was Fiji able to make the necessary changes so quickly? I believe that the answer is firstly in the partnership and networking approach adopted by civil society groups, the Fiji government, and UN agencies such as UNAIDS and the UNDP. Secondly, I believe that Fiji\u2019s Ministry of Health has a strong commitment to a human rights based approach to HIV/AIDS prevention and care. Thirdly, there is a strong political will, in Fiji, to ensure that the reform to HIV law is based on a framework which has long term survival and sustainability. Lastly, I believe that the support of advocates for HIV work, from the President of Fiji, to the many civil society groups represented here at this conference provides strong and enlightened leadership such that the necessary reforms could be effected. The result is an HIV law in Fiji which is now a model for the world.374 The Decree includes a statement of Guiding Principles, intended to ensure the interpretation and implementation of the Decree are consistent with human rights principles including the United Nations International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights (see Annex V for the text of the Guiding Principles). The Decree also includes a provision ensuring the Decree will be given priority over other laws if there is a conflict: Section
