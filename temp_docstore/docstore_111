Disclosing companies experience detrimental impacts from both climate and nature, but report less so from nature 71% of companies reporting detrimental impacts identified climate and nature-related primary impacts, again with the vast majority from climate. Compared to 69% reporting climate-related detrimental impacts, only 6.5% reported nature- related detrimental impacts. Companies rarely consider nature in their responses to detrimental impacts Among companies reporting on how they responded to the above detrimental impacts, only 11% identified nature-related responses. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In this report, CDP and IUCN jointly analyze the extent to which companies reporting to CDP go beyond climate, forests and water to also consider broader nature-related risks, impacts, opportunities, and responses. The key findings are as follows: The interlinked climate and biodiversity crises are now posing increasing environmental, social, and economic risks to society. Businesses contribute substantially to these crises and are today under unprecedented pressure from different sources to take various measures to lower their environmental footprint. 4 3 1 2 Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that businesses need to do much more to fully incorporate nature-related considerations in their assessments and reporting of environmental risks, opportunities, impacts and responses. A selection of case studies illustrates some of the steps that some companies participating in CDP\u2019s disclosure systems are currently taking to integrate nature within their operations. While these are welcome, it is too early to say to what extent these deliver true Nature-based Solutions (NbS), as defined and recognized by IUCN. The following recommendations are outlined: { Businesses should aim to identify and report on nature-related risks, opportunities, impacts and responses more systematically within their corporate environmental disclosures. { More businesses need to take concrete steps now to put in place science-based nature-positive net-zero strategies. { Businesses should implement their nature/NbS-related plans and actions based on the best available international standards and guidance, including by systematically applying the IUCN Global Standard for NbSTM. { Governments can encourage greater action and ambition by businesses, both by establishing policies to ensure more stringent corporate environmental disclosures on nature, and by ensuring greater alignment across all nature-related policy processes. 4 INTRODUCTION The challenges we face The world today is facing two critical interlinked challenges \u2013 the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis, the latter being expressed through the irreversible loss of nature and habitats. This is clearly evident through the recent assessments conducted by both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The 'IPCC Sixth Assessment Report: The Physical Science Basis', published in August 2021, highlights with unprecedented clarity the scale, speed, and severity of the ongoing climate crisis, and the need for rapid, sustained, and large-scale greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reductions across all sectors of the global economy1. Similarly, the '2019 IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services' and the '2021 IPBES-IPCC co-sponsored workshop report on biodiversity and climate change' underline the grave threat that is confronting the world\u2019s ecosystems, and how this is integrally interlinked with the climate challenge2. Furthermore, as the '2021 Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity' notes, our economies, livelihoods and well-being are all fundamentally dependent on nature, and our failure to act on biodiversity and ecosystem losses, which both exacerbate and are exacerbated by climate change, is posing real and increasing environmental, social and economic risks to society today3. Addressing this combined challenge requires the achievement of the global goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and also a clear net-positive goal for nature. This requires measures eliminating nature loss, with restoration well underway by 2030, moving us to a nature positive economic system by 2050. The role of business The role of businesses across different sectors of the global economy (agriculture, energy, transportation, industries, etc.) in contributing to these twin global challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss is well known and documented \u2013 and does not require repetition here. But what is important to note is that there is unprecedented pressure on businesses worldwide today, especially those engaged in the most environmentally damaging sectors \u2013 for example, fossil fuel-based energy extraction and commercial large-scale farming \u2013 to minimize the adverse effects of their operations on both climate and nature.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be761423-41b3-4681-9c02-413c6d7405ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "be761423-41b3-4681-9c02-413c6d7405ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Disclosing nature's potential", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00e7de788285218c7a197327443577441fedc7a259a6584726f155e3bc583314"}, "2": {"node_id": "62584101-f009-4bd4-9db8-3ca08fdb0fc8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d5e4542c38c2a856ff77186c82ef3de8df2465e02cbbb0aa154453fcd6e2ea8"}}, "hash": "d1e74a1868c3939b416b99caa5edcf235d0d0b47c3bfa9ca0c3b63bb812389e9", "text": "This pressure \u2013 which is emanating from multiple sources \u2013 including through government regulation, judicial rulings, civil society activism, and investor and consumer action \u2013 is now leading to companies taking a range of measures to address their environmental footprint.

Notably, companies themselves are also increasingly feeling the negative impacts of climate change and ecosystem degradation on their own operations and supply chains. However, we also know that the vast majority of companies are still not treating climate change and other environmental risk factors as core business concerns. The importance of corporate disclosure A prominent, immediate, and important way in which businesses can demonstrate and track their progress in systematically considering and addressing the environmental dimensions of their operations is through the disclosures that they make. This is typically done either in response to legal or regulatory requirements, or, voluntarily, as a demonstration of good corporate practice and behavior. In either case, by generating greater transparency both on the environmental risks that companies face, and the environmental impacts that they have, corporate environmental disclosure and reporting systems help to set concrete baselines against which their future progress can be measured, monitored and assessed. Regular disclosure also helps to build greater internal knowledge, awareness and capacity within the companies to support even higher levels of environmental ambition and action over time. 1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC (2021).

CLIMATE, NATURE, AND BUSINESS DISCLOSURE 5 Given the urgency of the environmental crises facing the world today, there is increasing consensus that companies and financial institutions must disclose the environmental dimensions of their work, and also the progress that they make in achieving their stated environmental commitments and targets. For example, 71% of companies disclosing to CDP agree that disclosure \u201cHelps my organization to track the progress of our environmental strategy5\u201d. Corporate disclosures of environmental risks, opportunities, impacts, and responses \u2013 if done in a comparable, consistent, and quantifiable manner \u2013 can become the foundation of transformation change. Such disclosure helps all stakeholders \u2013 including investors, large buyers, policymakers, regulators, civil society and consumers\u2013 to make better informed decisions and have clearer expectations of companies with respect to their sustainability efforts. In turn, better informed stakeholders can support companies in their efforts to act more progressively, including by ambitiously integrating environmental considerations within their strategic decisions and operations. Equally, ambitious corporate action can send strong signals from businesses to governments of their willingness to act, and help provide greater assurance to the latter to develop and support more ambitious environmental policies on their part \u2013 thereby constructing a mutually-reinforcing and upward-moving ambition loop6. CDP and corporate environmental disclosure CDP has been at the forefront of corporate environmental disclosure for more than 20 years, playing a central role in the mainstreaming of ESG disclosure and driving corporate action. Over these years, it has supported companies in making their environmental (climate, water and forest-related) risks and impacts more transparent to stakeholders and in helping them better understand how they can reduce their adverse impacts and move towards becoming corporate environmental leaders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0348f9d5-de4d-41a5-8f89-953ba9e959bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "0348f9d5-de4d-41a5-8f89-953ba9e959bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Disclosing nature's potential", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdcd0944808f8906f9ecf792a7eb3e312fc201e98956e2a4450ced912ceb7ead"}, "2": {"node_id": "24eaccbe-8bc6-452f-97fc-1dfb3bf4b1cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc718fef81c4795d7dfc2529fd588a3ce78608081fa0b58980295bd5df65165a"}}, "hash": "b13e9bdaeb0b48c28b8f51be41fdbf197ebc8afdec0aa796224a87d7c732f196", "text": "CDP has the world\u2019s largest, most comprehensive set of companies\u2019 self-reported environmental data, which is utilized by investors, policymakers and purchasing organizations to make informed decisions and drive action.

Until now no systematic assessment was conducted on the extent to which nature-related risks, opportunities, impacts and responses are reported on by companies across all of the three CDP\u2019s questionnaires (on climate, forests and water). This report seeks to address this important gap. In recognition of the need to adopt a more holistic approach to address the climate challenge, as well the importance of other environmental challenges in their own right, CDP is now looking to increase the ability of its questionnaires to capture the interconnectedness of environmental themes, with an expanded focus on nature. This is a process that it is now initiating jointly with IUCN, which is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. In this report, CDP and IUCN aim to set the baseline for future assessments by analyzing, through the 9,617 companies responding to the CDP\u2019s questionnaires on climate, forests and water in 2020, the extent to which reporting companies are currently considering nature-related risks, opportunities, impacts and responses. Through a selection of case-studies, the report also aims to identify some of the steps that companies have already begun to take to enhance nature within their own operations. This effort comes in the context of the growing international recognition of not only the range of risks that are posed by a deteriorating climate and nature, but also the increasing appreciation worldwide that investing in nature and nature-based solutions (NbS)7 can help to tackle both the climate and biodiversity crises in an integrated manner. This was seen, for example, in the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit, the 2020 Leaders Pledge for Nature, and, more recently, in the ministerial communiques on environment and climate released at the 2021 G7 and G20 summits. Business leaders, on their part, are also increasingly appreciating the reliance that their operations and supply chains have on healthy ecosystems, and the contribution that the latter can make in building their resilience8. There is today an enormous opportunity for all actors, including companies, to effectively deploy NbS to help address major societal challenges, such as climate change, human health, water and food security, and disaster risk reduction. A key way to connect business directly with nature can be through the implementation of NbS. It has been estimated, for example, that transitioning to a nature-positive economy can unlock annual business opportunities worth US$10 trillion by transforming the food, land, and ocean use systems that are responsible for almost 80% of nature loss, whilst creating 395 million new jobs by 20309. These jobs are also more likely than jobs in business-as-usual corporate models to be resilient and offer the opportunity for better livelihoods. Indeed, a number of companies have already begun to implement or support initiatives that simultaneously help protect, manage and restore the natural environment while delivering tangible and sustainable benefits for people and their bottom-lines. But, as this report concludes, there is still a significantly long way to go. The remaining sections of the report are structured as follows: Section 2 analyzes the 9,617 responses made through CDP\u2019s 2020 questionnaires and presents the key findings. Section 3 presents some case studies of potential NbS implementation by CDP respondents to date. Section 4 presents the main conclusions.

Geneva: World Economic Forum. 7 CLIMATE AND NATURE-RELATED RISKS, OPPORTUNITIES, IMPACTS AND RESPONSES Businesses face serious nature-related risks due to the significant dependencies that their economic activities have on the natural environment and its services. Together, the three largest sectors that are highly dependent on nature generate close to US$8 trillion of gross value added (GVA): construction (US$4 trillion); agriculture (US$2.5 trillion); and food and beverages (US$1.4 trillion). Therefore, business leaders have a crucial role to play in putting nature at the core of their corporate processes and decision-making and systematically identifying, assessing, mitigating, and disclosing nature-related risks to avoid severe consequences11. With proper planning, design and implementation, businesses can build resilient green supply chains and generate jobs and achieve people- and nature-positive development that can help strengthen the resilience of our societies and economies in the face of future environmental, economic, and health shocks. Whilst business generates the majority of jobs and economic activity, business-related activities also often cause direct negative impacts on climate and nature through their supply chains and different industry operations.

How does disclosure lead to action? This section analyses the responses made by 9,617 companies to CDP\u2019s questionnaires on forests, water security, and climate in 2020 to provide an overview of the current trends and patterns in corporate disclosure on nature. To reach the results presented below, we selected questions with similar themes across all questionnaires, identified climate and nature-related response options, and analyzed them. A more detailed description of the methodology used in this report is provided in Annex 1. DATA FROM CDP\u2019S DISCLOSURES Corporate disclosure of comparable and consistent environmental information is the foundation for transformative action. It can help accurately account for both risks and impacts of economic activities and in so doing, support the green transition. Such information helps stakeholders including investors, large buyers, policy actors, civil society and consumers make smarter decisions and increase their expectations of companies with respect to their environmental performance. This in turn compels companies to act. CDP\u2019s corporate data is shared across multiple investment platforms, as well as with top global purchasers. This means that by reporting to CDP, companies are able to show their investors, their buyers and their customers that they are preparing for the future, cutting costs and building resilience, and comply with environmental regulation. With greater insight, these companies are taking early action to tackle climate change, deforestation and water security, and the risks of continuing business as usual. Environmental disclosure is a fundamental tool for tracking the global economy\u2019s shift towards a sustainable future and providing the knowledge and the confidence to further raise our collective ambition. 8 Risk Category Number of Occurrences Percentage of Total Extreme weather events or natural disasters 1948 65.4% Changes in precipitation and variability in weather patterns 566 19.0% Rising temperatures 345 11.6% Water stress or scarcity 43 1.4% Rising sea levels 41 1.4% Ecosystem vulnerability 16 0.5% Water quality 11 0.4% Climate-related risks Nature-related risks Other 12\ufffd CDP\u2019s\ufffdquestionnaire\ufffduses\ufffdthe\ufffdspecific\ufffdterm\ufffd\u2018risk\ufffddriver\u2019\ufffdto\ufffddescribe\ufffdthe\ufffdcause\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdrisk.\ufffdFor\ufffdexample,\ufffdfloods\ufffdare\ufffda\ufffdrisk\ufffddriver,\ufffdand\ufffdthe\ufffdeconomic\ufffdand\ufffdfinancial\ufffdlosses\ufffdresulting\ufffdfrom\ufffdthem\ufffdare\ufffdthe\ufffdrisk\ufffd to the company. 13\ufffd \u201cSubstantive\ufffdfinancial\ufffdor\ufffdstrategic\ufffdimpact\u201d\ufffdis\ufffddefined\ufffdindividually\ufffdby\ufffdeach\ufffdcompany,\ufffdin\ufffda\ufffdcorresponding\ufffdquestion\ufffdin\ufffdCDP\u2019s\ufffdquestionnaires. 14\ufffd Risks,\ufffdas\ufffdwell\ufffdas\ufffdopportunities,\ufffdimpacts\ufffdand\ufffdresponses\ufffdin\ufffdthe\ufffdsubsections\ufffdbelow,\ufffdthat\ufffdcould\ufffdnot\ufffdbe\ufffdclearly\ufffdidentified\ufffdas\ufffdclimate\ufffdor\ufffdnature-related\ufffdhave\ufffdbeen\ufffdclassified\ufffdas\ufffd\u201cother\u201d. 15 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC (2021).

CDP asked companies to identify risks12 with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on their business13.

This shows that the companies that are assessing their risks are largely aware of how environmental issues may pose risks to their business operations. Among the companies that identified climate and nature-related risks, by far the most commonly disclosed risks were climate-related risks such as \u2018extreme weather events/natural disasters\u2019, with 65%, followed by \u2018changes in precipitation and variability in weather patterns\u2019 at 19%, and \u2018rising temperatures\u2019 at 11%. Table 1: Types of climate and nature-related risks identified by disclosing companies With mounting evidence today that these risks are increasing in both frequency and intensity due to climate change15, these responses show that the private sector recognizes that climate change is a core challenge for the future viability of their business operations. However, what is noteworthy here is that in contrast to over 97% of these total responses identifying climate-related risks, only 0.5% of the total responses identified a more explicitly nature-related risk (i.e. ecosystem vulnerability) as having a substantial strategic or financial impact on their business. While this may be due, in part, to the fact that more companies made disclosures under the climate questionnaire than the forests and water security questionnaires, and to the specific options that respondents were offered, it nevertheless suggests the greater recognition amongst the reporting companies, at this point, of the potential strategic or financial impact that climate- related risks, rather than nature-related risks, can have on their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a82ad218-8058-48dc-8ac7-a2de30d64feb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a82ad218-8058-48dc-8ac7-a2de30d64feb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Disclosing nature's potential", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "507c5e97ccf873460b2cb43adcb5a979bfdd311b26c996a38570b4d05e3da6bf"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae62de91-5fb7-4025-9798-692344457245", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74f51eb581792fe745a74577fbd9c01d413b66268ddcbf93f82120776e7799b3"}}, "hash": "c4e868e3ecd0c4903465cc0baa42142b94a3c3aaf6d0d9ea8d0a45ae400af030", "text": "businesses. Key findings 1. Disclosing companies are reporting greater risks from climate than nature Source: CDP 2020 data 9 Opportunity Category Number of companies17 Percentage of Total Increased resilience to impacts of climate change 543 66.5% Reduced water usage and consumption 140 17.1% Increased demand for certified or sustainable materials 111 13.6% Sustainable agricultural intensification 7 0.9% Increasing green investment 4 0.5% Enabling natural resource management/ reducing consumption 3 0.4% Preventing deforestation and reducing emissions 2 0.2% Climate-related risks Nature-related risks Other 2. Disclosing companies report few nature-related opportunities As with risks, CDP also asked companies to identify opportunities with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on their business. Examples of climate and nature-related opportunities included those listed in Table 2. Other opportunities that could be reported were, for example, increased shareholder value, increased security of production system, shift in consumer preferences, among others. Among the 2,570 companies disclosing any type of opportunity, 22% reported climate and nature-related opportunities. This shows that, while companies recognize environmental risks to their business, they are largely still not fully appreciating the potential benefits of working with nature. Companies in some sectors which have a high impact and high dependency on nature, such as Food, Beverage and Agriculture (39%), and Materials (30%), are more active in reporting climate and nature-related opportunities. But even in these sectors, there is a lot of room for a stronger reflection of nature-related opportunities16. Within the subset of companies disclosing climate and nature-related opportunities, \u2018increased resilience to impacts of climate change\u2019 (66%) is the most commonly reported opportunity by companies, followed by \u2018reducing water consumption\u2019 (17%) and \u2018sourcing sustainable materials\u2019 (14%). As can be seen in Table 2, companies disclosing nature-related opportunities, by contrast, account for just over 15%, showing that even among companies recognizing environmental opportunities, nature-related opportunities remain largely unreported, if not untapped. As with risks, this could be a consequence of more companies disclosing under the climate questionnaire, but it nevertheless indicates a trend of companies largely overlooking nature-related opportunities to date. Table 2: Types of climate and nature-related opportunities identified by disclosing companies 16 It should be noted that nature-related opportunities make up a small proportion of the number of total opportunities in the CDP questionnaire (for example, in the water questionnaire, only 1 of 20 options is a nature-related opportunity); this limits the options companies can select and must therefore also be kept in mind. 17 The same company might report more than one opportunity.

Drivers of project implementation Compliance with company voluntary commitments Main partnerships and engagement WWF A Forests Timber A A Climate Water security CASE STUDIES OF COMPANIES IMPLEMENTING POTENTIAL NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS (NBS) AND OTHER NATURE-RELATED INTERVENTIONS It is important to note that NbS approaches should not only be understood solely through the lens of climate; biodiversity underpins the delivery of many ecosystem services in the short term and supports the health and resilience of ecosystems in the long term and must therefore be a key element of all NbS alongside human well-being, as also called for in the IUCN definition21. When appropriately designed, managed, and governed, NbS for water, for instance, can provide approximately 1.4 billion people with clean and safe drinking water, saving US$140 billion/year22. NbS can be an effective way of strengthening natural systems\u2019 capacity to process a range of wastes and pollutants, not just greenhouse gases. They can also be an effective way of protecting and restoring natural systems that underpin economic activity, for example. The findings of the previous section indicate that there is still much to be done for businesses to strengthen recognition of nature-related considerations in their assessments and reporting of environmental risks, opportunities, impacts and responses. Some companies, however, are developing important initiatives towards better integrating nature in their operations.

CDP scoring measures the comprehensiveness of disclosure, awareness and management of environmental risks and best practices associated with environmental leadership, such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets. 13 Motivation for action In South Africa, where Mondi owns and manages plantation forests, freshwater resources are under critical stress, with water demand expected to exceed supply by 17% by 2030 if current trends continue. This is a risk for land users and places pressure on South Africa's (SA) economy. For freshwater ecosystems, the main risk is the hydrological impact of Mondi\u2019s forestry's water use (water quantity) and the impact of upstream land users and Mondi\u2019s own forestry operations on water quality. For this reason, Mondi has voluntarily sponsored the previously named Mondi Wetlands Program since 2001. The partnership played a key role in catalysing government-led Working for Wetlands Program in the early 2000s. Working with conservation agencies, Mondi became the first large landowner to work on rehabilitating degraded wetlands in the country. Implementation Mondi currently manages about 15,000 ha of wetlands within its own and leased land properties in South Africa. In 2014, Mondi extended the relationship with WWF through a global partnership (2014-2020), broadening its", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebe4bb82-9ee6-4cd8-9421-158f9e2d7876": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebe4bb82-9ee6-4cd8-9421-158f9e2d7876", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Disclosing nature's potential", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bce5ba0f5037169de93e7306cc6475b3eddcbdfe4897451e2dd44d6d15103902"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ac61e06-49a8-46f1-973d-c34739691c4b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79dd0719e8cf44521b83abef912e92985781edfedaac8f1b04b849babf51cf89"}}, "hash": "e141aa542dfe52358070827d40a4fa50cc3dd4434a1f2f57883226bdfbc53039", "text": "work from wetlands conservation to promoting freshwater stewardship beyond the boundaries of its own plantations to include the agricultural sector and small forest growers. Now renamed the WWF-Mondi Water Stewardship Partnership (WWF-MWP), it aims to maintain or enhance the values and resilience of ecological infrastructure (rivers, wetlands, and ecological networks) at a landscape scale in strategic water source areas. This integrated, landscape-based approach will help develop improved policies and management practices and help address conflicts over land and water use while maintaining critical ecosystem services in the landscape. Over the past three years, WWF and Mondi have worked collaboratively with farmers and government in the uMhlathuze catchment to strengthen water security for the Richards Bay city. While this project is ongoing, its initial success has supported WWF, Mondi and other partners to begin adapting the uMhlathuze model for the uMkhomazi catchment, which ultimately provides water to one of South Africa\u2019s largest cities, the economic hub of Durban. Reported results The first significant wetland rehabilitation success was measured at Mondi's Zoar wetland in 1999, which had been drained for dryland agriculture and remained unflooded for 60 years. The partnership initiated a major rehabilitation operation. Once completed, in less than a month the entire wetland area of 450 hectares had flooded for the first time in six decades. Conservationists witnessed the return of white-faced ducks, the endangered crowned cranes, and other wetland birds, while wetland plant species sprouted. The partnership has helped develop various technical and social tools to enable wetland management practices, such as providing guidance to landowners with practical information on how to assess, manage and rehabilitate their wetlands.

Main partnerships and engagement French Government, Cornell University Danone CASE STUDY 2: REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE Motivation for action Danone's businesses are directly related to major agricultural commodities. Climate change, through changes in weather patterns, more variability in seasonal weather, increasing temperatures, etc., can induce changes in resources, leading to reduced availability of key commodities including raw materials such as milk, which is the main raw material purchased by Danone on a value basis. As a response to climate and water security-related risks and as a response to increased consumer demand for more sustainable products, Danone is currently engaged in the implementation of regenerative agriculture (RA) practices within its supply chain, with actions focused mainly on soils and water. Implementation RA is an approach that regenerates soil, increases biodiversity, protects water in terms of quantity and quality, and enhances carbon sequestration in the soil, notably through fertilizer management. Danone works directly with farmers to co-manage action plans and promote farming practices that make it possible to limit the use of mineral fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemical products. The company reported carrying out RA activities in the United States, France, Morocco, Kenya, Spain, and Mexico. Danone has the ambition to source 100% of ingredients produced in France from RA by 2025.

The company is also working with suppliers to help them develop RA systems that are more water-efficient and improve productivity. RA practices help to preserve the water cycle, notably in the highest-risk areas of its supply chain, maximizing water efficiency and preserving quality. RA also has a role to play in the reduction of water contamination by reducing the usage of fertilizers and pesticides. In Mexico and Morocco, two of the most important production areas for strawberries, Danone is promoting regenerative agriculture practices with farmers. Training, technical support, and financial incentives to improve water management at farm level are provided to reduce the quantity of water used and secure the right quality. Reported results By transitioning to RA practices, like reducing soil tillage, covering soil by crops all year long, and crop association to continuously improve it, farmers can take all benefits of a healthy soil to sustain good productivity with fewer inputs. Danone also identifies RA as an opportunity to increase resilience and generate more revenues through increased production capacity. Scaled-up RA pilots in the US, France, and Mexico show strong potential impact in reducing the volatility of commodity prices, lower need for chemical intrants, better crops rotations, and stronger resilience against water scarcity. These actions also contribute to protect farms' yield. Additionally, The Danone Ecosystem Fund supports the transformation of agricultural practices in the company's supply chain through 36 projects across the world. For example, the 'Les 2 Pieds sur Terre' initiative aims to help farmers in France reduce their carbon footprint while increasing revenue and leveraging innovative financing tools. Regenerative agriculture practices in Kenya, France, and Spain for instance, show an increase of time resistance of crops to droughts up to five or six weeks, protecting farms' yield and securing supply even in times of water scarcity. In Mexico, Danone helped farmers improve water quality by reducing fertilizer run-off in ground and surface water, with a 15% increase in the biofertilizer ratio and a 15% reduction in pesticide use. Livelihoods have improved as a result, with an average 30% net income increase for the farmers. These practices improve farmers working conditions and relationships with their ecosystem and result in a more sustainable farming activity and water management. 16 Type of activity Ecosystem conservation and restoration 2020 CDP Scores Where is implementation taking place?

Brazil Environmental issues addressed Deforestation Environmental and other benefits reported Biodiversity loss reduction; protection of springs; support to environmental awareness in communities. Reported results 32,855 ha of restored forests. 151 springs under restoration, 960 seedlings planted with 543 people engaged. Drivers of project implementation Regulatory compliance, certifications, and voluntary commitments. Main partnerships and engagement The Nature Conservancy (TNC) Suzano Papel & Celulose CASE STUDY 4: ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION AND WATER SPRING PROTECTION IN BRAZIL Motivation for action The Brazilian Forestry Code (Law 12.651 / 2012) requires the restoration of protected areas of the properties that possess Permanent Preservation (APPs) and Legal Reserve (RLs) areas. In order to adhere to legal requirements and its certifications and voluntary commitments, Suzano launched an Ecological Restoration Program in 2010. The Program contemplates projects in the biomes of the Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Amazon. Additionally, since 2017, Suzano has been voluntarily conducting a natural regeneration project known as Nascentes do Mucuri (Mucuri River Springs). The Muciri river originates in the northeast region of the state of Minas Gerais and discharges in the South of the state of Bahia, extending for 446 kilometers in an area of approximately 15,400 square kilometers and a population of 537,000. The activities of Suzano's ecological restoration program are grouped into implementation and maintenance packages. In general, there are five different restoration methods employed in all units. There may be adaptations to these methodologies, according to the particularities of the units, so that the operationalization of the methodologies is used in applicable procedures. They are: planting native species; conducting natural regeneration; exotic/invasive control; isolation. After carrying out the key activities in the ''to be restored\u201d areas, these are transferred to the status ''in the process of being restored\u201d and are subject to the monitoring and maintenance process. The determination of the need to carry out maintenance activities comes from the operational and ecological monitoring of the areas, carried out by specialized teams. Maintenance activities include the phase between the implementation of the B B Climate Water security B Forests Timber 19 reforestation and the formation of a forest environment and comprise all the activities carried out after the first month of the implantation of the area until it is considered \"restored\". The maintenance package includes activities such as covering fertilization and maintenance, chemical weeding, mowing, crowning, ant control, replanting, eliminating weeds, and adaptive management (thickening and enrichment plantations), among others. The Mucuri Springs project encourages the protection of the springs of the Mucuri River and its surroundings, while promoting the resilience of the water resources that are valuable to maintain the ecosystem services in the region. It also promotes environmental education and training of local producers to consolidate a culture of preservation in the region. The project has also supported more than 20 families to start the Agroecological Transition Plan, a methodology of Suzano's Rural Land Development Programme (PDRT - Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural Territorial).

Consequently, the company established in 2015 a program called Desa Makmur Peduli Api (DMPA) to work towards that goal by improving the welfare of the communities living in and around forest areas, while at the same time reducing the risks of illegal logging, forest fires, and land disputes. Implementation DMPA aims to empower and involve communities in their sustainable operations, to achieve landscape-scale sustainable forest management, as well as to improve the protection and restoration outcomes across APP and supplier operations. This participatory community engagement program also aims to improve livelihoods, transfer knowledge, improve collaboration, and create a virtuous circle of forest management. The program focused on increasing the numbers of households participating in the program, within the villages that are already involved. It also focused on connecting the program to markets, to maximize commercial opportunities, boost incomes and ensure communities are benefiting. In 2019, it focused on linking the market to farmers, and if appropriate, in certain cases to buy products directly from the community, for example, compost which is then provided directly to pulpwood suppliers for forestry applications. B- B Climate Water security B Forests Timber 21 In September 2019, APP began working with Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara (YKAN), the main partner of The Nature Conservancy in Indonesia. A program was established in the Sanggau District on the Indonesian island of Kalimantan. Core to this program is the \u2018SIGAP' approach, or the \u2018communities inspiring actions for change' which YKAN has been developing and supporting for almost 10 years in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. APP reports that the approach has been so successful that it has been adopted by the regional government. The program engages the local community on fire prevention and provides basic training and facilitation, with a focus on strengthening village governance (including improving village development and land use plans), improving livelihoods, and strengthening forest management. The work in improving village development plans is connected to the planning processes at the district and sub-district levels, creating a more holistic approach to sustainable development. Over the long-term APP hopes to be able to demonstrate improved community wellbeing, lowered poverty rate, and improved village development index (a metric used by the Government of Indonesia). Reported results By the end of 2019, 335 villages, with 21,907 households, had participated in the DMPA project. The encouragement of economic empowerment for women has attracted 82 women\u2019s groups to get involved. Based on interim observations reported by the company, two-thirds of DMPA villages have experienced better incomes for families due to the greater diversification of livelihoods, fewer forest fires, and better relations with industries. 22 Type of activity Natural Infrastructure, reforestation with native species 2020 CDP Scores Where is implementation taking place?

PMI suppliers provide the tree seedlings (from a range of local species), advice, and propagation materials to help ensure high tree survival rates and optimal growth rates. The growth of the barns is monitored and interventions are organized by PMI\u2019s suppliers where support from farmers is needed. Bamboo seedlings are also provided so that bamboo poles can be used as horizontal supports and for the barn roof skeleton in the future. In 2020 over 20,000 (20,760) bamboo plants have been distributed by PMI\u2019s supplier in Malawi. The six cases presented above show how some leading companies are gathering valuable experience in implementing and supporting programs that aim at conserving and restoring nature, with benefits for biodiversity, climate, and human welfare. These initiatives can be seen as an indication that the private sector is keen to support nature as part of its sustainability efforts. But to what extent these go beyond pilot corporate social responsibility efforts to systematically hardwire nature and NbS within their core business operations and supply chains will require further examination and evaluation. In particular, for these to count as NbS, will required them to be assessed against the IUCN Global Standard for NbSTM (see Box 1 below). Box 1: IUCN Global Standard on Nature-based SolutionsTM The IUCN Global Standard on Nature-based SolutionsTM, launched in 2020, aims to ensure the application of NbS is done in a standardized and high-quality manner, and its uptake tracked and measured for adaptive management. This Standard, which has eight criteria and 28 indicators, aims to equip users with a robust framework for designing and verifying NbS that yield the outcomes desired, in relation to one or more of the societal challenge(s) that it is designed to address. Developed as a facilitative Standard, it purposefully avoids a rigid normative framing with fixed, definitive thresholds of what NbS ought to achieve. Rather it is designed to support users to apply, learn and continuously strengthen and improve the effectiveness, sustainability and adaptability of their NbS interventions. Reference: IUCN (2020).

This trend is consistent regardless of whether companies are identifying and reporting on: (i) the risks that may have a substantive financial or strategic impact on their business; (ii) the opportunities that may have a substantive financial or strategic impact on their business; (iii) the detrimental impacts that they experience; or (iv) in their responses to those detrimental impacts. This suggests a considerable overlooking of nature at a global scale by them at present, and also a significant opportunity to raise corporate awareness, knowledge and capacity on this topic. Likewise, the case studies presented in this report also reflect a wide variation in the range of nature-related interventions and activities currently being undertaken by companies in CDP\u2019s network. The current available data, on which this report is based, makes it difficult to evaluate the extent to which these go beyond pilot-interventions, and represent a true mainstreaming of nature into the core business operations and value chains of these companies. Similarly, it is also not possible to assess the extent to which some of these might actually deliver credible NbS, consistent with the requirements of the IUCN Global Standard. Nevertheless, what they do illustrate is the growing interest and seriousness with which some companies are beginning to more systematically consider and integrate the well-being of nature and local communities within their respective areas of operation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64fe3a13-4ce7-457d-b0ee-77b37368cdad": {"__data__": {"id_": "64fe3a13-4ce7-457d-b0ee-77b37368cdad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Disclosing nature's potential", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "177cfe83fac547561a4ad33288c63aa6209253c5d68c92358dacdcefefffb220"}, "2": {"node_id": "96f0f36f-19f8-4aa7-a2c0-bded478571c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c88f3e838b914b2cd463453ee7f73788bd4d40eed00f463ba4c799726742bf0a"}}, "hash": "8752c696f3ecb6b01ccb2edd419853a5a9b3d57b026840bbe39ae324fdde0120", "text": "There is an enormous opportunity for companies to become a powerful catalyst for change by systematically incorporating nature-related considerations within their supply chains and business strategies, and by effectively deploying NbS wherever possible to help address major societal challenges, such as climate change, water and food security, and disaster risk reduction.

It is also critical that companies have suitable internal accountability mechanisms in place, as well as inclusive local stakeholder engagement plans, that take into consideration the local context in which they operate. In the face of the climate and biodiversity emergencies that are confronting humanity today, all actors have their part to play. Reducing impacts on nature and climate is a business imperative to ensure continued prosperity and well- being across the world. On their part, companies can and must raise their ambitions around nature and climate, in support of an inclusive net-zero and nature-positive world. By incorporating nature into their strategy, businesses can benefit through long-term viability of business models, cost savings, increases in operational efficiency, increased market shares, predictable and stable supply chains, better relationships with stakeholders and customers, and access to new markets, products and services24. It has been estimated, for example, that for every dollar spent on ecosystem restoration, between three and 75 dollars of economic benefits from ecosystem goods and services can be expected25. 24 Business for Nature (2021).

Businesses should identify and report on nature-related risks, opportunities, impacts and responses more systematically within their corporate environmental disclosures. { As this report has shown, companies responding to CDP\u2019s questionnaires do not, at present, appear to fully recognize or report on nature-related considerations in the overall risks, opportunities, impacts and responses that they identify. { This may be, in part, due to the way in which these questionnaires were designed. Going forward, future CDP questionnaires will aim, in consultation with IUCN, to engage on the nature-related dimensions of corporate disclosures in a more structured manner and to further support companies on this. { But companies need to also invest in collecting high-quality data on both their dependencies and impacts on nature. { The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is developing a risk management and disclosure framework for organizations to report and act on evolving nature-related risks, which aims to support a shift in global financial flows away from nature-negative outcomes and towards nature-positive outcomes. This will be important to contribute to and support. More businesses need to take concrete steps now to put in place science-based, nature-positive, net-zero strategies. This will require businesses to: { Assess their impacts and dependencies on nature to ensure they are committing and acting on the most material ones. { Commit to ambitious goals on both climate and nature, including by setting science-based targets that are aligned with internationally agreed goals. { Disclose their actions and progress against stated goals and invite independent third-party verification. Tracking progress in a transparent way will ensure that corporate promises are being translated into action in a credible manner. 1 2 Businesses should implement their nature/NbS-related plans and actions based on the best available international standards and guidance. { It is critical that companies not only understand their natural capital dependencies, but also have a detailed understanding of the local context in which they plan to implement NbS, including through inclusive local stakeholder consultations and engagement. { In their efforts to implement NbS, companies should aim to apply and adhere to the IUCN Global Standard for NbSTM. This will help to ensure quality assurance and enhance the credibility of their NbS interventions, in terms of providing benefits for both human well-being and biodiversity. 3 26 Governments should put in place enhanced policies to ensure more and better corporate environmental disclosures. { Corporate action needs to be transparently disclosed, communicated and tracked to measure and manage risk across the economy. { Voluntary action is not enough, and needs to be supplemented by mandatory disclosure requirements.

The objective was to have an integrated analysis (across the forests, water security and climate change responses) of important aspects related to nature. To do the analysis, the authors performed the following steps: a) Selected the questions and data points which provide the most useful insights on how responding companies approach nature. b) Selected which topics to analyse (risks, opportunities, impacts, etc.). c) Grouped the questions from the different questionnaires in clusters of questions that approach the same or similar topics.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6313e66-e0de-49de-99b1-4f574ca3c4dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6313e66-e0de-49de-99b1-4f574ca3c4dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Disclosing nature's potential", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d5b20d89ec91a2bcfc3b1d666730863cc10a51e0d04cd0e4d8d91124ac52c96"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8b38a5a-017b-4fb4-8a88-f495c602ac61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/disclosing-natures-potential", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f11b381be3504d9a3ea6d21e0749f849bd52e61157cf62e93ecdc2a993a20bbc"}}, "hash": "bfd9c98e887beba396af9a1a7cddb41d1ec925606cdd8e321d370200184c48b4", "text": "d) Formulated an overarching question that encompasses the topic being analysed, as in the example below: e) Compiled the datasets from the three themes according to the clusters identified and performed a quantitative analysis of the responses. The percentages present in this report have been calculated based on the number of valid responses to the questions, meaning that companies whose responses are indicated as \u201cQuestion not applicable\u201d or were blank, were not part of the denominator. It is important to highlight that, since it was not feasible to analyse the tens of thousands of free text response fields in CDP\u2019s data set, this report presents an analysis based on pre-defined dropdown options in the questionnaire. The results presented in this report might, therefore, underestimate the extent of nature-related action by disclosing companies. In a few cases, companies may report nature-related actions in free text fields of the questionnaire, while choosing non-nature related response options. As a hypothetical example, in question W4.3a, a company may choose the response option \u201cIncreased sales of existing products/services\u201d, which is not classified as a nature-related answer. But in the free-text response field \u201cCompany-specific description & strategy to realize opportunity\u201d, the company might describe a nature-related action. Another important caveat is that CDP\u2019s questionnaires, even the forests and water security questionnaires, are still predominantly climate focused. As an example, there are no direct questions about NbS in the forests questionnaire. This is another reason why the figures reached by the analysis might underestimate, to some extent, the nature- related responses of companies.

Acknowledgements IV Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities V Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities Natural ecosystems in cities (green spaces and water bodies) provide an essential group of ecosystem services (e.g. water supply, local climate regulation, flood regulation, air purification, recreation) to human populations. Our knowledge and understanding of these ecosystem services increases year by year, alongside our understanding of the challenges faced by cities and how nature can be used in a positive way to tackle them through the integration of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in planning and development. Mediterranean cities and towns share many similar challenges related to climate, geography and culture. Many of these challenges stem from rapid population growth and urban expansion, mainly in coastal areas during the 20th Century. To add to these pressures, the impacts of climate change, such as changes in temperature and precipitation, are now putting extra stress on urban human well-being. As our understanding of the ecological, public health and economic consequences of this urbanisation grows, the case for \u2018greening\u2019 cities \u2013redesigning them with NbS at their heart\u2013 becomes ever stronger. The new global IUCN global NbS Standard, launched on July 2021, responds to the increasing focus on NbS in development planning and land management. The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) along with the IUCN Members in the region and key strategic partners are committing to promote Nature-based Solution (NbS) as approved in Resolution 34 \u201cThe implementation of Nature- based Solutions in the Mediterranean Basin\u201d by the IUCN constituency in the framework of the World Conservation Congress 2020. IUCN-Med is working to build capacity for design and implementation of NbS, with a special focus on Mediterranean cities. In 2020, TECNALIA was commissioned to support the assessment of good practices already identified in the publication \u201cNature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities\u201d (2019) against the criteria Foreword The result of this exercise allowed the identification of both the NbS Standard\u2019s potential in Mediterranean cities, and challenges in its use that must be resolved. of the IUCN global Standard on NbS in order to make the first practical assessment against real projects and strategies (already implemented or in the design stages) from Mediterranean cities. The result of this exercise allowed the identification of both the Standard\u2019s potential in Mediterranean cities, and challenges in its use that must be resolved. The overall lessons learned from the assessment point to the need for continuing improvements in practices, especially the systematic evaluation of options, more inclusive public involvement, incorporating adaptive management, and establishing monitoring systems for better reporting on the potential benefits of NbS in urban contexts. This report contributes to an evidence base on the benefits of NbS to cities in the Mediterranean region. However, we recognise that we are still at the early stages of developing sufficient knowledge to enable the development of city- specific NbS strategies at bigger scales.

(NbS - see fig 1). In recent years, this concept is emerging as a central tool in urban planning and development. For example, the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 programme has developed a specific research and innovation agenda, funding many projects regarding the effective use of NbS to meet societal challenges in cities. In parallel, the Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development notes the multiple challenges facing cities in the region (Objective 3, Table 1): excessive land uptake; rapid degradation of architectural heritage; aquifer pollution; inefficient waste management; atmospheric air pollution and noise; and the cumulative effect of all these factors on the environment and on human health. For those reasons, a new, sustainable and creative approach to planning and managing Mediterranean urban regions is urgently needed. NbS can play a crucial role in addressing these challenges, providing a multitude of positive environmental and socio-cultural functions: mitigating environmental pressures, improving aesthetics, reducing the urban heat island effect, mitigating flooding, and providing direct or indirect urban ecosystem services. In response to this emerging body of policy and practice, IUCN has developed the first-ever Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions (IUCN, 2020) to help users design, implement and verify NbS MSSD Objectives SDGs 1. Ensuring sustainable development in marine and coastal areas 2. Promoting resource management, food production and food security through sustainable forms of rural development 3.

This Standard, introduced in July 2020, provides clear parameters for defining NbS and a common framework to help benchmark progress. This complements the IUCN\u2019s global initiative named IUCN Urban Alliance, which aims to create greener, more liveable cities that will improve the health, well-being and prosperity of people living in urban areas, launched in 2018. This initiative will include development of a City Nature Index, providing a standardised way for cities to measure the quality of their underlying stock of natural resources, known as \u2018natural capital\u2019.

Based on the feedback of actual and potential NbS users, it has been developed to be flexible and adaptable, purposefully avoiding a rigid normative framing with fixed, definitive thresholds of what NbS ought to achieve. Rather the Standard is designed to support users to apply, learn and continuously strengthen and improve the effectiveness, sustainability and adaptability of their NbS interventions. 2 \u00a9 IUCN 5 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities Figure 2: Illustrating the interconnections between the 8 criteria of the NbS Standard (IUCN, 2020) \u00a9 RADIOKAFKA | DREAMSTIME.COM The Standard consists of 8 criteria and 28 indicators Summarised in Figure 2 and Table 2, (IUCN, 2020) 6 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities CRITERION FOCUS 1. NbS effectively address societal challenges The purpose of this Criterion is to ensure that the NbS is designed as a response to a societal challenge(s) that has been identified as a priority by those who are or will be directly affected by the challenge(s). All stakeholders, especially rights holders and beneficiaries of the NbS, must be involved in the decision-making process used for identifying the priority challenge(s) (Criterion 5). 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale The purpose of this Criterion is to encourage NbS designs that recognise the complexity and uncertainty that occur in living dynamic land and seascapes. Scale applies not only to the biophysical or geographic perspective but also to the influence of economic systems, policy frameworks and the importance of cultural perspectives. 3. NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity NbS are derived as goods and services from ecosystems, and therefore strongly depend on the health of an ecosystem. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem change can have significant impacts on the functioning and integrity of the system. Therefore, NbS design and implementation must avoid undermining the integrity of the system and instead, proactively seek to enhance the functionality and connectivity of the ecosystem. Doing so can also ensure the long-term resilience and durability of the NbS. 4. NbS are economically viable The return on investment, the efficiency and effectiveness of the intervention, and equity in the distribution of benefits and costs are key determinants of success for an NbS. This Criterion requires that sufficient consideration is given to the economic viability of he intervention, both at the design stage and through monitoring the implementation. 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes This criterion requires that NbS acknowledge, involve and respond to the concerns of a variety of stakeholders, especially rights holders. Good governance arrangements are proven to not only reduce an intervention\u2019s sustainability risks, but also to enhance its social \u2018license to operate\u2019. Conversely inadequate governance provision for otherwise well-intended actions can adversely affect the legitimacy of benefit and cost sharing arrangements. 6. NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits Trade-offs in land and natural resource management is inevitable.

NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence This Criterion requires that NbS implementation plans include provisions to enable adaptive management as a response to uncertainty and as an option to effectively harness ecosystem resilience. A degree of uncertainty is inherent when managing most ecosystems due to theircomplex, dynamic and self-organising nature. This also means that ecosystems have greater resilience which confers a wider range of options to respond to unanticipated social, economic or climate events. 8.

The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation commissioned in 2020 TECNALIA to undertake an assessment of how the Standard could be put into practice by analysing 18 cases of Nature- based Solutions in Mediterranean cities. The purpose of the analysis was to assess to what extent these interventions met the standard, and in this way to identify particular opportunities and challenges for applying the standard in urban areas throughout the Mediterranean region. It is the first practical assessment of the Standard against real projects and strategies already implemented or in the design stages. It aimed to identify both the Standard\u2019s potential in Mediterranean cities, and challenges in its use that must be resolved. Assessment of the Standard in Mediterranean cities The practices were selected considering their even distribution across the Mediterranean geography, their representativeness within the Mediterranean climate region and its idiosyncrasies, climate risks, urban development, planning culture and systems, governance, etc, and at different scales from regional, city and district levels. The analysis sought to: Identify good practice examples in different in Mediterranean cities in terms of the NbS benefits and their contribution to the societal challenges using the criteria and set of indicators suggested by the Standard. Identify gaps in practices and explore opportunities for improving and enhancing NbS interventions and the implementation process.

What underlies these challenges is the need for the use of tools and processes to measure and value NbS and the benefits they deliver to allow comparison with other approaches so that effective prioritisation can be made. In particular, prioritisation must take a long-term perspective, especially considering maintenance and renewal (i.e. a \u2018whole-life-cost\u2019 approach) and considers the \u2018externalities\u2019 inherent in each option so", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12f3768a-94fa-491a-812f-0bcde212d249": {"__data__": {"id_": "12f3768a-94fa-491a-812f-0bcde212d249", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities...Executive summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ecf00f915bdf53175cbdcbb1038a943adb1981eaf232bfd83fd4ca7c3238eb4"}, "3": {"node_id": "2fdc2536-14d7-4b13-8bfc-93fe90ac9c22", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4dff3c4822595de5dd0f292b036f35e490861f88cc313dc4e36426180a1b240"}}, "hash": "6f150e5f357084e265647ea17e21b56eda69778222d998d3741a25677cc6f3d6", "text": "that efficient trade-offs can be made.

MONITOR is fundamental to improvement in design and management. In the case of adaptive management, in addition to the use of these decision-making tools must be added the question of how to deal with the uncertainty of environmental change. Basing decision-making on a robust \u2018theory of change\u2019 is a helpful tool promoted by the Standard for navigating change over time. As with any auditing system, having rigorous procedures for measuring and monitoring is essential. This requirement is often seen as an extra burden. However, that is to overlook its strategic value. The ability to measure and monitor is fundamental to improvement in design and management and ultimately to securing a higher value of benefits for society. For all these reasons the Standard stresses the importance of identifying and documenting the benefits and costs of NbS (and of other options, especially \u2018no change\u2019) and who receives and who pays them. 10 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities For the evaluation a total of 28 indicators were used, grouped in 8 categories and criteria based on the IUCN Standard.

C O M 13 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities Cities in the Mediterranean region are spatially diverse, ranging in size from small and medium sized towns and cities to megacities. Historically they followed a compact form, largely in response to the Mediterranean climate, with high population density and narrow streets interspersed with open squares. The form of cities is also influenced by landscape, with cities confined to a narrow coastal strip by mountains being a common feature. There are a large number of port cities, having an industrial core. Many of these areas are now being redeveloped for housing, as new port infrastructure is developed on the urban fringes. From the 20th century many cities have expanded rapidly in a more dispersed model, comprising lower density development expanding outward along arterial transport corridors. This development is often poorly planned, with little consideration of open space and \u2018active\u2019 transport needs (walking and cycling). Coastal resort development represents a different type of urbanisation, often linear with a high density of tourist accommodation on the shoreline but also with large areas of open space adjacent to the sea (e.g. Boulevards, recreational parks etc). Spatial features of Mediterranean cities and the need for NbS These modern developments are not adapted to climate in the same way as the historic urban forms, and so require large amounts of energy for cooling, and large proportions of land devoted to transport infrastructure. Their transformation of the landscape has important consequences for water management, especially in the context of climate change. Water shortages and salinisation of coastal aquifers are already issues of concern. Similarly, biodiversity is depleted. Traditional food production systems such as olive and orange groves and small farms, often relatively high in biodiversity, are lost. Overall, ecosystem services once provided by natural and farmed landscapes are not replaced in urban forms of land use. Nature-based Solutions should aim to address these losses.

In 2011 the Union for the Mediterranean called for an Urban Development Strategy for Mediterranean cities \u2013 the resulting guidance framework sets out the main challenges and suggested responses for urban areas of 15-20,000 inhabitants or more. The Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development (2016-2025) in the framework of the Barcelona Convention recognised the particular challenges represented by cities in the region, especially regarding energy use, waste management, food security, and overall resilience to human-made risks and hazards. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and Land Based Sources of pollution (LBS) Protocols of the Barcelona Convention call for the protection of natural coastal zones, recognising the continuing impacts of urban areas on the natural environment of the Mediterranean. Local governments have a strong leadership role to play. Strategic spatial planning and urban development planning are powerful tools for guiding the renewal of Mediterranean urban areas to meet the challenges described. These processes, related stakeholder engagement and public participation, and the programming, monitoring and enforcement of implementation all fall to local governments for leadership. Networks, such as MedCities, have been established to promote good practices and knowledge sharing amongst urban professionals in local governments around the Mediterranean. The IUCN global NbS Standard provides a tool to support Mediterranean cities to meet the common challenges identified by the Union for the Mediterranean in its guidance framework for sustainable cities, and the urban objectives set out in the Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development. These challenges are complex and interrelated, arising from profound demographic, environmental and economic change, and must be tackled in an integrated way. This is an approach to which NbS are well suited, delivering multiple benefits, and which the NbS Standard facilitates. Given the status of NbS as a new approach, its potential must be established through well designed and implemented applications. The Standard provides a robust framework to do this, based on internationally agreed Principles. This works at both design and verification stages: Design: using the standard to help assess the various options available to tackle the particular problem that needs to be solved Verification: confirming that a design adheres to NbS principles, which may be important for funders, political leaders, or the public. Design and verification both take place at different scales, compare a city-wide green infrastructure strategy with the design of a public park for example, but nevertheless common standards can be applied to ensure quality and consistency in the planning and implementation of NbS. The IUCN global NbS Standard provides a tool to support Mediterranean urban areas to meet the common challenges identified by the Union for the Mediterranean in its guidance framework for sustainable cities. 15 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities How might the Standard BE USED IN PRACTICE TO ACHIEVE these goals? The assessment for use of the NbS Standard in Mediterranean cities demonstrates its value as: A STRATEGIC PLANNING TOOL The Standard can be used as a \u2018quick scan\u2019 diagnostic tool in the early stages of strategic planning, whether for a city-wide spatial strategy or a single neighbourhood or regeneration site, to ensure the multiple benefits of NbS are considered and integrated into policies. Later in the process the Standard can be used to evaluate the policy, prior to final review, and during implementation. A PROJECT DESIGN GUIDE Again, the NbS Standard can be used at different stages in the design of specific interventions, such as the design of a new housing or industrial complex, or the renewal of a transport corridor. A quick scan early in the project ensures NbS are fully considered and integrated into the design. Later evaluations can ensure the final design meets its aims, and that implementation is delivering the desired outcomes. A VERIFICATION TOOL At both design stage and following implementation, the NbS Standard provides an evaluation and assessment framework to measure outcomes across the seven societal challenges. In this way the Standard can be embedded as a learning process within urban planning and green infrastructure management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63fc2924-5272-439b-b0ac-ecf867f8123b": {"__data__": {"id_": "63fc2924-5272-439b-b0ac-ecf867f8123b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities...Executive summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95196ee0fc2a496aa9e4b617694d4aad819f88d862a38a335ad651a9932e6649"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0291d0a-5fb0-496b-b442-2f2040f7f884", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea642656f93fc15b5a2d003e1a33cca342ae9ffc94d7794c4ef8e1ff410bb923"}}, "hash": "91f51c0e71104b659577fecf951d5827c2080ab9fbde705fd4eb434dbd0315d1", "text": "\u00a9 JOYFULL | DREAMSTIME.COM 16 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities Contributing to the creation of more liveable urban environments, improving public satisfaction with the environment.

What BENEFITS does use of the Standard promise FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS? As a systematic design and evaluation tool the NbS Standard provides many benefits, including: Relevance of NbS Standard for urban authorities As NbS enter into policy and are adopted by projects on the ground there is a pressing need for greater clarity and precision of what the concept entails and what is required for it to be deployed successfully. Without this, the application of NbS could result in inconsistent and ungrounded applications. The Standard provides a systematic learning framework so that lessons can improve the application of NbS, leading to greater confidence in NbS among decision makers and supporting further innovation. Similarly, in the absence of such a Standard, NbS may remain a general concept, only marginally contributing to the pressing sustainability needs and not realising its full potential. Consequently, the Standard provides an opportunity to create a global user community that helps guide implementation on the ground, accelerates policy development, and creates a scientific evidence base on NbS. Through the Standard, NbS will be based on a common understanding of its interpretation and a shared vision for a just and sustainable world. The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation is committing to promote the NbS Standard in the Mediterranean, including capacity building in NbS with special focus on Mediterranean cities. 17 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities Increasingly a knowledge of societal challenges is used as the basis for prioritisation of governance and action at all scales. This is reflected in the UN Sustainable Development Goals and in European Union policy, for example. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the contribution that NbS can make to the specific societal challenges addressed by the IUCN Global NbS Standard (see also summary table 3 on page XX). More information can be found in the report \u2018Nature-based Solutions to address global societal challenges\u2019. And the IUCN report \u2018Nature based Solutions in the Mediterranean Cities\u2019 provides 50 examples from the Mediterranean region. Climate change mitigation and adaptation The effects of climate change on urban areas are diverse. Increasing global temperatures will lead to more intense heatwaves and more extreme weather patterns. These effects call for more cooling (and potentially more carbon emissions as a result \u2013 the sort of feedbacks to be avoided) to reduce heat stress, and modifications to infrastructure to cope better with heavy rainfall, and storm surges on the coasts. Increased temperatures and sun intensity increase the negative effects of air pollution, especially from traffic. There are NbS to all of these effects. For example: Low energy cooling - green infrastructure provides shade and evaporative cooling (e.g. green roofs, green walls, trees). Water features also promote evaporative cooling (but the energy consumption of fountains or other pumped systems must be considered carefully). Tackling societal challenges with NbS in the urban context Drought and flooding. More extreme weather events require better urban water management.

In parts of the world, securing this type of protection has led to reduced insurance costs for coastal properties such as hotels and other elements of tourist economies. Urban food production has a part to play in reducing carbon emissions: shortening supply chains and therefore transport emissions; recycling food waste as compost (also reducing carbon emissions from methane emitted as food decomposes); and helping to protect and enhance soil quality and its capacity to store water. 6 18 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities Carbon sequestration is a vital part of our response to climate change. Urban trees can play an important role in capturing and storing carbon for decades, and so removing it from the atmosphere. Urban trees deliver a range of other benefits as well, and the concept of the \u2018urban forest\u2019 is gaining increasing attention as a NbS. Air quality. Higher temperatures and related changes in atmospheric conditions tends to decrease air quality. Plants are proven to be good at removing pollutants and improving air quality, by trapping particulate pollutants, performing as a physical barrier to the dispersal of pollutants (from highways for example) and by absorbing polluting gasses. Human health The natural environment, and more specifically ecosystems, the climate and biodiversity, are increasingly recognised as being influential determinants of human health, well-being and social cohesion. A 2016 report published by IUCN points to an established and diverse body of evidence detailing these complex linkages and their underlying mechanisms. The World Health Organisation estimates that 12-18% of all deaths in the WHO Europe region are linked to environmental factors. For example, according to the European Environment Agency, air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe. A range of chronic diseases (such as obesity, cardio-vascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes) that place great burdens on health services are linked to environmental quality and access to nature. \u00a9 FRANZ1212 | DREAMSTIME.COM 19 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities Several studies have focused on how the benefits of green space \u2018encounters\u2019 (whether active or passive) can influence health and well-being. These include improvements in environmental quality, such as heat regulation and noise abatement, the promotion of physical activity and associated Body Mass Index improvements, enhanced social interaction, social cohesion and perceived safety, and opportunities for spiritual wellbeing experiences. The WHO \u2018One Health\u2019 initiative promotes integrated decision-making to protect public health from systemic threats - such as infectious pandemics, antibiotic resistance, and food safety - in the mitigation of which NbS can play a part especially in urban environments which house most of the world\u2019s populations. Urban NbS for positive human health include public parks and gardens, the urban forest in its entirety (street trees, urban woodland etc), community gardens, and planted boulevards and other people- friendly transport corridors (\u2018green links\u2019). Food security Food security is one facet of the large inequalities experienced in most urban communities. As more of the world\u2019s population live in cities, price and availability of staple foods are increasingly dependent on long supply chains and international commodity markets. Access to a sufficiently varied diet to provide the full range of micronutrients needed for good health is limited by supply and cost - a challenge often leading to both obesity and malnutrition according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. NbS to urban food security include use of vacant land for food production, rooftop farming, and policies for allocation of land for food production in urban developments (e.g. community gardens). Food production can also be integrated with food waste management and wastewater management, reducing pollution and increasing the recycling of essential nutrients. These actions help to discourage soil sealing (e.g. paving over gardens for other uses), to improve rainwater infiltration and temporary storage so reducing flash flood risk and effects of drought, to limit pollution, waste and associated carbon emissions, to support improvements in health and well-being and community cohesion, and help to reduce inequality. Water security Water management in cities has a number of dimensions. Urbanisation typically reduces the infiltration of rainwater into the soil, because so much of the surface is sealed \u2013 mostly with concrete and tarmac for example. This has a number of important effects: Rainfall collects on the surface and rapidly enters gullies, drains and water courses. During heavy rainfall, which we increasingly experience with climate change, this often causes localised flooding and pollution. Pollution comes from hydrocarbons and dust washed off surfaces, and from the flooding of foul sewers.

In the past, most towns had little impact on recharge rates. However, with rapid urban expansion the area of cities has grown enormously. Their effect on aquifer recharge rates is therefore significant. Further, with urban expansion, the demand for water increases. With these two factors, coastal freshwater aquifers are severely depleted in many cases, leading to saltwater intrusion, harming their use for drinking water and food production. 20 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities NbS for enhanced water security include: use of porous hard surfaces and green roofs to allow rain water management where it falls rather than relying on its transportation through expensive underground drains; wetlands (permanent or ephemeral) to slow the flow of water, provide storage against drought, and remove pollutants from runoff; planting of urban trees to slow rates of rainfall runoff; and many more. Increasing attention is being paid in policy to the interlinkages between water, food and energy, and the circular economy, each of which provide different ways of thinking about NbS and what benefits they can deliver in an urban context. Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss The implementation of NbS to address the societal challenges above will help to prevent and reverse environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. This is important as research has shown the importance to the urban economy and society of the ecosystem services that are enjoyed as a result of healthy natural capital. The strategic mechanisms to strengthen this urban natural capital fall broadly into two related categories: Improved urban planning \u2013 to plan strategically for urban re-naturing by creating new green space, connecting green spaces, ensuring new development contains sufficient green space for community health and well-being, protecting the use of green space to optimise ecosystem service flows.

NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges that addressed are water security, climate change in terms of its co-benefits (green space, habitats and biodiversity, environmental quality including air quality and waste management). There is explicit reference to human health, linked to some environmental benefits and also aligned with social justice, cohesion and equity. In these terms also social development is considered. Finally, economic development is one of the goals of the intervention. 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale This intervention is informed by scale: that of the port in relation to the city, and the scale of the task to mitigate the impact of port activities. The port and city administrations have worked together to integrate various strategies and so maximise the benefits of the intervention. 3. NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity Phase 1 of the park implementation tackles the environmental degradation of industrial land directly, through the landscaping of the park. In a second phase more attention is paid to biodiversity gains and water security. 4. NbS are economically viable A cost benefit analysis is not available for assessment, and indeed in purely economic terms would be unfavourable. However, the port authority recognises the strategic benefits (which are difficult to value) for social and ecological sustainability. 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Stakeholders are identified, nevertheless their involvement in the process in terms of participation and decision making are not explained. The approach for decision making is based on co-governance or hybrid governance (mix of responsibilities between government and non-government actors). No citizenship or community involvement is identified, rather their interests have been represented by the city authorities. 6. NbS equitably balances trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits Whilst the intervention represents an inherent trade-off between commerce and public well-being, this has not been explicitly assessed. 7. NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence partial Regular monitoring for air quality and noise is in place (formal monitoring system and presence of monitoring/evaluation reports), but a more comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework is lacking. 8. NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context NbS practice has been included in the Strategic Plan of the Port of Alicante How well does the NbS meet the Standard\u2019s criteria and what challenges were encountered? How does the NbS meet the societal challenges? Most directly this NbS addresses: Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss through the transformation of derelict industrial land, and Human health through the mitigation of air, noise and visual pollution. As the Park is developed further progress is made (Phase 2) in relation to water security, climate change mitigation co-benefits, and co-benefits from improving community infrastructure. Indirectly this NbS contributes to socio-economic development by helping to mitigate the impacts of port operations on the surrounding community and so managing strategic risks for port management.

NbS effectively address societal challenges The main goals are explicit and well detailed in the documents regarding the Plan and its implementation programme. During the First Phase of the Plan a specific study was developed to analyse the provision of ecosystem services by the green areas of the city including: climate change adaptation (thermal regulation for instance), wellbeing (social interaction and nature contact), and environmental co-benefits in terms of acoustic and air quality improvements and biodiversity. Finally, positive economic impacts were reported.. 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale The Plan and implementation programmes have a holistic approach of Socio- ecological Systems where interactions between natural ecosystem and society are reported and analysed. The Plan acts as an umbrella for a number of initiatives and plans which are aligned and work towards a common vision of the City. Green infrastructure becomes an integrating element across different urban plans and policies, including risks from climate change. 3. NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The Plan is based on a detailed assessment of the green spaces of the City and their biodiversity. The Digital Atlas of Biodiversity provides a snapshot of the city\u2019s trees, green-space plants, birds, butterflies and vertebrate animals among others. It is meant to be updated every 5-10 years. Opportunities to enhance ecosystem integrity and connectivity are explicitly recognised in the plan. 4. NbS are economically viable partial A full cost benefit analysis has not been undertaken. However, this is being done for some specific elements of the plan, such as for parks management options 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes A participatory approach is used for the definition of the Plan. This process enriches the results and also increases the public awareness and maintenance of green infrastructure. Participants included multi-level government representatives, researchers and social, environmental and private institutions, direct and indirect stakeholders and civil society organisations. 6. NbS equitably balances trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits No evidence found in the assessment. At the strategic scale of this Plan assessment of trade-offs is highly complex. 7. NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence partial A complex mix of activities, linked to individual elements of the plan, contribute to the evidence base and its monitoring. An overall monitoring and evaluation plan is in place, contributing to an adaptive management approach. 8. NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The City is aware of lessons learned in the first phase of the plan and these are incorporated into phase 2, as appropriate. Through this plan green infrastructure and biodiversity is becoming a driver for urban policies regarding planning, public health, sustainability, social rights and culture. How well does the NbS meet the Standard\u2019s criteria and what challenges were encountered? How does the NbS meet the societal challenges? This plan responds to specific goals of the City, which are supported by a strong evidence base and widespread public and political support. It has undertaken systematic surveys, at neighbourhood level, of all urban spaces and biodiversity. It has engaged with diverse stakeholders and consulted widely on priorities and options to address them. The Plan performs the challenging task of integrating a diverse range of sectoral and thematic plans and programmes so as to maximise the benefits of natural capital for the city and its residents. It has elevated the status of biodiversity in city planning and management, and in the minds of the public. This provides a strong policy basis for the systematic adoption of NbS to address societal challenges.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eec182ee-94b1-46a0-89fe-3518a45e144f": {"__data__": {"id_": "eec182ee-94b1-46a0-89fe-3518a45e144f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities...Executive summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba6b8c9231bc3de5366bb3147e1c2e19ea75a0491aec03bb6842360b9e56a175"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a133a5f-d7e4-4828-9192-ce9bbc358712", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebd45b11c3c6da74f668eba37fa1846f325d8f99f35c2f72a4f04a8d89f1bbc7"}}, "hash": "cad82185bdf69921188deb31a54b0523b80f4ac3e1451046fd633fda058864ec", "text": "This provides a strong policy basis for the systematic adoption of NbS to address societal challenges.

Raising civil awareness of the importance of natural ecosystems through specific events and providing facilities for social gathering in urban nature (picnic spots and outdoor classrooms). It is conceptualized as a social hub. The whole park acts as a storm water filter collecting rainwater from dry river valleys. An extensive meadow at the lowest point allows the collected water to seep into the aquifer. An innovative water circulation system connects a series of ponds with the main lake. Collected rainwater is pumped back upstream and is recirculated through the valley. The water is ecologically cleansed by plants to make it safe.

NbS effectively address societal challenges Biodiversity and the conservation of wildlife is one of the key drivers of the intervention. In this sense, creating a natural urban ecosystem is the main goal of the practise. This specific goal is related to climate change and disaster risk which was the ethos behind the water management system. Social development is part of the societal challenges addressed in this case, since it is devoted to offering a social hub for social gathering and development of educational activities aligned with the goals of the park. 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale The Park is managed jointly by the Municipality of Jerusalem and SPNI, a nature NGO. The park works in close cooperation with the Jerusalem Bird Observatory. Tours, seminars and conventions are regularly held in the park, hosting companies and decision makers from across the country. 3. NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity A comprehensive survey of flora and fauna was conducted before the Park\u2019s formal establishment, which influenced the infrastructure planning for the park and the botanic enrichment program to rehabilitate the site\u2019s ecosystem and endangered flora. 4. NbS are economically viable No evidence found during the evaluation of economic assessments. However, the management of the Park is re-procured periodically, providing a market mechanism to establish fair management costs. 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The Gazelle Valley Park was established in its current form following years of public participation in the planning process. A resident\u2019s convention from the adjacent neighbourhoods gave the public the opportunity to voice their opinions and eventually voted for their preferred design for the park, which was subsequently implemented. 6. NbS equitably balances trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The stakeholders in this case are acknowledged as the Mountain Gazelles. Two-thirds of the park is set aside for their use only. The public may visit the other third. This is a new concept to many of the visitors and is often a test of self-restraint. The control of storm water management was the driving force behind the support by the local water authority for the infrastructure of the Park. Since the copious amounts of rainwater have been collected by the natural filtration systems, there has been no local flooding. Seasonal flooding of the area had been damaging to road infrastructure as well as personal property. This has now ceased because of NbS. 7. NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Park staff and management apply established policies regarding the Mountain Gazelles, the water circulation system, the botanic enrichment and endangered flora conservation programs. Any intervention only takes place after considering their possible repercussions and with regards to crucial time periods for the ecosystem such as breeding periods, the dry and wet seasons, and the various annual cycles of the plant life. 8.

This is a challenging long-term project to complete the remaining 20%. It will take five years to be developed and involves the more complicated coastal sections comprising mobile structures (boardwalks etc) and new links. The project is driven by economic development priorities, particularly to enhance the province\u2019s tourism infrastructure. It\u2019s role as a NbS to enhance biodiversity is a secondary factor. Consequently, this retrospective assessment highlights a number of aspects for which application of the NbS Standard would have improved design and monitoring in respect of the ecosystem service benefits of the project.

NbS effectively address societal challenges partial The intervention is mainly driven by economic development, generating social development indirectly. It is mainly focused on the improvement of the area for touristic purposes, including public spaces and natural areas. However, only tourism benefits are documented in detail. There is no specific information regarding the enjoyment of natural and cultural heritage as a contribution to human wellbeing. 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale partial The project recognises interactions between increasing connectivity, improving tourist attractiveness, improving of economy, and improving heritage and environmental value. The project responds to differing scales, of institutions and intervention areas. Consideration of risks is limited to engineering aspects of connectivity. 3. NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity partial Biodiversity is addressed in the project detailing the different species and linking them to the main hazards that have an impact on them, but no evidence was available for assessment regarding the setting and monitoring of biodiversity outcomes. Opportunities to enhance ecosystem integrity and connectivity were secondary benefits, rather than integral to the concept. 4. NbS are economically viable partial An economic analysis specifies costs and benefits. In relation to natural capital, it is limited to the cultural services of the landscape, primarily through increased accessibility for visitors to key natural attractions. Other aspects of co-benefits of NbS were not addressed. No evidence was available to demonstrate that alternative options for NbS were developed and evaluated. 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes partial The project involves a large number of local governments and agencies in an integrated plan. However, evidence of direct stakeholder engagement was not available. 6. NbS equitably balances trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits No evidence found during the evaluation. 7. NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence No evidence found during the evaluation. 8.

Further information: http://www.sendalitoral.es/es/ 33 Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities Case summary The metropolitan territory constitutes a biodiversity hotspot, having many protected species and habitats. This must be reflected in local development policy and projects, hence the City is drawing up a new Plan for reclaiming nature and biodiversity, aiming to halt biodiversity loss, to renature landscapes to benefit wildlife and citizens, and to improve knowledge of an engagement with nature. Nature based solutions are central to the plan to develop, renovate, and build (green roofs, passage for wildlife, etc.). A flagship project is to make the city centre greener. Six kilometres of green arteries will be created from the disappearance of the bus lanes thanks to the arrival of the tram. The tramline itself will be set in grass, and its margins planted with 2,400 trees. 10,296 trees will be planted in the city as a whole.

NbS effectively address societal challenges The plan is led by the challenges of environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, and climate change. In taking action on these issues the NbS deployed help to address other societal challenges. New green corridors will have positive health benefits for example, and help reduce risks from flooding and heat stress. A more attractive city environment can have economic benefits too. 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale The plan is developed at metropolitan scale with a strategic view. It seeks the complementarity of interventions, using biodiversity enhancement to improve city permeability so that the inhabitants benefit from the beneficial effects of nature. 3. NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The Plan identified specific actions on biodiversity. These include: preservation of movement corridors for species, and protection of reservoirs of biodiversity as well as individual species; restoration of land and water corridors (green and blue grid): action to reduce animal collisions and light pollution in connection with road infrastructures; a marine plan; species preservation strategy (local ocellated lizard plan in particular). 4. NbS are economically viable No evidence found during the evaluation. 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The Plan places great emphasis on environmental education, to raise awareness at all levels of society and administration and to mainstream successes. 6. NbS equitably balances trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits No evidence found during the evaluation. 7. NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence A monitoring strategy covers different environmental and socio-economic aspects. The monitoring schemes includes installation of sensors for air quality / temperature / hydrometric parameters. The City has developed a unit of biodiversity experts (6 people) to support development and infrastructure project leaders, carrying out studies, providing advice on taking biodiversity into account - from the design phase to site monitoring. 8. NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The aim is to incorporate green and blue infrastructure into urban planning. The creation of a metropolitan atlas of biodiversity will improve knowledge and support integration of NbS in development planning and implementation.

Efforts to regenerate the city include a strategy to incorporate knowledge on ecology and urban planning into the design of green areas to create new parks and ecosystems. These new environmental features of Pavlos Melas are not only designed with biodiversity enhancement in mind but also as a way to provide opportunities for businesses, creating jobs and economic welfare. The flagship project concerns the transition of a former military camp in the city centre into a Metropolitan Park. Largely abandoned since 2006, nowadays it represents an \u2018Urban Gap\u2019 contributing to the deprivation of the area. To reverse the situation, the municipality has focused on a strategic regeneration plan based on different steps and procedures, with increased dialogue and cooperation of key stakeholders. The area corresponds to 332,104 m2 and comprises 63 buildings of 24,000 m2. The Municipality is embarking on the restoration of the park across a number of phases. Phase 1 will concentrate on the restoration of the Park\u2019s green spaces with the sustainable reuse of the many buildings being the focus of the Phase 2 restoration.

NbS effectively address societal challenges In addition to the commentary above, it should be said that this is a large site offering many opportunities to deliver multiple benefits. The design attempts to optimise the value of these social, economic and environmental benefits. 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale The design responds strongly to the history and cultural heritage of this site and is integrated with the long-term Strategic Action Plan for Thessaloniki. It takes account of risk factors inherent to this region (wildfires). 3. NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The design is informed by a detailed technical report on environmental aspects, and data is gathered and reported regarding \u2018new vegetation\u2019. However, no evidence was found of a specific benchmarking exercise for the project. 4. NbS are economically viable Decision making was supported by an economic feasibility assessment, which included investment and operating costs. The economic assessment was made in the context of the long-term strategic plan. 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes With the support of the OSMOS platform (for the local based economy), workshops were organised in order to involve key city actors and stakeholders. However, no evidence was available regarding the fundamental principles underpinning consultation (such as free prior and informed consent). 6. NbS equitably balances trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits No evidence found during the evaluation. 7. NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence No evidence found during the evaluation. 8. NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The intervention integrates not only the lessons learnt from previous projects (Prodomos Nikiforidis and Bernard Cuoro) but also makes use of this knowledge integrating it in a future project. However, there was no evidence that this is a systematic practice. The jurisdictional context is provided by the Strategic Planning process.

Given ongoing and rapid urbanisation, the urban fringes are continually expanding in area and now amount collectively to a significant and growing proportion of land in the Mediterranean Region. Further, they are dynamic environments subject to rapid and often unplanned change. A more strategic consideration of urban expansion and its relationship to remnant agricultural and natural ecosystems is needed, especially in the contexts of biodiversity protection, and water and food security. The Oued Tine valley project concerns the creation of environmental corridors to build resilience to climate change. The environmental corridors ensure and restore the flow of species which are vital for the survival of the local agro-ecosystem but are also vital to the maintenance of the region\u2019s animal and plant biodiversity in general. The project promotes the use of environmental corridors to increase connectivity between biotopes, allowing species to move and survive in a degraded and fragmented landscape, and ultimately contribute to the sustainability of the unique agro-systems widely represented in the project area. The project involves raising awareness of farmers and other stakeholders regarding the importance of biodiversity and NbS, and training in resilient farming practices. Agro-forestry systems in particular, such as olive and carob orchards, are promoted along with soil and water conservation practices.

NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The Friends of Capte Tunisia association, supported by SAS Capte, expect this project to create momentum in the region and allow new plantations to be created with neighbouring farmers wishing to change their practice. Training will strengthen adaptative capacities amongst farmers and others and mainstream new practices. The project contributes to Tunisian targets for reducing carbon emissions from agriculture. How well does the NbS meet the Standard\u2019s criteria and what challenges were encountered? How does the NbS meet the societal challenges? The project recognises that to achieve the sustainable creation of environmental corridors into the agricultural landscape, they must be beneficial to farmers, helping them to adapt to climate change and to sustain their livelihoods. These rural populations face an increasing precariousness of income linked to various factors: soil degradation, pollution and salinization of water and soil, the decline of biodiversity, the lack of livestock grazing areas etc. These threats to the ecosystems are associated with significant climatic changes (longer heat waves, decreasing rainfall). The introduction of agro-forestry practices and environmental corridors aim to: Improve the population\u2019s perception of the importance of biodiversity and its state of degradation. Improve access to the appropriation of good environmental and agronomic practices by farmers and their families. Contribute to the resilience of farms and agro-systems by increasing the availability of new resources and by increasing the sustainability of cropping systems through agroforestry systems. Increase beneficial interactions between farmers and stakeholders. Conservation of natural resources such as water.

The Living Lab is within the Sesvete district in the East of Zagreb at the foothills of the Medvednica mountain. With its 70,000 inhabitants, Sesvete has the youngest population in Croatia, and a strong community and entrepreneurial spirit. Located on various key European traffic routes, Sesvete has an industrial past and present, with a particularly active automotive and construction industry. Distinctive, tall silo buildings form part of Sesvete\u2019s skyline and industrial heritage. In particular, the site of the former meat-processing factory, Sljeme, is the core of the Living Lab, with green plans in place for the silo buildings themselves and the surrounding areas. A number of NbS will be implemented and tested in the living lab: Community-based urban farms and gardens. Repurposing unused post-industrial land. Aquaponics. Closed system urban agriculture, producing fish and vegetables, and creating employment. Green walls and roofs. Retrofitting industrial buildings to adapt to climate change, improve biodiversity, and create a stimulating environment for a business innovation centre. Accessible green corridors. Revitalising the river corridor for recreation and active transport. Local environmental compensation processes. Understanding how to integrate nature-based solutions into planning procedures and policy development at local level. As a living lab for NbS, results will be measured and evaluated and successes replicated elsewhere in the city.

Partners also presented their initial co-design ideas, which included launching an architectural competition in the area, offering a \u2018Walk around Sljeme\u2019 for students, a museum exhibition on the meat industry and history of Sljeme, and introductions to aquaponics, urban farming and the concept of an inclusive \u2018therapy garden\u2019, which uses horticultural therapy to integrate minorities and people with disabilities. 6. NbS equitably balances trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits No evidence found during the evaluation. 7. NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence A spatial analysis constitutes the baseline for the NbS strategy in the living lab and the monitoring and evaluation plan. A Monitoring & Assessment Plan will be developed for the living lab, describing the procedure and indicators to be used to monitor and assess benefits of NbS. The monitoring and evaluation plan are configurated as a collaborative action involving local authorities, the civic sector, SMEs, and research institutes, with the aim of providing a significant and comprehensive evaluation of NbS. 8. NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Zagreb will monitor and evaluate the environmental and social benefits of the nature-based solutions implemented and, if successful, integrate nature-based solutions into planning procedures and policy development at local level. How well does the NbS meet the Standard\u2019s criteria and what challenges were encountered? How does the NbS meet the societal challenges? The project has the objective of demonstrating the integration of NbS into business models that are economically self-sustaining and provide multiple benefits for the economic, ecological and social regeneration of deprived urban areas suffering from the consequences of deindustrialisation. Economic innovation is one key aspect of the project. Therefore, market-ready business models for productive Green Infrastructure are explored, where the direct and indirect benefit and costs associated with the NbS, who pays and who benefits will be evaluated. The Living Lab will implement different nature-based solutions, co-created with local stakeholders and citizens, that will create productive green infrastructure that not only helps improve living conditions and reduce vulnerability to climate change, but also provides measurable economic benefits to citizens and entrepreneurs in post-industrial urban districts. The choice and design of NbS are informed by a comprehensive spatial analysis covering the topics of socio-cultural inclusiveness, human health and wellbeing, ecological and environmental restoration, and the economic and labour market situation.

Acknowledgements III PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation along with the IUCN Members in the region and key strategic partners are committed to promoting Nature-based Solutions (NbS), as approved in Resolution 34 \u201cThe implementation of Nature-based Solutions in the Mediterranean Basin\u201d by the IUCN constituency in the framework of the World Conservation Congress 2020. This Resolution also urges local authorities in the Mediterranean Basin to prioritise NbS in the strategies they adopt for the management of natural areas and urban zones, as well as in their green infrastructure strategies, and to give them priority in their land-use and urban policies. The NbS concept was also identified by the European Commission as a strategic solution for the development of more sustainable cities, with specific funding programmes on research and innovation (Horizon 2020 Programme). A milestone in the support for NbS roll-out was the launch of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions in July 2020, which aims to create a common framework for the public, private, academic and civil society sectors to design, implement and scale up solutions through the timely and transparent provision of sound policies, actions and investment. Foreword In pursuit of this goal, in 2020, TECNALIA1 was commissioned by IUCN-Med to help in the assessment of the good projects identified in the publication \u201cNature-Based Solutions in Mediterranean cities\u201d (2019) against the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard on NbS. This would be the first practical assessment of real projects and strategies (either implemented or in the design stage) from Mediterranean cities. The following pages present 18 projects from existing NbS interventions in Mediterranean cities that were assessed against the IUCN Standard. The result of this exercise identified both the Standard\u2019s potential in Mediterranean cities, and challenges in its use that must be resolved.

IV PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES 1 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES The Mediterranean region has one of the fastest urbanisation rates in the world. Sixty per cent of the current population lives in urban settings, and it is expected that this trend will continue until 2030. In this scenario of demographic growth, often with limited land available and also limited municipal resources and budgets, cities face increasingly complex challenges of competition and conflict over land use distribution, waste and energy management, guaranteed water availability and quality, reductions in CO2 emissions and air and noise pollution, mobility, creation of economic opportunities and jobs, regeneration of degraded and unoccupied areas, biodiversity conservation, urban agriculture", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2646b318-db9d-4168-92d8-0ac380e48662": {"__data__": {"id_": "2646b318-db9d-4168-92d8-0ac380e48662", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfa08e25afd39e9a95c9598812ee7c27531a58d38dfba0e78d554aa3d7acb037"}, "3": {"node_id": "d7e7efe2-1d5f-4d30-b5b7-244b88a254bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9098eeeee69f111852959685db3ab3484039c0ce2ce0fe7396930d5c1ef4e1bd"}}, "hash": "c8049fb050c306f3d4c5d80b8ff954ecccb671071a38ba17af9199074440a517", "text": "and food security, and so forth. All the solutions proposed are aimed at ensuring the health and well-being of a more inclusive, fair and equitable society as well as addressing the pressing need for adaptation and resilience to climate change. Introduction Mediterranean cities share quite unique territorial and bioclimatic specificities that make them especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in that water shortages, extreme rainfall and flooding, droughts, forest fires and heat waves are becoming increasingly more frequent and intense. The concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) is taking hold internationally, providing a genuine opportunity for cities to adapt to climate change and improve sustainability. The IUCN defines NbS as actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. NbS, as the European Commission proposes, \u201chelps society face environmental, economic and social challenges in a sustainable way\u201d and is economically profitable. NbS does not reject new technologies but, on the contrary, innovates by favouring the active participation of citizens in both the design and the management of their cities. A number of Mediterranean cities have already implemented urban renaturing programmes as a way to more responsibly and efficiently manage their current challenges, including their adaptation to climate change. Mediterranean cities share quite unique territorial and bioclimatic specificities that make them especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

Beyond the general framework provided by the European Urban Agenda 2050, NbS in the EU are promoted in the cross-cutting European Cohesion Policy (2014\u20132020) and now the new EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation for 2021\u20132027, connecting urban, regional and environmental policies and bringing together established ecosystem-based approaches such as ecosystem-based adaptation and ecological engineering with the social and economic dimensions. Notwithstanding the developing global evidence base on the benefits of NbS in cities, it is still at a relatively early stage of development and consists of evidence that is currently not sufficiently detailed for the development of city- specific NbS strategies. Nor is there a sufficiently broad portfolio of case studies that are relevant and replicable outside their original location; those profiled to date typically rely on bespoke investment and delivery mechanisms. As this is an emerging policy area, cities are therefore currently having to deliver custom-designed local research and pilot projects to generate the knowledge and the evidence base on NbS benefits, and effectiveness they require for local policy development and investment attraction. Climate change mitigation and adaptation Food security Water security Human health Economic and social development Disaster risk reduction Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss 3 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES IUCN is a membership Union composed of both government and civil society organisations. It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Recognising the lack of a common understanding and international consensus on NbS, IUCN has developed a Global Standard to mainstream the concept and to facilitate the verification, design and scaling-up of NbS, in a highly collaborative process. As NbS are increasingly being adopted in everyday business, a standard will ensure the quality and credibility of these solutions, thus guaranteeing their effectiveness in providing benefits to both human well-being and biodiversity.

The projects were selected to be evenly distributed around the Mediterranean, to be representative of the Mediterranean climate region and its idiosyncrasies, and to deal with a range of climate risks, urban development, planning culture and systems, governance, etc., at different scales from regional to city and district levels. The analysis sought to: Assess examples of good practice in different Mediterranean cities in terms of the benefits of NbS and their contribution to societal challenges, using the criteria and set of indicators suggested by the Standard. Identify gaps in the projects and explore niches for improvement and opportunities for enhancing the NbS interventions and the implementation process. Identify lessons learned for practical application and usability of the standard, and extract messages and elements that can be shared with other practices. Evaluate the adaptability of the Standard and how it could be reviewed and customised.

Gland, Switzerland: IUCN. 6 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUE BEING ADDRESSED CRITERIA INDICATORS Societal challenges The purpose of this Criterion is to ensure that the NbS is designed as a response to one or more societal challenges that have been identified as a priority by those who are or will be directly affected by them. All stakeholders, especially rights holders and beneficiaries of the NbS, must be involved in the decision-making process used for identifying the priority challenge or challenges (Criterion 5). 1 NbS effectively address societal challenges 1.1 The most pressing societal challenges for rights holders and beneficiaries are prioritised. 1.2 The societal challenges addressed are clearly understood and documented. 1.3 Human wellbeing outcomes arising from the NbS are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed. Design at scale The purpose of this Criterion is to encourage NbS designs that recognise the complexity and uncertainty that occur in living dynamic land/seascapes. Scale applies not only to the biophysical or geographic perspective but also to the influence of economic systems, policy frameworks and the importance of cultural perspectives. NbS design will be informed by what stakeholders know about the interactions between different aspects of a land/seascape using a three-scale framework that considers the parts within the land/seascape, the land/seascape itself and the wider environment around the land/seascape.

Economic feasibility The return on investment, the efficiency and effectiveness of the intervention, and equity in the distribution of benefits and costs are key determinants of success for an NbS. This Criterion requires that sufficient consideration is given to the economic viability of the intervention, both at the design stage and through monitoring the implementation. For NbS to be sustainable, there must be strong consideration of the economic aspects as, most likely, long-term gains must be balanced against short-term costs, with short-term actions developed within the context of long-term (over generations) goals and plans. If the economic feasibility is not adequately addressed, NbS run the risk of being short-term projects, where, after closing, the solution and benefits provided cease to exist, potentially leaving the landscape and communities worse off than before. Innovative and evidence-based tools for the valuation of nature, along with ideas for NbS contributions to markets and jobs, encourage creative (blended) financing of NbS, thereby increasing the likelihood of their long-term success. 4 NbS are economically viable 4.1 The direct and indirect benefits and costs associated with the NbS, who pays and who benefits, are identified and documented. 4.2 A cost-effectiveness study is provided to support the choice of NbS including the likely impact of any relevant regulations and subsidies. 4.3 The effectiveness of an NbS design is justified against available alternative solutions, taking into account any associated externalities. 4.4 NbS design considers a portfolio of resourcing options such as market-based, public sector, voluntary commitments and actions to support regulatory compliance.

Good governance arrangements are proven to not only reduce an intervention\u2019s sustainability risks, but also to enhance its social \u2018licence to operate\u2019. Conversely, inadequate governance provision for otherwise well- intended actions can adversely affect the legitimacy of benefit- and cost-sharing arrangements. As a minimum, NbS must adhere to and align with the prevailing legal and regulatory provisions, being clear on where legal responsibilities and liabilities lie. However, as often is the case with natural resources, basic compliance will need to be complemented with ancillary mechanisms that actively engage and empower local communities and other stakeholders. 5 NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes 5.1 A defined and fully agreed upon feedback and grievance resolution mechanism is available to all stakeholders before an NbS intervention can be initiated. 5.2 Participation is based on mutual respect and equality, regardless of gender, age or social status, and upholds the right of Indigenous Peoples to Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC). 5.3 Stakeholders who are directly and indirectly affected by the NbS have been identified and involved in all processes of the NbS intervention. 5.4 Decision-making processes document and respond to rights and interests of all participating and affected stakeholders. 5.5 Where the scale of the NbS extends beyond jurisdictional boundaries, mechanisms are established to enable joint decision making of the stakeholders in the affected jurisdictions.

Adaptive management This Criterion requires that NbS implementation plans include provisions to enable adaptive management as a response to uncertainty and as an option to effectively harness ecosystem resilience. A degree of uncertainty is inherent when managing most ecosystems due to their complex, dynamic and self-organising nature. This also means that ecosystems have greater resilience, which confers a wider range of options to respond to unanticipated social, economic or climate events. The foundation of adaptive management is the evidence-base provided by regular monitoring and evaluation, drawing on scientific understanding as well as indigenous, traditional and local knowledge. By proactively adopting an adaptive management approach, the NbS can continue to be relevant through the lifecycle of the intervention and the risk of redundancy and stranded investments minimised. 7 NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence 7.1 A NbS strategy is established and used as a basis for regular monitoring and evaluation of the intervention. 7.2 A monitoring and evaluation plan is developed and implemented throughout the intervention lifecycle . 7.3 A framework for iterative learning that enables adaptive management is applied throughout the intervention lifecycle. 8 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUE BEING ADDRESSED CRITERIA INDICATORS Mainstreaming This Criterion requires that NbS interventions are designed and managed with a view to long-term sustainability and that they take account of, work with and align with sectoral, national and other policy frameworks. There are various approaches to mainstreaming NbS; however, all rely on strategic communications and outreach. Audiences to consider include individuals (e.g. the public, academics), institutions (e.g. national government, start-ups, businesses, and organisations) and global networks (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, Paris Agreement). 8 NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context 8.1 NbS design, implementation and lessons learnt are shared for triggering transformative change. 8.2 NbS inform and enhance facilitating policy and regulation frameworks to support its uptake and mainstreaming. 8.3 Where relevant, NbS contribute to national and global targets for human wellbeing, climate change, biodiversity and human rights, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). \u00a9 JOYFULL | DREAMSTIME.COM 9 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES a ) Case identification and information gathering 18 projects were selected for this assessment report.

We decided to classify these two different speeds into four types of case studies: Type 1: Urban regeneration in a global change context: Focusing specifically on urban interventions for social inclusion and socio-economic improvement of degraded areas, with a strong bottom-up, citizen engagement and multi-agent participatory approach. Type 2: NbS for climate change and water resilience: Driven by climate change adaptation needs, mainly interventions designed to cope with water management (either flood risk or water scarcity) and thermal stress. Type 3: NbS for coastal resilience in a context of rising sea levels: The Mediterranean Sea is always an important presence in all the cities assessed. However, this group includes projects where the NbS have a strong blue component to deal with specific coastal challenges faced by coastal cities (i.e. sea level rise, seaport infrastructure, maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation). Type 4: Mature projects: More advance practices in terms of NbS a longer experience applying this approach into local planning. The extent to which the project complied with each of the 28 indicators defined in the Standard was evaluated at one of two levels: Indicator is not considered at all; Indicator is fully covered, or some work has been done around some of the elements of the indicator. In the context of this first screening assessment we have not considered intermediate scoring scales, since, to be able to approach it in this way, a much more accurate knowledge of the practices and all their content would have been required. Furthermore, the case-studies assessment was undertaken between February-September 2020, thus when the Global Standard\u2019s self- assessment was not yet available in its current version. Therefore, we used a 2-levels (0 or 1) evaluation system, as opposed to using the currently available 4 levels self-assessment (insufficient, partial, adequate, strong). Each of these levels was standardised in order to obtain a percentage for the extent to which the projects complied with each of the indicators of the Standard. This provided information at two levels, both for the analysis of the projects as a whole and for the types defined above. That allowed us to draw conclusions on: Revision of the Standard as a self-assessment tool, identifying the criteria and the indicators which are the most challenging to address and to comply with. Conclusions can then be drawn on the applicability and usability of the Standard and tools to support its use can be identified. 11 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES Analysis of how the projects meet the criteria and indicators, identifying strengths, gaps and opportunities for improvement NbS deployment.

The answers obtained varied strongly with the city and the indicator. In the case of Zagreb evidence was found for a highly satisfactory number of indicators, namely 24 out of 28. Concerning the criterion 1 and indicator 1.1 \u201cThe most pressing societal challenges for rights holders and beneficiaries are prioritised\u201d is the one for which most useful information was found for all cities.

Other indicators with very low values (5 answers or less out of 18) are the ones on Economic feasibility (4.1, 4.2, 4.3), the remaining ones on Balance trade-offs (6.1, 6.2) and 7.3. on Adaptive management. On the other hand, Indicators with very high values (15 answers or more out of 18) are the ones dealing with Societal challenges, as already stated, Design at scale (particularly 2.1 and 2.2) and Biodiversity net-gain (3.1). The graphic below summarises the availability of information for each criterion. As can be clearly seen from the figure, a reasonable amount of information was available for most criteria, especially criteria 1 and 2. Conversely, less information was found for criteria 4 and 7, while serious problems were encountered in obtaining evidence for criterion 6.

C O M 15 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES What is the general feedback on the structure and content of the Standard? A certain bias towards biodiversity was perceived by most stakeholders, to the detriment of other societal challenges. However, it provides interesting and detailed keys to bringing about changes in green management, given the specificity of the urban environment in compact Mediterranean cities3: evaluating green infrastructure projects for their overall Biodiversity net-gain is of great value. Three criteria of the Standard were highlighted as the most difficult ones to evaluate and also to comply with, as explained below: Economic feasibility: Its evaluation raises two problems: How to monetise NbS benefits versus traditional interventions is difficult to analyse; there is still a lack of available tools and expertise and the studies (i.e. natural capital accounting) are time consuming and resource intensive, difficult to be assumed by most municipalities consulted. These kinds of analysis are in any case normally subcontracted on demand for the assessment of specific interventions, but there is not yet a standard procedure, not even for the most advanced and mature projects analysed. Evaluation in economic terms is not always feasible or even desirable. Some green interventions are not sustainable in economic terms sine the investment will not have an economic return, but the intervention is still strategic and will have a huge impact in social and environmental terms, which justifies its implementation. However, there is a lack of good evaluation methods for assessing return on investment. Natural Capital Assessment and Social Return on Investment are tools worth exploring, but they have not yet produced reliable results in terms of public health, for instance. Consideration of benefits and trade-offs: Although this criterion is considered very relevant, the studies and analysis required to evaluate benefits and trade-offs are time consuming and resource intensive and they are not delivered on a regular basis. These studies may be subcontracted ad hoc for a certain intervention, particularly strategic projects, but this is usually not yet done in the projects evaluated, and it remains a challenge even for the most mature ones. Adaptive management: This is a relatively new concept that has not yet been incorporated or internalised in territorial and urban planning and therefore it is too ambitious to try to evaluate it in the context of NbS implementation. 3 Barcelona City Council. \u00a9 GRAFIKERLINE | DREAMSTIME.COM 16 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES What are the main barriers to its use? \u201cStandard with interesting and innovative criteria but also with very ambitious indicators\u201d While the Standard offers an interesting and innovative criteria, it is also contained very ambitious indicators to really assess the current state of projects4. Lack of monitoring data could be an issue and there is still a need for a more comprehensive approach to knowhow and who should evaluate each indicator (including economic ones). Lack of data is seen as a constraint but also as an opportunity to challenge the local authorities and responsible bodies of the practices in the search for new elements or development criteria. In general terms, it was understood that a qualitative assessment of the indicators is possible, but a quantitative assessment, although useful, would be so complex that it would be very difficult to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76340855-acf1-4b37-9669-d52a2302216a": {"__data__": {"id_": "76340855-acf1-4b37-9669-d52a2302216a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4444996d4fdd6f66863b634892f578ff73b25e31917fc09a0eca8f83748665f"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae430957-0c3a-47f9-9983-ec76dc841810", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b733434c696dd797c598ff4aa380adb5e003429fb969843efd9fe7d0905e834"}}, "hash": "be4e76b3f66521b3caf510ead6e0ab79954bbead0541f94cdcbf05cbba41691f", "text": "carry out5. It is necessary to know in detail the scope of the object of evaluation: is it the plan or strategy or a specific project? The Standard seems valid for both, but perhaps it seems more appropriate for use at a strategic level6. It seems that the Standard works better on the conceptual, abstract and strategic approach (top-down) rather than the more operational approach (bottom up) that cities actually adopt in their day-to-day urban management7. \u201cAvailability and accessibility of information\u201d Availability and accessibility of the information in order to apply the Standard versus the day-to-day work in reality \u2013 there is a need for an extra effort to give more visibility to the studies and analyses that are carried out in each city and region. In some cases, there were enough studies and information to respond to some of the NbS criterion but the day-to-day work of civil servants does not allow to have enough time to find the data available from various sources of documentation. There is a need for an extra effort to give more visibility to the studies and analyses that are carried out in each city and region and systematise the information to make it more accessibility for easy consultation and further follow-up. 4 M\u00e1laga provincial authority \u2013 shared by all. 5, 6 Vitoria Gasteiz Centre for Environmental Studies, Vitoria-Gasteiz City Council. 7 Barcelona City Council. \u00a9 MARTIAPUNTS | DREAMSTIME.COM 17 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES What challenges and opportunities does the Standard present? \u201cInspiration for improvement\u201d The strategic and abstract vision provided by the Standard, in the shape of criteria and indicators, is considered an opportunity to undertake a qualitative, strategic reflection that could lead to improvements in the implementation and deployment of NbS and their incorporation into the local political agenda. However, it is also perceived as a difficult tool to apply to urban projects, particularly in the context of compact cities in the Mediterranean region and the increasingly limited resources available. \u201cGovernance\u201d There is a need for a systemic, multiscale approach to NbS implementation with a view to fostering the transition between the consolidated urban fabric and other natural or semi-natural green and blue spaces in peri-urban and rural areas. Some examples of this approach are M\u00e1laga\u2019s green corridors, the Green Infrastructure Strategy in Vitoria Gasteiz and the Metropolitan Park in Pavlos Melas, amongst others, which seek to establish such a link between these areas. The lack of multilevel (vertical) and interdepartmental (horizontal) coordination remains a challenge, and the need for a specifically metropolitan approach8 was highlighted by several stakeholders. The complexity in governance and the distribution of powers and responsibilities between different governmental levels and even between departments within the same authority was perceived as a key challenge, alongside unbending planning instruments. There is a need for innovative governance models and more agile and flexible planning instruments that can facilitate the implementation process. \u201cSystematic approach to biodiversity and green management\u201d Green management has been on the political agenda for many years for most of the projects analysed. Environmental quality is seen as a driver for dialogue with citizens. In Barcelona, green management is particularly driven by the biodiversity challenge, which is reflected in profiles and organisational charts, as well as spatial information systems and formal planning documents. The Standard can help to systematise the way green management and biodiversity are addressed in the political agenda, to further advance NbS deployment. \u201cPublic procurement\u201d Public procurement9 was also highlighted as a valuable tool that could aid sustainable NbS implementation. Clear guidelines, criteria and design standards could facilitate the process (e.g. by selecting species adapted to climate change while increasing autochthonous biodiversity). \u201cSocial acceptability\u201d The importance of social acceptability10 and responding to social demands and population needs remain a challenge for most projects. Working towards liveable and healthy public spaces through NbS could be a way to respond to social demands. A proactive approach to citizens\u2019 concerns, motivations and demands through public consultations guarantees acceptance without having to mobilise huge resources. A lack of social involvement in decision making could result in social non-acceptance or even generate a backlash against green interventions (misperception of insecurity and environmental risks, dirtiness, etc.).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae430957-0c3a-47f9-9983-ec76dc841810": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae430957-0c3a-47f9-9983-ec76dc841810", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4444996d4fdd6f66863b634892f578ff73b25e31917fc09a0eca8f83748665f"}, "2": {"node_id": "76340855-acf1-4b37-9669-d52a2302216a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be4e76b3f66521b3caf510ead6e0ab79954bbead0541f94cdcbf05cbba41691f"}}, "hash": "5b733434c696dd797c598ff4aa380adb5e003429fb969843efd9fe7d0905e834", "text": "Co-creation and co-design processes, effective evaluation and good communication channels are vital for increasing awareness, sensitivity, equity and acceptance and there is room for innovative approaches here. \u201cIt helps to put NbS on the political agenda and on the list of concerns of society\u201d. 8 Barcelona City Council, M\u00e1laga provincial authority. 9 Barcelona City Council. 10 All stakeholders. 18 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES 5.3 On", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26fa559e-c0fc-4fb7-8524-abf65c73525d": {"__data__": {"id_": "26fa559e-c0fc-4fb7-8524-abf65c73525d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df2738c4fb9fe4b47c1ad179f3ce531247f2803ce03156b4c7a8d534b53b321f"}, "3": {"node_id": "efd64d0b-5892-4fe7-b074-0aa1938bc5ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "becd1ecc4c1deb9cc345c7ae9a9753d3714bdc49668080f24b2023aaa3b69cb7"}}, "hash": "2a69ef3c52b4c7e0534ac0f26bbfc2fbf83aa1ff0f78c74d1e19cd677cd3582c", "text": "the review of the projects analysed Even though the 18 projects examined are very diverse in their contents, statu quo, scope, resources and budget, they all show good examples of the use of NbS approach to cope with relevant city challenges.

The tables on the following pages summarise the practices contribution to the Standard criteria and indicators, by challenge and by typology of practice analised. The projects were given one of two ratings: 0 when there was no evidence of the project responding to the indicator; 1 when there was evidence of the project analysed responding to the indicator completely or to a certain extent. Intermediate ratings were not used for this rapid assessment, since that would have required much more detailed knowledge of the projects and all their content. \u00a9 LJUBOV | DREAMSTIME.COM 19 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES Issue + Criterion Indicator Zagreb Tunisie M\u00e1laga Perchel Tesalonica Amman Pavos Melas Niza N\u00ba of answered indicators Issue relevance SOCIETAL CHALLENGES 1.

Urban regeneration is per se a comprehensive approach that must attend to the requirements and needs of multiple agents in all environmental and socioeconomic dimensions. On the other hand, Type 3 Coastal projects perform poorly on all criteria. All projects of this type are strongly biased towards a specific driver, especially economic improvement or biodiversity conservation, and are also dependent on spatial scale, affecting broad areas beyond municipal boundaries. They generally show top-down governance and low inclusive participation levels. All projects, regardless of the type they belong to, show that implemented NbS contribute positively to \u201csocietal challenges\u201d and meet the \u201cdesign at scale\u201d requirements. In the case of the criterion 1 \u201cSociety challenges\u201d, the concept is so broad in its formulation that it is very complex to find a project that not addresses at least two of them. Compared to the issue of biodiversity (criterion 3), the Standard has little to say about other challenges that may be especially relevant (such as climate change or social and economic improvement). The assessment reveals that \u201cBalance trade-offs\u201d and \u201cEconomic feasibility\u201d are the criteria where a real gap exists for all projects, at least based on the information available for the analysis. It was very challenging to find quality information about the analysis of trade-offs of the NbS deployed, or comparative analyses of green solutions versus more traditional ones in economic terms. Where such analyses exist, they are done from a markedly traditional perspective without addressing the benefits of NbS with respect to more traditional solutions, such as their effects on climate change, improvements in environmental conditions and contributions to health and well-being (including cohesion and social justice). It should be noted that identifying this gap in practice is justifiable given the state of the art since there is no general reference framework for addressing this issue at a European level (it is one of the objectives of the European Commission in the short term).

This is positive in the sense that these challenges are definitely less well advanced and addressed by NbS at present, alongside socio-economic development. However, this emphasis reduces the potential relative importance of other issues such as climate change (beyond its impact on human health and well-being). For indicator 1.3, there is a potential risk of overlap with the indicators on monitoring solutions (under Criterion 7). The concept of benchmarking is definitely a very relevant approach to use in the co-design and NbS prioritisation process, and therefore it is closely related to Criterion 7 and also Criteria 1 and 2. Results All the projects analysed aim at responding to two or more of the suggested societal challenges. This first criterion is one of the elements used for defining the types, by interpreting how each project contributes to meeting these societal challenges. Two aspects of the projects were evaluated: Their multifunctionality, one of the elements that most enriches the projects, and their ability to bring together different themes and topics and respond to different societal challenges; Their contribution to a single or a limited number of challenges, where the NbS intervention was designed ad hoc to cope with a specific issue and it has proven effective. Design at scale The purpose of this Criterion is to encourage NbS designs that recognise the complexity and uncertainty that occur in living dynamic land/seascapes. Scale applies not only to the biophysical or geographic perspective but also to the influence of economic systems, policy frameworks and the importance of cultural perspectives. NbS design will be informed by what stakeholders know about the interactions between different aspects of a land/seascape using a three- scale framework that considers the parts within the land/seascape, the land/seascape itself and the wider environment around the land/seascape. This Criterion refers to the ability of the project to generate an impact beyond the immediate boundaries of the intervention, and therefore it takes account of factors such as: Participatory system assessment; Natural and cultural contexts responding to the complex interaction between ecological, social and political systems; Long-term maintenance. 29 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES The spatial and temporal scales have a very important and significant role in the ecosystem approach and adaptive management, particularly where biodiversity loss and ecosystem malfunction become evident to local stakeholders, i.e. at spatial scales greater than individual pieces of land or water and at temporal scales longer than a few years. Results The analysis of the projects shows possible gaps: Analysis of the potential for upscaling or downscaling the NbS. This is different from the assessment of the transferability of the NbS implementation experience to future interventions, which is assessed under Criterion 8. The upscaling/downscaling analysis relates to the question of how the NbS design fits into the overall Green Infrastructure / NbS Strategy at city level or conversely how the NbS design and implementation could affect instruments at strategic level. Analysis of the scale of the intervention: site/ urban acupuncture level; district/urban level; municipal/local level; regional level. This seems to be included in the description of the Criterion but is not addressed by the indicators used. The scale determines the project objectives, the stakeholders to be involved and the potential transferability of lessons learned, amongst other things. Biodiversity net-gain NbS are derived as goods and services from ecosystems, and therefore strongly depend on the health of an ecosystem. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem change can have significant impacts on the functioning and integrity of the system. Therefore, NbS design and implementation must avoid undermining the integrity of the system and, instead, proactively seek to enhance the functionality and connectivity of the ecosystem. Doing so can also ensure the long-term resilience and durability of the NbS. Biodiversity is understood as a fundamental asset for NbS in tackling societal challenges.

Results The analysis shows that Biodiversity is of high relative importance compared to the other Criteria evaluated and also to other societal challenges. This fact may generate imbalances in the assessment of the projects, since those with a biodiversity objective as well as those on a regional scale or with a peri-urban approach are more likely to address this variable than more urban or urban acupuncture projects. The occurrence of alien species and the importance of encouraging endemic and/or protected species seem to be missing in the evaluation. \u00a9 TARIYA SAKMANGKORN | DREAMSTIME.COM 30 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES Economic feasibility The return on investment, the efficiency and effectiveness of the intervention, and equity in the distribution of benefits and costs are key determinants of success for an NbS. This Criterion requires that sufficient consideration is given to the economic viability of the intervention, both at the design stage and through monitoring the implementation. For NbS to be sustainable, there must be strong consideration of the economic aspects as, most likely, long-term gains must be balanced against short-term costs, with short-term actions developed within the context of long-term (over generations) goals and plans. If the economic feasibility is not adequately addressed, NbS run the risk of being short-term projects, where, after closing, the solution and benefits provided cease to exist, potentially leaving the landscape and communities worse off than before. Innovative and evidence-based tools for the valuation of nature, along with ideas for NbS contributions to markets and jobs, encourage creative (blended) financing of NbS, thereby increasing the likelihood of their long-term success. The indicators used to evaluate economic feasibility refer to: The identification of the direct and indirect benefits and costs associated with the NbS, who pays and who benefits. This would cover benefits to the local economy arising from the NbS projects, in terms of generating jobs and stimulating economic activity, property betterment and quality of life. It can be challenging to measure benefits in economic terms since they are not necessarily economic in nature but in value; for example, to quantify the benefits of the demonstration projects in reducing and attenuating urban run- off, one potential indicator is the avoided cost of treating run-off water entering the sewerage system. Similarly, co-benefits include measures under other Criteria that can be converted and taken into account when weighing the overall cost-effectiveness of the NbS. The effectiveness of the NbS design justified against available alternative solutions, taking into account any associated externalities. This refers to the benchmarking exercise of comparing the effectiveness of the NbS versus for instance more \u201ctraditional\u201d hard or engineering alternatives. A cost-effectiveness study to support the choice of NbS, including the likely impact of any relevant regulations and subsidies. The results of the effectiveness assessment can be combined with several measures of costs in order to evaluate the project\u2019s cost- effectiveness. Under this category, we therefore consider a series of cost-related indicators. In particular, both the project\u2019s one-off costs (e.g. costs related to construction of the NbS and land acquisition) and its recurring or maintenance costs, and an assessment of the savings made compared to the costs of alternative (non-NbS) solutions. Consideration of a portfolio of resourcing options such as market-based, public sector, voluntary commitments and actions to support regulatory compliance. Results Despite being one of the most important aspects of successful NbS implementation, economic feasibility remains one of the challenges in the analysis, as it is less advanced and less well covered in the assessment of the projects analysed, regardless of their nature and type.

Conversely, inadequate governance provision for otherwise well-intended actions can adversely affect the legitimacy of benefit- and cost- sharing arrangements. As a minimum, NbS must adhere to and align with the prevailing legal and regulatory provisions, being clear on where legal responsibilities and liabilities lie. However, as often is the case with natural resources, basic compliance will need to be complemented with ancillary mechanisms that actively engage and empower local communities and other stakeholders. This Criterion assesses the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders in all phases of NbS development and delivery, in an inclusive, timely, open and comprehensive manner that is culturally appropriate and embraces equity and gender identity issues. It covers the extent to which the governance structures and processes implemented in the analysed projects were conducive to achieving the objectives set and meeting societal challenges, were rights based, reflected a plurality of views and ensured equity. However, it should also place issues such as civil society participation (e.g. citizen science) and co-production of knowledge with stakeholders more centre-stage. Furthermore, it should promote effective communication on biodiversity issues to improve awareness of the multiple benefits of biodiversity. Results To a certain extend all practices considered stakeholders engagement as a core element for the delivery of their NbS initiatives, strategies or projects. There are three levels that it would be interesting to evaluate, representing different degrees of development of inclusive governance: Identify and involve all potential stakeholders (including citizens, technical experts and the private sector); Analyse whether decisions are made jointly, or whether participation is only advisory, i.e. the difference between a top-down and a bottom-up approach; Determine if there is a process of citizen empowerment, either through the use of citizen observatories or through the involvement of vulnerable groups or those at risk of social exclusion. In short, has there been any specific initiative to involve agents who may be under- represented or who, although key to the project, may be at risk of not participating in it in areas promoting social justification? Gender identity and the integration of social groups are not considered. \u00a9 IMAGE SORCE: https://pavlosmelas.gr/epiasan-douleia-gia-tous-mouseiakoys-xorous- stomitropolitiko-parko-paylou-mela/ 32 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES Balance trade-offs Trade-offs in land and natural resource management are inevitable. Ecosystems provide a wealth of different benefits and not everyone values each of them in the same way. While trade-offs cannot be avoided, they can be effectively and equitably managed. This Criterion requires that NbS proponents acknowledge these trade-offs and follow a fair, transparent and inclusive process to balance and manage them over both time and geographic space. This involves a credible assessment, full disclosure and agreement among the most affected stakeholders on how the trade-offs should be addressed. Fair and transparent negotiation of trade-offs and compensation among potentially affected parties for any damages or trade-offs to local opportunities and livelihoods provides the basis for successful long-term NbS outcomes. Critically, it is important to recognise that trade-offs have social and ecological limits beyond which point certain values or benefits can be lost in perpetuity. This means that safeguards will be necessary to ensure, inter alia, that the integrity of ecosystems and the long-term stabilising properties of ecosystem services are not exceeded. This Criterion seeks to evaluate the extent to which the NbS intervention identifies current and future benefits and trade-offs with the aim of ensuring that an ecosystem is not changed for the sake of an ecosystem service or resource. In addition, it assesses whether the project includes a procedure for the fair and transparent negotiation of trade-offs and compensation for loss of local opportunities. Results Along with economic feasibility, this is the least considered or addressed criterion within the projects analysed, except on very specific and focused matters. It is a very difficult criterion to evaluate. It is necessary to interpret the information produced by the Environmental Impact Assessment or similar procedures.

According to the Standard, this Criterion assesses the extent to which adaptive management is catered for in NbS deployment, based on continuous monitoring and evaluation, so as to be able to take account of uncertainty, ecosystem complexity and changes over time. Adaptiveness also needs to be anchored in the institutions and organisations that govern the NbS. Ecosystem processes and functions are complex and variable with a high level of uncertainty, which increases due to their interaction with social systems. Therefore, ecosystem management must involve the adaptation of methodologies and solutions, based on learning about how systems are managed and also on evidence and monitoring in a context of uncertainty. The adaptive management process is often presented as a cycle with a number of essential steps: ASSES PROBLEM MONITOR EVALUATE PLANNING & DESIGN IMPLEMENT ADJUST AND SO FORTH 33 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES Some of the differentiating characteristics of adaptive management are: acknowledgement of uncertainty about what policy or solution is \u2018best\u2019 for the particular management issue; thoughtful selection of the policies or solutions to be applied (the assessment and design stages of the cycle); careful implementation of a plan of action designed to reveal the critical knowledge that is currently lacking; monitoring of key response indicators; analysis of the management outcomes in consideration of the original objectives; incorporation of the results into future decisions. Results This is by far the least developed criterion addressed in the projects analysed, regardless of their type, showing that there is still a long way to go with regard to the regular operationalisation of adaptive management within government bodies. Similarly, there is a need for flexibility in policy making and implementation. Long-term, inflexible decisions are likely to be inadequate or even destructive. This transformation toward adaptive management will need a cross-sectoral approach to ensure policy coherence and effectiveness, as well as innovative governance approaches that allow the adaptive process to be operational (see Figure 6). Most of the projects analysed incorporate a monitoring and evaluation system that helps to track the progress of NbS interventions over time, although from reading the available material it is not possible to grasp whether the monitoring and evaluation results are used in an adaptive management approach. Mainstreaming This Criterion requires that NbS interventions are designed and managed with a view to long-term sustainability and that they take account of, work with and align with sectoral, national and other policy frameworks. There are various approaches to mainstreaming NbS; however, all rely on strategic communications and outreach. Audiences to consider include individuals (e.g. the public, academics), institutions (e.g. national government, start-ups, businesses, and organisations) and global networks (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, Paris Agreement). In this Criterion, the challenge refers to the NbS intervention being integrated or affecting and contributing to, and being aligned with programmes and policies already in place at local, regional and state levels. Results A very large range of policy instruments is available to cities to promote and assist in the implementation of NbS; of these, regulatory instruments are usually the most direct and directly powerful means of fostering NbS. Perhaps the only question to comment on relates to the UNDRIP (United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) criteria, which are at least partially complied with in all of these projects. At this point, therefore, it is not clear whether the evaluation focuses on knowing if there is an express reference to them or whether it is about knowing if there is one or more that the project refers to. 34 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES TYPE 1 Urban regeneration in a global change context INDIVIDUAL PROJECT FORMS PAVLOS MELAS (Greece) Integrated regeneration and Metropolitan Park OUED TINE VALLEY AREA (Tunisia) Environmental Corridors M\u00c1LAGA (Spain) Green Infrastructure Plan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8723d93-c762-4022-8c30-12bbe28dda14": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8723d93-c762-4022-8c30-12bbe28dda14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c9a98558f82f4cf753892c040e82e157e51ee1c415387e2641e7b45d03ba3a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b8650d2-6790-44a5-9eda-37f2abcb937e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8659a3e1575de8c569e7d724ab916e8b493f579cf6fde1c3c71acce257f9f6b2"}}, "hash": "9042e056e375b749f6b571ba3dc85b8af2445eea977f8a8bbfb7a4e34d0c57fc", "text": "Perchel Lagunillas NICE (France) Nature in the heart of Nice ZAGREB (Croatia) The Living Lab at Sesvete AMMAN (Jordan) Urban agriculture City Strategic Agenda THESSALONIKI (Greece) BlueHealth and Resilience Strategy 35 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES Urban agriculture (UA) was historically widely practised in urban areas in Jordan and the Levant.

Jordan offers an example where governments and communities have successfully addressed urbanisation, food security and urban poverty through an approach that focuses on UA. Jordan\u2019s total population is 6 million and the city of Amman, the capital of the Kingdom, is the main urban area with a population of 2.2 million. Amman has been a pioneer in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in recognising the importance of urban agriculture for the environment as well as for people\u2019s health and food security, since it brings greenery into the city together with all the benefits associated with that. The Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) has been supporting urban agriculture and food security programmes using urban land, including rooftops, schools, home gardens and vacant plots between buildings. The case of Amman includes two major actions that could serve as examples of best practice for other cities: Amman (Jordan) Urban agriculture City Strategic Agenda 1.Institutionalising urban agriculture as a first step towards its recognition as a major component of urban settings. The GAM conducted an exploratory study on UA within a regional programme implemented by the Environment and Sustainable Development Unit (ESDU) of the American University of Beirut in collaboration with the GAM.

Establishing a dedicated group of stakeholders and setting a City Strategic Agenda (CSA) to support the sustainable development of urban agriculture in Amman The ESDU, together with the RUAF Foundation \u2013 Global partnership on Urban Agriculture and Food Systems13, have promoted multi-stakeholder action planning and policy formulation (MPAP) on urban agriculture and food security, where national and local authorities cooperate with citizens, farmers and civic organisations and private sector companies in the preparation, implementation and evaluation of related policies and action plans. Based on the exploratory studies on urban agriculture and stakeholder identification, in 2009, the Greater Amman Municipality took the initiative to establish a multi-stakeholder forum (MSF) and a specialised Urban Agriculture Bureau and since then has committed human and financial resources to implement the City Strategic Agenda (CSA) to support the sustainable development of urban agriculture and its institutionalisation. Through its Urban Agriculture Bureau and MSF, Amman has partnered with several international organisations to encourage sustainable urban food production. Pilot projects that have been carried out include: More than 300 productive green roofs and 4,000 school and home gardens; A land bank to connect landowners with existing and potential producers: the city established a land bank for urban agriculture after mapping vacant land areas available in the city region; New land-use guidelines requiring 15% of each plot to be used for greening or agriculture; Local women\u2019s cooperative to improve the production, processing and marketing of selected crops such as green leafy vegetables; Training and technical assistance on access to markets for sustainable urban farmers; Promotion of organic and healthy food production and value adding (e.g. washing, packaging, labelling); Promotion of rainwater harvesting, wastewater recycling and more efficient water use in agriculture; Boosting urban and peri-urban forestation (with productive street/park trees and use of treated wastewater); Special seal to distinguish and market local urban agriculture products. 13 https://ruaf.org/ AMMAN (Jordan).

Urban agriculture. City Strategic Agenda 38 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Societal challenges Climate change / Food security / Water security / Disaster risk / Human health / Economic and social development CRITERIA 1. NbS effectively address societal challenges INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 1.1 The most pressing societal challenges for rights holders and beneficiaries are prioritised The following benefits of urban agriculture in Amman are explicitly recognised: \u2212 Reduction of emissions and climate change mitigation; \u2212 Access to clean food (health); \u2212 Bringing communities together, creating stronger social bonds and helping increase well-being in terms of stress relief; \u2212 Raising awareness regarding environmental concerns: densely populated city with little access to public green spaces, which are located in the urban periphery; \u2212 Economic benefits: for individual households and at a commercial level (markets, hotels, etc.). The financial rewards of engaging in urban agriculture on a household scale are very low. The value of urban agriculture accordingly lies elsewhere: in greening the city and bringing nature into it; in moderating the climate; in establishing social bonds between those who engage in it; in its therapeutic value as a relaxing activity that involves caring for living entities; in obtaining fresh and healthy vegetables. These benefits are of course more difficult to quantify than amounts of produce, their cost and their market value, but are no less important. Key challenges facing urban agriculture in Amman: \u2212 Limited availability of space; \u2212 Limited availability of water; \u2212 Social and cultural hindrances: lack of community engagement and lack of the cultural practice of vegetable gardening; \u2212 Technical constraints due to the intrinsic climatological characteristics of the region with very high insolation and drying winds, which require more advanced technical solutions; \u2212 Urban agriculture at the household level still has a very long way to go in Jordan. As things stand, the levels of knowledge, interest and dedication in households remain weak. It will take years of concerted effort to increase the uptake of this activity. Although training and pilot projects offered by community centres can be of help if administered properly, the best hope for spreading UA is through schools, where learning how to grow food could become part of the curriculum or an extracurricular activity. Of course, personnel who are dedicated to these activities over the long term are essential for any of them to succeed. 1.2 The societal challenges addressed are clearly understood and documented Exploratory studies on urban agriculture have been undertaken. 1.3 Human well-being outcomes arising from the NbS are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed Human well-being outcomes are explicitly recognised.

NbS are economically viable CRITERIA 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 4.1 The direct and indirect benefits and costs associated with the NbS, who pays and who benefits, are identified and documented Related to private investment and community based or cooperative projects, but no information is available. The fact that large private-sector companies are willing to support and enable the various activities connected to urban agriculture through their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts is important. The Investbank has directed a good part of its CSR funds to agricultural activities and associated marketing, but this so far has not included direct support for urban agriculture activities. The support that Landmark Hotel has provided to The Green Hub is also a good example of how large commercial establishments may support urban agriculture activities, in this case for the benefit of all involved, including the hotel itself. 4.2 A cost-effectiveness study is provided to support the choice of NbS including the likely impact of any relevant regulations and subsidies No evidence found during the evaluation. 4.3 The effectiveness of the NbS design is justified against available alternative solutions, taking into account any associated externalities No evidence found during the evaluation. 4.4 NbS design considers a portfolio of resourcing options such as market-based, public sector, voluntary commitments and actions to support regulatory compliance No evidence found during the evaluation. INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 5.1 A defined and fully agreed upon feedback and grievance resolution mechanism is available to all stakeholders before an NbS intervention can be initiated Establishing a dedicated group of stakeholders and setting a City Strategic Agenda (CSA) to support the sustainable development of urban agriculture in Amman are key aspects of this project. 5.2 Participation is based on mutual respect and equality, regardless of gender, age or social status, and upholds the right of Indigenous Peoples to Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) Special action is being dedicated to a local women\u2019s cooperative to improve the production, processing and marketing of selected crops, such as green leafy vegetables. This reinforces the idea of being not only inclusive but also sensitive to vulnerable groups. 5.3 Stakeholders who are directly and indirectly affected by the NbS have been identified and involved in all processes of the NbS intervention To boost engagement in urban agriculture activities, schools have been identified as the best place to start. A particular effort has been made in education and awareness raising amongst young people, particularly in two schools \u2013 Amman National School and King\u2019s Academy private school \u2013 where students have shown interest and enthusiasm in the process. 5.4 Decision-making processes document and respond to the rights and interests of all participating and affected stakeholders No information available or accessible in English. 5.5 Where the scale of the NbS extends beyond jurisdictional boundaries, mechanisms are established to enable joint decision making by the stakeholders in those jurisdictions affected by the NbS No evidence found during the evaluation.

NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 8.1 NbS design, implementation and lessons learnt are shared to trigger transformative change Formalisation of the City Strategic Agenda on UA The joint planning work in the MSF resulted in a City Strategic Agenda on Urban Agriculture, which then was forwarded to the municipal council or one of the council committees for discussion and approval, so that it could be incorporated in the municipal policies and budget. Adoption of the Strategic Agenda also led to the creation of a UA unit with the municipal structure. 8.2 NbS inform and enhance facilitating policy and regulation frameworks to support their uptake and mainstreaming In Amman, urban agriculture land use is included in land use planning, with 15% of new development permits to be given out for green and urban agriculture spaces. Agricultural lending institutions have recognised urban farmers as beneficiaries, allowing them new opportunities to access small loans. The Agricultural Extension Department of the Ministry of Agriculture provides urban and peri-urban producers with training and in-kind support services. Following intervention by the Amman Institute15, urban agriculture has been included as a major component of greening and re-zoning initiatives. 8.3 Where relevant, NbS contribute to national and global targets for human well-being, climate change, biodiversity and human rights, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) Multi-stakeholder policy influencing local urban food initiatives. Developments in Amman showed that the transition towards a more local food-producing system can be developed in a more top-down process. Several ministries, key institutions and NGOs took part in the Amman MSF. UA was institutionalised in the Bureau of Urban Agriculture of the City of Amman, first as part of the Department of Agriculture, but later directly under the Mayor\u2019s Office. The MSF meets irregularly, but the Mayor\u2019s Office provides support for business development and city greening16. The Urban Agriculture strategy contributes to Goal A of the Amman Resilience Strategy, which sets out the vision for a resilient Amman. 15 See \u201cUrban Agriculture in the Arab Region\u201d http://www.afedmag.com/english/ArticlesDetails.aspx?id=109 16 Urban Agriculture Magazine RUAF 31 - Inclusive Use of Urban Space. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309379997_Urban_ Agriculture_Magazine_RUAF_31_-_Inclusive_Use_of_Urban_Space AMMAN (Jordan).

District challenges Perchel\u2013Lagunillas is a typical historical, mainly residential district just outside the city centre, with architectural features that should be preserved but a high level of physical deterioration, large numbers of abandoned plots and minor economic activity. Challenge 1: A high level of vulnerability and social exclusion, with low levels of education. Furthermore, the project area is located right next to the revitalised historic centre of the city but lacks economic activity, as shown by its high rates of unemployment (especially among young people, more than 32% of whom are out of work); it has a high proportion of elderly residents on low incomes, and a high percentage of one-person households (47%, more than double the M\u00e1laga average). Challenge 2: The degradation of public spaces, green spaces and community facilities and the lack of infrastructure, which deters the active mobility of residents. Furthermore, the building stock is degraded too, with poor levels of energy efficiency (more than 53% of the registered Technical Building Inspections [ITE] are rated inadequate). Challenge 3: Poor connectivity with surrounding districts, with a lack of pedestrian and green infrastructure to connect with natural protected parks. The urban structure exacerbates the problem, as the area is divided in two by the river Guadalmedina and it is adjacent to the hill of Gibralfaro. On the other hand, the area can take advantage of its proximity to this hill, one of main green lungs of the city, on which stands the castle of Gibralfaro, a symbol of the city\u2019s cultural and built heritage. In the context of the eDUSI initiative, the EU\u2019s ReGREENeration project seeks to address the aforementioned challenges by proposing actions to improve social cohesion through enhancement of the district\u2019s connectivity with adjacent districts, involvement of vulnerable groups in the NbS deployment, and promotion M\u00c1LAGA (Spain).Green Infrastructure Plan.

NbS effectively address societal challenges INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 1.1 The most pressing societal challenges for rights holders and beneficiaries are prioritised Mainly three societal challenges have been prioritised: social cohesion (high level of vulnerability and social exclusion, with low levels of education), urban ecosystem (degradation of public spaces, green spaces and community facilities and lack of infrastructure, which deters the active mobility of residents) and connectivity (poor connectivity with surrounding districts, with a lack of pedestrian and green infrastructure to encourage active mobility of residents). The last two challenges are aligned with climate change in terms of their co-benefits: biodiversity and environmental quality, which in this sense are also related to human health. Finally, the development of new economic activities to reduce unemployment is another goal. 1.2 The societal challenges addressed are clearly understood and documented Three societal challenges are addressed: Challenge 1: High level of vulnerability and social exclusion, with low levels of education. Furthermore, the project area is located right next to the revitalised historic centre of the city but lacks economic activity, as shown by its high rates of unemployment (especially among young people, with more than 32% out of work); it has a high proportion of elderly residents on low incomes, and a high percentage of one-person households (47%, more than double the M\u00e1laga average). Challenge 2: Degradation of public spaces, green spaces and community facilities and lack of infrastructure, which deters the active mobility of residents. Furthermore, the building stock is degraded too, with poor levels of energy efficiency (more than 53% of the registered Technical Building Inspections [ITE] are rated inadequate). Challenge 3: Poor connectivity with surrounding districts, with a lack of pedestrian and green infrastructures to encourage the active mobility of residents. The urban structure exacerbates the problem, as the area is divided in two by the river Guadalmedina, and it is adjacent to the Gibralfaro hill. 1.3 Human well-being outcomes arising from the NbS are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed Human well-being outcomes arising from the NbS are identified as mainly linked to social cohesion. Additionally, the improvement of green areas and connectivity can also contribute to this goal; nevertheless, the direct link to NbS is not described in detail.

The city is characterised by a mix of urban and peri-urban settlements of multifaceted historical value, which make an important contribution to the city\u2019s historical-cultural identity. In recent years there has been great political commitment to urban regeneration and development and considerable efforts have been made within the Long-term Strategic Action Plan for Thessaloniki. In Pavlos Melas these efforts have involved incorporating ecology and urban planning into the design of green areas in the city, including new parks and ecosystems. These new environmental features of Pavlos Melas are not only designed with biodiversity enhancement in mind but also as a way to provide opportunities for businesses by creating jobs and economic welfare. This is a crucial element of this project since Pavlos Melas is among the 17 municipalities with the highest unemployment rates in Greece. Among the different actions and sectoral work carried out in Pavlos Melas municipality, one project stands-out as a flagship Nature-based Solution \u2013 the transformation of a former military camp in the city centre into a Metropolitan Park. Largely abandoned since 2006, it is now an \u2018urban gap\u2019 contributing to the deprivation of the area. To reverse the situation, the municipality has focused on strategic regeneration planning based on a variety of steps and procedures, including increased dialogue and cooperation with key stakeholders. The area covers 332,104 m2 and includes 63 buildings totalling 24,000 m2. The Municipality is embarking on a multi-phase restoration of the park. Phase 1 will concentrate on the restoration of the park\u2019s green spaces, while the sustainable reuse of the many buildings is the focus of Phase 2. The city\u2019s brownfield site will be turned into a biodiversity hotspot. A five-year timeline has been established to achieve the final goal of creating an expanding and connected park network that contributes to creating a carbon neutral city, reducing the thermal stress and forest fire risk during summer. Advanced water management methods were included as a required complement to an intervention that has been created with the active participation of citizens in the various phases of the process. Green corridors and cycle paths will encourage more suitable mobility and improve air quality. This intervention provides a transition from brownfield sites and military camps to urban parks, helping to create an attractive city that incorporates new NbS, offering business opportunities and promoting green housing.

A significant part of the Thessaloniki Waterfront has recently been renovated and opportunities exist for encouraging people to interact with the blue environment. This study will assess how individuals\u2019 health and well-being is affected by spending time during the working day at the city waterfront. They will be compared with a second group who have normal working days with no time to visit the waterfront. Workshop: Thessaloniki recently hosted a workshop to find out how the waterfront improves people\u2019s lives. This workshop was part of the BlueHealth international research investigation to identify changes that could impact health and well-being in coastal cities across Europe. The workshop, organised (on 7 November 2019) in partnership with the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, invited local stakeholders from public health, local government, urban planning and the Thessaloniki Water Service. Together the group identified six major factors that would impact health, well-being and blue space in the city. The factors likely to impact BlueHealth in Thessaloniki are: Climate change Migration Technology aimed at healthier urban living More recreational use of blue spaces Healthier urban living in EU policies and strategies Changes in labour conditions. Thessaloniki (Greece) BlueHealth and resilience strategy Thessaloniki Resilience Strategy [TRS-30]: (2017: Horizon 2030) Resilience is built on hope, which gives us confidence and strength to act. This Resilience Strategy builds on what the people of the city have already achieved and who they are whilst addressing their present and future challenges. It does so by creating structures and processes that will ensure the city\u2019s progress and development. The Resilience Strategy of Thessaloniki is a roadmap which will help the city to co- create a more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable city. Becoming a truly resilient city requires significant investment in terms of both time and resources. It requires hard work from everyone who lives and works in the city. The Strategy document reflects the values of the city and provides a roadmap to guide the evolution of activities that will help its citizens to work together to build resilience for decades to come. Rediscover the city\u2019s relationship with the sea: Integrate the economic and urban development of Thermaikos Bay by investing in the cultural and natural capital of the Bay for improved city life, restoring the ecosystem, monitoring environmental resilience, and designing a new governance system for managing these activities.

Nevertheless, it seems that these outcomes are not benchmarked or periodically assessed. Also, a workshop was held on 7 November 2019 to help Thessaloniki advise decision makers on how to maximise opportunities in the city and prepare it for protecting the environment, health and well-being in the future. THESSALONIKI (Greece). BlueHealth and Resilience Strategy ISSUES ADDRESSED Design at scale City-wide / District / Urban acupuncture CRITERIA 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 2.1 Design of NbS recognises and responds to the interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems No explicit reference to this is presented in the project, but as the design was guided by TRS-30, it should be true based on the TRS-30 vision: in particular, it is mentioned that it will be a dynamic coastal city that will guarantee the well- being of its people and will nurture its human talent, while strengthening its urban economy and respecting its natural resources. 2.2 Design of NbS is integrated with other complementary interventions and seeks synergies across sectors Synergies are identified at a policy level: The Government Continuity Plan and Risk Information System, the Thessaloniki Youth Resilience Challenge and the Action Plan on Refugee Integration, adopting a public space co-creation policy, Open Schools for the neighbourhoods and the Investment Framework for Thermaikos Bay. In this sense a cross-municipal collaboration has also begun, aiming to build resilience at the metropolitan level as a vehicle for development with the support of the World Bank and the Ministry of the Economy, Development and Tourism. 2.3 Design of NbS incorporates risk identification and risk management beyond the intervention site It is included in the TRS-30 \u201cLocal risk reduction and risk management systems\u201d, as an objective of Goal 3: to Build a dynamic urban economy and responsive city through effective and network governance. Thessaloniki is exposed to extreme conditions such as earthquakes, flooding, forest fires, snow and heat waves. These events interrupt city services and business continuity. It is essential to be prepared for these events and incorporate disaster resilience into long-term planning through risk management. This will enhance internal coordination and continuity planning in relation to emergency response and strengthen multi-stakeholder collaboration. 59 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Biodiversity net-gain CRITERIA 3. NbS result in net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 3.1 NbS actions directly respond to evidence-based assessment of the current state of the ecosystem and prevailing drivers of degradation and loss No explicit information is available about the NbS included in the renovation of Thessaloniki waterfront. However, in the TRS-30, one of the objectives of Goal 4 about rediscovering the city\u2019s relationship with the sea is Environmental Resilience Monitoring, since Thermaikos Bay has a fragile ecosystem and the monitoring is part of the intervention. 3.2 Clear and measurable biodiversity conservation outcomes are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed No information is available about the NbS included in the renovation of Thessaloniki\u2019s waterfront. Nevertheless, the second action of Goal 4 of TRS-30 is Develop environmental monitoring tools, but it is more concerned with pollutants and informing decisions about restoring the ecosystem. These tools will also help to predict and monitor the impacts of future infrastructure interventions. The challenge that arises from the use of the above indicators is the availability of the specific data sets in order to have a measurable evaluation. 3.3 Monitoring includes periodic assessments of unintended adverse consequences for nature arising from the NbS No evidence found during the evaluation. 3.4 Opportunities to enhance ecosystem integrity and connectivity are identified and incorporated into the NbS strategy No evidence found during the evaluation.

NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 5.1 A defined and fully agreed upon feedback and grievance resolution mechanism is available to all stakeholders before an NbS intervention can be initiated TRS-30 is based on the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) methodology, which provided an innovative model for the local authority to develop a holistic city strategy in collaboration with adjacent municipalities, local academic institutions, the non-profit sector, private stakeholders, and citizens and communities of the city. There are specific references to how citizens shaped the strategy: building trust amongst stakeholders by assessing perceptions of resilience across the city; by initiating dialogue including broad engagement and participation through various thematic working group meetings, workshops and mini- labs focusing on developing new ideas; and finally by activating the network and beginning resilience-in-action through mini-labs focusing on the implementation of solutions. One of the more relevant examples of this approach is the workshop held on 7 November 2019 in partnership with the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, which invited local stakeholders from public health, local government, urban planning and the Thessaloniki Water Service. Together the group identified six major factors that impact health, well-being and blue space in the city. 5.2 Participation is based on mutual respect and equality, regardless of gender, age or social status, and upholds the right of Indigenous Peoples to Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) TRS-30 is based on the robust participation and collaboration of more than 40 organisations and 2,000 citizens from across the city. There is also a special focus on the youth of the city. Over the last year, new partnerships have been formed, new solutions and ideas developed, and existing and ongoing innovation in the city highlighted. Rigorous academic research has been aligned with grass-roots initiatives. City policies have been combined and supported by best practice from other cities to develop new objectives, programmes and actions. The approach is mainly focused on residents, office workers, older people and schoolchildren in the centre of Thessaloniki. Participants have been recruited through the popular \u201cAUTH on Sundays\u201d campaign, and from environmental groups in the area. The interest received from the public exceeded expectations and 45 volunteers were enrolled in the study. 5.3 Stakeholders who are directly and indirectly affected by the NbS have been identified and involved in all processes of the NbS intervention More than 40 organisations and 2,000 citizens from across the city have been identified and take part in the actions mentioned for indicator 5.2. 5.4 Decision-making processes document and respond to the rights and interests of all participating and affected stakeholders No information available or accessible in English. 5.5 Where the scale of the NbS extends beyond jurisdictional boundaries, mechanisms are established to enable joint decision making by the stakeholders in those jurisdictions affected by the NbS No evidence found during the evaluation.

The Association Les Amis de Capte Tunisie\u2019s main missions are to contribute to: the fight against climate change; the development of solidarity with and among farmers; the improvement of the ecosystem and biodiversity, and improvement of the resilience of Tunisian agro-systems. Amongst the initiatives carried out by the association, there is one which is worth analysing in line with the third key aim of the association and this is the project called: Environmental corridors in the Oued Tine valley, located in the governorates of Bizerte and Manouba in north- eastern Tunisia. The project started in March 2019 and had a duration of 24 months. Total budget allocated: EUR 51,444 / TND 164,620. PPI-OSCAN: EUR 26,440 (52%). Co-financers: EUR 25,004 (48%). General purpose and specific objectives of the project: Rural communities economically dependent on the agricultural sector are the first to experience the effects of climate change, which are accentuated by poor agricultural practices (monoculture, deforestation, excessive ploughing, etc.). This is why the association, in collaboration with partner farmers and regional institutions, wishes to contribute to improving the resilience of farms to climate change, and to the restoration of agro-ecosystems.

NbS are economically viable INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 4.1 The direct and indirect benefits and costs associated with the NbS, who pays and who benefits, are identified and documented By planting trees and establishing agroforestry systems, the association, with the participation of the local population, will contribute to improving the resilience of farms to climate change and the restoration of agroecosystems. The establishment of hedges and thickets can reduce erosion (because bare land can lose between 11 and 86 tonnes of soil / ha / year) and limit bad agricultural practices, increasing the profitability and sustainability of farms. The training and awareness-raising work will enable the local population to better identify the existing forest species in the region, to enhance their value and process them, which will generate additional sources of income. The establishment of communal plantation sites, the installation of mini- nurseries and the monitoring and evaluation of the plantations will generate work for young people in the region. 4.2 A cost-effectiveness study is provided to support the choice of NbS including the likely impact of any relevant regulations and subsidies No evidence found during the evaluation. 4.3 The effectiveness of the NbS design is justified against available alternative solutions, taking into account any associated externalities No evidence found during the evaluation. However, it is worth mentioning that this project allows the association to propose solutions for farmers to adapt to the effects of climate change. These solutions are the result of collective work between association members and the local communities. They also depend on the support of institutions and of experts in the identification and mapping of indigenous forest species in the region, and the study of economic and agronomic challenges and opportunities for the identification of species to plant. These interactions will improve the technical skills of the association, especially in terms of the choice of species according to the various parameters involved. As part of a questionnaire given to the local communities, the initial state of perceptions, knowledge of the environment and training needs will be noted, then awareness workshops will assess the improvement in local people\u2019s knowledge of topics related to the conservation of biodiversity and the proper management of ecosystem services. To conclude, the association and its partners will improve their skills in terms of: i) project management, ii) surveying and mapping, iii) educational and fun games, iv) monitoring and management of plantations, and v) evaluation of ecosystem services. 4.4 NbS design considers a portfolio of resourcing options such as market-based, public sector, voluntary commitments and actions to support regulatory compliance There is a specific mechanism in place. The local community has formalised its involvement in the project as evidenced by the number of existing partnerships and the number of agreements signed. The people concerned will be consulted during the mapping process. An association for the promotion of apiculture has been created by the local community within the project: thanks to CAPTE\u2019s contact with the youth of the region, making them aware of environmental responsibility and local development, these young people have been influenced and have decided to take action. Their bee-keeping group will be a partner in the association\u2019s future projects and it will ensure that the impacts of these projects will be sustainable. It will validate the feedback from these surveys and the proposed training plan. The steering and monitoring-evaluation committee will include representatives from the community. Direct and indirect beneficiaries will participate in the implementation of activities and training. The activities and training will take place mainly locally. Finally, LACT provided support for an end-of-study project by a student from the agricultural school in Mateur entitled \u201cThe role of crop associations in an agroforestry context: a strategy to improve soil fertility\u201d. This student was from the region and he was properly supervised and accompanied in the field to take the soil samples.

Quantified and verifiable results to be achieved at the end of the project: \u20131 map produced, validated and distributed to partners; \u2013The local community (approx. 200 people) is aware and trained; \u201330 collaboration agreements for tree planting will be formalised; \u2013About ten native and other species will be introduced; \u2013 1 tool for monitoring and measuring the benefits of the plantations will be tested and shared; \u20131 steering committee and 1 monitoring and evaluation committee will be set up. 7.2 A monitoring and evaluation plan is developed and implemented throughout the intervention lifecycle Monitoring and evaluation has been specified and constitutes one of the key elements of the project. The steering committee will monitor and evaluate the actions carried out within the framework of its semi-annual meetings. It will be kept informed of the progress of activities by the monitoring and evaluation committee on a bi-monthly basis. 71 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES OUED TINE VALLEY AREA (Tunisia). Environmental Corridors INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 7.3 A framework for iterative learning that enables adaptive management is applied throughout the intervention lifecycle This project allows the association to propose solutions for farmers to adapt to the effects of climate change. These solutions are the result of collective work between association members and the local communities. They also depend on the support of institutions and of experts in the identification and mapping of indigenous forest species in the region, and the study of economic and agronomic challenges and opportunities for the identification of species to plant. These interactions will improve the technical skills of the association, especially in terms of the choice of species according to the various parameters involved. As part of a questionnaire given to the local communities, the initial state of perceptions, knowledge of the environment and training needs will be noted, then awareness workshops will assess the improvement in local people\u2019s knowledge of topics related to the conservation of biodiversity and the proper management of ecosystem services. To conclude, the association and its partners will improve their skills in terms of: i) project management, ii) surveying and mapping, iii) education, iv) monitoring and management of plantations, and v) evaluation of ecosystem services. ISSUES ADDRESSED Mainstreaming CRITERIA 8. NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 8.1 NbS design, implementation and lessons learnt are shared to trigger transformative change The Association Amis de Capte Tunisie, supported by SAS Capte, expect this project to create momentum in the region and allow new plantations to be created with neighbouring farmers wishing to change their farming methods. The development of a plantation monitoring tool will allow the association and farmers to perfect the introduction of agroforestry systems. Strengthening local people\u2019s skills in the management of nurseries and irrigation equipment will help to empower the population. Knowledge of the land, the diversity of current projects and the multiplicity of partnerships created contribute to the replicability of this type of project.

With a population of 790,000 inhabitants and located along the Sava river and below Medvednica mountain and its nature park, Zagreb has rich natural features. The Living Lab at Sesvete is one of the demonstration projects being developed as part of the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 research initiative proGIreg \u2013 Productive Green Infrastructure for Post-industrial Urban Regeneration. The proGIreg project focuses on developing and testing new Nature-based Solution (NbS)-oriented economies shared between public authorities, civil society and industry/SMEs. The Living Lab lies within Sesvete district in the east of Zagreb in the foothills of Medvednica mountain. With its 70,000 inhabitants, Sesvete has the youngest population in Croatia, and a strong community and entrepreneurial spirit. Located on various key European traffic routes, Sesvete has an industrial past and present, with a particularly active automotive and construction industry. Distinctive, tall silo buildings form part of Sesvete\u2019s skyline and industrial heritage. In particular, the site of the former meat-processing factory, Sljeme, is the core of the Living Lab, with green plans in place for the silo buildings themselves and the surrounding areas. A number of NbS will be implemented and tested in the living lab: Community-based urban farms and gardens Post-industrial areas often lack green spaces for public use. Turning unused urban land into productive community gardens can have a positive impact on locals, contributing to improved mental and physical health through exposure to nature and healthy sources of food and a community feeling. The Sesvete \u2018City Garden\u2019 will initially have around 100 units (and can be extended to new areas at a later stage). The garden will enable locals to grow traditional vegetables, herbs and flowers. This is one of 12 \u2018City Gardens\u2019 created in Zagreb since 2013. A nursery at the park entrance will serve as an educational centre for local schools. Food production will be organic, and the water pumps will run on solar power. Aquaponics Aquaponics is the combination of raising fish (aquaculture) in tanks together with soilless cultivation of plants (hydroponics) in a symbiotic environment, whereby the fish wastewater provides the nutrients needed to feed the plants. Aquaponics is ideal for promoting local food production in areas with contaminated or poor quality soil. Similarly to NbS food produced locally by locals can lead to healthier diets and contribute to community-building. Additionally, the aquaponics systems will create green job opportunities. This project intends to implement low-cost but stable aquaponics systems, which are easy to operate. Supported with technology from Dortmund and expertise from the University of Zagreb\u2019s Faculty of Agriculture, Zagreb will also test the potential of an aquaponics system on a 100 m2 former industrial site. Green walls and roofs Green roofs and vertical gardens improve a building\u2019s insulation, reduce stormwater run- off, capture CO2, filter pollutants, and increase biodiversity. This all leads to reduced energy consumption and increased urban resilience. Available technology is advanced, but the challenge is to increase uptake by integrating it into local urban policies. The former Sljeme meat- processing factory is to be fully revamped into a business innovation centre with a 700 m2 green roof (150 m2 of solar panels) and 300 m2 of green walls. There is also potential to replicate this on other factory buildings at the same site.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "987a7d41-f49a-4a13-b439-cb7d6540e24a": {"__data__": {"id_": "987a7d41-f49a-4a13-b439-cb7d6540e24a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a3d7cecb446e2d7b0c9a89ac3d9525c53a9b1ad1fc07f7ee1cdea416362007c"}, "2": {"node_id": "8820813c-400c-4fbd-aecf-6b63f56074a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f87c006431238282a92a49d62b724e13f8fa4b2bce4f6a65c3379fb05a9037f3"}}, "hash": "8dfe5cfe4be3919ce4669d5fae09a2e90ac2a4268efff3d41f61daa76d26a45b", "text": "There is also potential to replicate this on other factory buildings at the same site.

This is particularly relevant for the Pilot on Green corridors that will connect the Living Lab to the Sava river, the ecosystems of the forest in the north with the river in the south, and the different parts of Sesvete being redeveloped. 3.2 Clear and measurable biodiversity conservation outcomes are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed Yes, measurable biodiversity conservation outcomes are identified, particularly those related to ecological and environmental restoration and their benefits. The indicators used for ecological and environmental benefits assessment are those identified by the EKLIPSE EWG framework challenge to which they belong. 3.3 Monitoring includes periodic assessments of unintended adverse consequences for nature arising from the NbS There is no information available about how to contemplate the unintended adverse consequences of the NbS 3.4 Opportunities to enhance ecosystem integrity and connectivity are identified and incorporated into the NbS strategy Definitely one of the key aspects of the Living Lab is increasing the connectivity of green spaces through ecological corridors while improving accessibility from urban regeneration areas.

As suggested by EKLIPSE EWG, a cost-effectiveness assessment of the performance of the measures against their costs (both in terms of implementation and long-term maintenance) is necessary. Essentially, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted for each NbS comparing all direct and indirect costs and benefits identified, as described below. The direct economic and labour impact (both costs and benefits) will only be evaluated after implementation of the NbS. \u2013 Indirect impacts of the implemented NbS: The indirect impacts of the actions implemented cross-cut thematically and hence are to a certain extent more complex to assess than the direct economic impacts explained above. Indirect effects will be analysed by merging information from different sources and tools and seeking to focus on the sub-themes that were also outlined in Challenge 10 of the EKLIPSE EWG impact evaluation framework 1.0. Spatial data will always provide the baseline and the general trends against which to compare any changes detected through the different proGIreg assessment tools. 4.3 The effectiveness of the NbS design is justified against available alternative solutions, taking into account any associated externalities Yes.To describe benefit assessment, the EWG also recommended using specific indicators, which could easily and effectively describe the benefits and simultaneously provide efficient tools for comparing different NbS. The data collected as previously described and by following the Monitoring and Assessment Plan (D4.11), after having been stored in the proGIreg platform (see D4.24), will then be analysed by the WP4 partners according to their Task responsibility. For each of the abovementioned domains, data analysis will quantify the benefits in terms of specific indicators, calculated on the basis of the experimental data obtained. These indicators will be the final output of the proGIreg project and will be also used to compare the effectiveness of both the implemented NbS types and the developed monitoring protocols with those tested within the sister projects belonging, together with proGIreg, to EC Task Force 2 \u201cNbS Impact Evaluation Framework 2.0\u201d. 4.4 NbS design considers a portfolio of resourcing options such as market-based, public sector, voluntary commitments and actions to support regulatory compliance Nature-based solutions business models have not been developed, Nevertheless, the aim is to demonstrate how some NbS can develop into replicable, partly or fully self-sustaining businesses, so that proGIreg continues to provide sustainable benefits to society, also beyond the project. To do so, it is necessary to identify and understand possible bottlenecks for NbS when entering the market. Based on information from key proGIreg stakeholders gained via questionnaires, as well as information from cities external to the project, proGIreg will create a series of reports dedicated to the technological and non-technological barriers to NbS implementation, both within the project and beyond. A business model catalogue will present the economic and societal benefits of NbS and how they can be transformed into partly or fully self-sustaining businesses. ZAGREB (Croatia).

Explicitly recognised: Gender equity When communicating about proGIreg, partners should use gender-sensitive language and imagery in line with the European Institute for Gender Equality\u2019s Toolkit on gender sensitive communication. Below are the key principles and some examples from the Toolkit on inclusive communications: \u2013 Recognise and challenge stereotypes: e.g. make sure that the images you choose to use in communication materials do not reinforce gender stereotypes. Include a wide mix of people in different environments. \u2013 Be inclusive and avoid omission and making others invisible: e.g. do not use \u2018man\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019 to refer to the experiences of all people. \u2013 Be respectful and avoid trivialisation and subordination: e.g. ensure that your language actively promotes gender equality by use of the term Ms, which does not denote marital status. Zagreb: As this \u201cCity Gardens\u201d project flourished, increasing numbers of people from vulnerable and disadvantaged backgrounds showed an interest. Thus, the City Council and a local NGO came up with a plan for a new kind of garden equipped for people with psychological and physical disabilities. Therapeutic gardens are specially designed gardens with the aim of strengthening motor, sensory, cognitive, affective, nutritional, emotional and social potential. Gardens have been used for health and well-being around the world for hundreds of years, but this type of specifically designed garden would be a first for the Croatian capital. 5.3 Stakeholders who are directly and indirectly affected by the NbS have been identified and involved in all processes of the NbS intervention Yes. Involving a broad range of citizens and local organisations in the design of the proGIreg Living Labs is essential to the project\u2019s success; those who live and work in the area know best what they need, so working with them throughout the project ensures more inclusive and effective results. To support the Zagreb team in this process, experts on co-design from project partner ICLEI attended the meeting to guide the planning. Key activities included participants sharing their visions for Sesvete in 2030, in-depth stakeholder mapping of the area and presentations of co-design principles and methodologies. Partners also presented their initial co-design ideas, which included launching an architectural competition in the area, offering a \u2018Walk around Sljeme\u2019 for students, a museum exhibition on the meat industry and history of Sljeme, and introductions to aquaponics, urban farming and the concept of an inclusive \u2018therapy garden\u2019, which uses horticultural therapy to integrate minorities and people with disabilities.

Nature in the heart of Nice To do this, the MNCA has set up a unit comprising six biodiversity experts at the service of development and infrastructure project leaders, to carry out studies and provide technical expertise and advice on taking biodiversity into account from the design phase to site monitoring. There are three main actions in the Plan: Action 1, Planning in favour of biodiversity, for the integration of green and blue infrastructure in urban planning in the metropolitan area. It takes into account ecological continuities: developing an ecological network and translating it into green and blue infrastructure in the urban plan, expertise and recommendations in development projects, and restoration operations (such as wildlife corridors). Action 2, Local biodiversity management. This includes a pilot operation for the temporary installation of biodiversity monitoring sensors in the town of Cagnes-sur-Mer to measure the impact on biodiversity of partially switching off public lighting from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Associated pilot operations concern: light pollution and biodiversity (a pilot test of installing amber LEDs favourable to bats, urban monitoring and biodiversity (development of bat sensors to evaluate the solutions implemented in the framework), and concept of a pilot eco-landscaped garden, among others. Action 3, the project \u201cNature For City Life\u201d funded by the European Life programme incorporates NbS. In the search for solutions based on nature to develop, renovate and build (green roofs, wildlife corridors, etc.), \u201cNature and ecological continuities\u201d working groups are planned, involving a variety of actors on the following themes: protection of valleys, buildings and avifauna, bats and land use planning (e.g. including nest boxes in the design of buildings). This project also includes combating invasive alien species and promoting local plants (with production of a species guide and recommendations), together with marine biodiversity: \u2013 Ongoing development of a Sea Plan and a Territorial Ecological Restoration Scheme (STERE), involving other aquatic environments: \u2013 Study of aquatic environments and flood risk in the Tin\u00e9e and V\u00e9subie valleys; \u2013 Natura 2000 inter-site partnerships at sea, development of ecological diving moorings and creation of underwater nurseries. \u00a9 IMAGE SORCE: http://www.nice.fr/fr/actualites/la-nature-au-coeur-de-nice/mairie?type=articles&parent=root 83 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES NICE (France).

In particular, it aimed to: 1. Improve our understanding of mechanisms underpinning ecosystem services; 2. Analyse trade-offs and synergies between biodiversity, critical ecosystem services and territorial management; and 3. Facilitate the adoption of tools and concepts by stakeholders. It supported the incorporation of the complexity of ecological functioning into debates on territorial planning and management. Thinking in terms of ecosystem services and natural capital explicitly acknowledges our dependence on nature, and therefore the need for better protection and management of natural resources. As a result, these concepts have been adopted by policies, but the use of the concepts in practice is still in its infancy. The OPERAs project explored how and under what conditions these concepts could move beyond the academic domain towards practical implementation in support of sustainable ecosystem management. The ESNET Project (FP7\u20132014\u20132017) FINALISED Aimed to analyse future land use trajectories and their effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services for the Grenoble urban area. This dynamic motivated the Grenoble SCoT (territorial coherence plan) and underpinned critical issues for biodiversity and ecosystem services. As a project co-constructed with the multiple stakeholders involved in the management of the territory and its resources, ESNET built on their field knowledge, starting with the identification of the main issues linking the demand for ecosystem services with management and planning actions. These issues are structured by the need to reconcile ecological functioning and the uses and sharing of land and resources. The inherent complexity and multifunctionality of the territory mean that governance must be at the core of thinking on concerted management among all actors at the territorial scale.

NbS effectively address societal challenges INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 1.1 The most pressing societal challenges for rights holders and beneficiaries are prioritised The societal challenge most addressed is biodiversity and ecosystem services, which is considered the main driver of the intervention. Nevertheless, it is recognised that ecosystem services play an important role in supporting economic activity, development and general human well-being. Also, this project is perceived as crucial in facing the challenges of urbanisation in Grenoble to the detriment of agricultural areas, conservation of natural areas with high amenity and heritage value, and more generally dynamic economic development, as well as territorial inequalities. This framework aligned the project with human health and socio-economic development. 1.2 The societal challenges addressed are clearly understood and documented The societal challenges related to biodiversity and ecosystem services are clearly understood and documented; in fact they are specifically referenced in the modelling of land use and the biophysical modelling of ecosystem services. In terms of the biophysical modelling of ecosystem services, some relevant elements are included: prioritisation of ecosystem services and modelling methods: supply services, with a focus on timber production; regulation services, with a focus on the regulation of water quality (nitrogen); and cultural services, with a focus on recreational activities 1.3 Human well-being outcomes arising from the NbS are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed Ecosystem services are vital to human survival and well-being ,and the judicious management of the systems that produce these benefits is essential. Ecosystem service indicators are increasingly recognised as a key part of assessing whether such services are being managed appropriately and used sustainably. The ecosystem services approach highlights that the contribution of ecosystems to human well-being and activities is based on the use of resources and the functioning of interacting ecosystems. Going into detail, in this framework the human well-being outcomes are also analysed as cultural services, with a focus on recreational activities. Some references to the periodic assessment of this variable are reported, for instance in terms of the attractiveness of landscape. ISSUES ADDRESSED Design at scale City-wide / District / Urban acupuncture CRITERIA 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 2.1 Design of NbS recognises and responds to the interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems The ecosystem services approach is the main driver. In this respect, these interactions are considered. 2.2 Design of NbS is integrated with other complementary interventions and seeks synergies across sectors The intervention is included in the SCoT for Grenoble (Le Sch\u00e9ma de Coherence Territoriale de la grande r\u00e9gion de Grenoble). In addition, other concurrent projects have been identified that contribute to the same final goal. 2.3 Design of NbS incorporates risk identification and risk management beyond the intervention site In the risk analysis of the regulation services provided by ecosystems \u2013specifically soil erosion control, protective forests and flood regulation\u2013 the prioritisation of ecosystem services and modelling methods are taken into account.

These differences particularly concern patterns of urban expansion, forest expansion and the associated losses of agricultural land. 94 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Inclusive governance CRITERIA 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 5.1 A defined and fully agreed upon feedback and grievance resolution mechanism is available to all stakeholders before an NbS intervention can be initiated The projects provide stakeholders with user-friendly tools and instruments to enable them to apply ecosystem services science and knowledge in their field of work, in order to engage stakeholders and build a community around the outputs across science, policy and practice. Some variables to be highlighted about the stakeholders\u2019 involvement are the following: \u2013Participatory Scenario Planning process for downscaling regional normative scenarios; \u201319 institutions from 6 economic sectors were involved throughout a two-year process. Over twenty stakeholders representing the main management and decision- making bodies for land planning, agriculture, forestry, nature conservation, tourism and water management were involved. 5.2 Participation is based on mutual respect and equality, regardless of gender, age or social status, and upholds the right of Indigenous Peoples to Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) The stakeholders include those involved in territorial and resource management, such as representatives of the government, local authorities, NGOs and regional natural parks. They represent the main economic sectors that have an impact on land use and natural resources: urban planning, agriculture, forestry, tourism and water management. The project details the high added value and mutual benefits of an interdisciplinary and participatory approach, based on active collaboration with local actors involved in the management of the territory and its resources, and with strong sectoral and geographic expertise. The active participation of stakeholders in the design and evaluation of the work facilitated the integration of local needs and expectations. 5.3 Stakeholders who are directly and indirectly affected by the NbS have been identified and involved in all processes of the NbS intervention This process has taken place;, nevertheless, no specific reference to citizen participation is made. 5.4 Decision-making processes document and respond to the rights and interests of all participating and affected stakeholders No evidence found during the evaluation. 5.5 Where the scale of the NbS extends beyond jurisdictional boundaries, mechanisms are established to enable joint decision making by the stakeholders in those jurisdictions affected by the NbS No evidence found during the evaluation. FRENCH ALPS: Land use and ecosystem services in the Grenoble urban area ISSUES ADDRESSED Balance trade-offs CRITERIA 6. NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 6.1 The potential costs and benefits of associated trade-offs of the NbS intervention are explicitly acknowledged and inform safeguards and any appropriate corrective actions This example aims to: 1) offer a better knowledge of mechanisms underpinning ecosystem services; 2) analyse trade-offs and synergies between biodiversity, critical ecosystem services and territorial management and 3) facilitate appropriation of tools and concepts by stakeholders. Knowledge of the synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services is essential to manage ecosystems sustainably, and to maximise benefits for society. ESNET\u2019s key originality was its focus on the concept of ecosystem services networks, which aims to account for interactions (positive and negative) among ecosystem services from a functional perspective, thereby highlighting cause-effect relationships. 95 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Adaptive management CRITERIA 7.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32ec2b0c-2c04-4f9e-b5f7-47038b2370de": {"__data__": {"id_": "32ec2b0c-2c04-4f9e-b5f7-47038b2370de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ccdb0bbe0f68d5d8d1f12bfb2288c8411bd65839d7c962fec7787879dd25c9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "816ec023-6fff-418a-b0f4-18ca4b366ac4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f249a633268bc847f9cbd5907f911b69cdce0d214afbc66a4471c1fc34a3b311"}}, "hash": "c12aca9bd3ff67dc277ee5e1db832e1deb2cb2c818e0bb520acbd981587a268c", "text": "NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 7.1 An NbS strategy is established and used as a basis for regular monitoring and evaluation of the intervention The evaluation is based on previous data and modelling of different future scenarios, for instance in terms of the evaluation of the dynamics of significant contrasting uses according to the planning choices which underlie them, in particular with regard", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e6dad5e-40d1-4fc9-a019-786aae9ab83b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e6dad5e-40d1-4fc9-a019-786aae9ab83b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b66e400a02c7dd28da8a28f799ebc186692c02094e9078fcba2823eadb6bd175"}, "3": {"node_id": "6aace42e-dc29-4d30-bb58-4505e7d65bd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a50acb2901567f14b38bfd245484ff7d450b7cdf0168679d7b339a859a374a2"}}, "hash": "18ad189adc2ae04de7994ba6d13b9b60efc160a78a819854f95aff719b0fc9bc", "text": "to urban sprawl and forest expansion for the most contrasting scenarios. In terms of specific monitoring, the three major scientific challenges of the evaluation are: 1. Quantifying the capacity of the hydrosystem to provide ecosystem services of interest to its actors; 2. Identifying and analysing the synergies and spatial compromises between ecosystem services, or sets of ecosystem services; 3. Carry out an evaluation of sets of ecosystem services with local stakeholders to analyse their future trajectories. Nevertheless, the monitoring of the benefits in terms of their effectiveness in addressing societal challenges is not explicitly specified in the document. 7.2 A monitoring and evaluation plan is developed and implemented throughout the intervention lifecycle In the project there is a combination of modelling and mapping. In terms of modelling: the DINAMICA platform is used to represent recent land use change dynamics and major future trajectories under different scenarios, such as urban consolidation or the continuation of peri-urban sprawl. Such land use and management projections will provide data for the modelling of changes for 11 ecosystem services: 3 provisioning services, 2 cultural services and 6 abiotic and biotic regulation services, as well as for terrestrial vertebrate and plant diversity. Mapping was an essential method (ESNET) and was supported by multi-source mapping of land use / land cover at fine spatial (15 m) and typological (especially for agricultural ecosystems) resolution. This mapping was done for the baseline (2010) and for four scenarios for 2040. These scenarios were co-produced with stakeholders by adapting, downscaling and making spatially explicit the Montagne 2040 scenarios of the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes administrative region. Nevertheless, there is no explicit reference to continuous monitoring after implementation. 7.3 A framework for iterative learning that enables adaptive management is applied throughout the intervention lifecycle No evidence found during the evaluation.

NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 8.1 NbS design, implementation and lessons learnt are shared to trigger transformative change The results of the projects are well suited for the mainstreaming of ecosystem services in local decision making and land management at a time when ecosystem services are emerging as an important topic in national (and European) policy. Due to the time and resources invested in the various interventions, advanced coordination and previous experience of transdisciplinary research are essential to obtain value the from learnt lessons. 8.2 NbS inform and enhance facilitating policy and regulation frameworks to support their uptake and mainstreaming The main challenges for mainstreaming the ecosystem services concepts in practical usage are related to the various trade-offs that arise from: \u2013 The multiple functions and uses of ecosystems at a given location; \u2013 The time period over which functions and use are being considered; \u2013 The effects of local decision making elsewhere; and \u2013 The different ways in which social/cultural and market/non-market values are assigned to ecosystem services. 8.3 Where relevant, NbS contribute to national and global targets for human well-being, climate change, biodiversity and human rights, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) No evidence found during the evaluation. \u00a9 IMAGE SOURCE: https://operas-project.eu/node/323 FRENCH ALPS: Land use and ecosystem services in the Grenoble urban area 97 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES Jerusalem (Israel) Gazelle Valley Urban Nature Park This initiative was established in the context of Jerusalem`s Local Action for Biodiversity legacy project for the International Decade of Biodiversity.

In this respect, creating a natural urban ecosystem is the main goal of the project. This specific goal is related to climate change and disaster risk, which was the ethos behind the water management system. Social development is part of the societal challenges addressed by the project, since it intends to provide a social hub for gathering and developing educational activities aligned with the goals of the park. 1.2 The societal challenges addressed are clearly understood and documented The park is an important resource for the adjacent densely populated neighbourhoods. Volunteers of all ages and abilities make up the team who carry out most of the maintenance needs. The Park provides an important outdoor retreat from urban stress. 1.3 Human well-being outcomes arising from the NbS are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed Management of the park is routinely evaluated by the municipality of Jerusalem, which funds the entire project.

JERUSALEM. Gazelle Valley. Urban Nature Park ISSUES ADDRESSED Balance trade-offs CRITERIA 6. NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 6.1 The potential costs and benefits of associated trade-offs of the NbS intervention are explicitly acknowledged and inform safeguards and any appropriate corrective actions The water run-off management was the driving force behind the support by the local water authority for the infrastructure of the Park. Since copious amounts of rainwater have been collected by the natural filtration systems, there has been no local flooding. Seasonal flooding of the area had been damaging to road infrastructure as well as personal property. This has now ceased because of NbS. 6.2 The rights to, usage of and access to land and resources, along with the responsibilities of different stakeholders are acknowledged and respected The stakeholders in this case are acknowledged as the mountain gazelles. Two-thirds of the park is set aside for their use only. The public may visit the other third but the defining line between the public and the wildlife is only a thin cord. This is a new concept to many of the visitors and is often a test of self-restraint. 6.3 Established safeguards are periodically reviewed to ensure that mutually agreed trade-off limits are respected and do not destabilise the entire NbS No evidence found during the evaluation. 102 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Adaptive management CRITERIA 7. NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 7.1 An NbS strategy is established and used as a basis for regular monitoring and evaluation of the intervention The park staff and management apply established policies regarding the mountain gazelles, the water circulation system, and the botanic enrichment and endangered flora conservation programmes. Any intervention only takes place after considering its possible repercussions and with regard to crucial time periods for the ecosystem such as breeding periods, the dry and wet seasons, and the various annual cycles of the plantlife. 7.2 A monitoring and evaluation plan is developed and implemented throughout the intervention lifecycle The main subject of the intervention \u2013 the local population of mountain gazelles \u2013 is being closely monitored by staff members employed for this sole purpose. Varied tracking options are in use, and veterinary professionals, government officials and university researchers are included in the decision-making processes regarding the gazelles. 7.3 A framework for iterative learning that enables adaptive management is applied throughout the intervention lifecycle No evidence found during the evaluation. JERUSALEM. Gazelle Valley. Urban Nature Park ISSUES ADDRESSED Mainstreaming CRITERIA 8. NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 8.1 NbS design, implementation and lessons learnt are shared to trigger transformative change The park\u2019s master plan, as well as documents containing specific information about the flora and fauna, are publicly available on the park\u2019s website. 8.2 NbS inform and enhance facilitating policy and regulation frameworks to support their uptake and mainstreaming No evidence found during the evaluation. 8.3 Where relevant, NbS contribute to national and global targets for human well-being, climate change, biodiversity and human rights, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) The Gazelle Valley Urban Nature Park is used as a successful example of NbS for other projects both within Jerusalem and nationwide. \u00a9 IMAGE SOURCE: https://www.gazelle-valley.com/ https://www.gazelle-valley.com/ 103 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES Malta.

The Alter Aqua programme is an ongoing multi- stakeholder initiative started in 2011, designed and implemented by the Global Water Partnership \u2013 Mediterranean, in partnership with the Energy and Water Agency within the Ministry for Energy, Enterprise and Sustainable Development, the Ministry for Gozo and the Eco-Gozo Project, as well as The Coca-Cola Foundation and General Soft Drinks Co. Ltd. The programme was funded through a $1.4 million investment by the Coca-Cola Foundation, the philanthropic arm of The Coca-Cola Company. The programme aimed at mobilising non-conventional water resources to increase water availability in a sustainable, cost-effective way and promote a new water culture, at both local and national level. In this framework, the programme has implemented significant green infrastructure works, including installation and reinstatement of non-conventional water resource systems such as rainwater harvesting, stormwater management and greywater reuse systems in selected public buildings and areas. Through its practical actions the programme has positively impacted the lives of 65,000 people (around 15% of the population) in the Maltese Islands by collecting and reusing more than 19 million litres of water annually \u2013 equivalent to the monthly water consumption of over 1,000 families in Malta. Its applications to install greywater recycling systems and reinstate rainwater harvesting reservoirs have opened up new opportunities to collect rainwater for use in landscape irrigation and new forestation projects as well as green roof irrigation. The programme included various awareness- raising campaigns and capacity building towards sustainable water use. The target groups for these actions were school students, teachers, local authorities, local technicians and national NGOs. The current phase (2019\u20132021) focuses on engaging college and university students and young professionals in studying and applying non- conventional water resources and nature based solutions for improved water management in the Maltese Islands. This could definitely represent a best practice example of sustainable water resource management in Mediterranean countries and regions. MALTA. The Alter Aqua.

Non-Conventional Water Resources Programme (NCWRP) 106 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 2.2 Design of NbS is integrated with other complementary interventions and seeks synergies across sectors Yes, most of the installations were implemented in existing public buildings. Besides contributing to the local water budget, what is more important is the demonstration effect. A number of different technologies, at different scales and in various public facilities are showcased, many of them innovative and pioneering for the Maltese Islands. By selecting highly frequented as well as landmark public buildings and areas accessible to the general public for NCWR applications, insights are obtained into their specificities and benefits, making their adoption possible at domestic, community and national level. For example, the application of a greywater recycling system in MCAST, coupled with a green roof, not only reuses the greywater, which has become a resource instead of waste, but also offers the benefits of a green roof: a greener, cooler and more pleasant environment. Moreover, it serves for educational purposes, as students of water-related technologies study the process, while biology and biodiversity students also assess the potential of greywater recycling for green roof irrigation and the green roofs\u2019 effect on the microclimate. 2.3 Design of NbS incorporates risk identification and risk management beyond the intervention site No evidence found during the evaluation.

In the 2nd phase of the Alter Aqua programme, 3,440 students participated in educational activities. \u2212 The Alter Aqua video game has been produced. It is a helpful interactive tool to raise awareness and sensitise primary and secondary school students on the use of non-conventional water resources and water saving in everyday life. \u2212 Local teachers and educators have been instructed in how to apply the Alter Aqua educational material. In the 1st phase of the Alter Aqua Programme 255 persons were instructed. In the 2nd phase of the Alter Aqua Programme 277 persons were instructed. \u2212 Educational activities have enhanced related technical skills of local workers and technical services of local authorities, on traditional know-how as well as on modern technologies for NCWR schemes and water related innovations. \u2212 Capacity building for Youth, focusing on two main streams, technical and non- technical, has allowed college and university students and young professionals to develop their skills in the methodology, design and applications of NCWR management. Students and young professionals in social sciences improved their skills in communicating the value of water, Malta\u2019s water heritage, etc. 5.3 Stakeholders who are directly and indirectly affected by the NbS have been identified and involved in all processes of the NbS intervention No evidence found during the evaluation. 5.4 Decision-making processes document and respond to the rights and interests of all participating and affected stakeholders The Alter Aqua educational material is the result of a fruitful cooperation between the EkoSkola Team and the MEdIES team from Greece, with the intention to raise awareness and sensitise the educational community on the very crucial issue of NCWR across the Mediterranean, and particularly in the Maltese Islands.

In this respect, the general public were made aware of sustainable water use and the NCWR solutions that can be easily and cost-effectively applied at domestic and community level. A widespread campaign for dissemination was also set up. Awareness raising and dissemination of programme results is carried out through targeted events and/or conferences. Some highlights include the following: \u2013 The Alter Aqua Programme was included as an example of best practice for climate change adaptation through the use of NCWR and alternative water resources in the Mediterranean and was presented by GWP-Med at the 6th World Water Forum (12\u201316 March 2012, Marseille, France). \u2013 A National Consultation on Non-Conventional Water Resources Management in the Maltese Islands was organised by Alter Aqua in partnership with the Ministry for Energy and Health (Valletta, 6 May 2014) \u2013 An Alter Aqua Outreach Event was held in Gozo (5 May 2014) \u2013 An Alter Aqua corner and hands-on activities were organised at various events: Lejlet Lapsi - Notte Gozitana (Gozo, 10\u201312 May 2013); World Water Day in Malta (Valletta, 22 March 2014); Opening of the Heritage Trail (Pembroke, 3\u20134 May 2014). \u2013 Presentations have been given at various conferences, meetings and forums: 5th Beirut Water Week (22\u201323 May 2014); Global Environmental Change in the Mediterranean City and the Role of Global Earth Observations Conference, (Athens, 10\u201311 June 2014); annual GWP Consulting Partners Meeting (Trinidad, 27\u201328 June 2014); Rainwater Harvesting Knowledge Exchange Forum (Saint Lucia, Caribbean, 21\u201323 October 2014); Greening the Islands Conference on the Italian island of Pantelleria (30\u201331 October 2014); Malta Water Week (Valletta, 25\u201326 March,2015). \u2013 The dedicated website www.gozowater.com was developed to tell the stories of people involved in the Programme, as well as to testify to the Programme\u2019s contribution to Gozo\u2019s water scarcity challenge. 8.2 NbS inform and enhance facilitating policy and regulation frameworks to support their uptake and mainstreaming No evidence found during the evaluation.

A range of Action Points, which aim at stimulating the transition towards a green economy, is also included in the document (Ministry for Sustainable Development, the Environment and Climate Change, 2015). For spatial planning, the Planning authority in Malta has had a Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development since 2015. This policy document is a tool to enhance greening of open spaces, developing ecological corridors and improving the quality of life in urban areas (the Planning Authority, 2018a). The Alter Aqua programme is definitely in line with it. Although biodiversity is not the key driver of the AlterAqua programme, it is worth mentioning that Malta\u2019s National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 2012\u20132020 includes five policy goals with 20 action tasks that should be fulfilled by 2020. The strategy aims to integrate GI within spatial planning policies, and it identifies GI as one of the main options for improving ecosystems and their services. The policy document is viewed as a driver to enhance Malta\u2019s biodiversity, as well as the 2020 global and EU targets for biodiversity. Another GI-related policy document is the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (adopted in 2012). This document states the importance of the conservation of habitats, ecosystems and biodiversity as core elements of climate change adaptation (action 17) and specifies that cost benefit analyses and environment impact assessments should be used as tools to fulfil these tasks (Ministry for Resources and Rural Affairs, 2012, p.17).

Evaluation of general adaptation options regarding most of the existing and future risks that have been identified concerning vulnerable sectors, objects and areas as a result of the vulnerability assessment; 2. Survey of selected representative situations (case studies) and development of example solutions or adaptation options; and 3. Development of an action plan summarising all potential adaptation options for the different fields and sectors. Seven case study areas were selected for this plan, three of which are highlighted as examples of good practice: Number 5, Tirana River project: Ongoing project for the restoration of the Tirana River aiming at flood risk mitigation, improvement of the banks, and new recreation and housing areas. Climate change adaptation actions in Tirana mainly address informal settlements along the Tirana River; flood risks; waste and river pollution problems. The most important development project in Tirana is the restoration of the Tirana River and its flood plain. There is a high potential for upgrading the situation, and now there are ongoing redevelopment activities for the river, housing and land use. Number 6, Northern Boulevard project : Ongoing project for the improvement and development of the northern area of Tirana city centre up to the Tirana River in the north (see figure 2). Also, the connections of the city centre will be improved and a new Boulevard, housing areas, business areas and a green corridor are being developed. Number 7, Magnet project area: Ongoing development of a new quarter in the west of Tirana city centre. The whole block is subject to new investment, housing, businesses, car parks and green space.

Nevertheless, other societal challenges, like human health and socio-economic development, are also understood and documented. The Tirana Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan indicates that the main challenges in Tirana are: Urban sprawl: The structural form of the city and the distribution and density of land uses have a profound effect on the overall efficiency and performance of the city\u2019s physical and community infrastructure systems. While Tirana\u2019s centre has the vibrancy of a dense cosmopolitan city, towards the edges of the city we find the legacy of recent periods of uncontrolled growth and informal settlements. If left uncontrolled, the city\u2019s growth could take the form of continuing sprawl, leading to rising infrastructure costs, longer commuting times, destruction of the natural environment and productive agricultural areas, and overall rising energy and transport fuel consumption. Open green space: The Territorial Urban Plan of Tirana indicates that the ratio of open green space per 100,000 inhabitants is only 4.6 ha. This is a low value, and inhabitants have complained about the lack of green areas within their neighbourhoods, indicating this is a local issue for many city areas. Pollution of water bodies: The Tirana River in the north and the Lana River in the south are the two main receiving points for city sewage and drainage. However, there is no water treatment plant in Tirana [\u2026]. For comparison, the water quality recorded is more than 50% worse than the effluent quality of a typical wastewater treatment plant in Europe. Biodiversity: Biodiversity quality data is limited for Tirana for both terrestrial and aquatic ecology. Anecdotal evidence indicates that Tirana\u2019s biodiversity quality is poor. 1.3 Human well-being outcomes arising from the NbS are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed No evidence found during the evaluation. ISSUES ADDRESSED Societal challenges Climate change / Disaster risk / Human health / Economic and social development ISSUES ADDRESSED Design at scale City-wide / District / Urban acupuncture CRITERIA 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 2.1 Design of NbS recognises and responds to the interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems The initiative (and the highlighted projects) considered provides an integrated vision of the following aspects: Economy: development and new investments in business areas, adapted design and constructions; Society: new recreation and housing areas; Ecosystems: restoration of the Tirana River banks and flood plains, reduction of waste and river pollution problems, development of a green corridor, green areas, and promotion of climate friendly designs. TIRANA. Adaptation Action Plan 114 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Biodiversity net-gain CRITERIA 3. NbS result in net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 3.1 NbS actions directly respond to evidence-based assessment of the current state of the ecosystem and prevailing drivers of degradation and loss The actions respond to evidence-based assessment of the past (since the early 20th century) and current state of the weather (mainly temperatures and precipitation) in Tirana, while considering climate change scenarios too. The Adaptation Action Plan refers to both the results of the vulnerability assessment and the ongoing projects of the municipality. The focus was on improving the existing processes in the light of CCA needs, rather than on developing new processes. 3.2 Clear and measurable biodiversity conservation outcomes are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed No evidence found during the evaluation. 3.3 Monitoring includes periodic assessments of unintended adverse consequences for nature arising from the NbS The implementation and monitoring of CCA actions are indicated in chapter 6 of the Tirana CCA Action Plan: The purpose of monitoring the implementation of the CCA action plan is to understand whether the project or activity delivers the planned benefits and to be able to adjust the measures and activities according to potentially changing conditions and new knowledge. Furthermore, the findings from the monitoring process should be reflected in a long-term adaptation strategy and in new adaptation measures as well as future planning.

Also, future risks and opportunities are assessed: climate change might increase future risks, but also may offer future opportunities. The assessment builds on the identified current vulnerability (see chapter 4.1) and the projected climate change trends (see chapter 3.3). Finally, a risk analysis in carried out for specific examples: Example 2: Water courses \u2013 flood risk in spatial planning. TIRANA. Adaptation Action Plan 115 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Economic feasibility CRITERIA 4. NbS are economically viable INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 4.1 The direct and indirect benefits and costs associated with the NbS, who pays and who benefits, are identified and documented The improvement in the quantity and quality of green spaces and biodiversity in Tirana may provide a number of environmental, economic and social benefits. Some of them are: Climate change mitigation and adaptation: Green spaces may provide a range of mitigation and adaptation services, including: a) Provision of greater carbon capture and storage, thus reducing the risk of climate change; b) Protection of biodiversity in Tirana, enabling terrestrial ecosystems to remain habitable by a variety of plant and animal species; and c) Protection of Tirana\u2019s urban and rural areas of high economic value from changing weather patterns such as increased floods and heat waves. The improvement of green infrastructure through all Green Spaces & Biodiversity actions will enhance the quality perceived by our citizens, thus increasing the value that they place upon green spaces in terms of: a) Recreation and outdoor leisure activities, such as children\u2019s playgrounds in pocket parks and leisure areas along the restored lakes around Tirana; b) Improved health and well-being resulting from additional physical activity from cycling and walking along trails in green corridors and the Metrobosco, reducing health service costs; c) Increased cohesion and empowerment of the community through community ownership, management and use of green spaces, as well as improved image of place through the attractiveness of outdoor spaces. There is also a cost analysis for each action: see the Financial and Economic Assessment. 4.2 A cost-effectiveness study is provided to support the choice of NbS including the likely impact of any relevant regulations and subsidies No evidence found during the evaluation. 4.3 The effectiveness of the NbS design is justified against available alternative solutions, taking into account any associated externalities No evidence found during the evaluation. 4.4 NbS design considers a portfolio of resourcing options such as market-based, public sector, voluntary commitments and actions to support regulatory compliance No evidence found during the evaluation. ISSUES ADDRESSED Inclusive governance CRITERIA 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 5.1 A defined and fully agreed upon feedback and grievance resolution mechanism is available to all stakeholders before an NbS intervention can be initiated The Environmental Policies and Environmental Education department has coordinated the activities in Tirana in order to receive feedback on the interventions. A working group comprising representatives of all relevant directorates and sectors carried out a vulnerability assessment and developed an action plan. The focus was on two main variables: \u2013 The City administration approves jointly developed measures to be incorporated in the city\u2019s planning and management processes. \u2013 The capacities of selected representatives and decision makers (like councillors, etc.) are developed to follow up the implementation of the developed measures after setting up the action plan. The interim results provide guidance for the political and administrative work in the city incorporating other politics and plans.

The port has its own autonomous management body, the Port Authority of Alicante, with a direct link to the local government in the city of Alicante. In this complex governance set-up, the port\u2019s status as infrastructure of general interest means that the Port Plan prevails over any other planning instrument, and this includes the PGOU (General Urban Development Plan). This initiative is one of the actions of the Strategic Plan for the Port of Alicante, which aims to define the development model for the port for the next 20 years, with its specific features, and the coordination of the port, industrial and urban areas. In order to visually and acoustically isolate the impact that the port facilities have on the city, the Port Authority of Alicante has developed an attractive, high-quality green space, where the prevailing tree and bush species are native ones adapted to Alicante\u2019s climate, requiring low maintenance and water consumption and where citizens can spend their leisure time and enjoy cultural activities. To highlight the chromatic and volumetric effect of certain species and at the same time provide a scenic background for the immediate surroundings, large numbers of specimens of the same species have been planted in groups covering significant parts of the total area of the park. In some cases, the ground level has been raised by more than five metres above its previous level to create artificial hills that give a feeling of movement to the structure of the park and its paths. The total area of this park is approximately 24,700 m2, located under the access bridge to the highway and its adjoining areas. It borders the Avenida de Elche to the west, and roads of the port area to the east, north and south.

Key features of this project are: Strong landscape approach grounded in the European Landscape Convention (that is, perceived landscape) and in a specific climatic context. This is a very important aspect and the intervention has been designed with this approach (perceived landscape and climate). With this landscape approach, a buffer zone has been designed between the port area, the hard industrial area, and the consolidated urban area. One function of this transition area is to be a public space accessible to the community. It is very important to highlight that the intervention is carried out on port land, with the economic implications that this has. The Parque del Mar project would not have been economically viable otherwise. However, the port authority\u2019s investment and commitment to sustainability is clear, responding to social demands for the use of public space, identity creation, and urban landscape in general. The climate in this transition zone has been an important consideration and the shaded part is key for the use of the park. Although a formal public consultation process has not been carried out, the social demands known to exist or collected through public channels for receiving suggestions have been taken into account, since social acceptance of the intervention is regarded as essential. Another noteworthy aspect is the area of influence and impact of the intervention. It is considered not to be limited to the urban area immediately adjacent to the park but rather to be that of the Port itself, extending outside the province of Alicante to Valencia, Murcia, Albacete and beyond. The park\u2019s function as an acoustic barrier stands out, as it was designed bearing in mind the acoustic dimension for the chosen topography. There is a second phase of this intervention, \u201cParque del Mar II\u201d, currently under tender within the Strategic Plan. It will focus on: Elements of the existing cultural heritage; Social demand and acceptance; Water efficiency and use; Criteria for selecting protected species for the nursery of local species; in the first phase the aim was only to restore degraded habitats, but in the second part water efficiency is key and also endangered species may be planted.

In addition, meteorological conditions are monitored; the approach is not explicitly linked to thermal comfort. ALICANTE (Spain). Park of the Sea ISSUES ADDRESSED Design at scale District CRITERIA 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 2.1 Design of NbS recognises and responds to the interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems The interaction between society and ecosystem is especially important in the project since it combines blue and green elements in a new green area in order to address citizens\u2019 complaints about the pollution created by the port infrastructure and activities. One of the main goals of the project is to reduce the port\u2019s visual impact and to improve environmental quality in the immediate neighbourhood. 2.2 Design of NbS is integrated with other complementary interventions and seeks synergies across sectors The complementary interventions are linked to the other specific goals of the port and aligned with other interventions in the area or with the plans or programmes of other authorities or stakeholders. However, given the port\u2019s status as infrastructure of general interest, the Port Plan prevails over any other planning instrument, and this includes the PGOU. 2.3 Design of NbS incorporates risk identification and risk management beyond the intervention site Included in the Strategic Plan of the Port of Alicante. 129 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Biodiversity net-gain CRITERIA 3. NbS result in net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 3.1 NbS actions directly respond to evidence-based assessment of the current state of the ecosystem and prevailing drivers of degradation and loss In terms of human health and well-being it seems that the area is degraded, since several citizens\u2019 complaints about environmental quality are reported as one of the reasons for developing the project. There is no information on other aspects of ecosystem degradation. 3.2 Clear and measurable biodiversity conservation outcomes are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed The second phase of this intervention, \u201cParque del Mar II\u201d, currently under tender within the Strategic Plan, will include criteria for selecting protected species for the nursery of local species; in the first phase the aim was only to restore degraded habitats, but in the second part water efficiency is key and also endangered species may be planted. 3.3 Monitoring includes periodic assessments of unintended adverse consequences for nature arising from the NbS No evidence found during the evaluation. 3.4 Opportunities to enhance ecosystem integrity and connectivity are identified and incorporated into the NbS strategy There is a second phase of this intervention, \u201cParque del Mar II\u201d, currently under tender within the Strategic Plan. It will focus on: \u2212 elements of the existing cultural heritage; \u2212 social demand and acceptance; \u2212 water efficiency and use; \u2212 criteria for selecting protected species for the nursery of local species; in the first phase the aim was only to restore degraded habitats, but in the second part water efficiency is key and also endangered species may be planted.

Design of NbS is informed by scale INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 2.1 Design of NbS recognises and responds to the interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems There is a reference to these interactions in the definition of the goals of the project: increasing connectivity, improving tourist attractiveness, improving the economic development of the area, showcasing heritage, enhancing the area\u2019s environmental value and providing an opportunity to create an area for leisure and sports. 2.2 Design of NbS is integrated with other complementary interventions and seeks synergies across sectors Synergies are identified considering the high requirements of the project in terms of involving different authorities and key stakeholders from different sectors and for different variables (natural and cultural heritage, tourism, economic development, etc.). In this respect projects and programmes of different scales and governance levels must be assessed. One example of these synergies is the sister project, the Great M\u00e1laga Path (GSM) 2.3 Design of NbS incorporates risk identification and risk management beyond the intervention site The only risks that are mentioned in detail are the ones related to connectivity, in terms of engineering the different parts of the trail to provide continuity between them. \u00a9 IMAGE SOURCE: http://www.sendalitoral.es/es/ New bridge over Guadalhorce river.
